sort of crossbar and the only thing you
want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> check<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.189> read<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
want to check with that is just read the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.339 
want to check with that is just read the
information<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.480> make<00:00:30.689> sure<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.199> can

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
information and make sure that it can

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.049 
information and make sure that it can
support<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> weight<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> number<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
support the weight of the number of

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.430 
support the weight of the number of
kayaks<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.540> you're<00:00:33.780> putting<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
kayaks that you're putting up there a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.709 
kayaks that you're putting up there a
lot<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> those<00:00:34.890> things<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.510> maximum<00:00:36.510> weight

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
lot of those things have maximum weight

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
lot of those things have maximum weight
amounts<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> next<00:00:38.100> step<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.550> actually

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
amounts and the next step is to actually

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.670 
amounts and the next step is to actually
go<00:00:38.940> ahead<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.480> an<00:00:39.719> aftermarket<00:00:40.260> rack

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
go ahead and get an aftermarket rack

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.590 
go ahead and get an aftermarket rack
there's<00:00:41.010> several<00:00:41.250> companies<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:42.329> make

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
there's several companies that make

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.990 
there's several companies that make
these<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.440> come<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.860> lots<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.670> different

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
these and they come in lots of different

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.180 
these and they come in lots of different
options<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.930> most<00:00:46.170> basic<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
options the most basic is just the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549 
options the most basic is just the
crossbar<00:00:47.760> which<00:00:48.420> attaches<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.200> car

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
crossbar which attaches to your car

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.010 
crossbar which attaches to your car
somehow<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.480> stackers

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
somehow and then you can get stackers

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.180 
somehow and then you can get stackers
and<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.500> go<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.739> way<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and you can go all the way up to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
and you can go all the way up to
actually<00:00:53.520> getting<00:00:53.699> types<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.210> cradles<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
actually getting types of cradles that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
actually getting types of cradles that
cradle<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.530> boat<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> most<00:00:56.370> basic<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
cradle your boat but the most basic and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
cradle your boat but the most basic and
easiest<00:00:57.680> function<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.890> me<00:00:58.980> anyway<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.370> just

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
easiest function for me anyway is just

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
easiest function for me anyway is just
to<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> crossbars<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.109> stackers

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to get the crossbars with the stackers

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.110 
to get the crossbars with the stackers
and<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> stackers<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.579> nice<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and the stackers are nice because it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
and the stackers are nice because it
allows<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> set<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.899> boats<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> side

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
allows you to set the boats on the side

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.340 
allows you to set the boats on the side
and<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.250> fit<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.970> them<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.240> there

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
and you can fit more of them up there

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
and you can fit more of them up there
you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.530> load<00:01:07.740> either<00:01:08.220> two<00:01:08.670> people<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.270> on

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you can load either two people one on

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
you can load either two people one on
each<00:01:09.540> end<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.680> grab<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.220> lift<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
each end or you just grab it and lift it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.810 
each end or you just grab it and lift it
on<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.110> see<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.350> place<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
on up so you can see you just place it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.890 
on up so you can see you just place it
vertical<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> balanced

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
vertical and you want to get it balanced

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.020 
vertical and you want to get it balanced
so<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.200> doesn't<00:01:22.530> fall<00:01:22.770> back<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so that it doesn't fall back on you so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
so that it doesn't fall back on you so
you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> lean<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.409> bit

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you can kind of lean it in a little bit

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
you can kind of lean it in a little bit
you'll<00:01:25.830> push<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.369> later<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.630> helpful

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you'll push it in later and one helpful

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.359 
you'll push it in later and one helpful
hand<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.650> sure<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> empty<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

hand is to make sure you empty all the
water<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.119> kayak<00:01:30.479> before<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.979> pick

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
water out of your kayak before you pick

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
water out of your kayak before you pick
it<00:01:32.310> up<00:01:32.400> over<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.759> head<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.180> load<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it up over your head and load it on the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.450 
it up over your head and load it on the
roof<00:01:33.960> we'll<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.500> maybe<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.829> unpleasantness

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
roof we'll see maybe some unpleasantness

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.469 
roof we'll see maybe some unpleasantness
later<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.750> got<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.140> boat<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
later so you got one boat up here and

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.819 
later so you got one boat up here and
usually<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.750> more<00:01:39.990> than<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.320> boat<00:01:40.590> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
usually you have more than one boat and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.460 
usually you have more than one boat and
what<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.909> actually<00:01:42.119> start<00:01:42.470> with

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
what I like to do is actually start with

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.649 
what I like to do is actually start with
the<00:01:43.619> first<00:01:43.890> boat<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.759> hole<00:01:45.000> facing<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the first boat the hole facing the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.749 
the first boat the hole facing the
stackers<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.770> I'll<00:01:46.890> take<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> next<00:01:47.549> one

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
stackers and then I'll take the next one

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.580 
stackers and then I'll take the next one
and<00:01:47.909> actually<00:01:48.060> swap<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.840> direction<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and actually swap the direction so you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
and actually swap the direction so you
see<00:01:49.740> how<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.280> bow<00:01:50.579> first<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.450> going

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
see how this one is bow first I'm going

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.330 
see how this one is bow first I'm going
to<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> second<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.770> bow

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
to put the second one up there bow

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600 
to put the second one up there bow
backwards<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.299> I'll<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:55.049> them<00:01:55.110> cockpit

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
backwards and I'll put them cockpit

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.700 
backwards and I'll put them cockpit
small<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.820> thing<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.300> up<00:01:59.480> there<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:00.650> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
small this thing on up there and the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.170 
small this thing on up there and the
reason<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:01.070> like<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:01.970> is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
reason I like to do it like that is

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.630 
reason I like to do it like that is
mostly<00:02:02.540> because<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.980> makes<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.310> little<00:02:04.430> more

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
mostly because it makes a little more

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.610 
mostly because it makes a little more
aerodynamic<00:02:05.540> package<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.230> it<00:02:06.290> makes<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
aerodynamic package and it makes the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.650 
aerodynamic package and it makes the
boats<00:02:06.800> ride<00:02:07.160> better<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.790> there<00:02:07.820> if<00:02:08.210> you<00:02:08.420> put

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
boats ride better up there if you put

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.719 
boats ride better up there if you put
them<00:02:08.810> cockpit<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.680> cockpit<00:02:10.130> pull<00:02:10.400> the<00:02:10.550> hole

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
them cockpit to cockpit pull the hole

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.880 
them cockpit to cockpit pull the hole
and<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.210> have<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.600> end<00:02:11.720> swapped<00:02:12.290> like<00:02:12.650> that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
and you have the end swapped like that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.430 
and you have the end swapped like that
it's<00:02:13.070> pretty<00:02:13.340> nice<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.930> next<00:02:15.050> thing<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.290> want

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's pretty nice so next thing you want

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.510 
it's pretty nice so next thing you want
to<00:02:15.470> do<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.830> make<00:02:16.010> sure<00:02:16.160> it's<00:02:16.280> not<00:02:16.370> going

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
to do is just make sure it's not going

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.370 
to do is just make sure it's not going
to<00:02:16.580> fall<00:02:16.820> on<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.240> can<00:02:17.390> either<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> hand<00:02:18.170> on

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
to fall on you can either have a hand on

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.710 
to fall on you can either have a hand on
it<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:18.710> get<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> partner<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.970> then<00:02:20.240> I've<00:02:20.540> got

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
it or get a partner and then I've got

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.150 
it or get a partner and then I've got
ropes<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.260> I'm<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.470> going<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.680> swing<00:02:22.010> these

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
ropes so I'm just going to swing these

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.910 
ropes so I'm just going to swing these
things<00:02:22.490> up<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.880> around<00:02:23.650> there's<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.740> couple

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
things up and around there's a couple

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.380 
things up and around there's a couple
different<00:02:25.070> methods<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:25.850> use<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.210> tie

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
different methods you can use to tie

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.880 
different methods you can use to tie
these<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.780> we're<00:02:27.020> going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.170> talk<00:02:27.380> about<00:02:27.500> ropes

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
these on we're going to talk about ropes

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.110 
these on we're going to talk about ropes
right<00:02:28.160> now<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.610> then<00:02:28.700> we'll<00:02:28.790> talk<00:02:29.000> about

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
right now and then we'll talk about

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.330 
right now and then we'll talk about
straps<00:02:29.630> later<00:02:29.960> if<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.860> are<00:02:31.010> going<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.220> use

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
straps later if you are going to use

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.620 
straps later if you are going to use
ropes<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.820> want<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.060> make<00:02:32.180> sure<00:02:32.210> that<00:02:32.480> they're

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
ropes you want to make sure that they're

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.900 
ropes you want to make sure that they're
strong<00:02:32.960> enough<00:02:32.990> not<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.860> tensile<00:02:34.340> time<00:02:34.580> you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
strong enough not like tensile time you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.350 
strong enough not like tensile time you
want<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.150> go<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.360> your<00:02:36.370> local<00:02:37.370> store<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.880> get

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
want to go to your local store and get

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.880 
want to go to your local store and get
some<00:02:38.570> good<00:02:38.750> solid<00:02:38.990> rope<00:02:39.410> that's<00:02:39.650> going<00:02:39.830> to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
some good solid rope that's going to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.440 
some good solid rope that's going to
hold<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.310> stiff<00:02:40.580> on<00:02:40.790> there<00:02:40.970> remember<00:02:41.330> this

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
hold this stiff on there remember this

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.970 
hold this stiff on there remember this
is<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> big<00:02:41.930> object<00:02:42.380> you're<00:02:42.740> going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.920> be

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
is a big object you're going to be

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.250 
is a big object you're going to be
driving<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.550> 70<00:02:44.450> miles<00:02:44.630> an<00:02:44.840> hour<00:02:44.960> on<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
driving it 70 miles an hour on the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.870 
driving it 70 miles an hour on the
interstate<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.740> don't<00:02:46.100> want<00:02:46.340> your<00:02:46.520> rope<00:02:46.670> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
interstate you don't want your rope to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.140 
interstate you don't want your rope to
break<00:02:47.060> okay<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.560> next<00:02:48.740> thing<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:50.000> actually

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
break okay so the next thing is actually

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.580 
break okay so the next thing is actually
to<00:02:50.390> tie<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.630> thing<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:51.110> here<00:02:51.320> I'm<00:02:51.440> going<00:02:51.470> to

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to tie this thing on here I'm going to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.900 
to tie this thing on here I'm going to
show<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.860> pretty<00:02:52.040> cool<00:02:52.250> knot<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.760> use

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
show you a pretty cool knot that I use

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.250 
show you a pretty cool knot that I use
all<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.150> time<00:02:53.240> it's<00:02:53.600> called<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.870> trucker's

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
all the time it's called a trucker's

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.050 
all the time it's called a trucker's
hitch<00:02:54.470> okay<00:02:55.280> you're<00:02:55.370> just<00:02:55.430> going<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.670> reach<00:02:55.880> up

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
hitch okay you're just going to reach up

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.700 
hitch okay you're just going to reach up
above<00:02:56.330> your<00:02:56.480> head<00:02:56.540> really<00:02:57.110> as<00:02:57.230> high<00:02:57.440> as<00:02:57.500> you

above your head really as high as you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.710 
above your head really as high as you
can<00:02:57.740> reach<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.850> you're<00:02:59.120> just<00:02:59.240> going<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.450> twist

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
can reach and you're just going to twist

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.620 
can reach and you're just going to twist
this<00:03:00.080> rope<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.530> couple<00:03:00.709> times<00:03:01.239> you<00:03:02.239> know<00:03:02.360> two<00:03:02.420> or

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
this rope a couple times you know two or

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.240 
this rope a couple times you know two or
three<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.260> make<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.470> little<00:03:03.680> loop<00:03:03.950> like

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
three so you make a little loop like

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.920 
three so you make a little loop like
that<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.730> notice<00:03:04.970> I've<00:03:05.120> got<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.450> loose<00:03:05.660> end

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
that you notice I've got the loose end

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.050 
that you notice I've got the loose end
is<00:03:06.110> still<00:03:06.380> down<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:07.370> what<00:03:07.520> I'm<00:03:07.610> going<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.850> do

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
is still down and what I'm going to do

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.330 
is still down and what I'm going to do
is<00:03:08.270> reach<00:03:08.510> through<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:08.959> loop<00:03:09.260> grab<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
is reach through this loop grab the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.420 
is reach through this loop grab the
loose<00:03:10.760> end<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.209> rope<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:13.220> make<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
loose end of the rope and just make a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.150 
loose end of the rope and just make a
second<00:03:13.970> loop<00:03:14.090> like<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.830> okay<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:15.980> that's

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
second loop like that okay and that's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.130 
second loop like that okay and that's
going<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.550> kind<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:16.940> my<00:03:17.120> point<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.900> tension

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
going to be kind of my point of tension

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.900 
going to be kind of my point of tension
what<00:03:18.560> I'm<00:03:18.650> going<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.830> use<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.340> tie<00:03:19.520> this<00:03:19.580> on

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
what I'm going to use to tie this on

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
what I'm going to use to tie this on
there<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.209> then<00:03:20.330> I'm<00:03:20.390> going<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.570> take<00:03:20.750> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
there and then I'm going to take the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.410 
there and then I'm going to take the
loose<00:03:21.110> end<00:03:21.350> while<00:03:21.620> maintaining<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.400> loop<00:03:22.580> I'm

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
loose end while maintaining the loop I'm

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.890 
loose end while maintaining the loop I'm
going<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.630> wrap<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.900> around<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.709> rack<00:03:25.900> if

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
going to wrap it around the rack if

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.590 
going to wrap it around the rack if
you're<00:03:27.170> going<00:03:27.380> around<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:29.030> crossbar

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
you're going around the the crossbar

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.290 
you're going around the the crossbar
make<00:03:29.840> sure<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.110> go<00:03:30.230> inside<00:03:30.830> of<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.190> tower<00:03:31.430> and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
make sure you go inside of the tower and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.970 
make sure you go inside of the tower and
that<00:03:32.570> will<00:03:32.690> be<00:03:32.780> all<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.110> way<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.380> here<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:33.830> that

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
that will be all the way in here so that

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.550 
that will be all the way in here so that
it<00:03:34.070> doesn't<00:03:34.400> slide<00:03:34.700> off<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.030> end<00:03:35.390> if<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:36.530> just

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
it doesn't slide off the end if you just

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.550 
it doesn't slide off the end if you just
go<00:03:37.040> down<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.090> around<00:03:38.390> like<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:38.900> this<00:03:39.260> can

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
go down and around like this this can

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.440 
go down and around like this this can
move<00:03:39.890> around<00:03:40.280> out<00:03:40.580> here<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.030> creates<00:03:41.209> a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
move around out here and it creates a

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.030 
move around out here and it creates a
little<00:03:41.600> bit<00:03:41.720> of<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.930> safety<00:03:42.140> problem<00:03:42.709> if<00:03:42.800> you<00:03:42.890> do

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
little bit of a safety problem if you do

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.410 
little bit of a safety problem if you do
have<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.370> do<00:03:43.489> this<00:03:43.640> because<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.090> number<00:03:44.390> of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
have to do this because of the number of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.630 
have to do this because of the number of
boats<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:45.050> make<00:03:45.950> sure<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.400> wrap

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
boats you have make sure that you wrap

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.820 
boats you have make sure that you wrap
it<00:03:46.880> twice<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:47.840> creates<00:03:48.260> tension<00:03:48.380> to

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
it twice and that creates tension to

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.160 
it twice and that creates tension to
keep<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.190> there<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.180> like<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.510> go<00:03:50.630> around

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
keep it there but I like to go around

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.320 
keep it there but I like to go around
side<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.560> town<00:03:51.910> okay<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:52.970> you're<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.300> to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
side of the town okay so you're going to

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.910 
side of the town okay so you're going to
go<00:03:53.420> around<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.780> inside<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.290> tower<00:03:54.500> with

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
go around the inside of the tower with

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.970 
go around the inside of the tower with
that<00:03:55.099> loosen<00:03:55.580> still<00:03:55.910> got<00:03:56.060> your<00:03:56.180> loop<00:03:56.360> up<00:03:56.569> here

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
that loosen still got your loop up here

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.640 
that loosen still got your loop up here
you're<00:03:57.980> going<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.130> get<00:03:58.250> all<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.580> way<00:03:58.700> down<00:03:59.650> the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
you're going to get all the way down the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.110 
you're going to get all the way down the
end<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.130> rope<00:04:01.340> I'm<00:04:01.730> going<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:01.940> bring<00:04:02.060> that

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
end of the rope I'm going to bring that

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.809 
end of the rope I'm going to bring that
up<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.870> through<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.380> loop<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:04.430> then<00:04:04.610> take

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
up and through the loop and then take

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.030 
up and through the loop and then take
out<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.000> slack<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.870> now<00:04:06.500> you're<00:04:06.650> ready<00:04:06.800> to<00:04:06.830> tie

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
out the slack so now you're ready to tie

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.040 
out the slack so now you're ready to tie
this<00:04:07.099> thing<00:04:07.430> on<00:04:07.670> what<00:04:08.420> you're<00:04:08.569> going<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.780> do<00:04:08.900> is

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
this thing on what you're going to do is

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.680 
this thing on what you're going to do is
just<00:04:09.520> kind<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.580> push<00:04:10.790> in<00:04:11.030> make<00:04:11.360> sure<00:04:11.540> those

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
just kind of push in make sure those

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.530 
just kind of push in make sure those
boats<00:04:11.900> are<00:04:12.050> nice<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.500> snug<00:04:13.450> tighten<00:04:14.450> it<00:04:14.510> down

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
boats are nice and snug tighten it down

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.170 
boats are nice and snug tighten it down
and<00:04:15.100> here<00:04:16.100> you're<00:04:16.250> going<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.400> pull<00:04:16.639> away<00:04:16.760> from

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
and here you're going to pull away from

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.099 
and here you're going to pull away from
your<00:04:17.329> boat<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.540> little<00:04:17.810> bit

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
your boat a little bit

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.420 
your boat a little bit
with<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.530> loose<00:04:18.709> end<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.010> rope<00:04:19.220> and

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
with the loose end of the rope and

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.670 
with the loose end of the rope and
you're<00:04:19.519> going<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:19.700> pinch<00:04:20.230> right<00:04:21.230> here<00:04:21.290> what

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
you're going to pinch right here what

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.020 
you're going to pinch right here what
this<00:04:21.829> does<00:04:22.100> is<00:04:22.310> keep<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.610> from<00:04:22.760> losing

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
this does is keep you from losing

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.810 
this does is keep you from losing
tension<00:04:23.450> keep<00:04:24.110> some<00:04:24.320> rope<00:04:24.530> tight<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.490> you're

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
tension keep some rope tight and you're

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.540 
tension keep some rope tight and you're
going<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:25.970> go<00:04:26.120> around<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.600> bottom<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:27.550> you

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
going to go around the bottom and you

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.680 
going to go around the bottom and you
see<00:04:28.580> how<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:28.940> creates<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.389> little<00:04:29.510> bit<00:04:29.600> of

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
see how this creates a little bit of

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.440 
see how this creates a little bit of
leave<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.050> pull<00:04:30.229> it<00:04:30.320> back<00:04:30.350> through<00:04:31.389> and<00:04:32.389> you

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
leave you pull it back through and you

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.300 
leave you pull it back through and you
just<00:04:32.600> tighten<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.050> up<00:04:33.110> against<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.710> bottom<00:04:34.040> of

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
just tighten it up against the bottom of

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.340 
just tighten it up against the bottom of
that<00:04:34.430> first<00:04:34.790> loop<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.389> then<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:35.960> just<00:04:36.169> do<00:04:36.320> the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
that first loop and then you just do the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.760 
that first loop and then you just do the
same<00:04:36.650> thing<00:04:37.900> one<00:04:38.900> more<00:04:39.110> time<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:39.530> that's<00:04:39.680> a

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
same thing one more time and that's a

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.460 
same thing one more time and that's a
trucker's<00:04:40.190> hitch<00:04:40.430> with<00:04:41.360> half<00:04:41.630> hitches<00:04:41.900> as<00:04:42.290> the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
trucker's hitch with half hitches as the

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.409 
trucker's hitch with half hitches as the
anchor<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.250> then<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.490> can<00:04:43.669> take<00:04:43.820> an<00:04:44.030> extra

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
anchor and then you can take an extra

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.840 
anchor and then you can take an extra
loop<00:04:44.600> or<00:04:44.840> rope<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.590> just<00:04:45.770> loop<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.430> around<00:04:46.520> the

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
loop or rope and just loop it around the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.560 
loop or rope and just loop it around the
bar<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:48.430> tie<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.490> off<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:49.910> it<00:04:50.030> stays<00:04:50.300> out<00:04:50.510> of

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
bar and tie it off so it stays out of

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.570 
bar and tie it off so it stays out of
the<00:04:50.690> way<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.530> then<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:51.830> do<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.100> same<00:04:52.280> thing

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
the way and then you do the same thing

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.270 
the way and then you do the same thing
with<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.479> other<00:04:53.600> side<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.950> should<00:04:55.160> do

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
with the other side and that should do

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.740 
with the other side and that should do
it<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:55.580> if<00:04:55.669> you're<00:04:55.820> really<00:04:56.030> I'm<00:04:56.330> worried

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
it and if you're really I'm worried

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.180 
it and if you're really I'm worried
about<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.140> and<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.320> haven't<00:04:57.590> tied<00:04:57.770> boats<00:04:58.010> in

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
about it and you haven't tied boats in

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.159 
about it and you haven't tied boats in
your<00:04:58.310> car<00:04:58.550> very<00:04:58.729> often<00:04:59.180> you<00:04:59.600> should<00:04:59.630> also<00:04:59.900> do

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
your car very often you should also do

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.740 
your car very often you should also do
what's<00:05:00.350> called<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.620> bow<00:05:00.800> line<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.750> basically

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
what's called a bow line and basically

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.150 
what's called a bow line and basically
what<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:03.020> want<00:05:03.200> to<00:05:03.289> do<00:05:03.380> then<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.590> just<00:05:03.950> get<00:05:04.130> a

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
what you want to do then is just get a

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.920 
what you want to do then is just get a
section<00:05:04.610> of<00:05:04.729> rope<00:05:04.910> you're<00:05:05.360> going<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.570> loop<00:05:05.780> it

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
section of rope you're going to loop it

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.690 
section of rope you're going to loop it
through<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.200> grab<00:05:06.470> handles<00:05:06.979> on<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.250> front<00:05:07.580> of

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
through the grab handles on the front of

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.980 
through the grab handles on the front of
your<00:05:07.850> boat<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.300> you're<00:05:08.419> going<00:05:08.539> to<00:05:08.570> run<00:05:08.840> that

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
your boat and you're going to run that

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.320 
your boat and you're going to run that
thing<00:05:09.260> down<00:05:09.680> and<00:05:09.950> underneath<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:11.000> front<00:05:11.240> of

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
thing down and underneath the front of

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.300 
thing down and underneath the front of
your<00:05:11.419> car<00:05:11.690> and<00:05:11.990> all<00:05:12.169> cars<00:05:12.440> have<00:05:12.800> they<00:05:13.039> use<00:05:13.160> them

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
your car and all cars have they use them

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.150 
your car and all cars have they use them
for<00:05:13.340> towing<00:05:13.880> they<00:05:14.030> have<00:05:14.210> little<00:05:14.890> solid<00:05:15.890> pieces

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
for towing they have little solid pieces

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.650 
for towing they have little solid pieces
down<00:05:16.490> there<00:05:16.669> most<00:05:16.940> of<00:05:17.120> them<00:05:17.240> now<00:05:17.360> are<00:05:17.539> actually

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
down there most of them now are actually

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.170 
down there most of them now are actually
like<00:05:18.080> little<00:05:18.410> eyes<00:05:19.160> like<00:05:19.729> they're<00:05:19.880> actually

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
like little eyes like they're actually

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.340 
like little eyes like they're actually
something<00:05:20.360> you<00:05:20.479> could<00:05:20.630> slip<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.870> rope<00:05:21.080> through

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
something you could slip a rope through

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.290 
something you could slip a rope through
and<00:05:21.560> then<00:05:22.100> that<00:05:22.250> way<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.400> just<00:05:22.520> secure<00:05:23.090> the

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
and then that way you just secure the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.210 
and then that way you just secure the
boats<00:05:23.539> to<00:05:23.900> your<00:05:24.080> car<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.710> that's<00:05:24.800> just<00:05:25.100> an

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
boats to your car and that's just an

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.340 
boats to your car and that's just an
extra<00:05:25.640> measure<00:05:25.850> that<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.270> can<00:05:26.450> do<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.320> be

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
extra measure that you can do and be

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.080 
extra measure that you can do and be
real<00:05:27.740> careful<00:05:27.950> with<00:05:28.160> this<00:05:28.340> don't<00:05:28.640> take<00:05:28.789> it<00:05:28.940> for

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
real careful with this don't take it for

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.969 
real careful with this don't take it for
granted<00:05:29.150> boats<00:05:29.900> come<00:05:30.169> off<00:05:30.289> of<00:05:30.470> cars<00:05:30.650> all<00:05:30.950> the

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
granted boats come off of cars all the

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.570 
granted boats come off of cars all the
time<00:05:32.410> and<00:05:33.410> it's<00:05:33.590> really<00:05:33.800> scary<00:05:34.190> when<00:05:34.400> they<00:05:34.520> do

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
time and it's really scary when they do

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.920 
time and it's really scary when they do
so<00:05:34.940> if<00:05:35.030> you're<00:05:35.150> a<00:05:35.180> little<00:05:35.360> nervous<00:05:35.780> about

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
so if you're a little nervous about

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.469 
so if you're a little nervous about
ropes<00:05:36.410> you'll<00:05:37.280> want<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.580> get<00:05:37.700> straps<00:05:38.120> because

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
ropes you'll want to get straps because

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.150 
ropes you'll want to get straps because
those<00:05:38.690> are<00:05:38.810> actually<00:05:39.169> much<00:05:39.380> easier<00:05:39.410> to<00:05:39.950> deal

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
those are actually much easier to deal

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.040 
those are actually much easier to deal
with

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
with

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.810 
with
so<00:05:42.050> with<00:05:42.200> straps<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:43.160> actually<00:05:43.430> want<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.640> get

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
so with straps you actually want to get

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.360 
so with straps you actually want to get
those<00:05:44.000> on<00:05:44.270> before<00:05:44.990> you<00:05:45.440> put<00:05:45.620> your<00:05:45.770> kayak<00:05:46.160> up

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
those on before you put your kayak up

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.190 
those on before you put your kayak up
there<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:47.090> you<00:05:47.180> can<00:05:47.330> see<00:05:47.510> at<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.720> top<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:48.110> that

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
there and you can see at the top of that

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.409 
there and you can see at the top of that
stacker<00:05:48.620> there's<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.070> little<00:05:49.310> hole<00:05:49.580> where<00:05:50.360> I

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
stacker there's a little hole where I

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.590 
stacker there's a little hole where I
can<00:05:50.660> actually<00:05:51.050> thread

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.390 

just<00:05:53.930> wrap<00:05:54.290> through<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:54.800> get<00:05:54.920> it<00:05:54.950> like<00:05:55.190> this

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
just wrap through and get it like this

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.430 
just wrap through and get it like this
so<00:05:55.640> I<00:05:55.670> got<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:55.940> buckle<00:05:56.270> in<00:05:56.360> one<00:05:56.570> hand<00:05:56.840> and<00:05:57.080> then

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
so I got the buckle in one hand and then

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.840 
so I got the buckle in one hand and then
the<00:05:57.470> loose<00:05:57.800> tail<00:05:58.070> in<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.310> other<00:05:58.460> I'm<00:05:58.670> going<00:05:58.790> to

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
the loose tail in the other I'm going to

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.540 
the loose tail in the other I'm going to
separate<00:05:59.270> those<00:05:59.450> out<00:05:59.860> just<00:06:00.860> lay<00:06:01.040> them<00:06:01.190> off<00:06:01.340> to

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
separate those out just lay them off to

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.850 
separate those out just lay them off to
