00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
first of all let's just go over the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350 
first of all let's just go over the
local<00:00:49.350> figure<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:50.969> nice

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
they had scopes quote good on the helmet
I<00:00:54.090> wish<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> he<00:00:55.170> didn't<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> helmet<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I wish that he didn't have a helmet on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.380 
I wish that he didn't have a helmet on
because<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.550> I've<00:00:56.640> seen<00:00:56.820> from<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> trailer

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
because what I've seen from the trailer

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.750 
because what I've seen from the trailer
he<00:00:57.690> doesn't<00:00:57.960> wear<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> helmet<00:00:58.500> too<00:00:58.649> much<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
he doesn't wear the helmet too much the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
he doesn't wear the helmet too much the
hair<00:01:00.000> goes<00:01:00.270> down<00:01:00.510> that's<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:01.020> far<00:01:01.199> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
hair goes down that's very far that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
hair goes down that's very far that
that's<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.829> neat<00:01:02.070> that's<00:01:02.550> something

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that's really neat that's something

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
that's really neat that's something
that's<00:01:03.030> extremely<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:04.170> from<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that's extremely different from the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.780 
that's extremely different from the
others<00:01:04.619> he's<00:01:04.830> definitely<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> longest

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
others he's definitely got the longest

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.120 
others he's definitely got the longest
hair<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.930> movie<00:01:07.320> compared<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> other

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
hair in this movie compared to the other

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
hair in this movie compared to the other
toys<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.909> least<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> definitely<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
toys at least so I definitely think that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320 
toys at least so I definitely think that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
has gold in it for the first time which

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.420 
has gold in it for the first time which
looks<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.509> cool<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
looks really cool I really like the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
looks really cool I really like the
actual<00:01:17.670> sculpt<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.360> legs<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.020> nice

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
actual sculpt the legs are really nice

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
actual sculpt the legs are really nice
the<00:01:19.380> black<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.920> they're<00:01:20.040> using<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.850> really

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the black that they're using is really

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
the black that they're using is really
good<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> compare<00:01:23.640> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
good I don't know just if you compare it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
good I don't know just if you compare it
to<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> black<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.320> first

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
to like the black of like the first

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.010 
to like the black of like the first
movie<00:01:25.740> Thor<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.450> don't<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> guess<00:01:27.840> it's

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
movie Thor I don't know I guess it's

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.870 
movie Thor I don't know I guess it's
hard<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> tell<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.369> feels<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
hard to tell but this just feels like a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
hard to tell but this just feels like a
charcoal<00:01:30.630> black<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.770> looks

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
charcoal black which I think just looks

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.440 
charcoal black which I think just looks
really<00:01:32.250> nice<00:01:32.400> while<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.759> were<00:01:32.820> using<00:01:33.270> more

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
really nice while they were using more

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
really nice while they were using more
of<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> shiny<00:01:34.110> black<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> other<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of like a shiny black with the other and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
of like a shiny black with the other and
I<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.720> charcoal<00:01:37.170> black

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I think that the the charcoal black

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
I think that the the charcoal black
gives<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> lot<00:01:38.670> more<00:01:38.729> realistic<00:01:39.360> look<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
gives it a lot more realistic look to it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.260 
gives it a lot more realistic look to it
which<00:01:40.560> i<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.979> very<00:01:41.070> nice<00:01:41.490> you've<00:01:42.090> got

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
which i think is very nice you've got

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.289 
which i think is very nice you've got
the<00:01:42.420> gold<00:01:42.659> legs<00:01:43.619> which<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.310> nice<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the gold legs which is really nice the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
the gold legs which is really nice the
Cape<00:01:45.600> does<00:01:46.229> I'm<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.979> sure<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.369> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Cape does I'm not sure if this is a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
Cape does I'm not sure if this is a
reused<00:01:48.060> cape<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.479> seems<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> new<00:01:49.170> cape

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
reused cape it seems to be a new cape

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
reused cape it seems to be a new cape
but<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.680> can't<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.040> certain<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.149> very

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
but I can't be certain it's it's very

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.359 
but I can't be certain it's it's very
bright<00:01:51.869> red<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.320> time<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> course

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
bright red this time and then of course

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.100 
bright red this time and then of course
one<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> biggest<00:01:54.360> differences<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
one of the biggest differences is the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
one of the biggest differences is the
hammer<00:01:55.590> which<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.340> cool<00:01:56.670> we've<00:01:57.210> gotten<00:01:57.719> the

that<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.049> guy<00:03:09.230> doesn't<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:10.459> is<00:03:10.609> a

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
that this guy doesn't have this is a

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.910

much more improved articulated Thor than

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.849 
much more improved articulated Thor than
the<00:03:13.099> Avengers<00:03:13.879> one<00:03:14.239> as<00:03:14.450> well<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.959> then<00:03:15.379> it<00:03:15.650> has

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
the Avengers one as well and then it has

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.319 
the Avengers one as well and then it has
something<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.639> is<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.940> first<00:03:17.180> time

differences of

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.750 
differences of
you<00:04:28.560> can<00:04:28.710> actually<00:04:28.860> kind<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.250> see<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.610> the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
you can actually kind of see that the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.040 
you can actually kind of see that the
capes<00:04:29.970> get<00:04:30.210> lighter<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.600> lighter<00:04:30.660> because

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
capes get lighter and lighter because

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.960 
capes get lighter and lighter because
the<00:04:31.200> first<00:04:31.470> movie<00:04:31.770> Thor<00:04:31.920> had<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> very<00:04:32.640> dark

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the first movie Thor had a very dark

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.180 
the first movie Thor had a very dark
cape<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.840> Avengers<00:04:34.320> or<00:04:34.530> had<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:34.830> little<00:04:35.040> bit

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
cape the Avengers or had a little bit

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.980 
cape the Avengers or had a little bit
lighter<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.520> now<00:04:35.880> we<00:04:35.940> get<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.450> Thor

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
lighter and now we get to this Thor

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.860 
lighter and now we get to this Thor
which<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.380> totally<00:04:37.800> bright<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:39.150> that's<00:04:39.600> kind

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
which is totally bright so that's kind

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.420 
which is totally bright so that's kind
of<00:04:39.930> interesting<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.440> kind<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:40.770> like<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.100> darker

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
of interesting I kind of like the darker

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.370 
of interesting I kind of like the darker
one<00:04:41.580> better<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:42.090> think<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.870> Avengers

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
one better I think that the Avengers

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.170 
one better I think that the Avengers
Thor<00:04:43.710> probably<00:04:44.040> has<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.310> best<00:04:44.400> red<00:04:44.670> cape<00:04:44.970> I

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
Thor probably has the best red cape I

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.330 
Thor probably has the best red cape I
mean<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:45.480> just<00:04:45.570> it's<00:04:46.050> not<00:04:46.230> too<00:04:46.530> big<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.220> know

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
mean it's just it's not too big you know

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.490 
mean it's just it's not too big you know
it's<00:04:47.490> not<00:04:47.550> too<00:04:47.730> overpowering<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.540> mean<00:04:48.750> as<00:04:49.020> far

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
it's not too overpowering I mean as far

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.470 
it's not too overpowering I mean as far
as<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.830> way<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:50.010> think<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.580> cape<00:04:50.790> actually

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
as the way to think the cape actually

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.560 
as the way to think the cape actually
kind<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.720> like<00:04:51.870> flows<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.650> think<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:54.330> Thor

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
kind of like flows I think the the Thor

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.350 
kind of like flows I think the the Thor
to<00:04:54.780> Thor<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.260> much<00:04:55.680> better<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.520> Thor<00:04:56.760> one<00:04:57.060> kind

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
to Thor is much better the Thor one kind

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.210 
to Thor is much better the Thor one kind
of<00:04:57.420> flows<00:04:57.660> out<00:04:57.930> which<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.350> really<00:04:58.680> did<00:04:58.860> not<00:04:58.980> like

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
of flows out which I really did not like

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.300 
of flows out which I really did not like
and<00:04:59.520> so<00:05:00.030> did<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.330> Thor<00:05:00.570> -<00:05:00.780> one<00:05:01.050> which<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.350> I'm

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
and so did the Thor - one which I I'm

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.440 
and so did the Thor - one which I I'm
not<00:05:02.520> sure<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.760> might<00:05:02.880> be<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.060> totally<00:05:03.330> new

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
not sure it might be a totally new

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.360 
not sure it might be a totally new
sculpt<00:05:03.780> but<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.260> flows<00:05:04.500> out<00:05:04.770> which<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.190> didn't

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
sculpt but it flows out which I didn't

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.370 
sculpt but it flows out which I didn't
really<00:05:05.460> don't<00:05:05.700> like<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:06.270> one<00:05:06.450> go<00:05:06.720> flows<00:05:07.020> down

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
really don't like this one go flows down

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.200 
really don't like this one go flows down
which<00:05:07.830> I<00:05:08.160> think<00:05:08.370> it<00:05:08.430> looks<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.670> lot<00:05:08.850> better<00:05:08.910> and

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
which I think it looks a lot better and

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
which I think it looks a lot better and
a<00:05:09.420> lot<00:05:09.600> more<00:05:09.840> realistic<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:12.510> love<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.110> way

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
a lot more realistic and I love the way

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.920 
a lot more realistic and I love the way
that<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:14.090> cape<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:15.240> kind<00:05:15.480> of<00:05:15.510> like<00:05:15.630> attach

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
that the the cape is kind of like attach

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.990 
that the the cape is kind of like attach
those<00:05:16.290> big<00:05:16.770> gold<00:05:17.010> medallions<00:05:17.610> here<00:05:17.790> on<00:05:17.910> the

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
those big gold medallions here on the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.090 
those big gold medallions here on the
shoulders<00:05:18.390> it<00:05:18.900> just<00:05:19.110> looks<00:05:19.260> a<00:05:19.350> lot<00:05:19.500> better<00:05:19.740> as

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
shoulders it just looks a lot better as

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.730 
shoulders it just looks a lot better as
far<00:05:20.430> as<00:05:20.490> articulation<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.410> Avengers<00:05:22.410> movie

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
far as articulation the Avengers movie

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.580 
far as articulation the Avengers movie
Thor<00:05:22.950> is<00:05:23.190> by<00:05:23.400> far<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:23.790> least<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.570> then<00:05:25.170> and

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
Thor is by far the least and then and

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.380 
Thor is by far the least and then and
then<00:05:25.860> it's<00:05:26.040> it's<00:05:26.250> pretty<00:05:26.370> much<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.580> tie<00:05:26.940> between

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
then it's it's pretty much a tie between

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.410 
then it's it's pretty much a tie between
the<00:05:27.650> movie<00:05:28.650> Thor<00:05:28.920> and<00:05:29.340> then<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.700> movie<00:05:29.970> Thor

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
the movie Thor and then the movie Thor

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.990 
the movie Thor and then the movie Thor
to<00:05:30.720> Thor<00:05:31.110> because<00:05:31.980> they<00:05:32.280> have<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.610> exact<00:05:32.970> same

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
to Thor because they have the exact same

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.730 
to Thor because they have the exact same
articulation<00:05:33.830> except<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:36.510> movie<00:05:36.990> one<00:05:37.440> Thor

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
articulation except the movie one Thor

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.830 
articulation except the movie one Thor
has<00:05:37.980> a<00:05:38.250> ball-joint<00:05:38.460> upper<00:05:38.790> torso<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.450> the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
has a ball-joint upper torso and the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.700 
has a ball-joint upper torso and the
movie<00:05:40.230> -<00:05:40.500> Thor<00:05:40.800> has<00:05:41.600> pivoting<00:05:42.600> ankles<00:05:42.960> so<00:05:43.560> it's

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
movie - Thor has pivoting ankles so it's

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.040 
movie - Thor has pivoting ankles so it's
really<00:05:43.890> hard<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.130> tell<00:05:44.280> Plus<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:45.630> then<00:05:45.870> they

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
really hard to tell Plus and then they

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.960 
really hard to tell Plus and then they
both<00:05:46.260> have<00:05:46.500> a<00:05:46.530> little<00:05:46.740> bit<00:05:46.980> of<00:05:47.130> hindrance<00:05:47.580> on

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
both have a little bit of hindrance on

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.690 
both have a little bit of hindrance on
the<00:05:48.090> legs<00:05:48.300> on<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:48.960> thighs<00:05:49.169> but<00:05:49.950> overall<00:05:50.310> I

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
the legs on the thighs but overall I

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.570 
the legs on the thighs but overall I
would<00:05:50.910> I<00:05:51.090> would<00:05:51.330> consider<00:05:51.930> it's<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:52.919> very<00:05:53.250> hard

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
would I would consider it's a very hard

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.760 
would I would consider it's a very hard
drive<00:05:53.850> but<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.360> guess<00:05:54.660> I<00:05:54.870> consider<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.500> Thor

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
drive but I guess I consider the Thor

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.590 
drive but I guess I consider the Thor
one<00:05:56.040> movie<00:05:56.430> Thor<00:05:56.669> to<00:05:57.120> have<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.390> better

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
one movie Thor to have the better

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.300 
one movie Thor to have the better
articulation<00:05:58.169> because<00:05:58.680> I<00:05:58.710> think<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:59.190> the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
articulation because I think that the

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.720 
articulation because I think that the
ball<00:05:59.460> turing<00:05:59.700> upper<00:06:00.150> torso<00:06:00.330> is<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:01.020> is<00:06:01.830> is<00:06:02.370> a

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
ball turing upper torso is a is is a

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.240 
ball turing upper torso is a is is a
better<00:06:03.030> joint<00:06:03.390> than<00:06:03.720> just<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.350> the<00:06:04.680> pivoting

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
better joint than just that the pivoting

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.580 
better joint than just that the pivoting
ankles<00:06:05.669> so<00:06:06.330> yes<00:06:06.540> but<00:06:06.870> overall<00:06:07.140> all<00:06:07.410> their

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
ankles so yes but overall all their

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.920 
ankles so yes but overall all their
costumes<00:06:08.040> of<00:06:08.190> totally<00:06:08.520> different<00:06:08.880> I<00:06:09.060> mean<00:06:09.540> it

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
costumes of totally different I mean it

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.360 
costumes of totally different I mean it
having<00:06:10.290> the<00:06:10.380> three<00:06:10.590> Thor's<00:06:10.830> that<00:06:10.980> I<00:06:11.040> have<00:06:11.250> in

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
having the three Thor's that I have in

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.400 
having the three Thor's that I have in
the<00:06:11.460> back<00:06:11.640> are<00:06:12.060> not<00:06:12.360> necessary<00:06:12.900> but<00:06:13.110> having

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
the back are not necessary but having

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.470 
the back are not necessary but having
the<00:06:13.530> first<00:06:13.770> three<00:06:14.010> floors<00:06:14.400> from<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:14.910> movie

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
the first three floors from the movie

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.750 
the first three floors from the movie
one<00:06:15.660> Avengers<00:06:16.380> 2<00:06:16.470> movie<00:06:16.740> -<00:06:16.890> I<00:06:17.130> think<00:06:17.490> they<00:06:17.730> look

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
one Avengers 2 movie - I think they look
