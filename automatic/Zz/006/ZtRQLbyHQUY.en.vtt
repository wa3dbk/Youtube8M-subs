00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.090
 and today we are going to prepare an exciting 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.889
 dessert that is called chocolate coulant 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.240
 death by chocolate to do this 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.000
 cool and need the following 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.520
 Ingredients 250 grams of your 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.730
 70% preferred chocolate or that of yours 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.070
 couple 150 grams of icing sugar or 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.410
 blanquilla if it's icing is easier 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.470
 because it dissolves before 200 grams of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.949
 butter 6 medium eggs or five 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.309
 large 120 grams of wheat flour no 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.800
 120 grams of flour a pinch of salt 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.210
 and finally 2 tablespoons of cocoa in 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.210
 pure powder 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.170
 to prepare the dessert we will continue 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.050
 the next steps think that a 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.090
 tablespoon are about 25 grams 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.670
 approximately and if not with a scale 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.920
 it comes out perfect we shell the eggs in a 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.010
 We are going to use a blender 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.500
 electric we add all the sugar and 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.470
 we beat until it's humid and we're going to 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.720
 add the solids we mixed what 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.670
 is the flour with the cocoa and salt and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.070
 we add all that we beat again until 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.440
 that we already have that cream with color at 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.570
 chocolate the butter we put it in 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.759
 small taquitos and cut the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.009
 chocolate as if they were sprinkles of 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.600
 chocolate or small pieces very little 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.700
 we put the butter on top and 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.950
 we put the microwave in low temperature 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.290
 and we will put it for three minutes 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.210
 always intervals of a minute to see 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 that the chocolate melts little by little 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.410
 we do not want to be burned by 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.930
 we take out and with some rods we are 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.880
 stirring until they are integrated 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.580
 chocolate with butter we add it 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.710
 to the cream that we had reserved 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 stir with the rods and there we go 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.510
 see that we already have that dense mixture of 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.580
 chocolate 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.950
 and it's good if it seems almost a 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.320
 mousse only then we have cornear the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.060
 basis and secret of the recipe is that what 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.270
 let's freeze for it previously 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.770
 let's put together in the ways the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.990
 butter so that the good is us 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.640
 Stick when removing from the container once 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.590
 we have them all sitting is when 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.510
 we have to fill with cocoa cream 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.520
 or chocolate we have to leave more or 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.350
 minus half a centimeter because that's going to 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.570
 go up a bit by aig to the posterÃ­a 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.280
 that has some light dante or yeast 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.380
 then once we have 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.300
 filled all the vols we present is 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.580
 hit the surface where 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.200
 we are making the mixture so that it 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.060
 seat the cream well 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.130
 if there are possible bubbles go away and that 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.310
 the smooth surface is the part of 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.450
 up we put the coulant during a 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.430
 minimum time in the freezer 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 We preheat the oven for 10 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.760
 minutes at 200 degrees you see 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.610
 perfectly frozen super cheese has 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.890
 been about two hours in the freezer and 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.769
 we are going to put them directly to the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.230
 oven for 10 minutes and heat up 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.260
 and down there will be sites from the oven 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.610
 heats more and better instead of 10 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.580
 last 9 after the minutes have passed 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.950
 we take the school and put it in a 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.170
 nice dish with a little cocoa in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.430
 powder on top or icing sugar if not a 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.739
 companies already with a little bit of side 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.099
 most incredible vanilla is still a 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.099
 dessert that I tell you that your partner prepares
