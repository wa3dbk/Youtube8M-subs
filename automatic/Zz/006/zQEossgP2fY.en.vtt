been a mom a little weight behind the
scenes<00:01:25.010> kind<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.090> like<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.390> that<00:01:26.420> way<00:01:26.690> in<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:27.110> way

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
scenes kind of like it that way in a way

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.550 
scenes kind of like it that way in a way
and<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:27.920> okay<00:01:28.340> because<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.659> have<00:01:29.780> found<00:01:30.260> that

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
I could make a bigger impact just being

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.899 
I could make a bigger impact just being
behind<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.920> scenes<00:01:34.190> because<00:01:34.430> when<00:01:34.790> people

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
behind the scenes because when people

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.420 
behind the scenes because when people
