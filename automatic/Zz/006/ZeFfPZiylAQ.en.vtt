00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.560
 this week the reporter assembly presents a series of reports 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.500
 about the gold cycle 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.010
 the idea is to help public school students participating in the 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.359
 Assembly writing 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:15.189
 the theme is the impact of gold mining in the city where you live 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.470
 we already showed the railroad that connects black gold to mariana 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.840
 this Wednesday we present the secrets of the largest open gold mining mine 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.630
 to public visitation 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.699
 was mistaken 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.400
 during the gold cycle, almost half of world production was 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.340
 extracted from the mining hall 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.460
 and came from the passage and Marianna was the largest deposit of the mines captaincy 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.100
 general 'at that time pracon was the girl victim of this type of ballad 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.840
 romantic 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.950
 and in the future beyond 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.030
 with 15 meters of track 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.380
 but it goes over said garrabrant where more than 120 meters the equivalent of a building 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.950
 of 30 floors downstairs ambiance joined what increases the temperature 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.010
 constant throughout the year 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.290
 the tunnels and the large halls impress is so great 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.420
 a lot of people want 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.049
 monitors guide the visitors down this path as I talk about the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.990
 curiosities of mining beyond culture nor do we sin people know things 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.750
 indifferent and that in the mine 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.060
 and with what people do to explore in the beginning the exploration of gold 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.870
 it was only on the surface and made by slaves the excavation 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.369
 mine only came in the second and 9 part of the equipment continues here 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.660
 the holes they introduce dynamite 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.150
 so only after the blasts do not make the sauces all manually let 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.470
 the pillars 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.430
 It's very interesting because you have no concept of what to stay. 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 right here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.580
 when the stork excavation suffered deco between the São Paulo line but the water 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.550
 How is it now being pumped constantly? 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.600
 which have both the water table conditions 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.540
 echoing the bombs stopped the more than 30 kilometers of tunnels from the mine if 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.950
 transformed into an immense lake 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.239
 with crystalline waters are two kilometers long and up to 240 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.730
 meters deep beauty finally deceives due to a suicide case 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.440
 heavy metals and especially the subscriber 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.049
 that the cement used manufacturing day 5 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.689
 very close to consumption was a bit like the 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.179
 fish that live in 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.200
 this is bigger 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 the gold mine open for visitation 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:43.229
 166 years of separation and according to records are the last 58 years 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:49.239
 approximately 35 tonnes of the metal have been removed from 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.419
 golden stone wall can even cheer tourists 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.890
 but the hope of being quiet lasts a little second day this is not unison 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.220
 dear the famous pp candidate differentiates whistles from using the 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.950
 chemical method you by density stiffness 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.129
 however unfortunately for a pregnancy 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.280
 that we had until she comedy mother julie from the bite to the 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.959
 last stop she teaches 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.340
 should not show how the artisanal separation of gold was made 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.549
 in the battery is saved in the arena is very interesting as well 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.039
 but it's different from you 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:31.079
 without being with the child was made the signage of the time behind the 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.719
 resources that were had at the time spoke exonerated until now works out of 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.969
 mine on the other hand thieves know better than anyone else 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.660
 time passes 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.399
 hours at the embassy there at the beginning to be honest 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.250
 it was kind of 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.680
 not only for the reason why it wants to confer that more politics that stays 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.689
 within the coal mine of 7,800 million 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.409
 we were a little afraid 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.829
 then he was adapting with a physical job whenever he 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.120
 need a little bit of courage are trying to give them 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.820
 The mania of the passage is 5 minutes of black gold toward the 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.949
 'mariana' the place is open to visitation every day of the week 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.110
 in this 5th position and growing with a culture beyond their heritage are 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.770
 living more than 300 years in sabará
