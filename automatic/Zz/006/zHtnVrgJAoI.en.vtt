00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
so let me show you all the parts of it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
so let me show you all the parts of it
okey-dokey<00:01:03.450> so<00:01:03.660> starting<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.890> actual

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
okey-dokey so starting with the actual

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
okey-dokey so starting with the actual
material<00:01:06.360> first<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
material first and we can see that it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.040 
material first and we can see that it
has<00:01:08.640> sort<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> satin<00:01:09.420> finish<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
has sort of a satin finish on the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.680 
has sort of a satin finish on the
outside<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.880> look<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> tag<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
outside and if you look at the tag it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.999 
outside and if you look at the tag it
actually<00:01:13.080> says<00:01:13.320> 90%<00:01:14.220> polyester<00:01:14.700> 10%<00:01:15.390> spandex

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
actually says 90% polyester 10% spandex

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.160 
actually says 90% polyester 10% spandex
so<00:01:17.009> first<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.729> since<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> has<00:01:18.540> spandex<00:01:18.780> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so first of all since it has spandex in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
so first of all since it has spandex in
it<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.580> able<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> send<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it it's not going to be able to send you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
it it's not going to be able to send you
in<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> fabric<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.920> going

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
in very well because the fabric is going

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.249 
in very well because the fabric is going
to<00:01:23.280> stretch<00:01:23.630> secondly<00:01:24.630> since<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.140> all

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
to stretch secondly since it's all

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
to stretch secondly since it's all
synthetic<00:01:25.800> material<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.790> skin<00:01:27.090> isn't<00:01:27.240> going

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
synthetic material your skin isn't going

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.530 
synthetic material your skin isn't going
to<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.690> able<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> breathe<00:01:28.200> very<00:01:28.259> well<00:01:29.479> also<00:01:30.479> you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to be able to breathe very well also you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
to be able to breathe very well also you
can<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:31.080> that<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.649> only<00:01:31.800> has<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.520> layer

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
can see that it only has the one layer

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.749 
can see that it only has the one layer
of<00:01:33.119> material<00:01:33.300> so<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.649> not<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:35.130> strong<00:01:35.430> at

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
of material so it's not very strong at

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.230 
of material so it's not very strong at
all<00:01:36.710> moving<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> boning<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.640> has<00:01:38.850> 12

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
all moving on to the boning it has 12

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.630 
all moving on to the boning it has 12
bugs<00:01:39.539> in<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.050> they're<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.320> plastic<00:01:40.860> so

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
bugs in it but they're all plastic so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.040 
bugs in it but they're all plastic so
you<00:01:43.160> will<00:01:44.160> be<00:01:44.310> able<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.300> a<00:01:45.360> plastic

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
you will be able to do this on a plastic

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.010 
you will be able to do this on a plastic
corset<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.610> means<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.179> it's<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.570> going

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
corset so that means that it's not going

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.350 
corset so that means that it's not going
to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.740> able<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.039> hold<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.610> vertical<00:01:50.759> tension

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to be able to hold the vertical tension

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.150 
to be able to hold the vertical tension
very<00:01:51.600> well<00:01:51.869> when<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> cinch<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.679> on<00:01:52.800> yourself

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
very well when you cinch it on yourself

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.999 
very well when you cinch it on yourself
and<00:01:53.420> also<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:55.020> easily<00:01:55.259> warp<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:55.979> Bend

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and also it can easily warp and Bend

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.520 
and also it can easily warp and Bend
with<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.429> heat<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> your<00:01:56.820> body<00:01:57.119> causing<00:01:58.080> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
with the heat of your body causing the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.100 
with the heat of your body causing the
actual<00:01:59.100> shape<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.610> corset<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.509> warp<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
so you might have noticed when I showed

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110 
so you might have noticed when I showed
you<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.290> view<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.890> on<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.640> grommets

you the back view of it on the grommets

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
you the back view of it on the grommets

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.790 
tended to want to all pull together

towards the center and and that's also

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.260

not<00:02:23.099> good<00:02:23.280> for<00:02:23.520> keeping<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.880> vertical

of<00:02:30.120> sellers<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.900> eBay<00:02:31.290> are<00:02:31.530> able<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> say<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
of sellers on eBay are able to say that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.780 
of sellers on eBay are able to say that
their<00:02:33.440> corsets<00:02:34.440> have<00:02:34.770> metal<00:02:35.220> boning<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.700> it

their corsets have metal boning in it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
their corsets have metal boning in it
because<00:02:36.060> some<00:02:36.209> corset<00:02:36.540> makers<00:02:36.810> consider<00:02:37.230> the

because some corset makers consider the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.630 
because some corset makers consider the
bus<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.310> being<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:39.000> bum<00:02:39.300> or<00:02:39.569> rather<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.410> bones

bus as being a bum or rather to bones
but<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:42.330> very<00:02:42.690> very<00:02:42.959> careful<00:02:43.200> read<00:02:43.650> everything

but be very very careful read everything
on<00:02:44.700> those<00:02:44.970> websites<00:02:45.510> because<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.890> um<00:02:47.340> not

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
on those websites because this is um not

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.520 
on those websites because this is um not
necessarily<00:02:49.290> lying<00:02:50.099> but<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.530> misinforming

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
necessarily lying but it is misinforming

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.220 
necessarily lying but it is misinforming
you<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.830> making

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
sounds a lot better than it actually is

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.670 
sounds a lot better than it actually is
even<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.550> bus<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:58.120> still<00:02:58.810> quite<00:02:59.440> flexible

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
even so the bus is still quite flexible

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440 
even so the bus is still quite flexible
you<00:03:00.160> shouldn't<00:03:00.489> be<00:03:00.580> able<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.879> do<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.180> for<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
you shouldn't be able to do this for a

you shouldn't be able to do this for a
front<00:03:01.720> bus<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.620> going<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.190> bow<00:03:03.370> out<00:03:03.640> words

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
when you put it on yourself if you have

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.040 
when you put it on yourself if you have
a<00:03:06.280> lot<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.550> tummy<00:03:06.819> pooch<00:03:07.150> or<00:03:07.330> if<00:03:07.450> you're<00:03:07.629> rather

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
a lot of tummy pooch or if you're rather

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.530 
a lot of tummy pooch or if you're rather
large<00:03:08.379> in<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.650> bus<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.099> so<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:10.090> not<00:03:10.239> going

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
large in the bus and so it's not going

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.380 
large in the bus and so it's not going
to<00:03:10.630> hold<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:10.900> very<00:03:11.019> well<00:03:12.120> same<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.269> the

to hold you in very well same with the

to hold you in very well same with the
other<00:03:13.540> side<00:03:13.810> as<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.170> can<00:03:14.230> see<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.709> shouldn't<00:03:15.250> be

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
other side as you can see I shouldn't be

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.979 
other side as you can see I shouldn't be
able<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.790> bend<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> bus<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.569> that<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.750> two

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
able to bend the bus so that the two

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.979 
able to bend the bus so that the two
ends<00:03:17.200> touch<00:03:17.530> that's<00:03:17.860> not<00:03:18.069> good<00:03:18.660> even<00:03:19.660> though<00:03:19.959> I

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
ends touch that's not good even though I

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.509 
ends touch that's not good even though I
only<00:03:20.080> tried<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.650> corset<00:03:20.950> on<00:03:21.069> twice<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.489> can

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
only tried this corset on twice I can

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.729 
only tried this corset on twice I can
already<00:03:21.910> see<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.299> metal<00:03:22.810> bus<00:03:22.989> poking<00:03:23.530> through

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
already see the metal bus poking through

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.710 
already see the metal bus poking through
the<00:03:23.799> seams<00:03:24.220> here<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:24.849> not<00:03:24.970> reinforced<00:03:25.599> at

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
the seams here so it's not reinforced at

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.110 
the seams here so it's not reinforced at
all<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.470> then<00:03:26.620> again<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:27.220> guess<00:03:27.849> they<00:03:28.030> don't

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
all but then again I guess they don't

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.820 
all but then again I guess they don't
have<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.480> reinforce<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.080> because<00:03:29.410> it's<00:03:29.620> not

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
have to reinforce it because it's not

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.140 
have to reinforce it because it's not
meant<00:03:30.040> for<00:03:30.160> tight<00:03:30.430> lacing<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.940> first

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
meant for tight lacing in the first

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.000 
meant for tight lacing in the first
place<00:03:33.989> strangely<00:03:34.989> enough<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.319> have<00:03:35.470> absolutely

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
place strangely enough I have absolutely

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.890 
place strangely enough I have absolutely
no<00:03:36.549> problem<00:03:36.910> with<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.120> grommets<00:03:37.540> they<00:03:37.690> seem

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
no problem with the grommets they seem

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.250 
no problem with the grommets they seem
to<00:03:38.019> be<00:03:38.140> quite<00:03:38.440> well<00:03:38.680> set<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.280> they're<00:03:39.790> also

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
to be quite well set and they're also

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.740 
to be quite well set and they're also
equidistant<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:42.000> that's<00:03:43.000> one<00:03:43.180> perk<00:03:43.390> for<00:03:43.420> them

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
equidistant so that's one perk for them

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.530 
equidistant so that's one perk for them
so<00:03:44.650> how<00:03:44.829> are<00:03:44.980> sellers<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.549> eBay<00:03:45.940> able<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.390> get

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
so how are sellers on eBay able to get

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.270 
so how are sellers on eBay able to get
away<00:03:46.660> with<00:03:46.959> things<00:03:47.079> like<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.530> well<00:03:48.250> I

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
away with things like this well I
