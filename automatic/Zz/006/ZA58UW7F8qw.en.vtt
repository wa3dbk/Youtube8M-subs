00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
moment so that's why I want to be

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.450

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
properly and I do really cleanse as much

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.640 
properly and I do really cleanse as much
as<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.000> can<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:20.780> basically<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.230> product

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
as I can and basically this product

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.220 
as I can and basically this product
really<00:02:22.030> cleanses<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.150> more<00:02:23.420> than<00:02:23.720> just<00:02:24.020> using

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
really cleanses it more than just using

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.950 
really cleanses it more than just using
your<00:02:24.440> hands<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.480> know<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.840> you're

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
your hands and so you know that you're

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.960 
your hands and so you know that you're
giving<00:02:27.500> your<00:02:27.860> skin<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.280> best<00:02:28.460> wash<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.850> you

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
giving your skin the best wash that you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.820 
giving your skin the best wash that you
can<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.420> then<00:02:29.510> obviously<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:30.050> just<00:02:30.290> looks

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
can and then obviously it just looks

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.500 
can and then obviously it just looks
much<00:02:31.100> brighter<00:02:31.280> much<00:02:31.700> fresher<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.360> just

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
much brighter much fresher and it just

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.760 
much brighter much fresher and it just
picks<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.810> back<00:02:32.840> up<00:02:33.080> again<00:02:33.320> when<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:33.560> looking

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
picks it back up again when it's looking

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.520 
picks it back up again when it's looking
tired<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.340> dull<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.690> again<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.380> just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
tired and dull and and again it just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.900
