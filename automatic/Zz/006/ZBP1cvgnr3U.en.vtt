00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.850 
you up turn but Charlie they helpfully
reminded<00:02:15.360> me<00:02:17.330> don't<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.810> feel<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.410> urge<00:02:19.560> to

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
reminded me don't don't feel the urge to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.780 
reminded me don't don't feel the urge to
sprint<00:02:20.160> anywhere<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.730> mind<00:02:21.030> Z<00:02:21.240> because<00:02:22.790> your

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
sprint anywhere in mind Z because your

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.860 
sprint anywhere in mind Z because your
hunger<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.300> just<00:02:24.570> get<00:02:25.380> demolished<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.040> mean<00:02:26.870> if

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
hunger we just get demolished I mean if

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.940 
hunger we just get demolished I mean if
you<00:02:27.930> haven't<00:02:28.110> seen<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.320> last<00:02:28.350> video<00:02:28.680> already

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
you haven't seen the last video already

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.090 
you haven't seen the last video already
we<00:02:29.370> did<00:02:29.730> get<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.910> ton<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.270> food<00:02:30.690> but<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.950> could

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
we did get a ton of food but we could

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.050 
we did get a ton of food but we could
probably<00:02:32.220> agree<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.820> sprint

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
probably agree with the sprint

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.670 
probably agree with the sprint
everywhere<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.960> gone<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.650> quickly

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
everywhere it would be gone so quickly

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.870 
everywhere it would be gone so quickly
so<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:36.030> mean<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.690> good<00:02:36.810> idea<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:38.670> walk

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
so I mean it's a good idea to just walk

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.660 
so I mean it's a good idea to just walk
everywhere<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.300> mean<00:02:39.540> especially<00:02:40.050> like<00:02:40.680> it's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
everywhere I mean especially like it's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.070 
everywhere I mean especially like it's
quite<00:02:41.850> hard<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.450> walk<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.630> where<00:02:42.900> it

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
quite hard to just walk in where it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.030 
quite hard to just walk in where it
would<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.440> you've<00:02:43.590> been<00:02:43.709> having<00:02:43.860> like
