00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
or 72 so3 38 it was a little bit

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.860 
or 72 so3 38 it was a little bit
different<00:00:47.789> no<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.239> was<00:00:48.420> mounted<00:00:48.780> up

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
different no because this was mounted up

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.130 
different no because this was mounted up
here<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.920> off<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> welds<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> carefully

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
here so I off the welds and carefully

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
here so I off the welds and carefully
without<00:00:52.350> making<00:00:52.920> too<00:00:52.949> much<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> mess<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
without making too much of a mess and I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.819 
without making too much of a mess and I
revolved<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.750> about<00:00:54.989> an<00:00:55.050> inch<00:00:55.170> lower<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
revolved it about an inch lower so it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
revolved it about an inch lower so it
fits<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> need<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:58.289> worked<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.800> pretty

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
fits what I need it worked out pretty

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.229 
fits what I need it worked out pretty
good<00:00:59.160> so<00:01:01.460> I'll<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.579> give<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> start<00:01:03.120> up

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
good so I'll just give it a start up

00:01:03.239 --> 00:02:32.550 
good so I'll just give it a start up
here<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.010> I'll<00:01:05.010> set<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.909> bench

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.089 

so<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.650> ICC<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.129> runs<00:02:34.310> really<00:02:34.489> good<00:02:36.099> what's

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
so the ICC it runs really good what's

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.059 
so the ICC it runs really good what's
funky<00:02:37.310> in<00:02:37.519> here<00:02:37.579> now<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.989> has<00:02:39.109> a<00:02:39.139> higher<00:02:39.379> 50<00:02:39.650> psi

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
funky in here now it has a higher 50 psi

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.970 
funky in here now it has a higher 50 psi
and<00:02:40.969> the<00:02:41.629> cylinder<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:42.170> supposedly<00:02:42.799> it's

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
and the cylinder and supposedly it's

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.959 
and the cylinder and supposedly it's
supposed<00:02:43.189> to<00:02:43.249> keep<00:02:43.430> getting<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.730> little<00:02:43.879> bit

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969 
supposed to keep getting a little bit

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.550 
supposed to keep getting a little bit
higher<00:02:44.120> than<00:02:44.750> where<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.989> works<00:02:45.139> in<00:02:45.349> because

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
higher than where it works in because

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.690 
higher than where it works in because
it's<00:02:45.650> only<00:02:45.739> has<00:02:45.889> about<00:02:46.069> two<00:02:46.219> hours<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.639> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
it's only has about two hours on the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.940 
it's only has about two hours on the
engine<00:02:47.109> I'm<00:02:48.109> mixing<00:02:48.409> it<00:02:48.530> twenty<00:02:48.829> to<00:02:48.920> one

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
engine I'm mixing it twenty to one

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.970 
engine I'm mixing it twenty to one
because<00:02:50.049> well<00:02:51.049> because<00:02:51.170> it's<00:02:51.439> a<00:02:51.500> new<00:02:51.620> engine

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
because well because it's a new engine

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.509 
because well because it's a new engine
and<00:02:52.129> I<00:02:52.159> just<00:02:52.310> want<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.519> make<00:02:52.609> sure<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:54.519> it

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
and I just want to make sure that it

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.080 
and I just want to make sure that it
won't<00:02:55.579> blow<00:02:55.819> up<00:02:55.849> or<00:02:56.060> nothing<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:01.549> yeah

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
won't blow up or nothing so yeah

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.179 
won't blow up or nothing so yeah
I<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.900> figure<00:03:03.139> uh<00:03:03.169> I'll<00:03:03.620> show<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.859> guys<00:03:03.980> that

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
runs and I made some special skis for it

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.819 
runs and I made some special skis for it
that<00:03:08.599> have<00:03:08.750> wheels<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.230> it<00:03:09.349> but<00:03:09.469> those<00:03:09.560> didn't

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
that have wheels in it but those didn't

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.459 
that have wheels in it but those didn't
