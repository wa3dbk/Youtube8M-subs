this water on top of these springs

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.310 
this water on top of these springs
really<00:02:25.290> inhibits<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.130> flow<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.610> springs

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
really inhibits the flow of the springs

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.410 
really inhibits the flow of the springs
that<00:02:28.320> my<00:02:28.620> friends<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.250> water<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.850> should<00:02:30.180> be

that my friends is water that should be

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.590 
that my friends is water that should be
going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.800> st.<00:02:32.070> Johns<00:02:32.370> River<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.240> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
going to the st. Johns River and it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.450 
going to the st. Johns River and it
can't<00:02:33.960> get<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:35.190> being

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
can't get there because it's being

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.020 
can't get there because it's being
suppressed<00:02:36.180> in<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.630> aquifer<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.460> we're<00:02:38.880> going
