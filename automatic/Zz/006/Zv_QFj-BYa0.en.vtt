00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you were gonna plant spinach seeds six

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.549 
you were gonna plant spinach seeds six
inches<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.670> about<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:55.350> just

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
inches would be about right you just

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.040 
inches would be about right you just
keep<00:00:55.800> going<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.460> other<00:00:56.489> way

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
keep going the other way

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.619 
keep going the other way

make your furrow with the rake all the
way<00:01:00.870> down<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> row<00:01:01.969> it's<00:01:02.969> easy<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> fast<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
way down the row it's easy and fast and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.770 
way down the row it's easy and fast and
if<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> weird<00:01:05.939> rock<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
if you get a weird rock in there you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.219 
if you get a weird rock in there you
just<00:01:06.810> flip<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> think

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
just flip that out and then you think

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.630 
just flip that out and then you think
how<00:01:10.320> far<00:01:10.650> apart<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.189> next<00:01:11.369> furrow

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
how far apart you want your next furrow

and if you want it you know six inches
apart<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.509> go<00:01:15.659> six<00:01:15.930> inches<00:01:16.340> like<00:01:17.340> if

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
apart you just go six inches like if

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.010 
apart you just go six inches like if
you're<00:01:17.580> gonna<00:01:17.700> plant<00:01:18.119> spinach<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:18.900> be

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you're gonna plant spinach it would be

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.920 
you're gonna plant spinach it would be
about<00:01:19.140> six<00:01:19.409> inches<00:01:19.650> apart<00:01:20.060> just<00:01:21.060> pulling<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
about six inches apart just pulling that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.890 
about six inches apart just pulling that
soil<00:01:22.259> back<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.270> after<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.630> have<00:01:24.780> your

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
furrows made and after you've you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.429 
furrows made and after you've you
planted<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.340> seeds<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.780> still<00:01:31.049> use<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
planted your seeds you can still use the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.350 
planted your seeds you can still use the
rake<00:01:31.619> another<00:01:31.979> time<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> want<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.210> can

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
rake another time if you want you can

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
rake another time if you want you can
pull<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.140> soil<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.770> about

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
pull the little bit of soil think about

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
pull the little bit of soil think about
how<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> need<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.060> pull<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.390> back

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
how much you need you can pull it back

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.370 
how much you need you can pull it back
over<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.020> seats<00:01:37.640> before<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> tamp<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> down

so this tool is great and it makes it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
so this tool is great and it makes it
really<00:01:43.290> easy<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.740> make<00:01:43.920> straight<00:01:44.759> garden

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
really easy to make straight garden

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.200
