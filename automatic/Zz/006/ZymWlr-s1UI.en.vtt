quad<00:01:29.040> core<00:01:29.280> processor<00:01:29.759> here<00:01:29.939> also<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.240> 6<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.079> was

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
quad core processor here also a 6 I was

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
quad core processor here also a 6 I was
5.1<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.790> gonna<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.030> running<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> like

5.1 I think it's gonna be running a like

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.580 
5.1 I think it's gonna be running a like
I<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:34.020> six<00:01:34.439> at<00:01:34.619> least<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.520> cloud<00:01:36.420> yes<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.259> course

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
um so let's go ahead and take a look at

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
um so let's go ahead and take a look at
some<00:01:42.000> other<00:01:42.180> pictures<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:43.799> shall<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:45.920> here

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
