00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.060 
demonstrating with it giving me the time
actually<00:06:19.120> it<00:06:19.389> was<00:06:19.510> like<00:06:19.660> for<00:06:20.350> the<00:06:20.440> first<00:06:20.650> time

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
actually it was like for the first time

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.250 
actually it was like for the first time
since<00:06:21.370> we'd<00:06:21.610> met<00:06:21.820> each<00:06:22.000> other<00:06:22.240> we<00:06:22.930> had<00:06:23.110> the

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
since we'd met each other we had the

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.189 
since we'd met each other we had the
time<00:06:23.530> to<00:06:23.979> share<00:06:24.430> with<00:06:24.729> each<00:06:24.910> other<00:06:25.150> and<00:06:25.419> the

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
time to share with each other and the

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.650 
time to share with each other and the
hug<00:06:26.380> one<00:06:26.650> in<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.919> hug<00:06:27.160> yeah<00:06:27.760> I<00:06:28.030> think<00:06:28.270> that's

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
hug one in the hug yeah I think that's

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.860 
hug one in the hug yeah I think that's
got<00:06:28.900> to<00:06:29.139> be<00:06:29.320> although<00:06:29.590> there<00:06:30.010> were<00:06:30.100> too<00:06:30.400> many

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
got to be although there were too many

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.870 
got to be although there were too many
moments

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.940
