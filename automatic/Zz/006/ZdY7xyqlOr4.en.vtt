00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
I would say actually this case has got

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.250 
I would say actually this case has got
about<00:04:03.000> same<00:04:04.000> room<00:04:04.299> as<00:04:04.450> my<00:04:04.569> last<00:04:04.750> case<00:04:05.019> maybe

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
about same room as my last case maybe

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
about same room as my last case maybe
actually<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> bit<00:04:05.829> less<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:08.019> yeah<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.500> might<00:04:09.040> be

actually a bit less so yeah I might be
upgrading<00:04:09.879> like<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.750> might<00:04:11.290> put<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.560> on<00:04:11.709> my

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
upgrading like I might put this on my

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.199 
upgrading like I might put this on my
old<00:04:11.980> build<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.639> get<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:14.579> alien<00:04:15.579> Lee<00:04:15.730> case<00:04:15.970> I
