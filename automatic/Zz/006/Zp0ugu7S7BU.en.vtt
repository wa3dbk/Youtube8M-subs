00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.710 
outlet so you can have complete a full
flash<00:02:29.599> photography<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.099> water<00:02:31.370> here<00:02:31.720> but

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
flash photography on the water here but

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.259 
flash photography on the water here but
due<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.560> lens<00:02:33.769> from<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.190> Panasonic<00:02:34.879> which

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
due to the lens from the Panasonic which

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.580 
due to the lens from the Panasonic which
is<00:02:35.480> probably<00:02:36.019> one<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.349> best<00:02:36.560> lenses<00:02:37.430> any

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
is probably one of the best lenses any

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.009 
is probably one of the best lenses any
compact<00:02:39.590> camera<00:02:39.920> has<00:02:40.040> seen<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.610> far<00:02:41.019> from

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
compact camera has seen so far from

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.850 
compact camera has seen so far from
Panasonic<00:02:42.769> is<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:45.170> didn't<00:02:45.440> really<00:02:45.560> fit

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
Panasonic is that it didn't really fit

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.500 
Panasonic is that it didn't really fit
with<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.159> standard<00:02:46.549> solution<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.299> now<00:02:47.450> you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
with the standard solution so now you

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.180 
with the standard solution so now you
can<00:02:47.780> made<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:49.420> what<00:02:50.420> oh<00:02:50.750> sorry<00:02:51.739> it<00:02:51.890> has<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.069> be

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
can made this what oh sorry it has to be

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.599 
can made this what oh sorry it has to be
twisted<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:54.319> it<00:02:55.129> comes<00:02:55.370> with<00:02:55.459> a

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
twisted like this so it comes with a

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.280 
twisted like this so it comes with a
standard<00:02:56.030> port<00:02:56.390> which<00:02:56.720> will<00:02:56.959> give<00:02:57.109> you<00:02:57.230> a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
standard port which will give you a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.259 
standard port which will give you a
really<00:02:57.590> nice<00:02:57.739> wide<00:02:58.099> angle<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.579> a<00:02:58.700> fairly<00:02:59.000> good

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
really nice wide angle and a fairly good

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.399 
really nice wide angle and a fairly good
close-up<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:02.060> why<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.750> possible<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.290> take

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
close-up so why is it possible to take

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.430 
close-up so why is it possible to take
it<00:03:03.560> off<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.010> where<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.819> m67<00:03:05.390> threat<00:03:06.230> that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
it off and where is the m67 threat that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.729 
it off and where is the m67 threat that
enables<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.099> do<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> macro<00:03:08.049> well<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.590> can

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
enables you to do a macro well you can

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.149 
enables you to do a macro well you can
get<00:03:09.950> new<00:03:10.629> fronts<00:03:11.629> for<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.379> can<00:03:12.650> take

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
get new fronts for that so you can take

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.619 
get new fronts for that so you can take
off<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.519> one<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.090> can<00:03:14.239> put<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.599> a

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
off this one and you can put on a

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.599 
off this one and you can put on a
different<00:03:14.989> front<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.890> has<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.159> standard

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
different front that has the standard

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:17.800 
different front that has the standard
m67

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
m67

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.370 
m67
threats<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:18.829> you<00:03:18.889> can<00:03:19.130> mount<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:20.239> dome<00:03:20.840> port<00:03:21.169> or

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
threats so you can mount a dome port or

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.770 
threats so you can mount a dome port or
any<00:03:22.099> of<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.430> powerful<00:03:23.530> macro<00:03:24.530> lenses<00:03:25.780> this

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
any of the powerful macro lenses this

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.750 
any of the powerful macro lenses this
housing<00:03:27.139> is<00:03:27.230> really<00:03:27.560> supposed<00:03:27.919> to<00:03:28.069> be<00:03:28.280> mounted

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
housing is really supposed to be mounted

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.030 
housing is really supposed to be mounted
on<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.450> nalchi<00:03:29.780> cam<00:03:29.959> tray<00:03:30.260> because<00:03:30.470> if<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.799> do

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
on the nalchi cam tray because if you do

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.099 
on the nalchi cam tray because if you do
that<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.430> can<00:03:31.609> use<00:03:31.790> these<00:03:32.000> brackets<00:03:32.599> that

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
that you can use these brackets that

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.759 
that you can use these brackets that
comes<00:03:33.410> with<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.769> screw<00:03:34.250> them<00:03:34.400> on<00:03:34.579> here<00:03:34.849> and

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
comes with it you screw them on here and

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.430 
comes with it you screw them on here and
then<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.799> have<00:03:37.129> a<00:03:37.160> really<00:03:37.549> stable<00:03:38.440> handles

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
then you have a really stable handles

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.830 
then you have a really stable handles
system<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.549> again<00:03:41.000> why<00:03:41.389> is<00:03:41.450> that<00:03:41.599> so

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
system and again why is that so

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.680 
system and again why is that so
important<00:03:42.349> well<00:03:42.980> if<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.609> have<00:03:43.760> wobbling<00:03:44.510> in

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
important well if you have wobbling in

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.240 
important well if you have wobbling in
your<00:03:44.810> handles<00:03:45.199> when<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.530> were<00:03:45.709> using<00:03:45.919> light

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
your handles when you were using light

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.580 
your handles when you were using light
you<00:03:46.609> can't<00:03:46.849> really<00:03:47.030> use<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.209> for<00:03:47.359> video<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:47.930> as

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
you can't really use it for video and as

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.640 
you can't really use it for video and as
this<00:03:48.799> camera<00:03:49.220> shoots<00:03:49.489> 4k<00:03:49.849> well<00:03:50.750> guess<00:03:51.470> what

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
this camera shoots 4k well guess what

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.580 
this camera shoots 4k well guess what
I'm<00:03:51.739> gonna<00:03:51.980> be<00:03:52.099> using<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:52.669> so<00:03:53.590> wonderful

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
I'm gonna be using it for so wonderful

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.250 
I'm gonna be using it for so wonderful
camera<00:03:54.949> and<00:03:55.389> amazing<00:03:56.389> housing<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:56.989> great

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
camera and amazing housing and great

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.980 
camera and amazing housing and great
functionality
