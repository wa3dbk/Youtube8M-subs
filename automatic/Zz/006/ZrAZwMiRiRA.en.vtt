00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
with a very short video of how we

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.940 
with a very short video of how we
actually<00:00:07.919> reflow<00:00:08.730> our<00:00:09.150> HP<00:00:10.110> Pavillion<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
actually reflow our HP Pavillion and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.999 
actually reflow our HP Pavillion and
similar<00:00:11.460> boards<00:00:11.880> with<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.380> Nvidia<00:00:13.380> chipsets

to<00:00:14.790> repair<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> black<00:00:15.480> screens<00:00:15.949> I<00:00:17.180> received<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
to repair the black screens I received a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.189 
to repair the black screens I received a
ton<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.630> questions<00:00:19.020> recently<00:00:20.630> regarding<00:00:21.630> this

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
ton of questions recently regarding this

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
ton of questions recently regarding this
how<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.210> add<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> copper

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
how do we do it do we add the copper

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.009 
how do we do it do we add the copper
shims<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.710> reflow<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.490> reball<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
shims do we reflow do we reball and the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.550 
shims do we reflow do we reball and the
answer<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.250> short<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:30.109> we<00:00:31.109> use<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
answer up in short is we use this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.720 
answer up in short is we use this
machine<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.239> for<00:00:33.239> our<00:00:33.510> reflows<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.649> some<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
machine here for our reflows and some of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.880 
machine here for our reflows and some of
our<00:00:35.850> revolves<00:00:36.920> what<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.160> found<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
our revolves what we have found is that

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.119 
our revolves what we have found is that
approximately<00:00:40.890> 90<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> 95%<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> time<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
approximately 90 to 95% of the time the

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.000 
approximately 90 to 95% of the time the
reflows<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> trick<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.780> will<00:00:46.770> keep

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
reflows will do the trick and will keep

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.770 
reflows will do the trick and will keep
you<00:00:47.129> up<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> running<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> next<00:00:48.539> few

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you up and running for the next few

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.340 
you up and running for the next few
years<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:51.350> temperatures

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
years and it's all about temperatures

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.069 
years and it's all about temperatures
and<00:00:52.890> exactly<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.270> after<00:00:54.899> you're

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and exactly what you do after you're

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.580 
and exactly what you do after you're
done<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.469> reflow<00:00:56.420> basically<00:00:57.590> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
done with the reflow basically you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.500 
done with the reflow basically you
obviously<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> put<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.550> your<00:00:59.699> copper

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
obviously want to put in your copper

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.030 
obviously want to put in your copper
shims<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:02.010> replace<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.789> HP<00:01:03.570> foam<00:01:04.260> pads<00:01:04.710> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
shims to replace the HP foam pads that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.450 
shims to replace the HP foam pads that
they<00:01:05.159> put<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:06.210> takes<00:01:06.780> care<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
they put in there that takes care of the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.750 
they put in there that takes care of the
coolant<00:01:08.460> issue<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> heatsink<00:01:09.890> also<00:01:10.890> what

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
coolant issue on the heatsink also what

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.960 
coolant issue on the heatsink also what
we<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> reverse<00:01:13.049> blowout<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.430> actual

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we do is a reverse blowout of the actual

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
we do is a reverse blowout of the actual
fans<00:01:15.390> themselves<00:01:15.930> now<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.130> very

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
fans themselves now this is very

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.330 
fans themselves now this is very
important<00:01:18.110> because<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.439> fans<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.250> way

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
important because these fans the way

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.690 
important because these fans the way
they're<00:01:20.520> designed<00:01:22.009> clogged<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.220> very<00:01:23.460> easily

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
they're designed clogged up very easily

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.429 
they're designed clogged up very easily
if<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> amazed<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> amount<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.229> stuff

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
if the amazed at the amount of stuff

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.870 
if the amazed at the amount of stuff
that<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.680> pull<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.070> these<00:01:26.250> fans<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.759> it's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that we pull out of these fans so it's

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.130 
that we pull out of these fans so it's
important<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.420> reverse<00:01:27.869> blue

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
important to do that reverse blue

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
important to do that reverse blue
blowout<00:01:28.799> make<00:01:29.340> sure<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> fan<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.210> spinning

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
blowout make sure the fan is spinning

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.800 
blowout make sure the fan is spinning
freely<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.640> work<00:01:32.759> properly<00:01:33.060> without

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
freely so it can work properly without

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.230 
freely so it can work properly without
helping<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.770> keep<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.400> laptop<00:01:36.240> cool<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
helping to keep your laptop cool and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.530 
helping to keep your laptop cool and
also<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.420> refresh<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.860> thermal<00:01:41.280> paste<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
also we refresh the thermal paste on the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.940 
also we refresh the thermal paste on the
processor<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.470> well<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> GPU<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.570> video

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
processor as well as the GPU the video

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.469 
processor as well as the GPU the video
processor<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.070> well<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.060> important<00:01:48.450> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
processor as well now it's important to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.219 
processor as well now it's important to
keep<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> processor<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> CPU<00:01:50.220> cool<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.640> well

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
keep that processor the CPU cool as well

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.649 
keep that processor the CPU cool as well
due<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.500> fact<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.100> heat<00:01:53.310> runs<00:01:54.210> from

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
due to the fact that the heat runs from

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.219 
due to the fact that the heat runs from
the<00:01:54.899> processor<00:01:55.530> overtop<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.850> GPU<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> then

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the processor overtop the GPU and then

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.310 
the processor overtop the GPU and then
out<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.130> laptop<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.509> your<00:02:00.689> processors

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
out of the laptop so if your processors

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.910 
out of the laptop so if your processors
running<00:02:01.500> hot<00:02:01.829> obviously<00:02:02.549> your<00:02:03.469> GPU<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.740> gonna

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
running hot obviously your GPU is gonna

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
running hot obviously your GPU is gonna
run<00:02:05.130> hot<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.520> well<00:02:05.729> due<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> fact<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
run hot as well due to the fact that the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.300 
run hot as well due to the fact that the
heat<00:02:07.350> runs<00:02:07.590> right<00:02:08.099> over<00:02:08.129> top<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
heat runs right over top of it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.449 
heat runs right over top of it
before<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:10.300> exits<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.840> laptop<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:12.220> we

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
before it exits the laptop so we

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.610 
before it exits the laptop so we
obviously<00:02:13.209> we<00:02:13.330> refresh<00:02:13.930> clean<00:02:14.230> out<00:02:14.350> all<00:02:14.380> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
obviously we refresh clean out all the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.110 
obviously we refresh clean out all the
old<00:02:14.650> thermal<00:02:15.220> paste<00:02:15.400> put<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.760> some<00:02:15.940> good

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
old thermal paste put on some good

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.490 
old thermal paste put on some good
thermal<00:02:16.510> paste<00:02:16.800> put<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:17.920> our<00:02:18.069> copper<00:02:18.430> shim<00:02:18.670> and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
thermal paste put on our copper shim and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.350 
thermal paste put on our copper shim and
depending<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.910> motherboard<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.240> have

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
depending on the motherboard we have

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.150 
depending on the motherboard we have
about<00:02:22.540> seven<00:02:23.080> different<00:02:23.200> variations<00:02:23.950> of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
about seven different variations of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.970 
about seven different variations of
copper<00:02:24.490> shims<00:02:24.760> depending<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> type<00:02:26.800> of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
copper shims depending on the type of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
copper shims depending on the type of
motherboard<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.580> you<00:02:27.640> have

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
motherboard that you have

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.949 
motherboard that you have
so<00:02:28.630> basically<00:02:29.020> when<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.739> reflow<00:02:30.250> we<00:02:30.870> put<00:02:31.870> on

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
so basically when we reflow we put on

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.710 
so basically when we reflow we put on
our<00:02:32.080> little<00:02:32.230> template<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:33.069> isolate<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:34.239> GPU

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
our little template to isolate the GPU

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.559 
our little template to isolate the GPU
and<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.830> an<00:02:36.010> extra<00:02:36.310> precaution

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
and this is just an extra precaution

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.830 
and this is just an extra precaution
it's<00:02:37.569> not<00:02:37.750> really<00:02:38.319> needed<00:02:38.730> do<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.060> infrared

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it's not really needed do the infrared

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.820 
it's not really needed do the infrared
light<00:02:41.080> will<00:02:42.660> not<00:02:43.660> travel<00:02:44.080> too<00:02:44.380> much<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.769> a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
light will not travel too much it's a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.680 
light will not travel too much it's a
pretty<00:02:45.040> direct<00:02:45.340> beam<00:02:45.640> that's<00:02:46.300> hitting<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
pretty direct beam that's hitting the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.990 
pretty direct beam that's hitting the
GPU<00:02:47.140> SL<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.280> an<00:02:48.459> added<00:02:48.820> precaution

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
GPU SL but this is an added precaution

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.960 
GPU SL but this is an added precaution
just<00:02:49.600> uh<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:50.769> no<00:02:50.950> plastic<00:02:51.250> parts<00:02:51.820> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
just uh just so no plastic parts and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.750 
just uh just so no plastic parts and
whatnot<00:02:52.209> get<00:02:52.390> too<00:02:52.570> hot<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:54.040> basically<00:02:54.340> we<00:02:54.519> line

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
whatnot get too hot so basically we line

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.340 
whatnot get too hot so basically we line
up<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.830> GPU<00:02:56.970> I'm<00:02:57.970> not<00:02:58.780> gonna<00:02:58.930> go<00:02:59.080> through<00:02:59.290> the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
up the GPU I'm not gonna go through the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.979 
up the GPU I'm not gonna go through the
whole<00:02:59.380> process<00:02:59.739> right<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:00.310> but<00:03:01.269> basically<00:03:01.780> we

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
whole process right now but basically we

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.440 
whole process right now but basically we
would<00:03:02.590> turn<00:03:02.830> on<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.160> heat<00:03:03.790> plate<00:03:04.060> underneath

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
would turn on the heat plate underneath

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.750 
would turn on the heat plate underneath
and<00:03:04.660> let<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.870> warm<00:03:04.989> up<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.470> then<00:03:06.400> we<00:03:06.459> would

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
and let it warm up and then we would

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.090 
and let it warm up and then we would
turn<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.120> our<00:03:07.360> infrared<00:03:07.920> reflow<00:03:09.480> beam<00:03:11.100> now

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
turn on our infrared reflow beam now

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.550 
turn on our infrared reflow beam now
what<00:03:12.280> you're<00:03:12.400> gonna<00:03:12.459> see<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.260> beam<00:03:14.530> of

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
what you're gonna see is that beam of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.360 
what you're gonna see is that beam of
light<00:03:14.920> will<00:03:15.190> focus<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.630> GPU<00:03:17.019> itself<00:03:17.500> and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
light will focus on the GPU itself and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.330 
light will focus on the GPU itself and
it's<00:03:18.610> heating<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:18.940> up<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.090> about

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
it's heating it up to about

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.890 
it's heating it up to about
approximately<00:03:21.340> dependent<00:03:21.910> on<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.150> GPU

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
approximately dependent on the GPU

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.770 
approximately dependent on the GPU
that's<00:03:23.860> underneath<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.940> beam<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.269> light<00:03:25.420> it's

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
that's underneath the beam of light it's

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.600 
that's underneath the beam of light it's
anywhere<00:03:26.110> from<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:27.130> know<00:03:27.160> three<00:03:27.549> hundred

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
anywhere from you know three hundred

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.030 
anywhere from you know three hundred
three<00:03:28.090> hundred<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.390> fifty<00:03:28.660> degrees

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
three hundred and fifty degrees

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.550 
three hundred and fifty degrees
approximately

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
approximately

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.770 
approximately
and<00:03:32.670> basically<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.970> see<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.299> beam<00:03:34.450> of<00:03:34.600> light

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
and basically you see the beam of light

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.110 
and basically you see the beam of light
is<00:03:35.049> steady<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.680> then<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.160> gives<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.700> break

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
is steady and then it gives it a break

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.780 
is steady and then it gives it a break
for<00:03:37.390> about<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.630> one<00:03:38.079> or<00:03:38.170> two<00:03:38.320> seconds<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.549> this

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
for about a one or two seconds and this

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.970 
for about a one or two seconds and this
is<00:03:39.910> just<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.709> solder<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.640> reflow<00:03:43.120> and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
is just so the the solder can reflow and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.229 
is just so the the solder can reflow and
reconnect<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.220> motherboard<00:03:45.489> so

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
reconnect to the motherboard so

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.940 
reconnect to the motherboard so
basically<00:03:46.540> we<00:03:46.750> let<00:03:47.140> that<00:03:47.290> run<00:03:47.530> for<00:03:47.769> five

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
basically we let that run for five

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.920 
basically we let that run for five
minutes<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.579> then<00:03:48.790> shut<00:03:49.060> er<00:03:49.090> down<00:03:49.150> as<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.750> said

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
minutes and then shut er down as I said

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.000 
minutes and then shut er down as I said
I'm<00:03:50.019> not<00:03:50.170> going<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.410> go<00:03:50.560> through<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.859> whole

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
I'm not going to go through the whole

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.400 
I'm not going to go through the whole
process<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:52.570> that's<00:03:53.019> when<00:03:53.200> we<00:03:53.230> would

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
process and then that's when we would

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.740 
process and then that's when we would
bring<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.709> back<00:03:53.890> we<00:03:54.579> would<00:03:54.730> refresh<00:03:55.510> our

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
bring it back we would refresh our

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.310 
bring it back we would refresh our
thermal<00:03:56.260> paste<00:03:56.470> throw<00:03:57.220> out<00:03:57.370> our<00:03:57.489> copper<00:03:57.910> ship

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
thermal paste throw out our copper ship

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.110 
thermal paste throw out our copper ship
make<00:03:59.320> sure<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.620> fans<00:03:59.859> blown<00:04:00.220> out<00:04:00.430> good<00:04:00.940> and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
make sure the fans blown out good and

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.349 
make sure the fans blown out good and
the<00:04:01.239> fan<00:04:01.630> is<00:04:01.810> spinning<00:04:01.930> properly<00:04:03.359> obviously

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
the fan is spinning properly obviously

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.420 
the fan is spinning properly obviously
make<00:04:04.510> sure<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.989> contacts<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:08.430> shim

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
make sure that the contacts for the shim

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.599 
make sure that the contacts for the shim
are<00:04:09.880> nice<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.359> clean<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.739> when<00:04:12.220> we<00:04:12.310> put<00:04:12.489> it

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
are nice and clean and when we put it

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.560 
are nice and clean and when we put it
all<00:04:12.700> back<00:04:12.850> together<00:04:13.000> we<00:04:13.299> make<00:04:13.450> sure

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
all back together we make sure

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.849 
all back together we make sure
everything's<00:04:13.870> nice<00:04:14.079> and<00:04:14.320> tight<00:04:14.440> it's<00:04:14.620> very

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
everything's nice and tight it's very

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.029 
everything's nice and tight it's very
important<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:16.590> copper<00:04:17.590> shim<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.919> in

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
important that the copper shim is in

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.469 
important that the copper shim is in
there<00:04:18.190> nice<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.370> tight<00:04:18.580> so<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:18.940> can<00:04:19.090> transfer

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
there nice and tight so it can transfer

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.530 
there nice and tight so it can transfer
the<00:04:19.570> most<00:04:19.750> heat<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.140> also<00:04:20.440> we<00:04:20.620> do<00:04:20.859> not

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
the most heat and also we do not

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.990 
the most heat and also we do not
put<00:04:22.260> on<00:04:22.410> it's<00:04:22.890> a<00:04:22.980> common<00:04:23.310> misconception<00:04:23.430> that

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
put on it's a common misconception that

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.580 
put on it's a common misconception that
you<00:04:24.120> put<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.420> a<00:04:24.450> copper<00:04:24.840> shim<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.080> top<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.530> the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
you put on a copper shim on top of the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.140 
you put on a copper shim on top of the
processor<00:04:25.800> when<00:04:26.220> there's<00:04:26.550> actually<00:04:26.940> not<00:04:27.090> a

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
processor when there's actually not a

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.300 
processor when there's actually not a
good<00:04:27.360> thing<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.470> way<00:04:28.590> these<00:04:28.740> heat<00:04:29.010> sinks

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
good thing the the way these heat sinks

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.710 
good thing the the way these heat sinks
are<00:04:29.430> designs<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:31.160> heat<00:04:32.160> sink<00:04:32.430> fan<00:04:32.670> need<00:04:33.540> to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
are designs this heat sink fan need to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.340 
are designs this heat sink fan need to
sit<00:04:33.960> directly<00:04:34.290> on<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.190> CPU<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.000> if<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.050> add<00:04:37.320> a

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
sit directly on the CPU and if you add a

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.140 
sit directly on the CPU and if you add a
shim<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:37.680> there<00:04:37.920> you're<00:04:38.070> just<00:04:38.100> causing<00:04:38.700> issues

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
shim in there you're just causing issues

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150 
shim in there you're just causing issues
and<00:04:39.360> they<00:04:40.020> are<00:04:40.050> they<00:04:40.440> do<00:04:40.500> need<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.860> shim<00:04:41.040> on

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
and they are they do need the shim on

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.600 
and they are they do need the shim on
the<00:04:41.280> process<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.820> GPU<00:04:42.390> though<00:04:42.630> however<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.830> HP

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
the process the GPU though however as HP

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.150 
the process the GPU though however as HP
designed<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.480> that<00:04:45.540> way<00:04:45.660> so<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:46.770> yeah<00:04:46.920> that's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
designed it that way so so yeah that's

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.140 
designed it that way so so yeah that's
basically<00:04:47.370> it

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
basically it

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.570 
basically it
reball<00:04:48.810> basically<00:04:49.710> we<00:04:49.830> don't<00:04:50.160> use<00:04:50.400> this

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
reball basically we don't use this

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.580 
reball basically we don't use this
machine<00:04:50.760> too<00:04:51.060> often<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.480> re<00:04:51.720> balls<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.320> we

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
machine too often for re balls but we

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.770 
machine too often for re balls but we
can<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:53.130> they<00:04:53.280> can<00:04:53.460> be<00:04:53.550> used<00:04:53.760> basically<00:04:54.660> for

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
can that they can be used basically for

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.950 
can that they can be used basically for
our<00:04:54.960> reball<00:04:55.380> is<00:04:55.500> we<00:04:55.680> take<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.310> chip<00:04:56.490> right<00:04:56.700> off

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
our reball is we take the chip right off

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.140 
our reball is we take the chip right off
clean<00:04:57.960> off<00:04:58.110> ball<00:04:58.350> we<00:04:58.530> solder<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:59.250> put<00:04:59.850> on<00:04:59.940> some

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
clean off ball we solder and put on some

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.880 
clean off ball we solder and put on some
good<00:05:00.300> solder<00:05:00.570> reball<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.320> reconnect<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:01.830> to

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
good solder reball and reconnect it to

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.010 
good solder reball and reconnect it to
the<00:05:02.100> board<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.550> won't<00:05:03.510> bore<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.750> with<00:05:03.870> that
