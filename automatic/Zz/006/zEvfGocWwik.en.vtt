just to see where your fluid actually

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.350 
just to see where your fluid actually
was<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> should<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> edge

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
was and it should be right at the edge

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.410 
was and it should be right at the edge
