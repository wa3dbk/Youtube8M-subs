00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.940 
at high speed or you know if a missile
sent<00:03:10.630> at<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.200> know<00:03:11.320> can<00:03:11.530> slow<00:03:11.770> down

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
sent at you that you know can slow down

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.479 
sent at you that you know can slow down
time<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.580> then<00:03:12.670> move<00:03:13.000> around<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:14.530> get<00:03:14.800> an

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
time and then move around and and get an

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.400 
time and then move around and and get an

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.350 

so<00:03:20.410> basically<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:21.550> story<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:21.880> divided<00:03:22.210> in

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
so basically the story is divided in

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.080 
so basically the story is divided in
three<00:03:22.630> acts<00:03:22.840> so<00:03:23.290> we<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.530> act<00:03:23.740> 1<00:03:24.010> X<00:03:24.190> 2<00:03:24.250> X<00:03:24.580> 3<00:03:24.670> and

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
three acts so we have act 1 X 2 X 3 and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.720 
three acts so we have act 1 X 2 X 3 and
in<00:03:25.660> each<00:03:25.960> one<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.680> have<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:27.010> go<00:03:27.130> through<00:03:27.490> one

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
in each one you have to go through one

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.720 
in each one you have to go through one
level<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.270> each<00:03:28.600> dimension<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.610> up

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
level of each dimension so and it's up

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.980 
level of each dimension so and it's up
to<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.940> player<00:03:31.060> basically<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> player

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
to the player basically the player

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.690 
to the player basically the player
decides<00:03:32.290> which<00:03:32.590> one<00:03:32.830> he<00:03:32.890> wants<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.220> pick<00:03:33.400> so

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
you can you can go in 829 good more

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.240 
you can you can go in 829 good more
amazing<00:03:37.480> unknown<00:03:37.780> universe<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:38.890> revealed

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
amazing unknown universe not revealed

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.030 
amazing unknown universe not revealed
yet<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:40.300> once<00:03:40.750> all<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.230> them<00:03:41.350> are<00:03:41.500> completed

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
yet and once all of them are completed

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.580 
yet and once all of them are completed
then<00:03:43.000> we<00:03:43.150> move<00:03:43.330> on<00:03:43.450> with<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.660> story<00:03:43.930> with<00:03:44.350> Act

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
then we move on with the story with Act

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.310 
then we move on with the story with Act
two<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:45.490> so<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.360> player<00:03:46.660> has<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> Liberty
