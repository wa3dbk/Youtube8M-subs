bloody brilliant now I don't know what
the<00:01:56.670> difference<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.420> though<00:01:57.810> that's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the difference is though that's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.039 
the difference is though that's
obviously<00:01:58.469> oh<00:01:58.799> they're<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.700> parts<00:02:00.570> okay

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
obviously oh they're all parts okay

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.600 
obviously oh they're all parts okay
there's<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.560> loads<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.040> we're<00:02:02.159> gonna<00:02:02.280> carry

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
there's just loads so we're gonna carry

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
there's just loads so we're gonna carry
it<00:02:02.759> all<00:02:02.909> probably<00:02:03.540> gonna<00:02:03.630> end<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:03.899> being

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it all probably gonna end up being

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.109 
it all probably gonna end up being
overcome<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.829> what<00:02:05.009> does<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> ant<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.640> for

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
overcome but what does the ant do for

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.570 
overcome but what does the ant do for
fire<00:02:06.360> resistance<00:02:06.840> frost<00:02:07.229> ionic<00:02:08.009> increases

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
fire resistance frost ionic increases

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.199 
fire resistance frost ionic increases
carrier<00:02:08.879> weight

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
carrier weight

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.449 
carrier weight
how<00:02:09.450> convenient<00:02:10.110> anyway<00:02:10.530> take<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
how convenient anyway take it all and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.360 
how convenient anyway take it all and
now<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:11.970> go<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.300> head<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> white<00:02:12.959> run

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
now we go to head to the white run

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.740 
now we go to head to the white run
where<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:13.700> get<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.849> bit<00:02:14.030> better<00:02:14.150> view<00:02:14.269> because

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
where we get a bit better view because

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.420 
where we get a bit better view because
it's<00:02:14.900> ready<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.470> knowing<00:02:15.739> here<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:16.040> not<00:02:16.220> very

it's ready so knowing here it's not very

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.920 
it's ready so knowing here it's not very

version okay so we're gonna go for the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.220 
version okay so we're gonna go for the
light<00:02:55.640> armor<00:02:56.150> they<00:02:56.269> look<00:02:56.420> exactly<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:57.170> same

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230
