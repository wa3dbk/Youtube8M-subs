00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.750
 the chart technique delivers from the mental statements about how Steiner 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.889
 Stock exchange with certain indices stocks or commodities honors will go on 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.719
 I talk about the technical condition of the German leading index and coke 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.599
 Now with the NZ of Technical List X and the Trading Corp STI 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.259
 her sexy last week, we were able to market a hefty price slump 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.349
 observe how do you judge the current market situation in general 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.130
 as I am ordered in my book 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.980
 In the end, the DAX wrote that everything is priced in big 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.810
 and like such a price, the momentum is necessarily and the momentum is the big one 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.260
 driving force 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.790
 and what we saw last week was a downside to momentum 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 has accelerated and um 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.750
 Consider this acceleration that the daily margins are now bigger we had 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.310
 in the last week in the mountains partly span of up to 5 on points 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.150
 and that causes the market participants to be nervous percent the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.449
 The story to give good momentum that Rangnick made a decision big 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.340
 zel 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.610
 and 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.770
 at the moment 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.330
 let's talk one 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.770
 Major project OMG 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.510
 and the general market situation 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.280
 Child so that's in the playoffs 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.869
 We need to recover certain course levels otherwise we will be at the 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.950
 See downward movement 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.190
 Ehrman exactly Bongartz yes what is this Koerfer Hasselbach have nothing 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.440
 became Fabian Sing 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.000
 because of course we also talk about talking 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.350
 hidden there on the left side can put the patterns then the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.300
 Fighter Chronicle 2 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.280
 a choir must be red 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.530
 at least a sideward movement 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.840
 and usually a moving one 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.230
 high up hits last high points from 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.620
 Tuesday at 7006 on points 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.050
 and 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.250
 I kept thinking of a moving togo with the condition that 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 the DAX with 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.130
 established above the mark of 7043 points 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.340
 But then I had to use the forecasts 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.140
 the mountain 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.939
 for the second time 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.979
 at the mark of 7300 points failed 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.549
 and I was 26 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.179
 and 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:22.109
 Doctors pay attention on a Monday then I have a scrap of forecasts in my arms 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.329
 Letters open 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.760
 the first maybe because 6000 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.839
 Brunken 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.229
 the Parents' Council 5500 points Dr 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.799
 DAX also has at 5000 points and problems on as direction 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.149
 turned around 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.989
 that means they could then use their method 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.649
 find one out 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.209
 yes which important brands do we have to pay attention to now as where are the 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.449
 important support and resistance at the Club Helvétique 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.929
 Dish 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:52.780
 index 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.790
 October holding marks around 6000 children occurs 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.609
 established around 6570 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.129
 otherwise we will be another big cities 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.209
 the fall in prices revive 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 and Berdych Clinton Grote 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.739
 4000 euros 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.859
 750 points 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.139
 and of course she has to ask again what's up for her 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.859
 probably this is more likely to March 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.509
 or go down 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.219
 more likely 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.419
 but right now do not go listen to say 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.399
 I also have to look at the hillbillies 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:29.760
 we have today 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.099
 from there brought 20 points had broken then my support comes 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.379
 need to receive this support 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.909
 fifth woman leads over 6200 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.000
 correct points then possible becomes the mountain 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.049
 above the mark of 6400 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.539
 Region established in 6550 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.210
 and Dr big decline 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.250
 then it is over if this should not happen we will be one 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.549
 experience further price decline 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.569
 And so, in their opinion, this fall in price will be today 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.169
 start again 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.589
 Lyon not today 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:09.370
 I think we know nearby 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.949
 we need more 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.339
 soon the next big decline would be the upcoming European Championship 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.150
 Dierker 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.479
 the mountains 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.019
 as with the plagues 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.660
 Another interesting thing is the situation with Dow Jones at the moment 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.620
 it's the quote technique 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.740
 Merchant defendants had Dow Jones in the way 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.580
 only one way we can be beautiful 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.539
 zulegt and formed reversal pattern 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.659
 and percentages 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:38.269
 we see that he arrested Philipp with a five expert mark 

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:41.169
 Reason the second from 11 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.590
 benefited with my stock market letter 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.610
 around 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.309
 between 10 08 Netphen fourth jump of the BND around 500 points 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.360
 Entertainment and won 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 I'm probably sorry for the ears 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.039
 12 goals and points recover ideally 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.639
 up to twelve grapes 400 points 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.520
 Trichet should continue via Patch for Jung at the Dow Jones 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.889
 to Bernd Kohlhepp picture 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.639
 Vm 500 points to expect 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.089
 which of course they may lose again the markets would then impact 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:17.689
 Sharma still on the gold price of the upward 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.669
 Some brands are naked 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.969
 Well, it goes on here 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.099
 «The golf ball 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.089
 overwhelmed for the forecast by a group unidentified offenders around 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:31.919
 Offers or or merrier then also what called from 1007 has its 60 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:32.900
 dollar 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.900
 Anfield Road was reached and outbid 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.479
 Gold still has upside potential 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.469
 1008 79 dollars 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.279
 and then you are over for now 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.089
 with it on the logs 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:49.469
 for Bernd Mangold Lambert and Rudd 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:50.650
 or in the lead 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.360
 and of course many market participants are also worried about Moments 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.970
 would be a price drop 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.409
 What does it look like, you can see something like this sooner 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:59.650
 a price plus 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.969
 In the past, there would actually be more than a thousand decision makers 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.689
 after all, the first big Petronilla in EMEA is a big break 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:09.580
 he goes to Schladming 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.469
 To mark files 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:17.029
 Percent starts at $ 1000 and more, and yen at $ 1098 usually starts 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.490
 the remedy is achieved 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.479
 Impress yourself 300 and 5 90 dollars 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.009
 In addition, he had many one after the price per troy ounce of Seeberger 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.779
 raced up again for an outbreak 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.999
 Here, however, it went a bit sideways why 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:33.699
 when Binger consider territory 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.210
 by the marking 5 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.960
 become a trip to the world 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.710
 coined could 6 and had to bottom left around and how big the barrel starts at 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.099
 $ 39 Uncle at $ 41 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:49.779
 if a market around 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.409
 January of the Telekom the Throne 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:53.629
 over offers 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.649
 to bankruptcy threatens the pitch 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:01.329
 Dougan doing a complete oldie do not quite reach the portrays 

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:04.449
 Level Danone animal proteins gates back 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.289
 because such happens the EM 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:10.619
 the first big the Tonhalle 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:12.080
 in conversation conflicts 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.360
 2 percent back 50 dapd 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.779
 Resistance tone on 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:18.939
 therefore runs over two percent 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.960
 GmbH Intense Künster again turning upwards they think that it is longer 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.719
 stay sideways because will continue 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.599
 we know Real will be declared longer lasting 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:31.619
 examined 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.129

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:35.159
 Coma 3 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.909
 $ is undercut 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:40.769
 because Peter Papke live at there joins from the wembley gate 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.889
 because since I am here at Marin a fair driving technical assessments since 20 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:47.330
 not destiny Nellys Atak 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.759
 and from Sweden comes the idea matured the conversation
