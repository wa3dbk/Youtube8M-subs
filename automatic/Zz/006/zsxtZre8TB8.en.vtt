00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this updated one because I recently

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.759

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.890 
found that my foundation routine and
makeup<00:00:29.220> routine<00:00:29.429> worked<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.179> lot<00:00:30.330> better<00:00:30.390> with

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
makeup routine worked a lot better with

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.190 
makeup routine worked a lot better with
certain<00:00:31.289> different<00:00:31.740> products<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.430> terms<00:00:32.850> of

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
certain different products in terms of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
certain different products in terms of
holding<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.320> under<00:00:34.500> hot<00:00:35.010> humid<00:00:35.340> weather<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
holding up under hot humid weather and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.850 
holding up under hot humid weather and
it's<00:00:36.329> also<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:37.020> much<00:00:37.710> much<00:00:38.070> simpler<00:00:39.000> routine<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it's also a much much simpler routine so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.709 
it's also a much much simpler routine so
previously<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.910> you've<00:00:42.059> seen<00:00:42.300> my<00:00:42.510> previous

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
previously if you've seen my previous

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.900 
previously if you've seen my previous
video<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> go<00:00:43.710> back<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> watch<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.430> you'll

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
video of you go back and watch it you'll

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
video of you go back and watch it you'll
find<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.140> quite<00:00:46.469> an<00:00:46.620> involved

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
find that it was quite an involved

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.910 
find that it was quite an involved
process<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:48.300> involved<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.200> include<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
process that involved that include a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.540 
process that involved that include a
setting<00:00:50.399> spray<00:00:51.199> anti-shine<00:00:52.550> foundation

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

stuff<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.680> great<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.399> worked

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
stuff and it was great and it worked

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.290 
stuff and it was great and it worked
really<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:01.020> me<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.890> did<00:01:02.300> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
really really well for me it did the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
really really well for me it did the
reason<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.080> doing<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.379> updated<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
reason I'm doing this updated one is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.539 
reason I'm doing this updated one is
because<00:01:05.549> i<00:01:05.729> found<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.390> routine<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.170> works

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
because i found a routine that works

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.200 
because i found a routine that works
even<00:01:08.549> better<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.479> simpler<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:11.210> because

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
even better and a simpler and because

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
even better and a simpler and because
it's<00:01:12.390> simpler<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.110> easier<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.680> me<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> get

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it's simpler it's easier for me to get

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
it's simpler it's easier for me to get
ready<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> morning<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> takes<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.900> lot

all work well for hot humid weather so I

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.610 
all work well for hot humid weather so I
start<00:02:39.820> off<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:43.800> anti-shine<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:46.290> well<00:02:47.290> no

start off with a anti-shine and well no

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.590 
start off with a anti-shine and well no
that's<00:02:48.040> not<00:02:48.190> entirely<00:02:48.489> true<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.390> this

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
that's not entirely true so with this

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.620 
that's not entirely true so with this
particular<00:02:50.200> BB<00:02:50.770> cream<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.430> i'm<00:02:51.519> using<00:02:52.090> the

wet<00:06:39.849> droplets<00:06:40.849> of<00:06:41.029> water<00:06:41.149> that<00:06:41.809> was<00:06:41.959> playing

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349 
wet droplets of water that was playing

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:45.309 
wet droplets of water that was playing
to<00:06:42.589> my<00:06:42.709> face<00:06:42.979> and<00:06:43.309> that<00:06:43.669> was<00:06:43.789> it<00:06:43.969> and<00:06:44.209> then<00:06:45.019> the

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
to my face and that was it and then the

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.429 
to my face and that was it and then the
BB<00:06:45.619> cream<00:06:46.479> combination<00:06:47.479> with<00:06:47.779> the<00:06:47.809> mineral

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:48.439 
BB cream combination with the mineral

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.889 
BB cream combination with the mineral
powder<00:06:48.769> foundation<00:06:48.969> just<00:06:49.969> lasted<00:06:50.539> throughout

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:50.899 
powder foundation just lasted throughout

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:54.339 
powder foundation just lasted throughout
the<00:06:51.259> day<00:06:51.499> I<00:06:51.830> only<00:06:52.610> needed<00:06:53.239> to<00:06:53.659> block<00:06:54.080> and

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
the day I only needed to block and

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.059 
the day I only needed to block and
powder<00:06:54.709> once<00:06:55.309> and<00:06:55.759> with<00:06:56.749> the<00:06:56.989> anti<00:06:57.379> shy<00:06:57.709> even

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.069 
powder once and with the anti shy even

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.219 
powder once and with the anti shy even
that<00:06:58.489> wasn't<00:06:58.759> critical<00:06:59.269> because<00:06:59.659> I<00:06:59.929> didn't

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:00.229 
that wasn't critical because I didn't

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.409 
that wasn't critical because I didn't
really<00:07:00.499> get<00:07:00.679> that<00:07:00.739> shiny<00:07:01.249> and<00:07:01.550> really<00:07:02.029> didn't

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
really get that shiny and really didn't

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.219 
really get that shiny and really didn't
get<00:07:02.629> a<00:07:03.610> key<00:07:04.610> or<00:07:04.639> oily<00:07:05.389> or<00:07:05.569> anything<00:07:05.989> like<00:07:06.019> that

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
get a key or oily or anything like that

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.209 
get a key or oily or anything like that
so<00:07:06.649> I<00:07:06.979> could<00:07:07.519> go<00:07:08.029> an<00:07:08.329> entire<00:07:08.809> day<00:07:09.199> in<00:07:09.559> fact<00:07:09.919> once

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:10.219 
so I could go an entire day in fact once

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.419 
so I could go an entire day in fact once
even<00:07:10.669> without<00:07:11.389> the<00:07:11.899> anti-shine<00:07:12.619> I<00:07:12.889> went<00:07:13.219> an

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:13.429
