00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.370 

there<00:00:05.330> are<00:00:05.450> several<00:00:05.720> ways<00:00:05.960> to<00:00:06.020> go<00:00:06.350> about

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
there are several ways to go about

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.879 
there are several ways to go about
getting<00:00:06.860> a<00:00:06.950> handheld<00:00:07.490> camera<00:00:08.180> movement<00:00:08.930> in

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
getting a handheld camera movement in

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.040 
getting a handheld camera movement in
lightwave<00:00:10.430> and<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:10.910> of<00:00:11.300> course<00:00:11.540> probably<00:00:11.809> the

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
lightwave and and of course probably the

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.620 
lightwave and and of course probably the
first<00:00:12.650> way<00:00:12.920> would<00:00:13.190> be<00:00:13.250> to<00:00:13.400> just<00:00:13.670> set<00:00:14.330> your<00:00:14.480> key

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
first way would be to just set your key

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.019 
first way would be to just set your key
frames<00:00:14.930> is<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.230> go<00:00:15.380> in<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:15.769> hand<00:00:16.400> animate<00:00:16.910> it

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
frames is to go in and hand animate it

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.390 
frames is to go in and hand animate it
but<00:00:17.150> that<00:00:17.330> might<00:00:17.540> be<00:00:17.570> become<00:00:18.380> more<00:00:19.279> of<00:00:19.310> a

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
but that might be become more of a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.950 
but that might be become more of a
challenge<00:00:19.610> than<00:00:19.790> you<00:00:20.000> think<00:00:20.210> to<00:00:20.420> get<00:00:20.540> the<00:00:20.689> look

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
challenge than you think to get the look

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.679 
challenge than you think to get the look
you're<00:00:21.169> after<00:00:21.380> of<00:00:21.860> this<00:00:22.520> random<00:00:22.849> handheld

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
you're after of this random handheld

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.249 
you're after of this random handheld
type<00:00:24.050> movement<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:25.550> could<00:00:25.880> go<00:00:26.119> into<00:00:26.329> with<00:00:27.140> the

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
type movement you could go into with the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.780 
type movement you could go into with the
camera<00:00:27.590> selected<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.099> could<00:00:28.279> go<00:00:28.430> into<00:00:28.579> the

add modifier noisy Channel and with
noisy<00:00:35.300> channel<00:00:35.630> you<00:00:35.750> can<00:00:35.840> barely<00:00:36.020> see<00:00:36.260> it

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
noisy channel you can barely see it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.420 
noisy channel you can barely see it
right<00:00:36.440> here<00:00:36.470> so<00:00:36.680> I'm<00:00:36.739> going<00:00:36.859> to<00:00:36.890> crank<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:37.280> up

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
right here so I'm going to crank this up

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.470 
right here so I'm going to crank this up
to<00:00:37.699> say<00:00:37.879> five<00:00:38.440> okay<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:40.609> can<00:00:40.760> get<00:00:40.879> random

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
to say five okay and you can get random

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.689 
to say five okay and you can get random
values<00:00:42.019> on<00:00:42.350> whatever<00:00:42.859> channel<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:43.399> want<00:00:43.550> an

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
values on whatever channel you want an

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.400 
values on whatever channel you want an
hour<00:00:44.059> channels<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:44.780> want<00:00:44.960> right<00:00:45.199> now<00:00:45.230> I'm

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
hour channels you want right now I'm

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.860 
hour channels you want right now I'm
just<00:00:45.469> applying<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.429> X<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.090> as<00:00:47.329> I

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
just applying it to the X and so as I

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.259 
just applying it to the X and so as I
scrub<00:00:48.199> through<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.100> camera<00:00:49.699> is<00:00:49.879> kind<00:00:50.179> of

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
scrub through the camera is kind of

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.689 
scrub through the camera is kind of
shaken<00:00:51.079> around<00:00:51.170> because<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.859> the<00:00:52.100> noisy

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
shaken around because of the noisy

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.630 
shaken around because of the noisy
channel<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:54.859> could<00:00:55.010> adjust<00:00:55.190> those

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
channel and you could adjust those

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.299 
channel and you could adjust those
values<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:56.179> it<00:00:56.269> wasn't<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:56.690> extreme<00:00:57.199> but<00:00:58.070> for

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
values so it wasn't so extreme but for

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.860 
values so it wasn't so extreme but for
me<00:00:58.429> I'm<00:00:58.579> going<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.789> remove<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.420> for<00:00:59.780> me<00:00:59.839> I

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
me I'm going to remove that for me I

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.540 
me I'm going to remove that for me I
think<00:00:59.989> there's<00:01:00.350> an<00:01:00.530> even<00:01:00.620> easier<00:01:00.890> way<00:01:01.190> and

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
think there's an even easier way and

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.099 
think there's an even easier way and
it's<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.850> it's<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.359> way<00:01:02.480> that's<00:01:02.659> worked<00:01:02.870> for<00:01:02.960> me

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
it's a it's a way that's worked for me

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.500 
it's a it's a way that's worked for me
in<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.289> past<00:01:03.320> we've<00:01:03.890> used<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.309> on<00:01:04.430> on<00:01:05.030> several

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
in the past we've used it on on several

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.200 
in the past we've used it on on several
movies<00:01:05.780> Batman<00:01:06.380> new<00:01:06.530> times<00:01:06.770> comes<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.370> mind<00:01:07.550> to

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
movies Batman new times comes to mind to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.230 
movies Batman new times comes to mind to
get<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.900> handheld<00:01:09.560> camera<00:01:09.980> look<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.400> I

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
get the handheld camera look and I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.030 
get the handheld camera look and I
thought<00:01:11.450> we<00:01:11.570> could<00:01:11.720> take<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:11.870> look<00:01:12.050> at<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.320> so

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
thought we could take a look at that so

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.440 
thought we could take a look at that so
the<00:01:13.190> first<00:01:13.430> thing<00:01:13.550> I'm<00:01:13.760> going<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.940> do<00:01:14.150> is

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
the first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.540 
the first thing I'm going to do is
switch<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.410> camera<00:01:15.830> view<00:01:15.860> so<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:16.370> I<00:01:16.490> can

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
switch to camera view so that I can

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.780 
switch to camera view so that I can
actually<00:01:16.760> see<00:01:17.210> what<00:01:18.310> what<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.430> camera<00:01:19.760> is

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
actually see what what the camera is

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.480 
actually see what what the camera is
going<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.000> see<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:21.010> then<00:01:22.010> what<00:01:22.250> I'm<00:01:22.340> going<00:01:22.430> to

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
going to see and then what I'm going to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.270 
going to see and then what I'm going to
do<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.970> on<00:01:23.660> frame<00:01:24.170> 0<00:01:24.500> I'm<00:01:24.800> just<00:01:24.890> going<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.100> move

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
do is on frame 0 I'm just going to move

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.650 
do is on frame 0 I'm just going to move
in<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.550> little<00:01:25.580> closer<00:01:27.130> okay<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.540> instead<00:01:29.540> of

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
in a little closer okay and instead of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.600 
in a little closer okay and instead of
60<00:01:30.110> frames<00:01:30.440> I'm<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.160> go<00:01:31.220> ahead<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.430> set

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
60 frames I'm going to go ahead and set

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.360 
60 frames I'm going to go ahead and set
this<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.910> 180<00:01:32.540> frames<00:01:32.980> now<00:01:33.980> what<00:01:34.130> I'm<00:01:34.220> going<00:01:34.310> to

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
this to 180 frames now what I'm going to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.280 
this to 180 frames now what I'm going to
do<00:01:34.550> is<00:01:34.820> make<00:01:35.780> sure<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:36.110> auto<00:01:36.530> key<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.100> on<00:01:37.310> and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
do is make sure that auto key is on and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.080 
do is make sure that auto key is on and
i'm<00:01:39.290> going<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.500> move<00:01:39.590> my<00:01:39.650> frame<00:01:40.100> slider<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.820> say

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
i'm going to move my frame slider to say

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.410 
i'm going to move my frame slider to say
120<00:01:41.990> that's<00:01:42.920> going<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.190> give<00:01:43.220> me<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.580> few<00:01:44.060> frames

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
120 that's going to give me a few frames

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.090 
120 that's going to give me a few frames
to<00:01:44.810> get<00:01:44.990> ready<00:01:45.230> because<00:01:45.560> i'm<00:01:45.740> going<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.950> push

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
to get ready because i'm going to push

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.370 
to get ready because i'm going to push
play<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.850> i'm<00:01:47.570> going<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:47.750> start<00:01:47.960> creating

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
play and i'm going to start creating

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.010 
play and i'm going to start creating
keyframes<00:01:49.220> on<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.580> fly<00:01:49.790> just<00:01:49.850> by<00:01:50.300> clicking<00:01:50.600> in

keyframes on the fly just by clicking in
the<00:01:51.530> window<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.190> dragging<00:01:52.760> so<00:01:52.910> i<00:01:53.180> could<00:01:53.840> start

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
the window and dragging so i could start

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.950 
the window and dragging so i could start
it<00:01:54.200> at<00:01:54.290> zero<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.070> I<00:01:55.400> like<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.120> go<00:01:56.690> ahead<00:01:56.780> and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
it at zero but I I like to go ahead and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.420 
it at zero but I I like to go ahead and
start<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.590> mean<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.830> could<00:01:57.920> be<00:01:58.040> anywhere<00:01:58.370> in

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
start it I mean it could be anywhere in

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.560 
start it I mean it could be anywhere in
here<00:01:58.520> but<00:01:58.820> I'm<00:01:58.880> going<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.060> start<00:01:59.390> at<00:01:59.480> around

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
here but I'm going to start at around

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.430 
here but I'm going to start at around
120<00:02:00.110> 130<00:02:00.950> anywhere<00:02:01.490> in<00:02:01.580> there<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.330> push<00:02:03.140> play

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
120 130 anywhere in there and push play

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.490 
120 130 anywhere in there and push play
so<00:02:04.160> that<00:02:04.340> when<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.580> gets<00:02:04.820> around<00:02:05.090> 20<00:02:05.840> I'm<00:02:06.140> ready

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
so that when it gets around 20 I'm ready

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.499 
so that when it gets around 20 I'm ready
to<00:02:06.680> start<00:02:06.950> moving<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:08.149> i'm<00:02:08.239> going<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.390> go<00:02:08.479> ahead

going<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.800> kind<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.220> I'm<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.820> barely<00:02:14.120> moving

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
going to kind of I'm just barely moving

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.770 
going to kind of I'm just barely moving
my<00:02:14.690> mouse<00:02:15.190> because<00:02:16.190> auto<00:02:16.550> key<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.000> on

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
my mouse because auto key is on

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.050 
my mouse because auto key is on
I<00:02:17.870> recorded<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.709> movement<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:19.610> I'm<00:02:19.880> not

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
I recorded that movement so now I'm not

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.940 
I recorded that movement so now I'm not
doing<00:02:20.300> anything<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:20.750> playing<00:02:21.050> back<00:02:21.140> and

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
doing anything it's playing back and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.040 
doing anything it's playing back and
I've<00:02:22.160> got<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> little<00:02:22.640> bit<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.150> movement<00:02:23.780> night

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
I've got a little bit of movement night

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.850 
I've got a little bit of movement night
don't<00:02:24.350> have<00:02:24.680> any<00:02:24.980> why<00:02:25.600> movement<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:27.560> this

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
don't have any why movement on this

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.760 
don't have any why movement on this
right<00:02:28.100> now<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:30.050> can<00:02:30.200> always<00:02:30.319> go<00:02:30.560> back<00:02:30.590> and

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
right now and we can always go back and

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.650 
right now and we can always go back and
do<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.010> we<00:02:31.160> could<00:02:31.280> also<00:02:31.520> add<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.450> another

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
do it we could also add that to another

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.420 
do it we could also add that to another
item<00:02:33.020> but<00:02:33.470> let's<00:02:33.680> just<00:02:33.770> say<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.370> is

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
item but let's just say that this is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.210 
item but let's just say that this is
enough<00:02:34.819> little<00:02:35.150> handheld<00:02:35.770> movement<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:37.069> we

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
enough little handheld movement that we

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.650 
enough little handheld movement that we
want<00:02:37.459> now<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.790> might<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> little<00:02:38.390> extreme

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
want now it might be a little extreme

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.750 
want now it might be a little extreme
but<00:02:38.870> we'll<00:02:39.140> see<00:02:39.350> when<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:39.500> start<00:02:39.920> doing<00:02:40.580> more

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
but we'll see when we start doing more

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.090 
but we'll see when we start doing more
animation<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.450> our<00:02:41.600> camera<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.620> might<00:02:42.860> work

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
animation with our camera it might work

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.820 
animation with our camera it might work
out<00:02:43.550> just<00:02:43.760> fine<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.810> I'm<00:02:44.930> going<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.110> go<00:02:45.260> over<00:02:45.290> to

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
out just fine so I'm going to go over to

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.050 
out just fine so I'm going to go over to
the<00:02:45.920> perspective<00:02:46.870> view<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:49.640> can<00:02:49.670> see<00:02:49.940> the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the perspective view and you can see the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.490 
the perspective view and you can see the
camera<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:50.390> kind<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.720> hovering<00:02:50.959> let<00:02:51.170> me<00:02:51.260> zoom

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
camera just kind of hovering let me zoom

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.330 
camera just kind of hovering let me zoom
in<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.160> see<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.620> motion<00:02:55.040> path

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
in so you can see the the motion path

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.740 
in so you can see the the motion path
for<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:57.440> camera<00:02:57.860> right<00:02:58.220> here<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.540> yeah<00:02:59.630> it

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
for the camera right here so yeah it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.380 
for the camera right here so yeah it
just<00:02:59.810> kind<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.140> swivels<00:03:01.100> around<00:03:01.239> that's<00:03:02.239> me

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
just kind of swivels around that's me

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.449 
just kind of swivels around that's me
moving<00:03:02.870> my<00:03:02.900> mouse<00:03:03.200> as<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:04.010> was<00:03:04.130> playing

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
moving my mouse as it was playing

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.140 
moving my mouse as it was playing
through<00:03:04.850> ok<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.800> more<00:03:07.069> subtle<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.730> move<00:03:07.940> my

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
through ok the the more subtle I move my

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.890 
through ok the the more subtle I move my
mouse<00:03:08.330> well<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:10.180> tighter<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.420> area<00:03:11.750> that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
mouse well the tighter the area that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.360 
mouse well the tighter the area that
that<00:03:12.080> movement<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.530> going<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.739> be<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.090> ok<00:03:14.090> so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
that movement is going to be in ok so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.240 
that movement is going to be in ok so
now<00:03:16.370> what<00:03:16.610> I'm<00:03:16.700> going<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:18.130> create<00:03:19.130> a

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
now what I'm going to do is create a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.640 
now what I'm going to do is create a
null<00:03:19.690> object<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:20.930> let's<00:03:21.290> do<00:03:21.530> add<00:03:22.459> null<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.410> i'm

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
null object so let's do add null and i'm

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.400 
null object so let's do add null and i'm
going<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:24.829> call<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.150> cam<00:03:26.769> our<00:03:27.769> OT<00:03:28.370> for<00:03:28.700> rotate

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
going to call this cam our OT for rotate

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.250 
going to call this cam our OT for rotate
click<00:03:30.410> ok<00:03:30.769> i'm<00:03:31.549> going<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.790> take<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.120> camera<00:03:32.540> m

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
click ok i'm going to take the camera m

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.470 
click ok i'm going to take the camera m
for<00:03:33.950> motion<00:03:34.280> options<00:03:34.670> parent<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.650> null

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
for motion options parent to the null

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.690 
for motion options parent to the null
then<00:03:38.480> I'm<00:03:38.630> going<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.810> take<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.019> null<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.799> on

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
then I'm going to take that null and on

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.729 
then I'm going to take that null and on
frame<00:03:41.060> 1<00:03:41.900> 80<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.810> heading<00:03:45.230> I'm<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:45.650> to

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
frame 1 80 in the heading I'm going to

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.920 
frame 1 80 in the heading I'm going to
do<00:03:45.829> 360<00:03:46.609> degrees<00:03:47.410> ok<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.620> then<00:03:49.340> I'm<00:03:49.430> going<00:03:49.519> to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
do 360 degrees ok and then I'm going to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.090 
do 360 degrees ok and then I'm going to
scrub<00:03:50.930> through<00:03:51.170> just<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.620> can<00:03:51.739> see<00:03:51.799> the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
scrub through just so you can see the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.490 
scrub through just so you can see the
camera<00:03:52.579> is<00:03:52.760> now<00:03:52.940> rotating<00:03:53.660> around<00:03:53.870> the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
camera is now rotating around the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.460 
camera is now rotating around the
character<00:03:55.209> ok<00:03:56.209> so<00:03:56.750> it's<00:03:57.049> going<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> rotate

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
character ok so it's going to rotate

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.960 
character ok so it's going to rotate
around<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.859> character<00:03:58.190> but<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.370> still<00:03:58.670> have

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
around the character but I still have

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.009 
around the character but I still have
all<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.690> keyframes<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.640> camera<00:04:02.000> has<00:04:02.120> ok

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
all the keyframes that the camera has ok

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.920 
all the keyframes that the camera has ok
so<00:04:03.890> let<00:04:04.609> me<00:04:05.709> let<00:04:06.709> me<00:04:06.799> go<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.100> camera<00:04:07.549> view

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
so let me let me go to the camera view

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.220 
so let me let me go to the camera view
and<00:04:08.930> push<00:04:09.829> play<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.810> now<00:04:11.930> we're<00:04:12.079> moving

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
and push play and so now we're moving

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.140 
and push play and so now we're moving
around<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:13.250> character<00:04:13.670> but<00:04:13.850> there's<00:04:14.030> some

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
around the character but there's some

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.710 
around the character but there's some
slight<00:04:14.570> little<00:04:14.900> handheld<00:04:15.729> glitches<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:17.060> are

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
slight little handheld glitches that are

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.229 
slight little handheld glitches that are
going<00:04:17.989> now<00:04:18.140> in<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.919> playback<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.970> video

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
going now in the playback of the video

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.900 
going now in the playback of the video
that<00:04:20.450> you're<00:04:20.539> watching<00:04:20.600> right<00:04:20.959> now<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
that you're watching right now the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.190 
that you're watching right now the
framerate<00:04:23.240> is<00:04:23.539> probably<00:04:23.900> going<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.080> be

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
framerate is probably going to be

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.870 
framerate is probably going to be
different<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:24.919> might<00:04:25.100> be<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.280> lot<00:04:25.580> more

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
different so it might be a lot more

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.010 
different so it might be a lot more
jittery<00:04:26.539> it's<00:04:26.840> it's<00:04:27.289> it's<00:04:27.680> subtle<00:04:28.099> on<00:04:28.460> here<00:04:29.030> on

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
jittery it's it's it's subtle on here on

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.590 
jittery it's it's it's subtle on here on
the<00:04:30.349> actual<00:04:30.590> light<00:04:30.830> wave<00:04:30.979> playback

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
the actual light wave playback

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.720 
the actual light wave playback
just<00:04:31.840> keep<00:04:32.440> in<00:04:32.560> mind<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.890> when<00:04:33.070> when<00:04:33.610> the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
just keep in mind that when when the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.190 
just keep in mind that when when the
video<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.480> you're<00:04:34.630> watching<00:04:34.690> gets

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
video that you're watching gets

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.950 
video that you're watching gets
compressed<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.890> will<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:37.120> will<00:04:37.150> change<00:04:37.630> a

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
compressed it will it will change a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.080 
compressed it will it will change a
little<00:04:38.200> bit<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.950> you'll<00:04:39.070> want<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.280> give<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.640> a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
little bit so you'll want to give this a

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.160 
little bit so you'll want to give this a
test<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.410> just<00:04:41.560> rotating<00:04:42.160> around<00:04:42.280> the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
test so this is just rotating around the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.100 
test so this is just rotating around the
character<00:04:44.640> if<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:46.150> wanted<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.660> could<00:04:46.900> also

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
character if I wanted to I could also

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.870 
character if I wanted to I could also
just<00:04:47.410> take<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:47.860> null<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.430> I'm<00:04:48.520> rotating

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
just take this null that I'm rotating

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.420 
just take this null that I'm rotating
and<00:04:49.500> slightly<00:04:50.500> move<00:04:50.830> it<00:04:50.980> up<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.220> down<00:04:51.310> and

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
and slightly move it up and down and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.190 
and slightly move it up and down and
well<00:04:51.790> let's<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.300> give<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.480> a<00:04:52.660> go<00:04:52.900> so<00:04:53.140> I'm

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
well let's just give that a go so I'm

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.890 
well let's just give that a go so I'm
going<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.410> hit<00:04:53.470> T<00:04:53.800> for<00:04:54.070> move<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.720> I'm<00:04:55.720> going<00:04:55.870> to

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
going to hit T for move and I'm going to

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.850 
going to hit T for move and I'm going to
use<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.230> right<00:04:56.500> mouse<00:04:56.530> button<00:04:57.250> for<00:04:57.820> this<00:04:58.030> and

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
use the right mouse button for this and

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.910 
use the right mouse button for this and
I'm<00:04:59.860> going<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.280> set<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.300> say<00:05:01.690> around<00:05:01.930> 140<00:05:02.530> just

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
I'm going to set it say around 140 just

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.880 
I'm going to set it say around 140 just
a<00:05:03.010> little<00:05:03.220> lead<00:05:03.430> time<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:07.230> I'm<00:05:08.230> barely<00:05:08.530> I'm

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
a little lead time and I'm barely I'm

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.800 
a little lead time and I'm barely I'm
just<00:05:09.100> kind<00:05:09.280> of<00:05:09.340> shifting<00:05:10.240> my<00:05:10.360> mouse<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:10.600> little

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
just kind of shifting my mouse a little

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.850 
just kind of shifting my mouse a little
bit<00:05:11.170> okay<00:05:12.070> so<00:05:12.130> now<00:05:12.430> I'm<00:05:12.820> getting<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:14.320> with<00:05:14.590> my

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
bit okay so now I'm getting it with my

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.220 
bit okay so now I'm getting it with my
with<00:05:15.700> my<00:05:15.910> null<00:05:16.150> that's<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.720> parent<00:05:17.110> of<00:05:17.170> the

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
with my null that's the parent of the

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.510 
with my null that's the parent of the
camera<00:05:17.590> I'm<00:05:17.650> getting<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.920> little<00:05:18.070> up<00:05:18.310> and<00:05:18.460> down

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
camera I'm getting a little up and down

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.110 
camera I'm getting a little up and down
motion<00:05:19.260> so<00:05:20.260> I'm<00:05:20.380> adding<00:05:20.560> more<00:05:20.980> a<00:05:21.700> little<00:05:22.060> more

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
motion so I'm adding more a little more

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.280 
motion so I'm adding more a little more
subtle<00:05:22.480> movement<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:24.480> parent<00:05:25.480> is<00:05:25.630> moving

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
subtle movement so the parent is moving

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.260 
subtle movement so the parent is moving
up<00:05:26.440> and<00:05:26.530> down<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:26.950> also<00:05:27.460> spinning<00:05:27.850> the<00:05:27.940> camera

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
up and down and also spinning the camera

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.730 
up and down and also spinning the camera
around<00:05:28.420> and<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.720> camera<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.110> has<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.470> little

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
around and the camera just has a little

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.710 
around and the camera just has a little
bit<00:05:30.010> of<00:05:30.360> X<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.720> Z<00:05:31.990> movement<00:05:32.760> for<00:05:33.760> you<00:05:34.300> know<00:05:34.420> for

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
bit of X and Z movement for you know for

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.200 
bit of X and Z movement for you know for
that<00:05:34.840> that<00:05:35.320> little<00:05:35.470> handheld<00:05:35.890> look<00:05:36.280> so<00:05:36.940> again

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
that that little handheld look so again

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.750 
that that little handheld look so again
quick<00:05:37.990> in<00:05:38.200> quick<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:38.860> dirty<00:05:39.130> way<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.490> getting

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
quick in quick and dirty way of getting

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000 
quick in quick and dirty way of getting
a<00:05:39.820> handheld<00:05:40.240> camera<00:05:40.720> you're<00:05:41.350> not<00:05:41.500> limited<00:05:41.770> to

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
a handheld camera you're not limited to

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.070 
a handheld camera you're not limited to
spinning<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.640> around<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:43.240> can<00:05:43.270> do<00:05:43.570> sweeping

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
spinning it around you can do sweeping

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.410 
spinning it around you can do sweeping
motions<00:05:44.470> and<00:05:44.830> and<00:05:45.160> pans<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:46.000> tilts<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.300> all

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
motions and and pans and tilts and all

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.000 
motions and and pans and tilts and all
kind<00:05:46.690> of<00:05:46.750> stuff<00:05:46.810> it's<00:05:47.230> you<00:05:47.440> have<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.710> decide

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
kind of stuff it's you have to decide

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.470 
kind of stuff it's you have to decide
you<00:05:48.400> know<00:05:48.520> what<00:05:48.550> you<00:05:48.880> want<00:05:49.030> to<00:05:49.090> do<00:05:49.180> but<00:05:49.330> it's

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
you know what you want to do but it's

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.440
