00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.559
 we are with Victorian music artist 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 in the sardine 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:22.130
 Well the name comes from wanting to put a 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:25.039
 brand flama is written differently to how 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.050
 as you want to say a flame no but it is 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.300
 basically for when I leave the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.250
 events and everything is to turn people on 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.390
 have that chemistry with the public and everything 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.310
 that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.870
 from that essence is that the name is born 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.059
 and where the schools 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.780
 good my people the urban genre is born 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.090
 since I was little I was inclined 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.550
 different genres but more the genre 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.989
 human, because I liked the most 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.659
 singer-songwriter and then I managed to record five 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.540

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.659
 sentimentally in my family and also 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.060
 of companies of 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.490
 of support also from friends and all that 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.810
 has been a very fundamental part for 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.790

 good mom is a letter that speaks 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.220
 about when you fall in love with a 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.229
 woman because from the upper stratum and 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.140
