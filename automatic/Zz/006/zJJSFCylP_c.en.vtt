00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.710 

so<00:01:24.500> basically<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.100> imac<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:26.060> what<00:01:26.600> they

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
so basically the imac is a what they

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.470 
so basically the imac is a what they
call<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:27.140> all<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:28.130> one<00:01:28.310> computer<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.360> it's

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
call it all in one computer so it's

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.260 
call it all in one computer so it's
really<00:01:29.630> just<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:30.020> big<00:01:30.260> big<00:01:30.530> monitor<00:01:31.040> with<00:01:32.000> the
