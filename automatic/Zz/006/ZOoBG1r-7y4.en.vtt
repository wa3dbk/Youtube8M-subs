great to be here so tell us what exactly
is<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.830> super<00:00:08.280> moon<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.610> will<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.910> affect<00:00:09.330> earth

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
is a super moon and will it affect earth

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.470 
is a super moon and will it affect earth
well<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.889> super<00:00:11.340> moon<00:00:11.519> happens<00:00:11.969> when<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.330> get<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
well a super moon happens when you get a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.259 
well a super moon happens when you get a
full<00:00:12.780> moon<00:00:13.019> near<00:00:13.440> perigee<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.309> perigee<00:00:15.089> is

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
full moon near perigee and perigee is

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.090 
full moon near perigee and perigee is
our<00:00:15.509> word<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.109> closest<00:00:16.529> approach<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
our word for the closest approach the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.580 
our word for the closest approach the
moon<00:00:17.279> makes<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> earth<00:00:17.940> every<00:00:18.300> month

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
moon makes to the earth every month

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
moon makes to the earth every month
Apogee<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> farthest<00:00:20.220> away<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:21.000> see<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
Apogee is the farthest away you see the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
Apogee is the farthest away you see the
moon's<00:00:21.600> orbit<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.320> perfect<00:00:22.769> circle

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
moon's orbit is not a perfect circle

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.230 
moon's orbit is not a perfect circle
it's<00:00:23.310> actually<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.699> elliptical

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
it's actually a little elliptical

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.849 
it's actually a little elliptical
sometimes<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.380> farther<00:00:25.650> away

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
sometimes it's a little farther away

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
sometimes it's a little farther away
sometimes<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.580> closer<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.630> means

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
sometimes a little closer and that means

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.419 
sometimes a little closer and that means
that<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> size<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> moon<00:00:28.830> seems<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
that the size of the moon seems to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.519 
that the size of the moon seems to
change<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> sky<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.779> when<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
change in the sky and when you get a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
change in the sky and when you get a
full<00:00:31.859> moon<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.579> happens<00:00:32.910> when<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> moon<00:00:33.239> is

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
full moon that happens when the moon is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
full moon that happens when the moon is
very<00:00:33.510> close<00:00:33.899> that's<00:00:34.530> called<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> super<00:00:35.219> moon

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
very close that's called a super moon

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.400 
very close that's called a super moon
now<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.390> far<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.809> effects<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.290> earth

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
now as far as the effects on the earth

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
now as far as the effects on the earth
nothing<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.489> direct<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.300> actual<00:00:39.690> size<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
nothing very direct the actual size of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.450 
nothing very direct the actual size of
the<00:00:40.230> moon<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> sky<00:00:40.649> doesn't<00:00:41.219> change<00:00:41.370> very

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the moon in the sky doesn't change very

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
the moon in the sky doesn't change very
much<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.300> only<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.719> 12<00:00:43.110> percent<00:00:43.320> larger

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
much it's only about 12 percent larger

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.880 
much it's only about 12 percent larger
than<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:44.489> average<00:00:44.610> full<00:00:45.059> moon<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
than an average full moon and and as you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
than an average full moon and and as you
may<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.579> highest<00:00:47.760> tides<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> month

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
may know the highest tides of the month

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
may know the highest tides of the month
happen<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.379> full<00:00:49.620> moon<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> new<00:00:50.250> moon<00:00:50.280> these

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
happen at full moon and new moon these

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
happen at full moon and new moon these
are<00:00:51.329> called<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> spring<00:00:52.020> tides<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.590> each

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
are called the spring tides of each

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
are called the spring tides of each
month<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> moon<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.449> little

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
month and because the moon is a little

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.330 
month and because the moon is a little
closer<00:00:54.899> than<00:00:55.140> normal<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.590> means<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> tides

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
closer than normal that means the tides

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.250 
closer than normal that means the tides
will<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.360> higher<00:00:57.629> than<00:00:57.930> normal

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
will be a little bit higher than normal

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
will be a little bit higher than normal
as<00:00:58.379> well<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.280> we're<00:00:59.460> talking<00:00:59.609> about<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> change

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
as well but we're talking about a change

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.110 
as well but we're talking about a change
of<00:01:00.629> less<00:01:01.140> than<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.530> inch<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
of less than an inch so one of the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.729 
of less than an inch so one of the
challenges<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.960> measuring<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.650> they

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
challenges about measuring what they

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.800 
challenges about measuring what they
call<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> proxy<00:01:05.400> gian<00:01:05.640> tides<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.270> high<00:01:06.420> tides

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
call the proxy gian tides the high tides

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.440 
call the proxy gian tides the high tides
associated<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> super<00:01:08.580> moon<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.970> even

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
associated with a super moon is even

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.760 
associated with a super moon is even
measuring<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> fun<00:01:10.439> thing<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
measuring it at all it's a fun thing to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
measuring it at all it's a fun thing to
actually<00:01:11.070> detect<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:12.060> something<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
actually detect it's not something that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.980 
actually detect it's not something that
you<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.810> easily<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> best

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
you can easily see so when is the best

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
you can easily see so when is the best
time<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.259> view<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> super<00:01:17.159> moon<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.520> will<00:01:17.729> look

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
time to view the super moon it will look

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.380 
time to view the super moon it will look
different<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:18.540> other<00:01:18.689> full<00:01:19.229> moons<00:01:19.909> well<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
different from other full moons well to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.450 
different from other full moons well to
me<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.869> best<00:01:22.049> time<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.470> view<00:01:22.650> any<00:01:22.920> full<00:01:23.280> moon

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
me the best time to view any full moon

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.039 
me the best time to view any full moon
is<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.939> sunset<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.689> that's<00:01:24.869> when

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
is right at sunset because that's when

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.289 
is right at sunset because that's when
it<00:01:25.140> rises<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.400> see<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> moon<00:01:26.970> with

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it rises and when you see the moon with

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.450 
it rises and when you see the moon with
respect<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> horizon<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.979> buildings

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
respect to the horizon with buildings

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
respect to the horizon with buildings
and<00:01:29.700> trees<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.329> whatever<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.290> seems<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and trees or whatever it just seems to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
look so much more spectacular it looks

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020 
look so much more spectacular it looks
larger<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.500> reality<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> size<00:01:35.340> change<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.850> not

that much the of a moon at perigee are

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
that much the of a moon at perigee are
closest<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.840> larger

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
closest it's just a little bit larger

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.980 
closest it's just a little bit larger
than<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> moon<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.009> farther<00:01:41.340> away

there<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.140> isn't<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.649> best<00:01:43.950> time<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.460> night

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
there really isn't a best time at night

actual moment of super moon when it's
both<00:01:49.229> closest<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.250> most<00:01:50.490> full<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.060> gonna

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
both closest and the most full is gonna

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.230 
both closest and the most full is gonna
be<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.780> 7:30<00:01:52.320> a.m.<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.829> Sunday<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:54.030> that's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
be at 7:30 a.m. the Sunday but that's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
be at 7:30 a.m. the Sunday but that's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
actually after the moon has set so I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
actually after the moon has set so I
would<00:01:56.549> say<00:01:56.729> anytime<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.479> Saturday<00:01:57.869> night<00:01:58.020> go

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
would say anytime on Saturday night go

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.690 
would say anytime on Saturday night go
out<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.560> look<00:01:58.619> at<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.890> beautiful<00:01:59.490> big

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
out and look at this beautiful big

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.880 
out and look at this beautiful big

astronauts the poles of the Moon are
fascinating<00:02:27.670> places<00:02:27.910> there<00:02:28.750> are<00:02:28.780> actually

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
fascinating places there are actually

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.930 
fascinating places there are actually
craters<00:02:29.560> both<00:02:29.860> at<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.040> North<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.460> South<00:02:30.520> Pole

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
craters both at the North and South Pole

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.180 
craters both at the North and South Pole
of<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> moon<00:02:31.240> where<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.110> Sun<00:02:32.320> never<00:02:32.800> shines

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
of the moon where the Sun never shines

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.580 
of the moon where the Sun never shines
you<00:02:33.550> never<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:33.880> any<00:02:34.090> sunlight<00:02:34.420> at<00:02:34.720> all<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.290> of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
you never get any sunlight at all and of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.140 
you never get any sunlight at all and of
course<00:02:35.800> those<00:02:36.040> are<00:02:36.070> very<00:02:36.310> difficult<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.820> image

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
course those are very difficult to image

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.000 
course those are very difficult to image
but<00:02:37.480> we're<00:02:37.600> actually<00:02:37.870> bouncing<00:02:38.320> lasers<00:02:38.770> down

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
but we're actually bouncing lasers down

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.500 
but we're actually bouncing lasers down
to<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.280> moon<00:02:39.460> we're<00:02:40.090> studying<00:02:40.360> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
to the moon we're studying the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.720 
to the moon we're studying the
topography<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.140> these<00:02:41.350> craters<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.040> there's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
topography of these craters and there's

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.850 
topography of these craters and there's
evidence<00:02:43.240> that<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.510> may<00:02:43.660> be<00:02:43.690> ice<00:02:44.050> actually

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
evidence that there may be ice actually

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.680 
evidence that there may be ice actually
frozen<00:02:45.400> into<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> soil<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.570> these

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
frozen into the soil in these

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.750 
frozen into the soil in these
permanently<00:02:47.320> shadowed<00:02:47.470> craters<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.610> there

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
permanently shadowed craters so there

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640 
permanently shadowed craters so there
may<00:02:48.880> be<00:02:48.910> more<00:02:49.240> water<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> moon<00:02:50.080> frozen

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
may be more water on the moon frozen

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.160 
may be more water on the moon frozen
water<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.340> suspected<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.630> LRO<00:02:53.050> is

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
water that we suspected so LRO is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.810 
water that we suspected so LRO is
telling<00:02:53.590> us<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:53.920> much<00:02:54.070> about<00:02:54.130> how<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.550> moon

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
telling us so much about how the moon

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.970 
telling us so much about how the moon
came<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.600> how<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:55.900> changes<00:02:56.470> over<00:02:56.590> time

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
came to be how it changes over time

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.130 
came to be how it changes over time
we've<00:02:57.730> recorded<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.240> coldest<00:02:58.690> temperature

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
we've recorded the coldest temperature

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.110 
we've recorded the coldest temperature
in<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.350> entire<00:02:59.650> solar<00:02:59.980> system<00:03:00.070> with<00:03:00.490> LRO<00:03:00.820> and

in the entire solar system with LRO and

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.370 
in the entire solar system with LRO and
one<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.600> these<00:03:01.720> permanently<00:03:02.200> shadowed

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
one of these permanently shadowed

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.650 
one of these permanently shadowed

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
Fahrenheit so just a fascinating place

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.699 
Fahrenheit so just a fascinating place
and<00:03:13.540> we're<00:03:13.630> finding<00:03:13.900> out<00:03:14.020> new<00:03:14.170> things<00:03:14.200> all<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
and we're finding out new things all the

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.710 
and we're finding out new things all the
time<00:03:14.920> there's<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:15.610> much<00:03:15.760> more<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.030> learn<00:03:16.360> about

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
time there's so much more to learn about

this familiar object in the sky I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.810 
this familiar object in the sky I
understand<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.500> LRO<00:03:21.010> has<00:03:21.250> taken<00:03:21.610> some

a relic of a more exciting and more

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.110 
a relic of a more exciting and more
violent<00:04:14.920> time<00:04:15.160> in<00:04:15.400> our<00:04:15.489> solar<00:04:15.700> system's

together<00:04:18.280> lots<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.299> things<00:04:19.510> were<00:04:19.660> colliding

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
together lots of things were colliding

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.380 
together lots of things were colliding
we<00:04:20.979> think<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> moon<00:04:21.430> may<00:04:21.640> have<00:04:21.760> been<00:04:21.910> created

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
we think the moon may have been created

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.450 
we think the moon may have been created
during<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.720> super<00:04:23.140> collision<00:04:23.740> where<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.310> earth

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
during a super collision where the earth

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.050 
during a super collision where the earth
was<00:04:24.760> actually<00:04:25.030> hit<00:04:25.150> by<00:04:25.180> something<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.690> size

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
was actually hit by something the size

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.950 
was actually hit by something the size
planet<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.980> moon<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:28.790> serene<00:04:29.450> and

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
planet so the moon is so serene and

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.900 
planet so the moon is so serene and
anyway<00:04:30.320> we<00:04:30.620> see<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:30.950> it's<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:31.220> familiar<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.880> us

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
anyway we see it it's so familiar to us

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.350 
anyway we see it it's so familiar to us
it's<00:04:32.540> all<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:32.990> dramatic<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.070> violent<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.910> the

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
it's all so dramatic and violent and the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.510 
it's all so dramatic and violent and the
stories<00:04:35.840> associated<00:04:36.470> with<00:04:36.590> it<00:04:36.770> just<00:04:37.340> just

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
stories associated with it just just

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.780 
stories associated with it just just
really<00:04:37.850> fire<00:04:38.240> my<00:04:38.510> imagination<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:40.550> tell<00:04:40.760> us

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
really fire my imagination so tell us

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.900 
really fire my imagination so tell us

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
where can we learn more about the moon

where can we learn more about the moon
