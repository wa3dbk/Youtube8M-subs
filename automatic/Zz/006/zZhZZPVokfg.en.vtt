this<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> gun<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.530> takes<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
this kind of gun and that takes me to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.530 
this kind of gun and that takes me to
the<00:01:35.070> next<00:01:35.159> point<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.090> i'm<00:01:36.240> using<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the next point which i'm using the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
the next point which i'm using the
specialist<00:01:36.930> package<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.189> issued<00:01:38.400> duck

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
specialist package and is issued duck

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609 
specialist package and is issued duck
that<00:01:38.790> gives<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> ballistic<00:01:40.020> vest<00:01:40.229> team

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that gives me a ballistic vest team

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
that gives me a ballistic vest team
player<00:01:40.829> i'm<00:01:41.759> using<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.270> ax<00:01:42.299> specialist

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
player i'm using the ax specialist

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690 
player i'm using the ax specialist
package<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.770> said<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.460> need<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
package because as I said you need to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.859 
package because as I said you need to
give<00:01:44.820> yourself<00:01:44.880> every<00:01:45.420> advantage<00:01:45.689> possible

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
give yourself every advantage possible

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.859 
give yourself every advantage possible
and<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:47.430> mobs<00:01:47.939> assault<00:01:48.329> mobs<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:48.720> quite

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and it's mobs assault mobs are quite

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
and it's mobs assault mobs are quite
hard<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.320> dragon<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.759> if

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
hard with the dragon off and I think if

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.249 
hard with the dragon off and I think if
you<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:50.970> give<00:01:51.210> yourself<00:01:51.479> enough<00:01:51.659> ammo<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:51.990> do

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you just give yourself enough ammo to do

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.980 
you just give yourself enough ammo to do
it<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.500> possible<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> do<00:01:53.850> find<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.630> dome

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it as possible but I do find on on dome

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.209

spinning a bit scout sniper but you

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.240 
spinning a bit scout sniper but you
really<00:02:09.750> want<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.050> limit<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.530> interchanges

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
really want to limit it to interchanges

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.500 
really want to limit it to interchanges
and<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.430> lot<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> people<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.970> had<00:02:12.120> success

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and a lot of people have had success

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.370 
and a lot of people have had success
using<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.959> tactic

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
using my tactic

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.590 
using my tactic
interchange<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:17.150> sniping<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.420> yeah

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
interchange and a sniping on that yeah

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.450 
interchange and a sniping on that yeah
as<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.840> said<00:02:18.870> sliding<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.320> them<00:02:19.500> just<00:02:19.530> crazy<00:02:20.070> but

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
as I said sliding on them just crazy but

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.090 
as I said sliding on them just crazy but
we<00:02:21.240> want<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:22.580> pretty<00:02:23.580> much<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.090> ACOG<00:02:24.720> is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
we want to do is pretty much the ACOG is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.740 
we want to do is pretty much the ACOG is
pop<00:02:26.100> fire<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.880> didn't<00:02:27.240> really<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.510> there

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
pop fire as I didn't really do it there

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
pop fire as I didn't really do it there
but<00:02:28.080> once<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.410> kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.310> take<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> shot<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
but once you kind of you take a shot it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.600 
but once you kind of you take a shot it
kicks<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.300> dramatically<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.650> let<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.250> let<00:02:32.550> it

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
kicks up dramatically and let it let it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.460 
kicks up dramatically and let it let it
just<00:02:32.730> come<00:02:32.910> back<00:02:33.030> down<00:02:33.180> into<00:02:33.330> place<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.320> take

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
just come back down into place and take

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.690 
just come back down into place and take
your<00:02:34.590> next<00:02:34.710> shocks<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.130> too<00:02:35.310> short<00:02:35.460> kill

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
your next shocks it's too short kill

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.460 
your next shocks it's too short kill
from<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> most<00:02:36.180> part<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.630> think<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.290> head

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
from the most part I think to the head

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.950 
from the most part I think to the head
that's<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.800> shot<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:39.120> silencer<00:02:39.600> might<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
that's one shot so a silencer might be a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.780 
that's one shot so a silencer might be a
good<00:02:40.080> idea<00:02:40.200> if<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.980> fancy<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.520> like

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
good idea if you fancy just like

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.240 
good idea if you fancy just like
spamming<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.420> with<00:02:42.570> kick<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.190> talking<00:02:44.190> of

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
spamming it with kick and talking of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.560 
spamming it with kick and talking of
kick<00:02:44.430> kick<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.730> probably<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.420> best

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
kick kick is probably the best

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.970 
kick kick is probably the best
proficiency<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.410> recommend<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:46.890> this

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
proficiency I can recommend with this

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.970 
proficiency I can recommend with this
gun<00:02:47.250> has<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:49.170> move<00:02:49.320> seen<00:02:49.470> already<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.770> gun

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
gun has you move seen already the gun

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.130 
gun has you move seen already the gun
kicks<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.340> like<00:02:50.700> crazily<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:51.810> not<00:02:52.020> sure

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
kicks up like crazily and I'm not sure

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.050 
kicks up like crazily and I'm not sure
of<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.320> game<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.740> kick<00:02:53.010> or<00:02:53.190> without<00:02:53.430> it

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
of this game as would kick or without it

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.790 
of this game as would kick or without it
might<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.450> impact<00:02:54.900> impact<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.440> think<00:02:55.470> it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
might be impact impact I think it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.160 
might be impact impact I think it
probably<00:02:56.040> was<00:02:56.270> but<00:02:57.270> normally<00:02:57.630> my<00:02:57.780> best<00:02:57.990> games

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
probably was but normally my best games

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.230 
probably was but normally my best games
have<00:02:58.290> been<00:02:58.380> coming<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.860> kick<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.940> my<00:03:00.060> best

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
have been coming with kick and my best

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.840 
have been coming with kick and my best
killfeeds<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.900> stuff<00:03:01.140> because<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.610> gun<00:03:02.820> is

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
killfeeds and stuff because the gun is

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.540 
killfeeds and stuff because the gun is
