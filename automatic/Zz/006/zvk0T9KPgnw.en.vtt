00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.290
 Hello, Julia. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.950
 good and useful program of business 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.480
 our permanent assistant techno store 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.180
 plus killed again invited us 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 study household appliances and this time we 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.110
 get to know multicookers 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.030
 and so what is the slow cooker 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.430
 Perhaps this and the oven and pans and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.989
 pans and yogurt maker and steamer and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.910
 bread maker in one bottle 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.460
 but this device has one main thing 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.129
 advantage it saves that time 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 which you spend on cooking 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.429
 heating elements evenly 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.559
 warm up the tank at the same time 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.809
 cooking significantly reduced a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.809
 useful properties of products are preserved 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.550
 we will tell you in detail about each function 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 for now, advertising time so back to 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.740
 Multicookers for example such a model 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 Redmond has a great design 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.930
 the volume of the bowl is 5 liters in other words in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.579
 you can bake a whole chicken or 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.710
 kilograms three potato wedges 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.710
 or cook soup for the whole family 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.150
 lived there in this multicooker 18 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.830
 automatic programs from the soup and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.430
 stewing before cooking dough and yogurt 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.430
 but 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.330
 full 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.960
 The slow cooker will not allow in Japan and 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.009
 burning evenly with water saving 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.840
 and electricity will cook dishes 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.520
 another excellent multicooker function 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.190
 it's steaming 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.060
 as the process is hermetically sealed 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.000
 closed bowl 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.920
 cooking happens very fast therefore and 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.739
 useful properties of products better 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.569
 saved if earlier you rarely 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.459
 spoiled his family baking because 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.350
 troublesome and long to watch out for 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.340
 temperature of the oven to look to the dough 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.230
 was baked 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.480
 and not burned then with a slow cooker you 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.330
 become just a master of cakes and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.370
