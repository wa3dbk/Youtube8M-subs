 we have had in this program the truth 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.380
 is that they have an attitude and above all 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.239

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.370
 we currently have already in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340

 as soft as steam or if it is 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.309
 exactly or also for this stage of 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.970
 menopause also a bit complicated 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.890
 in this age previous to that age also 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 we are prepared with this type of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.509
 super light fixes is transparent 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.579
 light to the bottom and the trousers 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.590
 super comfortable and super modern also not 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.200

 chic and elegant touch for this age to 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.959
 I loved the combination the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 contrast of the red belt with the button 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.330
 the button is key in this garment gives and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 enhances all the gray suit is better is 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.490
 a super neutral color but combining it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.649
 with this red we give an incredible art 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.780
 by also true for a meal with 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.209

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.580
 cute in principle but at the same time 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.740
 elegant exactly for those who 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.179
 They tend to go continuously to 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.319

 makes us a super cute combination 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.260
 brown belt contrasts again the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.840
 contrast of colors gives us a 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.209
 totally different approach we do not raise 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.519

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.769
 the very cheerful color scheme and 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.019
 very springy and especially one 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.709
 well dressed and very cool one does not have 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.900
 one channel necessarily with these 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.599
 tirant visits and all this is 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.239
 perfect for all day you see one very 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.849

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.859

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.659
 exactly and somewhat baggy but with this 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.329
 Belt we shape ourselves in the body 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.889
 but we never stop being comfortable piece 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.959
 is super important at this stage of 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.609
 our life and arranged to me it seems to me 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.040
 something wonderful that that to any 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.700
 we are still worried about seeing each other 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.610

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.640
 lose this is another super comfortable model 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.670
 also this type of shirt helps us 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.230
 greatly to conceal the other kilitos 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.330
 that we can have and especially give that 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.130
 Focus also on the legs lengthen 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.830
 a little figure with this kind of 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.959
 pants a blouse that the best stop 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.600
 and that we do not dare to put on what 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.640
 we cover with this type of camila and you see 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.709
 spectacular because it gives us shape in 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.660
 carved on the bottom and what 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.940
 we cover very well with this one with this 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.500
 long shirt and good also the pants 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.840
 it helps you a lot because it's a pair of pants 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.790
 thin that allows you to be fresh already 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.250
 the best you do not have that day you want to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.530
 bring a skirt or something shorter because 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.360
 you have several occupations exactly and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.150
 especially this type of fabric in the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.739
 pant allows you mobility at the moment 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.760
 to walk when making your 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.010
 movements you can do 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.560
 properly and very comfortably and look 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.580
 the accessories also included 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.470
 very simple but with a nice touch 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.500
 exactly very flirtatious for example 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.870
 see there this one is also super yes 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.530
 that is very modern but we give that 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.720
 also touch this stage not see a 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.030
 we also bring a blouse in the part 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.820
 below to have the button open and 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:41.450
 it looks like we have a neckline but 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:44.940
 to the same one that visits below like the 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.730
 lace is lace lace that we let see 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.590
 slightly and the pants just like 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.250
 they simulate denim but if they are fixed it is 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.830
 a thin thin fabric again that 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.770
 allows us to be very comfortable there now 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:06.370
 I want I want to teach you also friends 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:09.460
 to our next model and the truth 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.069
 is that if we have a night commitment 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.440
 by day this dress is ideal because we 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.879
 It gives a touch of unique elegance like 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.700
 we can see here in our model 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.160
 gorgeous 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.410
 the fact of contrasting the black with the 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.900
 white has been given during eras 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.150
 and it will never go out of style without this 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.700
 Contrast detail at the waist 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.040
 good to me I have been encouraged blond there are some 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.340
 touches of beige with coffee also not 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.280
 exactly beige white coffee but this one 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.170
 this contrast is the Hindi simÃ³ 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.990
 and especially the detail in the waist 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.700
 It helps us a lot to hide that little belly 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.070
 that we could have in the part of 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.900
 in front and the shovel the lower abdomen good 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.240
 but also this kind of dresses to the 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.320
 long the figure exactly the stylist 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.270
 much is not armed figure gives us this 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.950
 that triangle-like detail that 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.260
 we can be seeing in the waist and 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.780
 is collected from the hair as it helps 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.690
 will be more neck more stylized with 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.630
 the whole dress looks divine, notice that 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.540
 that the secret is knowing how to combine all 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.940
 the accessories with the hairstyle with the 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.650
 dressed and well now you better go with a 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.300
 dressed like this we just saw and 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.550
 for in the afternoon you can put a sack 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.009
 and in the night you put a scarf 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.169
 certainly the makeup and accessories 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.360
 we can become day or night 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.000
 like how is this the last dress that 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.210
 we saw it was better a heel a little more 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.550
 high also in the garments that are 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.159
 turn into something uncomfortable we also 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.289
 can make a lot of the costumes and the 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.330
 attitude that we have in addition to 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.789
 use all this type of garments 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.340
 especially not since never friends leave 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.050
 to feel sexy at any stage of 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.840
 our life and especially with the attitude 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:55.419
 and the desire to continue living from 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.069
 enjoy that we are breathing not like this 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.300
 is and I also take advantage of that 

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:59.949
 that we are talking about women of the 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.659
 seniors in sending a greeting very 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:03.310
 great to my mom and my mother-in-law 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:07.590

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.590
 beautiful gorgeous women and you speak them 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.770

 beautiful lady and now thanks are and 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.300

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.960
 our house we lack a lot of that 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.960
 talk about friends
