anyway it's just whether you want to say
it<00:02:20.489> with<00:02:20.610> economy<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> don't<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.510> why<00:02:21.720> you'd

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
it with economy I don't know why you'd

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.780 
it with economy I don't know why you'd
do<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.319> but<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.950> turn<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.400> true<00:02:23.640> if

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
do this but you just turn it to true if

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.089 
do this but you just turn it to true if
you<00:02:23.910> need<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.299> then<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.560> set<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.860> price

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
you need to then you can set the price

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.910 
you need to then you can set the price
of<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.430> spawner<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.420> change<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.799> can

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
of a spawner to change it and you can

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.740 
of a spawner to change it and you can
even<00:02:29.069> set<00:02:29.310> separate<00:02:29.819> prices<00:02:30.269> for<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> type<00:02:30.720> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
even set separate prices for the type of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.440 
even set separate prices for the type of
monster<00:02:31.700> that's<00:02:32.700> under<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.120> other<00:02:33.269> one

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
monster that's under the other one

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.770 
monster that's under the other one
prices<00:02:34.760> then<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> can<00:02:36.000> just<00:02:36.090> set<00:02:36.299> individual

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
prices then you can just set individual

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.199 
prices then you can just set individual
prices<00:02:37.260> as<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:38.250> say<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.459> don't<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:38.849> see<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
prices as I say I don't really see the

prices as I say I don't really see the
point<00:02:40.079> in<00:02:40.349> this<00:02:40.560> one<00:02:40.769> but<00:02:41.099> it's<00:02:41.880> possible<00:02:42.420> if

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
point in this one but it's possible if

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.970 
point in this one but it's possible if
