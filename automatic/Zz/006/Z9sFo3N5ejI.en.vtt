00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.250
 Today I want to give you the new needle 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 cantilever can 357 htl of liebherr 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 present the 357 htm is the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.400
 successor of the proven 355 hcl and 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.399
 was decisive in some points 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:35.460
 the 357 hcl is improved in two 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.090
 versions with twelve tons and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.070
 an 18 tonne cyclist through the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 switch from one to two rods 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.980
 operation can thus be hardest 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.710
 loads of 24 or 32 tonnes 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.590
 For which construction sites was the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.289
 Crane now designed by the small 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.690
 turning circle radius plays janika hcl gran 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.300
 his advantages especially in operations 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 cramped construction sites together with 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.320
 his outstanding kink point is he 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.680
 On construction sites with big hooks heights too 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.680
 home 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.800
 Of course , being alone is not 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.710
 Everything and needs a suitable tower 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.630
 That's why the system in the Lieper building set became so 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.610
 a new foundation cross with one 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.420
 crashes width of 6 06 meters 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.760
 developed 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.790
 with this small dimensions they are suitable 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.030
 Great for tight construction sites 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:42.570
 the 357 hcl can be on the new and 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.800
 now proven 355 ecm system 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.920
 being constructed 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.860
 with dimensions of 1 meter 90 x 1 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.899
 meter 90 it represents the slimmest and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.680
 most powerful tower system of its 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.649
 class dar 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.229
 the small dimensions predestine the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.300
 Storm system around in tight elevator 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.720
 shafts built and climbed to 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.720
 become 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.420
 another advantage of this compact 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.420
 dimensions provided cost-effective 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.420
 container transport 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.959
 I come back to the actual 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.030
 can 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.500
 we are now on the revolving stage 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.140
 of the 357 hcl in front of me they see the new one 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.799
 of course, from love own 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.090
 production 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.440
 we show 116 kw allows high 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.860
 speeds even at high loads 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.829
 There are hook heights of up to 1100 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.780
 meters in own operation possible next to the 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.450
 high hat speeds in the lesson 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.310
 hook and at low loads has the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.920
 can of course position over the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.989
 Mode meiko must make this possible 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.739
 sensitive place also from 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.739
 highest loads 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.520
 Of course, the 357 hcl still has 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.650
 much more highlights 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.020
 We would like to have them on the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.310
 present bauma 2013 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.310
 We look forward to you
