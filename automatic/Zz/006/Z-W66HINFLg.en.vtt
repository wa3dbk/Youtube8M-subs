see it I really don't like intentionally

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.640 
see it I really don't like intentionally
scratching<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.630> devices<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.229> did<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
scratching your devices so I did this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.890 
scratching your devices so I did this
for<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> guys<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.970> thumbs<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> down

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
for you guys so thumbs up for that down

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
for you guys so thumbs up for that down
below<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.619> sure<00:01:40.860> enough<00:01:41.130> after<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.460> few

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
below but sure enough after a few

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
below but sure enough after a few
minutes<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> scratches<00:01:42.570> were<00:01:42.750> mostly

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
minutes the scratches were mostly

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.100 
minutes the scratches were mostly
minimized<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.340> say<00:01:44.670> minimize<00:01:45.000> not<00:01:45.479> completely

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
minimized I say minimize not completely

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.260 
minimized I say minimize not completely
gone<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:47.040> definitely<00:01:47.159> way<00:01:47.670> less<00:01:47.909> noticeable

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
gone but definitely way less noticeable

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
gone but definitely way less noticeable
than<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:48.990> were<00:01:49.049> fresh<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.680> would<00:01:49.829> be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
than when they were fresh this would be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
than when they were fresh this would be
awesome<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.820> dropped<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.299> phone

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
awesome if you like dropped your phone

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.300 
awesome if you like dropped your phone
on<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> concrete<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.290> picked<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> back<00:01:53.250> up

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
on the concrete and picked it back up

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
on the concrete and picked it back up
put<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.000> pocket<00:01:54.149> walked<00:01:54.659> home<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
put it in your pocket walked home and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.719 
put it in your pocket walked home and
then<00:01:55.590> took<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.040> pocket<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> few

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
then took it out your pocket a few

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
then took it out your pocket a few
minutes<00:01:57.000> later<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.450> you'd<00:01:57.750> barely<00:01:58.020> even<00:01:58.409> be

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
minutes later and you'd barely even be

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
minutes later and you'd barely even be
able<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.799> tell<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> drop<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.490> phone<00:01:59.520> sounds

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450

great<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:00.930> take<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.110> look<00:02:01.229> back<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
great but take a look back at that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.590 
great but take a look back at that

right now I'm by New York City it's cold

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.830 
right now I'm by New York City it's cold
it's<00:02:25.620> windy<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:26.249> maybe<00:02:26.879> 55<00:02:27.510> degrees

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840

Fahrenheit or 13 degrees Celsius on a
nice<00:02:30.930> day<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.290> here<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.799> decided<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.219> try<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
nice day out here so I decided to try to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.610 
nice day out here so I decided to try to
simulate<00:02:32.730> some<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.299> heat<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.840> heal<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.230> but

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
simulate some of the heat to heal it but

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.080 
simulate some of the heat to heal it but
actually<00:02:34.950> rubbing<00:02:35.219> against<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:35.670> scratches

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
actually rubbing against the scratches

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.270 
actually rubbing against the scratches
really<00:02:36.510> fast<00:02:36.719> for<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.049> bit<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:37.379> as<00:02:37.560> crazy<00:02:37.920> as

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
really fast for a bit now as crazy as

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.099 
really fast for a bit now as crazy as
you<00:02:38.489> may<00:02:38.639> look<00:02:38.879> trying<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> warm<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:39.959> your

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
you may look trying to warm up your

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.020 
you may look trying to warm up your
phone<00:02:40.290> by<00:02:40.500> clutching<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.159> your<00:02:41.280> body<00:02:41.400> or

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
phone by clutching it to your body or

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.940 
phone by clutching it to your body or
rubbing<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.599> really<00:02:42.900> fast<00:02:43.169> or<00:02:43.439> playing<00:02:43.769> some

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
rubbing it really fast or playing some

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.559 
rubbing it really fast or playing some
intensive<00:02:44.400> games<00:02:44.669> as<00:02:45.150> long<00:02:45.329> as<00:02:45.450> you're<00:02:45.540> not

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
intensive games as long as you're not

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.819 
intensive games as long as you're not
microwaving<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.650> actually

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
microwaving it you can actually

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.949 
microwaving it you can actually
accelerate<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.909> healing<00:02:47.939> process<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.870> little

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
accelerate the healing process a little

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.920 
accelerate the healing process a little
bit<00:02:49.260> by<00:02:49.709> warming<00:02:50.189> up<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.609> device<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.329> you

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
bit by warming up the device and you

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.390 
bit by warming up the device and you
know<00:02:52.019> that's<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.500> pretty<00:02:52.680> neat<00:02:52.919> trick<00:02:53.069> now

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
know that's a pretty neat trick now

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.520 
know that's a pretty neat trick now
finally<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> took<00:02:53.939> a<00:02:54.120> knife<00:02:54.389> and<00:02:54.689> took<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.079> deep

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
finally I took a knife and took a deep

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.349 
finally I took a knife and took a deep
scratch<00:02:55.949> clean<00:02:56.489> across<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.969> back<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.299> the

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
scratch clean across the back of the

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.809 
scratch clean across the back of the
device<00:02:57.480> right<00:02:58.019> under<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.469> lte-a<00:02:59.040> logo<00:02:59.639> and

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
device right under the lte-a logo and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.490 
device right under the lte-a logo and
tried<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> few<00:03:00.389> things<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.750> warm<00:03:00.930> up<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.260> device

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
tried a few things to warm up the device

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.170 
tried a few things to warm up the device
and<00:03:01.560> heal<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.189> and<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.699> been<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.849> few<00:03:03.120> hours

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
and heal it and it's been a few hours

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.089
