00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.400
 this movie is practically the continuation of my previous fact for 

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.669
 caravels of cristoforo colombo 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.949
 in which they are ready 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.900
 commented on the models I made from nannini to the alleged 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.770
 to send a subsequent video how many people wanted to see the saint 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.800
 maria I love the ultimatum 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 that then fairs under construction 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.710
 as web 60 the fleet of Cristoforo Colombo 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.490
 for the journey undertaken August 2, 1492 which was formed by three caravels 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.400
 for greater clarity 2 were caravels or nina la pinta 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.020
 while the holy mary 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.340
 verona caracas which was used as the flagship of the expedition 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.840
 owned by juan de the thing that the joe colombo have it, however, was the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.670
 his cartographer pilot 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.720
 built around 1480 in santander in galicia 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.110
 stable carpenters who without the aid of drawings and plans of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.100
 construction 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.140
 they parried it with the name of calling at 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.220
 this was the original name of the holy Mary and proved to be bad for 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 the very robust era 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.660
 the holy mary was priced with 5 cotton sails 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.080
 4 squares and a can 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.130
 that is triangular in shape for the mizzen tree 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.360
 peaceful beyond 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.580
 the possibility of adding laterally to the veiled mistress 2 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.090
 cutlasses 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.930
 thus the small side square sails were defined 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.280
 which were usually assembled when there was calm sea and to take advantage of the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.580
 maximum the wind as this was weak almost absent 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.640
 the length of the hull was about 26 meters the maximum width for almost 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.819
 eight millimeters the dive the ministers 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.840
 is the maesta tree was about 27 meters high 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:21.329
 some texts report that according to the storage capacity of the time and that 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.499
 every barrel of wine is taken off every viviano 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.389
 of one, 37 cubic meters 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.209
 the santa maria scozzaro about 106 tons 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.050
 equivalent today 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.050
 at 51 52 tons 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.049
 armament practically only for defensive purposes 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:49.119
 it was composed of 4 6 bombe indeterminate number of crossbows and portable pushers 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.489
 the holy mary in the night between 24 and 25 December 1492 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.089
 dao offshore you have one 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:04.419
 and consequently this christopher colombo moved on mine 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.069
 taking the lead 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.889
 in January 1493, together with the pine forest, he set out on the return journey 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.099
 landing in spain the following March 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:22.979
 by reason attributed to lot of ray from the holy mary are different 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.999
 some texts report that there was a calm sea, realizing the bass 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.879
 backdrop 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.049
 they surrender lying down on their side also because of the low tide that in 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.069
 meanwhile it manifested itself 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.930
 others 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.189
 that hit a rock irreparably damaging a hull 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.109
 others still a storm thing in the shipwreck making it vibrate on the 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.279
 beach 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:48.419
 in fact 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.279
 it seems however that they could have recovered as much as possible 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.499
 and there were no loss of life 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:02.279
 colombo had a fort built on the coast called the sailor 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:04.989
 be cool I have about forty men 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.739
 practically the crew of the holy mary 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.679
 but when on the second trip with the end of 1494 colombo returns 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:18.569
 discovers that the Spaniards previously left were all killed by 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.579
 diseases from Indians 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.150
 I thank those who have shared the vision of this signed in 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.480
 hope to have linked nicely for a few minutes
