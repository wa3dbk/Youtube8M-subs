00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay now we're gonna talk about using

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.300 
okay now we're gonna talk about using
our<00:00:03.210> legs<00:00:03.510> helping<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.410> shoot<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.859> bending<00:00:05.160> our

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
our legs helping a shoot and bending our

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.800 
our legs helping a shoot and bending our
knees<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.730> obviously<00:00:06.120> that's<00:00:06.270> why<00:00:06.480> we<00:00:06.600> Bend

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
knees and obviously that's why we Bend

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.230 
knees and obviously that's why we Bend
our<00:00:06.899> knees<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.309> that<00:00:08.429> we've<00:00:08.519> got<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.940> good

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
our knees is so that we've got that good

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.120 
our knees is so that we've got that good
ready<00:00:09.450> position<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.960> what<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.530> allows<00:00:10.800> us<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
ready position and what it allows us to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.820 
ready position and what it allows us to
do<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.400> coil<00:00:11.759> our<00:00:12.030> muscles<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.469> if<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.710> do

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
do is coil our muscles so that if we do

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.670 
do is coil our muscles so that if we do
decide<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.219> shoot<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.059> spring<00:00:15.450> up<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.900> I

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
decide to shoot we can spring up and I

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.650 
decide to shoot we can spring up and I
get<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> nice<00:00:17.190> jump<00:00:17.490> shot<00:00:17.670> off<00:00:17.850> depending<00:00:18.539> on

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
get a nice jump shot off depending on

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660 
get a nice jump shot off depending on
how<00:00:18.900> our<00:00:18.930> defenders<00:00:19.800> leaping<00:00:20.130> ability<00:00:20.340> might

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
how our defenders leaping ability might

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.250 
how our defenders leaping ability might
be<00:00:20.850> or<00:00:21.060> how<00:00:21.180> tall<00:00:21.449> they<00:00:21.630> might<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.960> they<00:00:22.109> might

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
be or how tall they might be they might

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.859 
be or how tall they might be they might
be<00:00:22.380> taller<00:00:22.590> than<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.449> important

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
be taller than we are so it's important

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.019 
be taller than we are so it's important
to<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.050> able<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.320> jump<00:00:25.560> well<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> we'll<00:00:26.880> get

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to be able to jump well and we'll get

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.089 
to be able to jump well and we'll get
into<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.380> ways<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.920> can

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
into all of the ways that you can

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.370 
into all of the ways that you can
increase<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.789> jumping<00:00:30.000> ability<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:31.109> another

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
increase your jumping ability in another

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.350 
increase your jumping ability in another
series<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.730> what<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:32.969> want<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.149> talk<00:00:33.300> about

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
series but so what we want to talk about

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.740 
series but so what we want to talk about
again<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.290> keeping<00:00:35.010> our<00:00:35.130> legs<00:00:35.309> bent<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.480> what

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
again is keeping our legs bent and what

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
again is keeping our legs bent and what
I<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> teach<00:00:38.489> for

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I like to do and what I teach for

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.319 
I like to do and what I teach for
position<00:00:40.670> shoulder<00:00:41.670> width<00:00:41.850> stance

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
position shoulder width stance

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.709 
position shoulder width stance
some<00:00:43.290> people<00:00:43.739> will<00:00:43.920> completely<00:00:44.730> square<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.360> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
some people will completely square up so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
some people will completely square up so
if<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> line<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.640> see

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
if we're on the line here you can see

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.389 
if we're on the line here you can see
