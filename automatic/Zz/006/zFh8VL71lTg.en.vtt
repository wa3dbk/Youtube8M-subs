00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.709
 have fallen previously it is going to cover 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.019
 the area in the middle nobody comes but 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.220
 there is a little transition now its 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.660
 colleagues will be covering all the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.420

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.920
 coal waiting for one of them to fall 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.989
 to make those coverages of 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.120
 substitutions get to drops in the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.910
 central area to get another 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.230

 a clip so that finally 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.250
