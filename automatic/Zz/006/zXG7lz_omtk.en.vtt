 before we would have invited the 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.150

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.560

 sergio sergio of milano who won the 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.500
 competition

 only on twitter everyone shows up 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.520
 Twitter is in fact one of the reasons 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.040
 which we chose because we know 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.780
 that this twitter likes a lot it seems 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.340
 that goes very strong so he is there 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.960
 they said it's very strong on twitter 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.550
 then I don't know if you can say briefly 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.470
