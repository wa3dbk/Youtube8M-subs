00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.190
 Oh, this time with John Brass 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 4 I'll try again to iron all times so King mwonyamyeon 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:21.390
 Uh Well I'm telling you that more than one bonus to stab Lee 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.230
 I use a comma to tell you to poke rhythm like this , 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.279
 Tell me. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.660
 If you like piano What do you know then 4-bit 8-bit apps are packed 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.960
 It is. 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 If you do not mean gypsum in an empty space, but you find it using rhythm, this also works. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 So you can use it properly . 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 I think you're mostly trying to be a mommy. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:55.079
 So today I'll try packing a very basic rhythm once . 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 Brass receive the rest of the first rebuttal or receive or receive another one or two, or 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.089
 There is no such thing as the judge who is almost all night 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 I only use letters. 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:14.160
 Here Well, so once haebomyeon first placing 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.550
 How did this beating process itguyo can do 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.000
 By using any wells 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.000
 Then another one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:35.509
 Itgoyo this law is to ppaek ppaek gangah jeojom times varying octaves 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.509
 Once you hit the plus, the caveat is that you have to break it. It's not black. 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.450
 Another way to do this is with code . 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.450
 5 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.880
 When I sweat my nose 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.540
 There are two or exactly 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 Another place to go is very hard to clean it 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:07.980
 It may have been grapes. I think it's okay to use two. 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.980
 Then the next two patterns are 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.820
 Third or 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.360
 Oh, the third one 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.940
 Ah , I've heard a lot. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.940
 Yes, the fifth issue 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.800
 Oh sixth Playa those coming 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.870
 Seventh. 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.190
 How are you going to be very ah 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.820
 There is no last 6th posture . 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.820
 Mostly. 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.050
 Oh, I'll try and have one addition to my mind the most Lower yogeol 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.050
 Besides the mummy , 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.100
 Now there are many characters in the rhythm feeling only a little 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.100
 I'll try. 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.940
 U 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.940
