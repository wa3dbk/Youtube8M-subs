going to sit around right exactly and
they<00:00:50.430> certainly<00:00:50.640> improved<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> program

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
they certainly improved the program

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.049 
they certainly improved the program
overall<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.379> especially<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.920> JGR<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.850> looked

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
overall and especially at JGR it looked

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.639 
overall and especially at JGR it looked
like<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> be<00:00:54.719> another<00:00:54.930> Joey

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
like it was going to be another Joey

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
they both run out of fuel so walk me

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
they both run out of fuel so walk me
through<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.230> couple<00:01:01.440> things<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> crew

through a couple things one as a crew
chief<00:01:03.149> how<00:01:03.420> hard<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> calculate<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
chief how hard is it to calculate the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.960 
chief how hard is it to calculate the
fuel<00:01:04.890> mileage<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> don't<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.790> what

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
fuel mileage because you don't know what

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.420 
fuel mileage because you don't know what
the<00:01:06.000> driver<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.659> doing<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.200> car

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
the driver is really doing in the car

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.700 
the driver is really doing in the car
exactly<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.610> he's<00:01:08.729> doing<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.150> two<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.110> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
exactly what he's doing and two is this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770 
exactly what he's doing and two is this
an<00:01:10.890> example<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.369> how<00:01:11.549> teams<00:01:12.299> are<00:01:12.479> really

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
an example of how teams are really

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
an example of how teams are really
pushing<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.380> edge<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:14.010> when

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pushing it to the edge because when

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
pushing it to the edge because when
everybody<00:01:14.820> fitted<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.240> last<00:01:15.450> time<00:01:15.689> nobody

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
everybody fitted that last time nobody

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.630 
everybody fitted that last time nobody
can<00:01:16.409> make<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> end<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.130> were<00:01:17.220> banking

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.550 
do not shift as much because we don't
need<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> use<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> fuel<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
need to use the fuel because when the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.640 
need to use the fuel because when the
RPMs<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.790> use<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.240> fuel<00:01:33.540> yes<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
RPMs go up we use more fuel yes it is

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.890 
RPMs go up we use more fuel yes it is
very<00:01:34.680> tough<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.970> figure<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.390> fuel<00:01:36.600> mileage

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
very tough to figure the fuel mileage

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210 
very tough to figure the fuel mileage
because<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> drivers<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.950> doing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
because the drivers are all doing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.249 
because the drivers are all doing
something<00:01:38.790> different<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.020> tough

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
something different so it's it's a tough

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.569 
something different so it's it's a tough
deal<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.619> figure<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:40.920> exactly<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.520> they

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
deal to figure out exactly when they

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.590 
deal to figure out exactly when they
gonna<00:01:41.700> run<00:01:41.820> out<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> fuel<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.570> think

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
gonna run out of fuel I don't think

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.940 
gonna run out of fuel I don't think
