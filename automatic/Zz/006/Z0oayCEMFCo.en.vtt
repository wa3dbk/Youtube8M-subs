00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.960
 it was a lamborghini but good 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 conformo with the cart that adds us 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.809

 ok that we have hidden in our classroom 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.920
 although there was no need 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.970
 and well I'm going to change the mode for 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.430

 we have our water ok these are the 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.430
 kraft 2 to get here until the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.910
 capo which are four wooden slabs of 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.950
 ingot oak of 10 and we will get this 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:19.180
 piece that I think is a tire I think yes 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.729
 ok and we need to create four of these 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.330
 four tires and 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.840
 we are going to edit 5 ingots this will give us 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.869
 the chassis and to get to the cart we go 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.110
 to be an iron ingot a trunk a 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.580
 chassis a leather a furnace a block 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.100
