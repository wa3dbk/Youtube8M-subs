00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
up there quickly I like this level a lot

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.900 
up there quickly I like this level a lot
in<00:03:05.530> fact<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.430> levels<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.819> this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
in fact I like all the levels in this

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.400 
in fact I like all the levels in this
game<00:03:06.970> except<00:03:07.480> for<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:07.930> part<00:03:07.989> where<00:03:08.350> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
game except for that one part where the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.890 
game except for that one part where the
birds<00:03:08.590> kill<00:03:08.860> me<00:03:08.980> over<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.760> over<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.390> over

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
sadistic in the end I think we all need

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.580 
sadistic in the end I think we all need
to<00:04:36.010> ask<00:04:36.250> ourselves<00:04:36.550> does<00:04:37.180> Mario<00:04:37.690> really<00:04:38.200> get

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
to ask ourselves does Mario really get

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.210 
to ask ourselves does Mario really get
the<00:04:38.770> punishment<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:40.240> he<00:04:40.300> deserves<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.919> I

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
the punishment that he deserves and I

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.860 
the punishment that he deserves and I
don't<00:04:42.400> think<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:42.789> he<00:04:42.910> usually<00:04:43.180> ends<00:04:43.630> up<00:04:43.690> with<00:04:43.750> a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
don't think so he usually ends up with a

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.870 
don't think so he usually ends up with a
mild<00:04:44.169> concussion<00:04:44.860> but<00:04:44.889> then<00:04:45.190> he's<00:04:45.370> back<00:04:45.580> at<00:04:45.850> it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
mild concussion but then he's back at it

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.840 
mild concussion but then he's back at it
