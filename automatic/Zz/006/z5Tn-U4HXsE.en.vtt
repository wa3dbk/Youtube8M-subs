Airstream is going to Bud Brisbane me he

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
Airstream is going to Bud Brisbane me he
said<00:01:37.259> put<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:38.159> corners<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.579> you'd<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
said put your corners that you'd like it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
said put your corners that you'd like it
in<00:01:39.060> play<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:40.140> buzzing<00:01:40.500> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
in play and when you're buzzing your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
in play and when you're buzzing your
Airstream<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.689> should<00:01:42.869> feel<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
Airstream you should feel it up here and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
Airstream you should feel it up here and
the<00:01:44.700> reason<00:01:45.090> why<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.600> other<00:01:45.689> words<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the reason why in other words so the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
the reason why in other words so the
Airstream<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.009> call<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.340> upstream

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
Airstream going up we call that upstream

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.660 
Airstream going up we call that upstream

it being here bud showed me okay he says

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.310 
it being here bud showed me okay he says
now<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> airstream<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.229> he

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
now the airstream is here and what he

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.810 
now the airstream is here and what he
did<00:01:55.500> he<00:01:55.590> came<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> was<00:01:56.700> doing

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
did he came over and when I was doing

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
did he came over and when I was doing
that<00:01:56.939> he<00:01:57.060> pushed<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.869> my<00:01:58.380> bottom<00:01:58.649> lip<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> little

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that he pushed on my bottom lip a little

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310 
that he pushed on my bottom lip a little
like<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.450> airstream<00:02:00.899> leveled

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
like this and the airstream leveled

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.319 
like this and the airstream leveled
straight<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> went<00:02:02.219> straight<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.240> he

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
straight out and went straight and he

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.139 
straight out and went straight and he
says<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.259> recreates<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.219> when<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.880> put

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
says what this recreates is when you put

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.559 
says what this recreates is when you put
the<00:02:06.450> trumpet<00:02:06.840> mouthpiece<00:02:07.129> onto<00:02:08.129> your<00:02:08.220> chops

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
the trumpet mouthpiece onto your chops

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.729 
the trumpet mouthpiece onto your chops
we<00:02:09.569> always<00:02:09.810> use<00:02:09.929> our<00:02:10.080> bottom<00:02:10.349> lip<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
we always use our bottom lip is the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.110 
we always use our bottom lip is the
anchor<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.190> we're<00:02:11.340> normally<00:02:11.730> should<00:02:11.970> be

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
anchor so we're normally should be

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.160 
anchor so we're normally should be
putting<00:02:12.330> more<00:02:12.569> pressure

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
putting more pressure

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.400 
putting more pressure
here<00:02:14.060> anchor<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.600> takes<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.110> Airstream

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
here anchor that it takes the Airstream

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
here anchor that it takes the Airstream
pushes<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.860> straight<00:02:17.100> out<00:02:17.130> going<00:02:17.430> straight

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
pushes it straight out going straight

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.930 
pushes it straight out going straight
through<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:19.080> middle<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.440> mouthpiece

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
through the middle of the mouthpiece

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.490 
through the middle of the mouthpiece
okay<00:02:20.940> now<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.660> upper<00:02:21.930> register<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.440> is

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
okay now and the upper register this is

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.040 
okay now and the upper register this is
very<00:02:22.800> important<00:02:23.310> because<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.540> need<00:02:24.690> really

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
very important because you need really

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.350 
very important because you need really
good<00:02:25.080> corners<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.980> need<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.400> tight<00:02:26.760> aperture

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
good corners you need a tight aperture

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.059 
good corners you need a tight aperture
as<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.720> go<00:02:27.870> higher<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.440> play<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> upper

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
as you go higher to play in the upper

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.360 
as you go higher to play in the upper
register<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:30.030> -<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.240> tighter<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.690> aperture

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
register so - the tighter the aperture

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.530 
register so - the tighter the aperture
Corner<00:02:32.370> strength<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.240> determine

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
Corner strength is going to determine

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.870 
Corner strength is going to determine
how<00:02:33.810> tight<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.680> along<00:02:35.520> with<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
how tight that can be along with the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.210 
how tight that can be along with the
speed<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.510> air<00:02:36.660> not<00:02:36.870> volume<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.650> air<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.040> what

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
speed of air not volume of air is what

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.460 
speed of air not volume of air is what
gives<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.850> upper<00:02:39.030> register<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
gives you the upper register and the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.080 
gives you the upper register and the
sound<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.250> power<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.880> need<00:02:42.000> to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
sound and the power that you need to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:03:03.660 
sound and the power that you need to
play<00:02:42.300> I'll<00:02:42.870> briefly<00:02:43.170> demonstrate<00:02:43.770> this

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.229 

okay<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.909> was<00:03:05.120> from<00:03:05.450> C<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.010> staff<00:03:07.249> to<00:03:07.909> CC

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
okay that was from C and the staff to CC

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.759 
okay that was from C and the staff to CC
above<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.749> staff<00:03:08.989> now<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.260> notice<00:03:09.590> I'm<00:03:09.739> not

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
above the staff now you notice I'm not

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.110 
above the staff now you notice I'm not
out<00:03:10.129> of<00:03:10.459> air<00:03:10.670> I'm<00:03:11.389> not<00:03:12.790> I'm<00:03:13.790> not<00:03:13.909> doing

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
out of air I'm not I'm not doing

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.809 
out of air I'm not I'm not doing
anything<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.469> because<00:03:15.799> I'm<00:03:16.129> using<00:03:16.310> speed

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
anything this is because I'm using speed

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.879 
anything this is because I'm using speed
of<00:03:16.939> air<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.359> to<00:03:17.870> control<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.469> airstream

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
of air and to control the airstream

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.979 
of air and to control the airstream
through<00:03:19.189> really<00:03:19.790> really<00:03:19.939> strong<00:03:20.420> corners

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
through really really strong corners

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.990 
through really really strong corners
playing<00:03:21.709> every<00:03:22.069> one<00:03:22.189> of<00:03:22.280> those<00:03:22.370> pitches<00:03:22.670> at<00:03:22.909> a
