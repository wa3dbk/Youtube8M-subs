00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.540
 The agreement further promotes Olympic education and invites 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.540
 The purpose is to enliven 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.409
 The big sports sports club has been going on for 2-4 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.659
 Q As a large institution working as pr or function This is the new University of Tsukuba 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.829
 The aim of our current invitation is that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.450
 It means that you will arrive 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.460
 I want to support with my full strength 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.800
 I will come 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.399
 Agreement of university invitation committee is 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.470
 People at this time 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 There is also the Komeito 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.390
 The Slope Committee will form a partnership agreement with the university, which will be the sixth school this 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.490
 Tied up 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.280
 It has been decided that the 2016 Summer Olympics will be held and it has been less than 4 months 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.360
 What kind of actions are required of the Bid Committee in the future? 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.430
 It seems that the decision of the host city and Nayoro city councilor 100 people 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.990
 by 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.350
 It is a vote 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.540
 I'm going to plan for drawing someday and strengthen lobbying 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780
 I don't think it feels like that 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.630
 From 17th to Lausanne in Switzerland 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.250
 There are aftershocks in this world 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.040
 In Tokyo and 4 cities including Tokyo 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.130
 Of course 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.400
 About plan 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.280
 And this is the pressure of the pre-production too 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.310
 I think when it comes to a wide viewing angle 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.290
 In order to have the mayoral election the mayor of Kaku specifically 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.900
 What do you need? 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.460
 It will be a storage box 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.140
 This is important too 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.590
 Lobbying in the night club, ie a one-to-four strong relationship with Japan 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.780
 It's about keeping up 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.450
 I think it's more important 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.249
 So that is still the case 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.379
 This promotion secretary general came out but later between countries 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.830
 Lower Takeda City 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.619
 I will fail those people that fit 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:22.129
 Well wash the place hard work by all means necessary necessary processing 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.349
 I think I want 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.960
 It will be another four months to extend the instructions to another 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.950
 I want you to show more excitement in public opinion
