00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello dear friends especially 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.670
 who loves horror 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.519
 and today we have a review game under 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.620
 called mental hospital 2 and so 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.900
 here are the first options here you are 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 can customize the graphics or choose 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 low either high or ultra 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.930
 settings well, in general, it's all by 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 standard so go to mode 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.279
 investigations accordingly and that she 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.369
 what it is of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.880
 yourself 8 chapters that you need 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.880
 go to impose a whole bunch of bricks yourself 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 in the pants and actually let's start with 4 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 where I have stayed here already 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.570
 much worse than at first but 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 initial mission no less scary 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.120
 Probably the same except 1 body mission 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.700
 absolutely not terrible but only teach you 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.250
 management and coordination in this game and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.129
 so we hit some abandoned 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.039
 mental hospital where lives 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.550
 a whole cloud of incomprehensible creatures here 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.219
 eg 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.949
 one of them is standing there also 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.760
 periodically occur various 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.409
 hallucinations with us at us that's how it is now 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.689
 blurs the screen either 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.689
 go any shadows cast 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.790
 incomprehensible zombies and monsters and so 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.890
 periodically here on every mission us 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.700
 come across notes in which to us 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.860
 agree on some plot that we 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.979
 should help find lieutenant sidorova 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.810
 the main mission here is to find it 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.509
 some sidorova who got here and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.000
 gone and so we need to find 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.329
 him and solve all the puzzles swarm mother 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.909
 some dude went there but hopefully he 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.130
 won't touch us by the way here 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 so many dark places where you will be 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.619
 see almost nothing but good 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.259
 for this you have a video camera which 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.350
 you can activate it here 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.060
 there is a shooting mode in the dark that is you in 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.710
 darkness using this camcorder 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.969
 you can see well enough and cool 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.069
 there was some kind of music 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.409
 dudes come in very scary very 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.810
 scary especially if playing this game 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.030
 in headphones because sometimes here 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.180
 completely unexpectedly published some 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.370
 very scary sounds rattle or climbs 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.709
 some strange creatures that 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.720
 easy or write here in this 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.629
 Polyclinic conducted some 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.739
 studies conducted by people 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.260
 testing some drugs 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.410
 which made people just some 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.629
 freaks in both moral and physical 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.180
 sense and so here I think now 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.280
 will be quite dark and as you see 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.220
 we see nothing here and so we 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.799
 have to turn on the video camera my goodness 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.720
 there are some freaks here but we are calm 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.610
 let's go around they won't touch us 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.360
 but there are completely different creatures 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.670
 who just want to do with you 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.519
 so it is you to eat and did not even worry 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.150
 swallow them need to beware and what 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.700
 what else would you like to say well that's 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.049
 all black ghost caught me 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:11.280
 and we turned out to be as pleasant as 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:14.090
 arms and legs to to to to to to 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.319
 called to the table and eat us or 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.109
 turn into the same awful feeling 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.739
 which actually ate us 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:26.220
 take into account the fact that charging the world is ultimate 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.440
 ends but he charge I don't know 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.660
 what they have for the camera is possible on android 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.690
 She is very fast charging for example 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.489
 see there will be no notes now 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.840
 read just want to show you how 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.359
 the battery is fast 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.060
 but she has such an important piece in 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.980
 differences from android battery devices 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.739
 if we turn off the camera itself 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.700
 charge and replenish ie goal 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.889
 here is a chip 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.200
 the camera is that the battery has 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.970
 limited amount of time rather 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.340
 so here's what a limited charge 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.220
 because I don't know where she could be 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.060
 to be charged but in general, such is 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.310
 trick so if you have a weak 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.220
 from battery somewhere deep into darkness i 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.840
 I would not advise you to go great indie 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.880
 horror from the game developer light and 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.060
 madness and many many others 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.260
 indie horror 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.709
 therefore we are afraid and we postpone 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.709
 bricks
