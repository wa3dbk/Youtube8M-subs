because<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> screen<00:01:49.140> like

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
because when you get to a screen like

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.660 
because when you get to a screen like
this<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.100> type<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.520> information

this and you have to type in information
it<00:01:51.600> was<00:01:51.750> kind<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.470> difficult<00:01:52.710> from

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it was kind of a little difficult from

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.710 
it was kind of a little difficult from
other<00:01:53.220> TVs<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.670> had<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> do<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
other TVs we had to do it on the the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.109 
other TVs we had to do it on the the
remote<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.590> offering<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.159> keyboard<00:01:56.969> makes

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
remote so offering this keyboard makes

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.630 
remote so offering this keyboard makes
it<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> lot<00:01:57.420> easier<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:58.310> now<00:01:59.310> when<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.549> have

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
it a lot easier to use now when you have

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
it a lot easier to use now when you have
the<00:01:59.790> keyboard<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.689> easy<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> use<00:02:01.259> but

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the keyboard it's really easy to use but

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.770 
the keyboard it's really easy to use but
I<00:02:01.829> will<00:02:02.070> admit<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
I will admit there is a kind of a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.910 
I will admit there is a kind of a
learning<00:02:03.930> curve<00:02:04.290> when<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.469> comes<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
learning curve when it comes to this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
learning curve when it comes to this
because<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.909> keys<00:02:06.090> themselves<00:02:06.659> weren't

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
because the keys themselves weren't

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.639 
because the keys themselves weren't
entirely<00:02:07.140> responsive<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
entirely responsive and

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.020 
entirely responsive and
to<00:02:08.739> use<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.099> number<00:02:09.340> pad<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.640> actually<00:02:09.909> have

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
to use the number pad you actually have

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.850 
to use the number pad you actually have
to<00:02:10.149> hit<00:02:10.269> a<00:02:10.329> separate<00:02:10.780> button<00:02:11.049> that's<00:02:11.620> going<00:02:11.799> to

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
to hit a separate button that's going to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.850 
to hit a separate button that's going to
turn<00:02:12.040> on<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.610> turn<00:02:12.760> off<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.319> sensor<00:02:14.680> that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
turn on and turn off the the sensor that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.199 
turn on and turn off the the sensor that
you'll<00:02:15.010> be<00:02:15.099> able<00:02:15.189> to<00:02:15.310> control<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> mouse<00:02:15.879> and

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
you'll be able to control the mouse and

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.539 
you'll be able to control the mouse and
in<00:02:16.659> doing<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:16.959> turning<00:02:17.829> on<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.010> turning<00:02:18.040> off<00:02:18.280> I

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
in doing so turning on and turning off I

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.059 
in doing so turning on and turning off I
kind<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> lost<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.450> mouse<00:02:19.659> a<00:02:19.689> few<00:02:20.019> times<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.829> it

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
kind of lost the mouse a few times so it

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.979 
kind of lost the mouse a few times so it
was<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.310> maybe<00:02:22.150> there's<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.480> learning<00:02:22.629> curve<00:02:22.810> to

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
was a maybe there's a learning curve to

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.949 
was a maybe there's a learning curve to
it<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:23.409> it<00:02:23.470> was<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> little<00:02:23.769> difficult<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> use

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
it but it was a little difficult to use

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.240 
it but it was a little difficult to use
another<00:02:25.959> negative<00:02:26.409> for<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.620> TV<00:02:26.890> was<00:02:27.069> that

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
another negative for the TV was that

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.220 
another negative for the TV was that
when<00:02:27.370> working<00:02:27.579> between<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:28.060> menus<00:02:28.420> or<00:02:28.599> trying

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
bit of a lag time you're not sure if you

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.890

that is one thing that I did notice

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.710 
that is one thing that I did notice
there<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.849> bit<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.180> lag<00:02:52.329> time<00:02:52.359> between
