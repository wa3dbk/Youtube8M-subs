00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 and Sasha in the championship a lot of games we 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.860
 pulled out at the last minute and here 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.049
 it turned out that they lost on 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.129
 last minute 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.500
 how to explain it 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.189
 but I don’t know first I think it’s 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.660
 coincidence for us 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.509
 negative which have developed therefore 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.810
 I cannot say something else right away 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.230
 think why it all turned out well it 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.910
 is it unpleasant to say that all the same 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.390
 there was relaxation in the last 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.430
 minutes when comfortable advantage 20 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.750
 honestly already believed in victory in victory 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.530
 believed before I do not deny it 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.420
 but I have question 2 well, at least I don’t know in our 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.050
 relaxed and i can't say that we 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.969
 played straight at all 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.829
 without how to say very much 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.070
 relaxed i think i think that 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.629
 the team that scored let them they 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 probably all the same and believed to the end in 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.420
 victory and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.330
 at least the fact that they are equal to them 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 it turned out we again , these goals goals 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.530
 who flew to us 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 unusual they always work out then 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.640
 when you accidentally appetite accident 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.150
 not in our favor 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 get that all of you today unexpectedly 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.340
 for many and possible for myself came out in 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.900
 center forward position when i 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.910
 last time was such an experience as far as 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.630
 were you ready for this did you know in advance what 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.460
 may end in advance did not know how 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.930
 say not that I would be surprised but I 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.910
 I understood that I would probably go to that position 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 several barriers because earring 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.810
 I want to fire up 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.259
 he has been a striker for years 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.220
 I went out did my job so 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.800
 to tell 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.610
 pleased with his appearance 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.440
 there of course judging because you came out and 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.220
 Immediately almost the first touch scored in 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.200
 Basically playing you was there comfort 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.610
 comfortable where care is my game 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.080
 anyway she she finds how to say 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.090
 get closer to the gate to attack all 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.819
 sleep time is aimed at attacking 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.739
 to score a goal so he say i don't 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.510
 basically my position is lost 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.170
 maybe a little bit pulling them 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.030
 winger now on the locker room 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.269
 hot pursuit did not discuss anything we 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.159
 disassembled no no all up was pretty 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.120
 so calm so I think what else 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.120
 let's get together and talk
