00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.780
 Kedomo I think would like to do a little more of the fighting in the fact that love 

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:12.850
 First of all, please negotiate basically basically high places are strong after all 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:18.760
 I than overlooking this Well doing this from a high place 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:21.340
 When the person who was the m is divided into individual clear from the way in the search operation is easy, for example, this tongue 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.690
 I would do if Well not see what the here and here light 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:30.610
 In Well, here is this I is not go and maybe the enemy does not see it full Well I think Oran 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:32.840
 Really you own someday the field of vision to annoying it a little I went saying to say 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.430
 It's all right, as the field of vision can not catch up 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.660
 It is better to have you take a high place that you can see at a glance all at once 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.710
 High place 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:47.300
 Riding on top please because because I would ride on a variety of favorite Yaro Ness on everyone taking 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:52.700
 A pot but when the genital area is the basic shoot stopped when the bf in please 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:57.590
 Even if you hit it while it's worth it, that's because it has a fairly high shot-up rate 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:01.460
 I know if I hit like this I am different from bf Cotto character 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.530
 There are many places to hit because the sound figure of is so big 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:11.549
 So beat it because now we can defeat Ndeee 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.520
 The effect is being done while moving to the left and right as far as possible so that the enemy bullets do not hit properly. 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:20.040
 Hitting while doing this to shift the aim 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.659
 Toka or hit while moving this while jumping in the serve and or hit while jumping 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.719
 a 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:30.710
 Do you jump and sell and get on ? 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:34.549
 It is important that say as much as possible shifting the aim of the enemy in the Well of the various forms of a Uchikata 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:39.740
 Just make sure you hit the first level 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.240
 Almost 99 9% wins you so true to the cot university off tofu like a was the first stage I mean 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.270
 There is a place like a game 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.600
 So I definitely want to hit the first row 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:52.900
 I 'm going to hit it already If I do it I think it's okay if this is done 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.270
 I wonder if the other Wow and If yours is one encounter to the enemy unexpected 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.729
 I know whether it is better to move the left or right, but I think this is about middle class, maybe the way 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.869
 I do not move much anymore 0 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.070
 I think all right not move so much because that sort of also give up because they give up anymore I 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.380
 In a 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.150
 This to in 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.630
 Cold sound Tteyuu fence of sound and suppressor Tteyuu intends Tropsch from home course angle and I split 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:22.230
 Really since the footsteps be heard and divided by I'm hear 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.230
 Please listen to it in footsteps will be important that the Tteyuu power to hear 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.540
 It is such a feeling It sounds like a strange sound like this and walks a little while while footsteps and burning 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.870
 Also a little bit After doing this I 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:47.280
 It becomes difficult to hear footsteps, but this team is probably used for such search 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.780
 You may not use it at a quick pace . 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.630
 Most people do something like this, and people who enjoy themselves are now feeling 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.810
 But if you do it a little more quickly 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.880
 Sliding is a jump jump 5 minutes tool 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.310
 This is also early, yes 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:10.310
 It's too early, so I want to move quickly 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.060
 Econo aw in please try the wind is there is a technique that I boost slab Tteyuu 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.540
 It is 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.799
 a 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.129
 When I 'm jumping something, I get shocked with this round button 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.210
 If you apply this, you can cut the boost slam 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:23.880
 Well because 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:29.980
 Toka above manner in tomorrow to do this 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.819
 Well it is faster to boost Slab kill than kill at the right end right now 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.749
 Just but please remember also that sort of 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.069
 If you have this toothbuffer, use a boost slam to fight at a basic assault distance 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:42.540
 There is almost no scene 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.629
 The people who got in from bf want you to be especially careful, but this is not the case of money policy 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.799
 Please put the song that brings out life to the thorough Honda 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:52.810
 If it is that bf, close-up lecture is not so strong or it takes time. 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:56.650
 Hit in the Toka star who basically something Tsu bar 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.010

 Please, Netsuke the song you put out this and without Tsukasa sound 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:09.069
 It's time to take an umbrella obstacle to such a wall so that I don't really run too much 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.689
 I really want to go this way 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.560
 To the probability that the encounter lose to know is very high really really because this first stage hit game 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.940
 First stage 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.889
 So if you're like this one 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:26.830
 Horse how or say doing this I guess and we do this 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:31.120
 Please, go really while cocoa glial ring from doing it or code 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.870
 And in that way if I do not know but the enemy is good if seen it 's such a not absolute 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.909
 Please give me 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.120
 In wait at wide I doing this when I become one Uchiai called the phased rear enemy coming 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.780

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:47.240
 For example , hiding in such shadows 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:49.250
 If it is hidden here in the place of weeds, which are written here as weeds, it may be 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:56.419
 Such feeling as possible 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:05:00.230
 When it's nice to be found, let 's make a few beads rack &amp; reduce your hit area 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.770

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:14.099
 In many places to ride a real bitter maintain Mr. Tsu's I mean is it a surprise attack from various Toko

 Here also because there are fellows that are blind or to see what what I doing this really that 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.040
 There is a time when there is something like hide-and-seek games, but it is also normal 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.689
 Because I want to enjoy too much 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.160
 I think that it is all right 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:47.160
 In Nee prima facie

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:07.150
 I think there are a lot of people who really do this and people who are really called Gachi 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:10.480
 Jump Singling Aim Light 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.750
