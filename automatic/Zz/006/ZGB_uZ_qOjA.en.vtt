00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
by the ropes because he really was

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.200 
by the ropes because he really was
bouncing<00:00:54.680> off<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:54.890> them<00:00:55.280> coming<00:00:55.820> into<00:00:56.120> the

when<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:03.140> do<00:01:03.320> that<00:01:03.530> then<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:04.250> get<00:01:04.550> caught<00:01:04.759> or

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
when you do that then you get caught or

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.940 
when you do that then you get caught or
something<00:01:05.180> stupid<00:01:05.660> so<00:01:06.259> that's<00:01:06.530> why<00:01:06.680> they<00:01:06.800> want

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
something stupid so that's why they want

to<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.310> didn't<00:01:07.610> go<00:01:07.729> in<00:01:07.910> for<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.119> kill<00:01:08.330> because<00:01:08.479> I

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
to I didn't go in for the kill because I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.530 
to I didn't go in for the kill because I
was<00:01:08.810> worried<00:01:09.680> about<00:01:09.920> himself<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.760> his<00:01:11.000> power

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
was worried about himself and his power

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.789 
was worried about himself and his power
because<00:01:11.810> he<00:01:11.840> didn't<00:01:12.170> have<00:01:12.200> some<00:01:12.439> power<00:01:12.619> here

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
because he didn't have some power here

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.620 
because he didn't have some power here
