gotta have straight lines as you got a
half<00:00:24.630> straight<00:00:24.900> line<00:00:25.080> axis<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.619> does<00:00:25.800> that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
half straight line axis what does that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.970 
half straight line axis what does that
really<00:00:26.130> mean<00:00:26.630> well<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.830> this

you<00:00:38.430> look<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> root<00:00:39.000> canal<00:00:39.329> anatomy<00:00:39.809> you

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you look at the root canal anatomy you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
you look at the root canal anatomy you
always<00:00:40.260> find<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.100> bulge<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.760> dentin

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
always find this little bulge of dentin

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.319 
always find this little bulge of dentin
goes<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.899> little<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:44.070> much<00:00:44.460> dent<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.059> here

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
goes this little this much dent in here

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
goes this little this much dent in here
on<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.899> off<00:00:46.200> mainly<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> lingual

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
on top off mainly it's the lingual

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
on top off mainly it's the lingual
canals<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.170> teeth<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> medial

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
canals on all teeth and the medial

canals on all teeth and the medial
portion<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.770> canals<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.579> this

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
portion of the canals will have this

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.939 
portion of the canals will have this
bulge<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.329> thinking<00:00:54.690> its<00:00:54.930> natural<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.590> it's

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
bulge of thinking its natural it's it's

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
bulge of thinking its natural it's it's
one<00:00:56.190> ball<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.120> being<00:00:57.270> formed<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
one ball that which is being formed so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
one ball that which is being formed so
if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.520> much<00:00:59.879> dentin<00:01:01.160> blocking

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
if you have this much dentin blocking

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
if you have this much dentin blocking
you<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.430> having<00:01:03.180> preventing<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.170> from

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
having a straight line to the canal

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.910 
having a straight line to the canal
there'll<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:09.060> more<00:01:09.600> stress<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.560> your

struggling with Athenian shape the ice

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.289 
struggling with Athenian shape the ice
stopped<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.070> maybe<00:02:02.490> improve<00:02:02.820> my

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
accessibility maybe I haven't removed

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.969 
accessibility maybe I haven't removed
enough<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:06.930> bulge<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> today
