00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.030
 if you get me two you ago 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.889
 asked of you is again on the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.089
 want to film nokia voice for android 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.100
 I hear you declared crazy 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.800
 today that day has come 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.880
 next to city mark of the pureview club that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.490
 could 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.340
 mark has one and my blog where you 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 also writes about the pureview camera 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.720
 devices from Nokia and you have it here 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.910
 also present and you help us a bit 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 with the story role nokia because a whole 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.989
 in short what exactly is the story 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.170
 currently around nokia 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.030
 well in short yes it is actually one 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 unexpected step although it leaked 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.789
 was of course but it is one 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.910
 unexpected it is still following the year 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.230
 the total commitment for microsoft 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.629
 now comes with a new line appliances 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 which is based on android that is for 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.879
 for some people that is very bad 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.559
 surprising and and very special and me 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.000
 think it's a separate must say because 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.350
 that underlies what they want 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.240
 there you can do a thousand things or say it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.560
 it is honestly not me 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.610
 completely clear why they are this way 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.470
 I choose the idea that the whole 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.600
 cheaper device line from nokia and 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.980
 the entry models of van lume for 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 windows phone 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.130
 that he is on the big gap between blacks 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.600
 that you just say that very cheap 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.740
 they could serve them 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.260
 they now also have 220 in every year 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.480
 that launched the device and costs 29 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.920
 euros that he can do it more on the internet 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.050
 we have those that shade reasonably 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.080
 is also known in the Netherlands 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.750
 that went up to yes a euro or 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.850
 or costas year nowadays 120 just like that 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.620
 there is still a big hole in it 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.540
 they couldn't get any closer with luja 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.130
 telephones yes so i guess they just 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.600
 now try to be a swimmer 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.100
 that hole in March also lubricate close 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.479
 like with android you have on everyone 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.890
 price point 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.869
 you just got off the phone but not out 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.660
 from 40 euros to 800 euros 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.729
 You can go either way and I think you 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.020
 now trying to get what they are 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.250
 could not yet operate in this way 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.810
 to serve 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.270
 it is the dry land and a second 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.910
 rumor or or a statement or 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.179
 strategy that goes around is that they are with 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.070
 these devices people say knowledge 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.780
 wants to make make addict make 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.650
 to the My Castle services as it is 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.689
 Of course the time and no nuts 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.340
 the play store on it is all 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.290
 centered around the marx or services 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.239
 and then when people switch 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.319
 than to more expensive ones than to lumia 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.450
 to go 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.980
 yes that's right I think even with the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.459
 presentation yesterday he has no loop 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.530
 from 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.329
 boss of nokia very emphatically said 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.010
 that they have nothing to do with the 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.870
 google services 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.549
 but very emphatically to onedrive we 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.769
 go for your cloud storage and derge 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.730
 corpse so I find that is clear 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.859
 they could not still have 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.269
 to microsoft and you via android 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.420
 want to try looking it is also see 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:52.560
 the device that looks very much like 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:54.150
 windows phone and I think it's with the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.709
 thought behind that is okay if you 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.940
 once 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.680
 are used to this but you still want it 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.980
 slightly more options yours 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.540
 you can also use the smartphone 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.680
 want to make the transfer to a spring roll anyway 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.599
 and finally say yet 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.180
 ultimately a real yes 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.230
 the appearance is really all windows 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.909
 phone 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.200
 well not entirely but with that 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.760
 say tiles but it seems there 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.409
 also incredibly what we have 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.409
 have Nokia heartwood through the difference 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.669
 well what is the difference between one 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.410
 totally different operating system 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:29.040
 the marketplace is different have one 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.440
 own store they have some android 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.250
 store strip also say the de 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.290
 great 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.609
 google marketplace too what's his name 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.569
 again the google play store 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.599
 the play store you that no junior no so 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.919
 it's it looks like on android that looks like 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.870
 on windows phone it is really yes one 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.990
 new on week system more interesting 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.600
 is on 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.040
 a few years ago a club ex 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.900
 Nokia employees feel independent 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.810
 made from nokia who started his jola 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.470
 and jola has selfies as even own on 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.420
 Register 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.460
 but because they don't have any apps for it 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.120
 have little or applications they have 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.010
 Android taken as market and the crazy 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.840
 that Jonah is now the same 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.460
 markets used low to say it differently 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.550
 that Nokia now uses the same markets 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.260
 as a youngster initially did 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.940
 so what what what what it says 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.320
 basis of 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.540
 that young one did that to clean 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.280
 applications and I think that in a way 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.200
 The same goes for Nokia now that they are 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.220
 start with that new platform that it 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.220
 the switch from van 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.760
 no windows smear but still those 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.220
 can offer services 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.140
 and yet applications have enough yes me 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.700
 find it a special stop back 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.410
 the devices and then goes 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.860
 finally because we have the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.740
 the nokia ex and also your excel two 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.600
 different devices have very fast 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.160
 difference between the train you have there 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.160
 even three here then your ex and on you 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.770
 ex plus with a box excel 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.050
 and that is primarily a matter of nokia 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.910
 and log your ex still your ex plus comes to them 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.040
 more memory and expandable memory 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.530
 The excel is just knowing respect great 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.060
 display is actually a better camera 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.380
 this for a price point of like belief 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.150
 109 euros 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.830
 we are not about anything at all 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.730
 The most interesting feature I think now 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.520
 in the Netherlands they will probably 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.720
 not going to see that not said 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.160
 for the time being it is not first 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.330
 Immersion market as still in them 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.550
 likes to call 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.320
 so yes the the market that still has to serve 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.570
 for Alzheimer's the next billion 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.800
 callers and the next messi next 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.150
 billion that needs to become mobile 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.530
 plugged in 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.540
 but whether it never comes to the Netherlands 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.570
 not said 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.430
 finally the part between microsoft and 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.990
 nokia who is not around yet but me 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.860
 will is not affected by nuts 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.510
 to say of 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.610
 stop because it is android want 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.870
 we don't think how big do you think it is 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.680
 that will happen when the deal is around 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.090
 is that this is being taken off the market 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.620
 new 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.450
 I think this is a very smart way 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.230
 is to people well windows phone 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.220
 to get 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.220
 mark thank you very much done
