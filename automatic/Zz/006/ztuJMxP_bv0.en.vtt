her house because to get a stronger

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.510 
her house because to get a stronger
signal<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.590> was<00:03:15.680> going<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.860> cost<00:03:16.010> thousands<00:03:16.490> of

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
signal it was going to cost thousands of

signal it was going to cost thousands of
dollars<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.210> just<00:03:17.450> realized<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:17.930> this

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
dollars and so I just realized that this

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.840 
dollars and so I just realized that this
isn't<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:18.770> worth<00:03:18.980> seeing<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.310> girl<00:03:19.580> nude

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
isn't really worth seeing this girl nude

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.150 
isn't really worth seeing this girl nude
and<00:03:20.150> then<00:03:20.930> she<00:03:21.200> put<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> restraining<00:03:21.770> order<00:03:21.890> on

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
and then she put a restraining order on

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.310 
and then she put a restraining order on
me<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:23.480> didn't<00:03:23.690> really<00:03:23.780> understand<00:03:24.230> that

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
me and I didn't really understand that

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.130 
me and I didn't really understand that
because<00:03:24.770> what's<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.850> big<00:03:26.000> deal<00:03:26.240> with
