the<00:00:29.130> two<00:00:29.310> projects<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.320> this<00:00:31.460> we<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.640> assemble

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the two projects is this we can assemble

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
the two projects is this we can assemble
this<00:00:33.329> right<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> box<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.890> it's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
this right out of the box because it's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
this right out of the box because it's

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
going to get painted I don't have to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220 
going to get painted I don't have to
worry<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:37.940> glue<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> put<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
worry about glue when I put it in this

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.069 
worry about glue when I put it in this
area<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.879> gets<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> outside<00:00:42.450> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
area here if it gets on the outside of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.010 
area here if it gets on the outside of
the<00:00:43.200> hole<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.340> issue<00:00:44.629> because<00:00:45.629> it's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the hole it's no issue because it's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.619 
the hole it's no issue because it's
going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.410> painted<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.300> stain

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
going to get painted with the stain

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.310 
going to get painted with the stain
rocker<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:50.070> particular<00:00:50.730> piece<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.329> had<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
rocker this particular piece I had to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
rocker this particular piece I had to
make<00:00:52.500> sure<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.309> areas<00:00:53.789> were<00:00:54.000> taped<00:00:54.360> off

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
make sure that the areas were taped off

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
make sure that the areas were taped off
so<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.410> stain<00:00:55.710> wouldn't<00:00:56.129> interfere

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so that the stain wouldn't interfere

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.689 
so that the stain wouldn't interfere
with<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> glue<00:00:57.480> adhesion<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.219> left<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
with the glue adhesion and I left it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.939 
with the glue adhesion and I left it
unassembled<00:01:00.300> until<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.289> stained<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
unassembled until it was stained and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.640 
unassembled until it was stained and
then<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.730> assemble<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> after<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.290> finish

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
then I assemble it after that to finish

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.710 
then I assemble it after that to finish
it<00:01:04.830> big<00:01:05.519> difference<00:01:05.939> between<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.570> way<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it big difference between the way you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.160 
it big difference between the way you
approach<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.119> sand<00:01:09.630> all<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
approach these two you do sand all the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.429 
approach these two you do sand all the
parts<00:01:11.299> before<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.930> put<00:01:13.170> them<00:01:13.229> together

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
parts before you put them together

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.820 
parts before you put them together
that's<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.790> common<00:01:15.600> sense<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that's just really common sense it's so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
that's just really common sense it's so
much<00:01:17.009> easier<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.490> sand<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.390> they're

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
much easier to sand these when they're

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
much easier to sand these when they're
flat<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.229> they're<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:20.220> all<00:01:20.490> put<00:01:20.909> together

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
flat and they're not all put together

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.840 
flat and they're not all put together
and<00:01:21.600> difficult<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> reach<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.100> they<00:01:23.310> did<00:01:23.549> both

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and difficult to reach so they did both

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.070 
and difficult to reach so they did both
get<00:01:24.180> sanded<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:27.030> instructions<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.840> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
get sanded so the instructions on this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.350 
get sanded so the instructions on this
are<00:01:28.290> pretty<00:01:28.790> straightforward<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.820> put<00:01:30.150> some

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
are pretty straightforward you put some

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.060 
are pretty straightforward you put some
glue<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.869> hole<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> start<00:01:31.860> building

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
glue in the hole and you start building

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.460 
glue in the hole and you start building
this<00:01:32.430> rocker<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.450> that's<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.170> gonna<00:01:34.320> do

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
this rocker so that's what I'm gonna do

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
this rocker so that's what I'm gonna do
begin<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.680> 120<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.729> finishing<00:01:39.180> block

begin with 120 on the finishing block

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.859 
begin with 120 on the finishing block
and<00:01:39.750> sand<00:01:40.229> every<00:01:40.799> flat<00:01:41.070> surface<00:01:41.640> work<00:01:42.570> from

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
120 to 150 to 180 it is tempting to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.550 
120 to 150 to 180 it is tempting to

let's<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.359> do<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> quick<00:03:12.870> primer<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.500> how<00:03:13.709> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
let's just do a quick primer on how to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.690 
let's just do a quick primer on how to
correctly<00:03:15.060> spray<00:03:15.720> with<00:03:16.019> an<00:03:16.170> aerosol<00:03:16.700> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
correctly spray with an aerosol you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.870 
correctly spray with an aerosol you
might<00:03:17.910> also<00:03:18.209> want<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.900> think<00:03:18.959> about<00:03:19.880> investing

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
might also want to think about investing

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.180 
might also want to think about investing
in<00:03:21.030> one<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.359> these<00:03:21.480> nifty<00:03:21.840> little<00:03:22.169> can<00:03:22.560> handles

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
in one of these nifty little can handles

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.259 
in one of these nifty little can handles
it<00:03:23.579> makes<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.840> spray<00:03:25.230> can<00:03:25.620> more<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.669> spray

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
it makes the spray can more like a spray

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.150 
it makes the spray can more like a spray
gun<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:28.230> also<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.129> relieves<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:30.000> vent

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
gun and also it relieves that vent

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.280 
gun and also it relieves that vent
frozen<00:03:32.160> finger<00:03:32.639> from<00:03:33.120> what<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> call<00:03:33.780> spray<00:03:34.109> gun

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
frozen finger from what I call spray gun

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.869 
frozen finger from what I call spray gun
finger<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.970> clip<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.329> on<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:37.280> now<00:03:38.280> you've<00:03:38.669> got

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
finger you clip it on and now you've got

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.589 
finger you clip it on and now you've got
a<00:03:38.910> trigger<00:03:39.500> rather<00:03:40.500> than<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> finger<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:41.819> this

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
a trigger rather than a finger and this

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.009 
a trigger rather than a finger and this
creates<00:03:43.079> much<00:03:43.530> less<00:03:43.919> fatigue<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.750> other

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
creates much less fatigue the other

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.559 
creates much less fatigue the other
really<00:03:46.590> important<00:03:47.310> thing<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.910> never<00:03:48.299> forget

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
really important thing to never forget

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.759 
really important thing to never forget
when<00:03:49.440> you're<00:03:49.590> spraying<00:03:49.949> is<00:03:50.599> light<00:03:51.769> multiple

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
when you're spraying is light multiple

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.710 
when you're spraying is light multiple
coats<00:03:53.569> do<00:03:54.569> about<00:03:54.870> 12<00:03:55.349> inches<00:03:55.769> away<00:03:56.329> don't<00:03:57.329> try

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
coats do about 12 inches away don't try

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.479 
coats do about 12 inches away don't try
to<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:58.079> too<00:03:58.109> close<00:03:58.620> because<00:03:58.980> that's<00:03:59.220> when

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
to be too close because that's when

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.150 
to be too close because that's when
drips<00:03:59.819> happen<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:01.349> want<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.709> just<00:04:01.889> keep

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
drips happen and you want to just keep

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.810 
drips happen and you want to just keep
light<00:04:02.970> light<00:04:03.359> passes

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.610 

just<00:04:11.820> like<00:04:12.060> that

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
just like that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.470 
just like that
so<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.800> you're<00:04:13.980> not<00:04:14.160> at<00:04:14.460> any<00:04:14.700> one<00:04:15.000> point<00:04:15.240> in

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.300 
able to get that horrible dripping and
drooling<00:04:21.420> then<00:04:22.350> you're<00:04:22.800> sunk

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
drooling then you're sunk

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.000 
drooling then you're sunk
you<00:04:23.580> have<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.940> stop<00:04:24.240> let<00:04:24.720> it<00:04:24.840> dry<00:04:25.080> sand<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.980> down

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
you have to stop let it dry sand it down

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.380 
you have to stop let it dry sand it down
and<00:04:26.430> then<00:04:26.760> repaint<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:29.040> other<00:04:29.250> thing<00:04:29.610> you
