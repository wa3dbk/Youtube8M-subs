00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
wheat over a network and you'll require

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.450 
wheat over a network and you'll require
a<00:00:15.599> few<00:00:15.990> things<00:00:16.400> you<00:00:17.400> will<00:00:17.609> require<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.390> actual

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
a few things you will require the actual

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.220 
a few things you will require the actual
file<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.180> actual<00:00:21.449> program<00:00:22.140> I'm<00:00:22.740> using<00:00:23.010> Linux

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
file the actual program I'm using Linux

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.849 
file the actual program I'm using Linux
the<00:00:25.230> way<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:26.279> using<00:00:26.550> Linux<00:00:27.560> it<00:00:28.560> should<00:00:28.740> be

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the way I'm using Linux it should be

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
the way I'm using Linux it should be
pretty<00:00:29.220> much<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.580> same<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.689> you're

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
pretty much the same for you if you're

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.200 
pretty much the same for you if you're
using<00:00:30.840> Mac<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:32.399> you're<00:00:32.579> using<00:00:32.700> Windows

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
using Mac and if you're using Windows

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
using Mac and if you're using Windows
this<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> useless<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.260> there's<00:00:34.680> already

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
this is useless because there's already

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.389 
this is useless because there's already
a<00:00:35.280> program<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> GUI<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> for<00:00:36.989> you

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
a program with a GUI to do that for you

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.810 
a program with a GUI to do that for you
so<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:39.270> applies<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> Linux<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.579> Mac<00:00:41.579> I'm

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
so this applies to Linux and Mac I'm

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
so this applies to Linux and Mac I'm
using<00:00:41.850> Ubuntu<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.590> shouldn't

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
using Ubuntu but it really shouldn't

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.760 
using Ubuntu but it really shouldn't
matter<00:00:44.360> which<00:00:45.360> variety<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> Linux<00:00:46.590> you're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
matter which variety of Linux you're

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
matter which variety of Linux you're
using<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.610> done<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
using because this is done in the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
using because this is done in the
terminal<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.440> all<00:00:49.620> pretty<00:00:50.070> much<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
terminal so it's all pretty much the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.599 
terminal so it's all pretty much the
same

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.579 

okay<00:00:53.359> I'll<00:00:53.570> show<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.170> need<00:00:54.320> first

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
okay I'll show you what you need first

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.520 
okay I'll show you what you need first
you<00:00:55.489> need<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.670> download<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.359> file<00:00:59.229> once<00:01:00.229> you

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
you need to download the file once you

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.119 
you need to download the file once you
have<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.920> file<00:01:02.170> you're<00:01:03.170> going<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.710> need<00:01:03.859> to

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
have the file you're going to need to

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.200 
have the file you're going to need to
save<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> folder<00:01:05.360> as<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.990> can<00:01:06.170> see<00:01:06.409> I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
save it to a folder as you can see I

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.480 
save it to a folder as you can see I
saved<00:01:08.210> mine<00:01:08.360> in<00:01:08.509> My<00:01:08.659> Documents<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:10.210> we<00:01:11.210> load

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
saved mine in My Documents and we load

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.160 
saved mine in My Documents and we load
so<00:01:13.490> once<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:13.880> have<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.270> make<00:01:14.840> sure<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.080> get

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
so once you have that make sure you get

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.840 
so once you have that make sure you get
the<00:01:15.289> right<00:01:15.409> one<00:01:15.560> for<00:01:15.590> your<00:01:15.830> OS<00:01:16.159> there's<00:01:16.490> ones

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
the right one for your OS there's ones

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.779 
the right one for your OS there's ones
for<00:01:17.090> Windows<00:01:17.600> Mac<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.350> Linux<00:01:18.380> but<00:01:19.070> don't<00:01:19.640> use

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
for Windows Mac and Linux but don't use

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.870 
for Windows Mac and Linux but don't use
that<00:01:19.820> one<00:01:20.149> for<00:01:20.420> Windows<00:01:20.689> use<00:01:21.580> sendoff<00:01:22.580> because

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
that one for Windows use sendoff because

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.100 
that one for Windows use sendoff because
it's<00:01:23.030> got<00:01:23.149> a<00:01:23.179> GUI<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:23.750> just<00:01:23.929> much<00:01:24.080> easier

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
it's got a GUI and it's just much easier

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.399 
it's got a GUI and it's just much easier
to<00:01:24.530> work<00:01:24.679> with<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.880> anyway<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:27.080> you<00:01:27.110> want<00:01:27.350> to

since they're both UNIX based are case
sensitive<00:02:10.769> by<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.220> way<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.660> once<00:02:12.959> you're<00:02:13.110> in

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
sensitive by the way and once you're in

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.170 
sensitive by the way and once you're in
the<00:02:13.260> folder<00:02:13.620> you're<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.760> want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:14.970> run

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the folder you're going to want to run

this command export we load all caps

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.990 
this command export we load all caps
then<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> want<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.530> equals<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.610> think<00:02:23.849> this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
then you want to do equals I think this

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.339

I<00:03:44.409> said<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.890> use<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:46.090> send<00:03:46.390> elf<00:03:46.569> GUI<00:03:46.959> it's

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
I said just use the send elf GUI it's

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.869 
I said just use the send elf GUI it's
easier<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.879> it's<00:03:49.859> just<00:03:50.859> easier<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.670> work<00:03:51.819> with

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
easier and it's just easier to work with

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.369 
easier and it's just easier to work with

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
because you don't have to run commands

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.940 
because you don't have to run commands
but<00:03:54.189> anyway<00:03:54.489> that's<00:03:54.970> it<00:03:55.329> for<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.079> tutorial

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.770 
you are so there would be a learning
experience<00:04:08.109> for<00:04:08.560> both<00:04:08.650> of<00:04:08.889> us<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.480> this<00:04:10.480> is

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
experience for both of us and this is
