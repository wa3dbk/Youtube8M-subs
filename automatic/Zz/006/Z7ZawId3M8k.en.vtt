you can see the like cotton in it like

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.050 
you can see the like cotton in it like
like<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.290> same<00:02:30.100> material<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.880> feels

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
like this so it's same material it feels

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.809 
like this so it's same material it feels
like<00:02:31.239> probably<00:02:31.600> not<00:02:31.750> similar<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:33.010> it's

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
like probably not similar but it's

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.640 
like probably not similar but it's
obviously<00:02:34.330> cheaper<00:02:34.660> quality<00:02:35.350> as<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.250> see

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
obviously cheaper quality as you can see

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
be embarrassing but yeah so that's

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.270 
be embarrassing but yeah so that's
pretty<00:06:44.920> much<00:06:45.630> what<00:06:46.630> I<00:06:46.750> could<00:06:47.140> see<00:06:47.380> from<00:06:48.100> my

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
pretty much what I could see from my

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.820 
pretty much what I could see from my
observations<00:06:49.210> on<00:06:49.450> how<00:06:49.660> to<00:06:49.720> tell<00:06:50.020> like<00:06:50.500> this<00:06:50.650> is

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
observations on how to tell like this is

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.060 
observations on how to tell like this is
it<00:06:51.010> like<00:06:51.840> Michael<00:06:52.840> Kors<00:06:53.080> didn't<00:06:53.440> tell<00:06:53.620> me<00:06:53.770> this

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
it like Michael Kors didn't tell me this

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.490 
it like Michael Kors didn't tell me this
is<00:06:54.160> how<00:06:54.310> you<00:06:54.370> tell<00:06:54.550> the<00:06:54.580> difference<00:06:54.700> I'm<00:06:55.330> just

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
is how you tell the difference I'm just

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.230 
is how you tell the difference I'm just
the<00:06:56.500> differences<00:06:56.920> I<00:06:57.100> can<00:06:57.340> see<00:06:57.520> from<00:06:57.790> having<00:06:58.120> a

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
the differences I can see from having a

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.630 
the differences I can see from having a
real<00:06:58.480> Michael<00:06:58.870> Kors<00:06:59.110> watch<00:06:59.350> versus<00:07:00.070> a<00:07:00.100> fake

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
real Michael Kors watch versus a fake

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.190 
real Michael Kors watch versus a fake
one<00:07:01.320> it's<00:07:02.430> very<00:07:03.430> hard<00:07:04.180> to<00:07:04.300> tell<00:07:04.510> I<00:07:04.540> was<00:07:04.870> hoping

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
one it's very hard to tell I was hoping

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.530 
one it's very hard to tell I was hoping
there<00:07:05.380> was<00:07:05.440> some<00:07:05.650> type<00:07:05.860> of<00:07:06.180> serial<00:07:07.180> number

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
there was some type of serial number

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.660 
there was some type of serial number
database<00:07:07.780> I<00:07:08.140> could<00:07:08.320> run<00:07:08.470> it<00:07:08.590> through<00:07:08.800> I<00:07:09.220> think

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.670 
database I could run it through I think

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.790 
database I could run it through I think
there<00:07:09.850> is<00:07:10.030> but<00:07:10.360> it's<00:07:10.540> like<00:07:10.660> super<00:07:11.080> expensive<00:07:11.350> I

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
if I didn't have a real one I probably

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.959 
if I didn't have a real one I probably
would<00:07:33.850> not<00:07:34.090> have<00:07:34.150> known<00:07:34.570> that

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:34.969 
would not have known that

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:39.719 
would not have known that
the<00:07:35.179> fake<00:07:35.360> Michael<00:07:35.629> Kors<00:07:36.019> watch<00:07:36.289> so<00:07:37.779> yep

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:39.729 
the fake Michael Kors watch so yep

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:43.059 
the fake Michael Kors watch so yep
well<00:07:41.139> so<00:07:42.139> I<00:07:42.169> couldn't<00:07:42.469> think<00:07:42.529> of<00:07:42.679> anything<00:07:42.889> to

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:43.069 
well so I couldn't think of anything to

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:45.309 
well so I couldn't think of anything to
make<00:07:43.309> a<00:07:43.339> video<00:07:43.819> about<00:07:43.939> because<00:07:44.599> all<00:07:44.839> my<00:07:45.019> videos

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:45.319 
make a video about because all my videos

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.559 
make a video about because all my videos
have<00:07:45.469> been<00:07:45.589> about<00:07:45.860> breast<00:07:46.219> augmentation<00:07:46.539> so<00:07:47.539> I

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:47.569 
have been about breast augmentation so I

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:49.569 
have been about breast augmentation so I
figured<00:07:48.169> this<00:07:48.289> would<00:07:48.439> be<00:07:48.499> a<00:07:48.679> good<00:07:49.099> reason<00:07:49.549> to

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:49.579 
figured this would be a good reason to

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:51.759 
figured this would be a good reason to
make<00:07:49.849> a<00:07:49.879> video<00:07:50.329> on<00:07:50.419> something<00:07:50.869> interesting<00:07:51.649> I

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:51.769 
make a video on something interesting I

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:54.339
