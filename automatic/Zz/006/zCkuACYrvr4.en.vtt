00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
holding that back playing on the 360

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.499 
holding that back playing on the 360
because<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.729> Call<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> Duty<00:01:33.150> ghosts<00:01:33.420> the

persons between those the 360 doesn't

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
persons between those the 360 doesn't
look<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:36.930> bad<00:01:37.229> compared<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> Xbox<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.280> but

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
look that bad compared the Xbox one but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.120 
look that bad compared the Xbox one but
in<00:01:39.060> battlefield<00:01:39.650> battlefields<00:01:40.650> case<00:01:40.799> it's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
in battlefield battlefields case it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.310 
in battlefield battlefields case it's
the<00:01:41.759> complete<00:01:42.030> opposite<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.630> battlefield<00:01:43.110> 4

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the complete opposite just battlefield 4

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.969 
the complete opposite just battlefield 4
on<00:01:43.500> ps4<00:01:43.890> PC<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.000> Xbox<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.320> looks<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
on ps4 PC and Xbox one just looks so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
on ps4 PC and Xbox one just looks so
good<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.240> 316<00:01:48.780> ps3<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.649> just

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
good and on the 316 ps3 it's just

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.499 
good and on the 316 ps3 it's just
honestly<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.210> shouldn't<00:01:51.450> be

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
honestly it's just it shouldn't be

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.300 
honestly it's just it shouldn't be
considered<00:01:51.630> battlefield<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:52.860> poor<00:01:53.130> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
considered battlefield for how poor it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.770 
considered battlefield for how poor it
is<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.640> how<00:01:53.729> bad<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> graphics<00:01:54.420> are<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.600> those
