00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
rubber feet to stop it slipping see some

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.280 
rubber feet to stop it slipping see some
labeling<00:02:30.700> there<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.299> sits<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.260> desk

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
labeling there so that sits on the desk

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.330 
labeling there so that sits on the desk
top<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:34.060> rubber<00:02:34.239> feet<00:02:35.340> don't

stop it entirely from moving but helps

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.899 
stop it entirely from moving but helps
it<00:02:40.090> not<00:02:40.480> slip<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.410> if<00:02:41.829> we<00:02:41.950> bring<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.400> galaxy

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
it not slip and if we bring a galaxy

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.559 
it not slip and if we bring a galaxy
note<00:02:43.120> in<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.170> slides<00:02:45.159> in<00:02:45.459> like<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
note in that just slides in like so and

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.630 
note in that just slides in like so and
there<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.690> see<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.230> sat<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.459> desk

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
there you can see it sat in the desk

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.710 
there you can see it sat in the desk
duck<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.620> side<00:02:53.980> profile<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:55.420> get<00:02:55.599> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
duck there is side profile you get the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.170 
duck there is side profile you get the
idea<00:02:56.109> that<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:56.920> at<00:02:57.099> a<00:02:57.220> better<00:02:57.400> viewing<00:02:57.760> angle

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
idea that then at a better viewing angle

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.770 
idea that then at a better viewing angle
on<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> desktop<00:02:59.879> so<00:03:00.879> that's<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> important

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
on a desktop so that's the important

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.099 
on a desktop so that's the important
mode<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.160> sit<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.609> in<00:03:03.819> landscape<00:03:04.510> mode<00:03:04.540> if

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
mode you can sit it in landscape mode if

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.470 
mode you can sit it in landscape mode if
you<00:03:05.319> wish<00:03:05.739> as<00:03:06.220> well<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:07.150> if<00:03:07.239> you're<00:03:07.359> perhaps

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
you wish as well so if you're perhaps

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.650 
you wish as well so if you're perhaps
viewing<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.170> movie<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.209> Samson<00:03:10.209> don't<00:03:10.450> quite<00:03:10.629> a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
viewing a movie and Samson don't quite a

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.509 
viewing a movie and Samson don't quite a
nice<00:03:10.870> job<00:03:10.900> of<00:03:11.230> designing<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.980> because<00:03:12.220> even

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
nice job of designing this because even

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.729 
nice job of designing this because even
when<00:03:12.700> in<00:03:13.359> landscape<00:03:13.989> mode<00:03:14.019> you've<00:03:14.410> still<00:03:14.620> got

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
when in landscape mode you've still got

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.699 
when in landscape mode you've still got
access<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.690> ports<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.109> what<00:03:17.290> have<00:03:17.500> you

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
access to the ports and what have you

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.659 
access to the ports and what have you
what<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.250> don't<00:03:18.519> get<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.630> rubber<00:03:20.079> feet

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
what you don't get is the rubber feet

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.390 
what you don't get is the rubber feet
but<00:03:21.669> you've<00:03:22.599> got<00:03:22.840> good<00:03:23.650> amount<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.040> support

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
but you've got good amount of support

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.650 
but you've got good amount of support
there<00:03:24.609> so<00:03:24.819> it's<00:03:24.940> not<00:03:25.030> really<00:03:25.269> going<00:03:25.299> to<00:03:25.419> move

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
there so it's not really going to move

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.680 
there so it's not really going to move
about<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.950> then<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.910> could<00:03:28.060> actually<00:03:28.239> do<00:03:28.569> it

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
about and then you could actually do it

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.379 
about and then you could actually do it
that<00:03:29.260> way<00:03:29.470> as<00:03:29.739> well<00:03:30.160> so<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.579> quite<00:03:30.790> versatile

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
that way as well so it's quite versatile

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.470 
that way as well so it's quite versatile
in<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.870> respect<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:33.099> that<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.880> official

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
in that respect so that is the official

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.900 
in that respect so that is the official
