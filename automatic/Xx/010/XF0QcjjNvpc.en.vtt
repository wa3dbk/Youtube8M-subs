00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
if what you all would have one you would
have<00:01:33.180> leapfrogged<00:01:33.420> Ottawa<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.189> think

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
have leapfrogged Ottawa this way I think

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
have leapfrogged Ottawa this way I think
Toronto's<00:01:36.270> ahead<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.720> ottawa<00:01:37.079> now<00:01:37.110> because

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
Toronto's ahead of ottawa now because

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.550 
Toronto's ahead of ottawa now because
they<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.549> wins<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.329> don't<00:01:40.200> know<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
they have more wins I don't know how it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.840 
they have more wins I don't know how it
works<00:01:40.710> exactly<00:01:41.009> have<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.579> look<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
works exactly have to look at the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.060 
works exactly have to look at the
standings<00:01:42.180> again<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:43.770> but

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
standings again so the one up but

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.219 
standings again so the one up but
needless<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.820> say<00:01:45.000> Ottawa<00:01:45.390> might<00:01:45.689> drop<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
needless to say Ottawa might drop the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.090 
needless to say Ottawa might drop the
fifth<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.770> Montreal<00:01:47.670> drops<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.210> sixth<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
fifth now Montreal drops to sixth and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.260 
fifth now Montreal drops to sixth and
that'll<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> Eastern

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
that'll be that for the Eastern

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.389
