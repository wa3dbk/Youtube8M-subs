00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.899
 what do you think is bad 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.529

 he is fast and even 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.260
 time the muscles need 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.049
 all lost they first little 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.099
 oath then they will cease then they 

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:55.709
 will walk then they will dictate 

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:57.110
 anonymity central bankers 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.489
 so is the right hand 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.579
 try to put an akor no matter what 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.760

 about this and not going to play 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 Now I will try to play 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 b and still in blood 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.720
 attention experiment 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.270
 since even Vladimir was trying to get him 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 put the district hour 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.329
 I'm for it for you and doing it 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.329
 who would not need to explain from a gun 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.049
 Attention 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.009
 will now be 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.459
 many years ago 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.029
 played my hand 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:20.459
 even a little different start 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 so now amazed 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 Victoria Demyanchuk girls 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.839
 well let's show how i can 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.599
 type and such food 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 and this 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.519
 it was here on the elbow of the year could not those things 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.260
 I need flu 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.249
 accompaniment butane simulators 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:54.489
 theater 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.709
 here it is that the cards need to 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.870
 It was beautiful how much power at first 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.999
 little but we can by set 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.769
 what is the settlement about what should be the most 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.029
 long these too should be but it is not 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:07.049
 necessarily leading year here is the main 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.939
 he is a sin of Navas and himself alone 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.809
 thoughts big load Aktau 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.219
 Nazis for the beauty of this rhythm soyak 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.529
 portray yourself 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.389
 I think we should have been long 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.789
 I wanted to go as a plot, but he, too 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:21.029
 should be the same as u 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.369
 the author if we win 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.519
 and what is the reception of their many courses that 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.859
 in which he hours 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.649
 but the fact that the nbu should always be ready 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.569
 every cattle is the same for everyone 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.259
 another six months experiment Victoria 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:34.419
 people 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.439
 how does she actually play guitar like 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.439
 everyone else was under became 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.259
 Pushkin but not yet given to put 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.139
 I did not speak about this in the first year 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.139
 why even 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.319
 so you try it 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.099
 and immediately memory turned out or not 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.369
 century 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.299
 that's what happens willy nilly 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.379
 these companies for the period then what I 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.789
 she said 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.409
 so can 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.329
 and as a result I take care of my sister 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.579
 didn't sound 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.680
 because the hand is not ready she then 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.250
 will become ductile she will then be obedient 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.470
 at the beginning here is a hand for every beginner 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.470
 guitarist lighthouse right 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.900
 know why 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.509
 In short, if the party is not and who 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.160
 it will be easier to understand forward and in frequency 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.650
 until the end and if the asymmetry on a hundred 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.940
 twenty dmitry on the right and should be 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.940
 country inappropriate square 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.019
 austria smoothly move on to these and others 

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:43.580
 let's say yes 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.280
 I understand what to say to the area 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.870
 position 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.870
 I donâ€™t even talk about it 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.029
 turn on her 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.300
 uefa 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 in fifth gear lnt 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.209
 and also so the field is impossible to say a 

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:05.189
 here is the answer 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:08.189
 so well, that's the hour and the car talking 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.990
 continues to reflect give battle m 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.559
 to do this 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:17.479
 he 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.289
 into a dead end a little bit a little bit a little bit 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.460
 a little bit a little bit 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.460
 and 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.400
 while clinton 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.330
 nearly 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.309
 however, in the message 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.680
 Yes 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.159
 this package 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.539
 attack tons 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.539
 3 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:06.560
 stars first win with 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.979
 yen 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.979
 and there is 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.349
 very honored 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.179
 3 St. Petersburg 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:33.589
 everything is clear simple like that 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.629
 so it is necessary to watch 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.169
 prim 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.349
 3m 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:45.319
 with itself and extremely so and to him so plays paradise 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.300
 let's order 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.379
 everyone understands 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:53.379
 she understood everything 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.229
 something like that and compare yourself risks 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:06.290
 only myself 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.009
 by myself 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:07.720
 yesterday's 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.990
 this is the key to success
