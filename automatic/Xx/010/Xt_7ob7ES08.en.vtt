00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
reviewed the book if I stay which is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.429 
reviewed the book if I stay which is
this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.730> sequel<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.390> honestly<00:00:25.289> i'm

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this is the sequel but honestly i'm

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.570 
this is the sequel but honestly i'm
going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> say<00:00:25.740> right<00:00:25.859> now<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.039> i'm<00:00:26.310> pretty<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
going to say right now that i'm pretty I

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.310 
going to say right now that i'm pretty I
think<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.060> two<00:00:27.330> books<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.750> stand<00:00:28.050> alone<00:00:28.170> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
think the two books can stand alone I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.870 
think the two books can stand alone I
mean<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> same<00:00:29.010> characters<00:00:29.490> used<00:00:29.730> in

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
mean it's the same characters used in

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.749 
mean it's the same characters used in
both<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:31.170> feel<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.279> could<00:00:32.430> read<00:00:32.610> this

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
both but I feel like you could read this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250 
both but I feel like you could read this
book<00:00:32.969> without<00:00:33.149> without<00:00:33.719> having<00:00:34.110> read<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
book without without having read the

it or not and in this book it takes
place<00:00:51.090> three<00:00:51.329> years<00:00:51.480> after<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.680> stay<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
place three years after if I stay and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
place three years after if I stay and
what<00:00:54.210> happens<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> mia<00:00:54.989> has<00:00:55.199> gone<00:00:55.410> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
what happens is mia has gone to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.310 
what happens is mia has gone to
Juilliard<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.309> study<00:00:56.550> cello<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> adam<00:00:58.109> has

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
Juilliard to study cello and adam has

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.590 
Juilliard to study cello and adam has
become<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.250> huge<00:00:59.520> rock<00:00:59.850> star<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
become this huge rock star and so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000 
become this huge rock star and so
they're<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.199> opposite<00:01:01.559> sides<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> country

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
they're on opposite sides of the country

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
they're on opposite sides of the country
they<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.760> even<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.870> each<00:01:03.989> other

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
they don't even really know each other

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
they don't even really know each other
so<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> relationship<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.489> been<00:01:05.549> distanced

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
so the relationship has been distanced

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420 
so the relationship has been distanced
and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.590> night<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.799> happen<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> meet

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and then one night they happen to meet

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.820 
and then one night they happen to meet
in<00:01:08.549> New<00:01:08.640> York<00:01:08.850> City<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.810> mostly<00:01:10.680> about

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
in New York City and it's mostly about

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.250 
in New York City and it's mostly about
that<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.400> night<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.640> where<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> takes<00:01:12.930> them

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that one night and where it takes them

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.090 
that one night and where it takes them
and<00:01:14.720> what<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:15.900> similar<00:01:16.439> between<00:01:16.860> this

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and what was really similar between this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.340 
and what was really similar between this
book<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.520> first<00:01:17.790> book<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
book and the first book is that in if I

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.660 
book and the first book is that in if I
stay<00:01:20.659> because<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.290> main<00:01:22.530> narrator<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
stay because the main narrator was in a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
stay because the main narrator was in a
coma<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.060> most<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.320> comprised<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
coma for most of it it was comprised of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.670 
coma for most of it it was comprised of
mostly<00:01:26.369> flashbacks<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.840> really

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
mostly flashbacks which was a really

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.649 
mostly flashbacks which was a really
interesting<00:01:28.710> narrative<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.420> talked<00:01:30.630> about

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
interesting narrative and I talked about

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.950 
interesting narrative and I talked about
that<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:32.040> review<00:01:32.220> if<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:33.030> stay<00:01:33.329> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that a lot in my review if I stay but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
that a lot in my review if I stay but
even<00:01:34.259> though<00:01:34.409> both<00:01:34.710> characters<00:01:35.130> state

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
even though both characters state

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
even though both characters state
entirely<00:01:36.180> conscious<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.869> whole<00:01:36.900> time<00:01:37.079> during

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
entirely conscious the whole time during

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990
