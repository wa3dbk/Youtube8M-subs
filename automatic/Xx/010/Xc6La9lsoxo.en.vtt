00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.670
 it's dendermonde Protestants led in an earlier life it's no different 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.730
 since 1810 in four who should have competed against, for example, one in honor 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.650
 from sony 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.279
 the preses 50 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.150
 when about both equally large is also the disadvantage of a touch sensitive screen 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:30.070
 that you can't make it without problems so you can keep your finger on the screen 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.770
 usually happens what he goes to another place he left and 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.769
 yes, that is what your shoe for Komatsu corps members found stuck on a finger 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:38.550
 he 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.950
 not make everyone suitable for disputes 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.120
 if you look at this one then the outside is the irish meter 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.290
 soldiers who are but also good in the hand can help even further 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.590
 important as 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.620
 the the user interface 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.710
 and how pleasantly you can deliver why not the same pace cda calls too 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.140
 acting and not being struck by a book 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.160
 that is almost three weeks a bit the bee edition other a nice one 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.120
 loving peter reading 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.190
 and this offers you out of your thumb if you don't hold on to that passion 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.150
 in a place there come according to the head impressions that this is very good 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.740
 done with those crash aires 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.820
 All eyes on all bids are in the bottom of the free overview 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.860
 this is the president going it is actually reloading it is something to look up 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.230
 this to the menu 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.880
 sound of a truck 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.800
 and to the next or previous page 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.480
 well and second was the train tulikivi 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.740
 I am of course a big hit for the polls 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.520
 I can just move a bit further by following, but I can do that too 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.030
 the choirs 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 pressing the button on the next page 8 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770
 while reading the different 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.240
 extra traffic through the menu 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.060
 and make drawings 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.410
 then in the top optic wage 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 can i make a note the likely is saved 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 but also other functions such as the dictionary 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.390
 7 went standard 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.030
 please take the booking but he was already looking for help on the board 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.120
 to look up 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.949
 for example you can on 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.989
 will search 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.319
 not won for short day that is a pity 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.510
 it would be nice if the standard already contained a dictionary 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.889
 the settings click here no exception 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.389
 and that all I have looked at all three at that time 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.319
 is to indicate communication 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.679
 heister center so that when you turn you turn your screen it goes with the book 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:45.549
 to turn 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.529
 but you can also say that I just always want to be standard 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.289
 have standing 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.839
 the mp3 function is something that people probably value a lot 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:59.079
 I often had it for you to listen during their book 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.689
 being able to listen to music 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.039
 them 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.669
 yes frankly it is careful that you do not 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.409
 lochem must play 41 games 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.429
 both I respect 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.499
 can also be used in these pretty many functions 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.839
 as I sell a number of players to pitch the park I think 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.629
 so you can listen to the music 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.489
 for music that is of course not very important to play the building a little 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.650
 but it is not nice what very nice session speech it can listen well 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.599
 I have six also has WiFi 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.839
 the club az 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.459
 that can be done on the internet 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.629
 and of course i have 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.629
 wikileaks 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:54.059
 I also had to look where others the team is 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.399
 I find you above ring 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.300
 as you can see it can all be read further 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.790
 and the defense on the strangest to continue to the next page 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.879
 that bar is 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.539
 with a bicycle 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.279
 the fair hundredths 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:14.279
 touch well 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.400
 for example and could leave on a website 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.829
 it all just goes well 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.419
 just look at the connections that are on twitter 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.330
 most applications are still there 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.289
 here just November 3 with the team headphones 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.159
 now I have a small mini sv sd card it is with micro sd cards 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.180
 arcadis a book in places 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.260
 micro usb a connection for connecting to your computer and also for the 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.280
 Charger 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.000
 and here it can come true 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 may be moved 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.740
 undergo 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.740
 there is still a small criticism 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:55.889
 I am satisfied with 13 percent in the end 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.510
 some things i'm tasty that says the trend music section quite 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.479
 went well 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.639
 but yes there are not meant to read it is a bit 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.499
 passing by 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.529
 what for me what they all go there 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.970
 but then against the new processes 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.180
 maybe open another screen 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.199
 I sit there screens are just a bit darker 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.429
 follow people it was nice when the oyo is also covered with screens 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.650
 now prefers a pinkpop screen 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.860
 that is this one that we extend she is 50 using sony 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.949
 and that also works I have a bit faster 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.309
 so also some difference in price 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:34.669
 but it's still smart to look at the sales I want
