are<00:04:26.240> marked<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:26.990> well<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:27.710> they<00:04:28.490> have<00:04:28.520> super

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
are marked so well so they have super

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.659 
are marked so well so they have super
good<00:04:29.300> directions<00:04:29.810> that's<00:04:30.110> how<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.410> earn<00:04:30.830> by

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
good directions that's how I earn by

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.930 
good directions that's how I earn by
following<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.150> directions<00:04:32.419> on<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.810> cans

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
following the directions on the cans

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.439 
following the directions on the cans
okay<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:37.070> then<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.430> stain<00:04:37.759> it<00:04:37.789> and<00:04:38.180> that's

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
okay so then you stain it and that's

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.219 
okay so then you stain it and that's
really<00:04:39.160> probably<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.310> easiest<00:04:40.900> step<00:04:41.900> in<00:04:42.139> the

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
really probably the easiest step in the

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.640 
really probably the easiest step in the
whole<00:04:42.380> process<00:04:43.300> next<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.229> is<00:04:45.289> what<00:04:45.620> I

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
whole process next and this is what I

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.730 
whole process next and this is what I
put<00:04:45.979> on<00:04:46.039> my<00:04:46.250> vanity<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.570> tung<00:04:47.990> oil<00:04:50.560> but<00:04:51.560> there

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
put on my vanity is tung oil but there

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.320 
put on my vanity is tung oil but there
is<00:04:51.889> another<00:04:52.220> option<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:53.060> it's<00:04:53.240> a

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
is another option and it's a

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.930 
is another option and it's a
polyurethane<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:54.410> men<00:04:55.310> wax<00:04:55.610> has<00:04:55.910> a

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
polyurethane and men wax has a

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.150 
polyurethane and men wax has a
polyurethane<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:57.110> back<00:04:57.289> of<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.500> can<00:04:57.770> says

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
polyurethane the back of the can says

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.700 
polyurethane the back of the can says
you<00:04:58.490> can<00:04:58.699> use<00:04:59.139> the<00:05:00.139> specific<00:05:00.770> kind<00:05:01.070> I<00:05:02.410> did<00:05:03.410> tung

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
you can use the specific kind I did tung

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.990 
you can use the specific kind I did tung
oil<00:05:04.039> on<00:05:04.340> my<00:05:04.490> vanity<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:06.039> now<00:05:07.039> if<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.490> had<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.880> to

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
oil on my vanity and now if I had it to

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.360 
oil on my vanity and now if I had it to
do<00:05:08.150> again<00:05:08.180> use<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.350> polyurethane<00:05:09.680> because

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
do again use the polyurethane because

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.080 
do again use the polyurethane because
what<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.880> does<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.539> it<00:05:12.169> puts<00:05:12.199> a<00:05:12.770> clear<00:05:13.520> coat

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
what that does is it puts a clear coat

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.170 
what that does is it puts a clear coat
on<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.889> does<00:05:16.130> give<00:05:16.400> it<00:05:16.520> more<00:05:16.669> of<00:05:16.729> a<00:05:16.880> shiny

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
on it does give it more of a shiny

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.850 
on it does give it more of a shiny
appearance<00:05:17.449> but<00:05:18.050> it's<00:05:18.199> actually<00:05:18.680> like<00:05:18.710> a

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
appearance but it's actually like a

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.900 
appearance but it's actually like a
protective<00:05:19.960> seal<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.380> so<00:05:22.010> in<00:05:22.250> here<00:05:22.580> when<00:05:22.789> I'm

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
protective seal and so in here when I'm

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.710 
protective seal and so in here when I'm
doing<00:05:22.940> hairspray<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:23.900> makeup<00:05:24.349> and<00:05:24.669> I<00:05:25.669> just<00:05:26.539> I

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
doing hairspray and makeup and I just I

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.570 
doing hairspray and makeup and I just I
really<00:05:26.750> wish<00:05:27.139> I<00:05:27.259> would<00:05:27.410> have<00:05:27.440> done<00:05:27.680> that<00:05:27.919> the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
really wish I would have done that the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.170 
really wish I would have done that the
tung<00:05:28.880> oil<00:05:29.120> gives<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.870> more<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.470> a<00:05:30.830> in<00:05:31.340> my

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
tung oil gives it more of a in my

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.820 
tung oil gives it more of a in my
opinion<00:05:32.210> like<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.960> natural<00:05:33.710> wood<00:05:34.840> finish<00:05:35.840> the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
opinion like a natural wood finish the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.969
