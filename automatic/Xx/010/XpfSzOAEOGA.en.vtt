00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello, how am I doing with the musical all year long? 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.609
 in these dates we put our house a 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.259
 Christmas tree in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.269
 teach how to make some so original 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.269
 how do we start 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.910
 ko 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.320
 to make our ornament by the tree 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 for Christmas we need the following 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.710
 scissors materials folios colors 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.720
 thread and needle to make our ornament 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.230
 of life we ​​need 24 circles of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.040
 paper for it we have to double the 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.040
 folio several times 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.320
 one 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.740
 two 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.589
 and three times 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.740
 now in this rectangle that you see 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.620
 we have to do 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.630
 We can make a circle by eye or 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 we can use a template that 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.110
 we will have done previously with a compass 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.450
 I am going to do it to eye because neither 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.610
 it is imperative that the circle comes out 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.570
 perfect 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.570
 we cut it 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.380
 and they will not have left 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.720
 8 the circle we need therefore 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.490
 three folios to do 8 for 3 24 what 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.040
 next thing we would have to do is 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.050
 choose each circle separately and 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.590
 do this operation 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.619
 we have to fold it in half 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.659
 We pass the nail because it is very 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.729
 important that the form remains, if not 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.280
 the form then the result in what 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.549
 should we fine fold it back by the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.549
 half 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.170
 we pass the nail we bend it again 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.170
 half 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.710
 passing a fingernail and we bend it again 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.710
 in half 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.450
 this we would do with all circles 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.450
 you say with the 24 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.960
 I already have the 24 pieces with a bit of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.240
 patience and time are achieved for 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.340
 continue what we have to do 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.660
 we will take groups of 6 because as 64 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.480
 pieces of 6 triangles of these for 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.370
 assemble the piece we have to open each 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.050
 piece of paper but not totally 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.040
 because if I do not lose the form and we do not 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.780
 interesting we will open it and a bit and with the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.580
 needle help with and what I do that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.910
 that you put it double is very fine because 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.190
 If you can not get through, click 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.910
 the center of 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.910
 paper 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.099
 and we put it down to work we do the same 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:00.060
 with all the papers until we have 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.060
 the piece with 6 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.600
 You see is staying like that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.730
 try that finished the first piece 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:34.599
 now we cut about 15 centimeters 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.060
 the thread and we reserve it for the end 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.440
 so we would do with the four pieces already 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.019
 I have the four pieces done now what 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.519
 what we are going to do is go riding our 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.590
 Christmas ornament 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.620
 we have to take a piece in one hand 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.410
 and another in another and we have to do two 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.299
 knots but very carefully because if 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.690
 we do not tighten it well the piece remains 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.780
 loose and the ball would not look good 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.380
 one advice that I do is that with this 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.080
 hand shot towards outward and 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.770
 I give it a spin here on the thread of this 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.540
 shape does not get loose 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.790
 I already said that I had crossed to the knot 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.500
 at least I am careful to take 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.829
 here 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.840
 and some knots you see that has been 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.370
 perfectly attached to the two pieces if 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.930
 they would have if we had not pressed 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.790
 of the thread if they had been loose I will 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.729
 make another knot to secure it 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.370
 these 2 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.990
 and we will attach it to form only 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.240
 one 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.560
 and so we have the next piece for 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.060
 join it with the following 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.630
 bubble these two pieces others the same 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.630
 than the previous 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.150
 squeezing well so that it did not sound very 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:48.150
 valid 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.939
 and I do the two knots when it arrives 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.869
 together the three blocks again I do 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.490
 what we have done before 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:03.380
 I take the threads and together 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.060
 I only have to put the last piece 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.080
 is the most difficult because having already 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.590
 three blocks this figure is the time to 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.590
 make the knots 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.260
 some final knots and I'll finish 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.260
 our Christmas bonus 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.810
 finally one of the threads and already 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.000
 we would have finished our ornament 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.199
 Christmas we can give you a little bit of shape 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.690
 with your hands if we see that you have not 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.780
 totally round and here it is 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.780
 the result 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.169
 I have already seen the result of our 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.180
 Christmas duel the original material with 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.080
 the one that I learned to make this ball makes 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.289
 a few years 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.590
 cellophane paper this ball case has 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.000
 six groups of seven circles each 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.479
 will be bigger will ask you more 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.740
 articles to fill more the sphere in 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.180
 the school I do it with colorful flowers 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.340
 because to a more resistant material and 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.539
 less delicate for children you know 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.250
 where can you find me down 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.199
 explained everything in the description not 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.180
 forget comments on my suggestion 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.189
 what videos do you want me to subscribe to? 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.659
 channel so as not to lose the news and 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.099
 little finger up they have liked been 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.099
 Christmas ornament until then
