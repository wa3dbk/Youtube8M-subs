00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.410 

then<00:04:06.519> you're<00:04:06.640> going<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.790> do<00:04:06.909> that<00:04:07.060> two<00:04:07.269> more

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
then you're going to do that two more

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.470 
then you're going to do that two more
times<00:04:07.480> as<00:04:08.049> Drake<00:04:08.709> does<00:04:08.920> in<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.159> song<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.700> then

times as Drake does in the song and then

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.910 
times as Drake does in the song and then
the<00:04:10.719> left<00:04:10.930> hand<00:04:11.049> is<00:04:11.230> going<00:04:11.319> to<00:04:11.379> change<00:04:13.500> at<00:04:14.500> the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
the left hand is going to change at the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.449 
the left hand is going to change at the
point<00:04:15.250> where<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:16.859> believe<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:17.949> start<00:04:18.160> singing

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
the hook he'll start just at the point

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.850 
the hook he'll start just at the point
where<00:04:22.960> he<00:04:23.110> starts<00:04:23.320> playing<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.560> hook<00:04:23.680> he's

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
where he starts playing the hook he's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.430 
where he starts playing the hook he's
