00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.969 
together pretty well you can even use
this<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.600> bed<00:02:06.810> if<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.049> want<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> sit<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this in bed if you want to sit this on a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
this in bed if you want to sit this on a
pillow<00:02:08.310> next<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.179> watch<00:02:09.569> your<00:02:09.750> movie

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
pillow next to you and watch your movie

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.190 
pillow next to you and watch your movie
in<00:02:10.229> bed<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.679> could<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:10.950> that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
in bed you could do that

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.490 
in bed you could do that
also<00:02:11.500> tilt<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.489> that<00:02:12.790> way<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.209> lock<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.319> in

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
also tilt that that way and lock it in

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.680 
also tilt that that way and lock it in
and<00:02:14.770> then<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.160> watch<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.489> movie<00:02:15.569> or<00:02:16.569> you're

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
and then you can watch a movie or you're

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.930 
and then you can watch a movie or you're
laying<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:16.989> your<00:02:17.050> side<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:18.370> could<00:02:18.519> even<00:02:18.670> sit

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
laying on your side you could even sit

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.729 
laying on your side you could even sit
on<00:02:18.970> your<00:02:19.180> chest<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.690> suppose<00:02:19.989> if<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.230> wanted<00:02:20.560> to

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
on your chest I suppose if you wanted to

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.430 
on your chest I suppose if you wanted to
and<00:02:20.980> then<00:02:21.129> angle<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.879> up<00:02:22.000> really<00:02:22.150> high<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.170> a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
and then angle it up really high so a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.080 
and then angle it up really high so a
lot<00:02:23.739> of<00:02:23.769> different<00:02:24.099> angles<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.030> different

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
lot of different angles and different

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.670 
lot of different angles and different
things<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.569> can<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:25.870> with<00:02:26.050> this

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
things you can do with this

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.290 
things you can do with this
I<00:02:26.739> thought<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.459> carve<00:02:27.700> thing<00:02:27.910> was<00:02:28.060> really

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
I thought the carve thing was really

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.270 
I thought the carve thing was really
neat<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.599> course<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.230> wouldn't<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:30.130> using

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
neat of course you wouldn't be using

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.880 
neat of course you wouldn't be using
that<00:02:30.519> if<00:02:30.640> you're<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.819> passenger<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.480> course<00:02:31.890> not

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that if you're a passenger of course not

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.710 
that if you're a passenger of course not
if<00:02:33.010> you're<00:02:33.130> driving<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.880> what<00:02:34.300> makes<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.599> nice

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
if you're driving and what makes it nice

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.259 
if you're driving and what makes it nice
too<00:02:34.989> is<00:02:35.170> it's<00:02:35.380> very<00:02:35.620> light<00:02:36.310> easy<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:37.000> carry

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
too is it's very light easy to carry

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.119 
too is it's very light easy to carry
around<00:02:38.040> everything<00:02:39.040> folds<00:02:39.730> into<00:02:39.880> itself<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
around everything folds into itself and

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.750 
around everything folds into itself and
and<00:02:42.129> then<00:02:42.640> from<00:02:42.849> there<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:43.690> easily<00:02:43.900> just

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and then from there you can easily just

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.039 
and then from there you can easily just
angle<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.819> up<00:02:45.970> whatever<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.420> want<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.900> can

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
angle it up whatever you want you can

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.170 
angle it up whatever you want you can
kind<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.290> see<00:02:47.530> how<00:02:47.709> it<00:02:47.739> works<00:02:48.010> down<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.940> side

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
kind of see how it works down the side

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.000 
kind of see how it works down the side
here<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.660> how<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:50.110> easily<00:02:50.290> adjust<00:02:50.590> it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
here and how you can easily adjust it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.550 
here and how you can easily adjust it
almost<00:02:51.310> perfectly<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:52.090> whatever<00:02:52.269> angle<00:02:52.959> you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
almost perfectly to whatever angle you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.920 
almost perfectly to whatever angle you
might<00:02:53.769> want<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.040> do<00:02:54.220> some<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.910> these<00:02:55.000> lower

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
might want to do some of these lower

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.410 
might want to do some of these lower
angles<00:02:56.410> would<00:02:56.560> be<00:02:56.620> great<00:02:57.010> for<00:02:57.220> typing<00:02:57.700> cetera

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
angles would be great for typing cetera

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.539 
angles would be great for typing cetera
cetera<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.680> really<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.340> it

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
cetera so I really like it

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.800 
cetera so I really like it
it's<00:03:00.819> pretty<00:03:01.030> cool<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.420> think<00:03:01.510> it's<00:03:01.660> a

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
it's pretty cool I think it's a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.509 
it's pretty cool I think it's a
