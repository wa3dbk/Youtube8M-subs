00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.880
 will return to the subway is always a 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.860
 experience that is worth repeating 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.990
 this garden has housed some of the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.029
 biggest battles of the center of Paris 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.410
 this beautiful and multicolored paris that is the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.300
 only fault that I find this 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.730
 really here too much color everything is 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.080
 very green very red very everything that I 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 I really wonder and what else I 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.890
 flake of everything is just that here 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.210
 there is very little blue and I when I play my 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.860
 battle filtres I'm used to 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.420
 I seem to have dropped an inkwell 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.760
 blue in full screen this is going to be 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.440
 difficult to overcome but in the end I suppose 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.850
 which is a matter of adapting more or less 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.739
 similar to what this version of battle 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.120
 Filters has done so much with the new 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.710
 we had received the following battle 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.449
 films like with things that even still 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.640
 we had not seen that they already appear in 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.530
 these menus of the so-called wenni sanluis a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.720
 curious name for this also curious 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.159
 way to start to examine a little more 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.630
 in depth all this let's start 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.250
 for the menus with which the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.659
 pleasant surprises like the one of for example 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.670
 you do not need to use a web like 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.049
 battlelog to access the game itself 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.549
 to play the single module that makes 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.200
 missing is downloading the web installer 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.580
 that you will have in the description and also 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.860
 register the three which you can 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.720
 achieve and create your soldiers of the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.280
 which we can have several which is 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.680
 an interesting functionality how much 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.000
 less after this we can enter a 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.600
 little else in the rest of the menus that I eat 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.729
 you can see 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.470
 they are pretty good in panties 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.210
 basically on the rise, neither the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.560
 options neither the campaign nor the most 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.090
 cool that I've seen at first glance that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 is the one of max making in the purest style 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.049
 of code or good games that require a 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.909
 Pre- departure room as I say 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.350
 even the subject is not active but it will be 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.450
 quite interesting to see how it works 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.009
 when it is ready what luckily yes 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.330
 is ready is the server search engine 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.860
 and good as you can see there is a server 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.810
 available as well as you can see 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.030
 has a viewer mode already operational and 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.950
 It is also 120 hertz another of the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.259
 most novel features of the mod and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.179
 that should offer a better net code and 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.740
 I should emphasize in because it is absurd 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.149
 the amount of double chaos and deaths 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.039
 of a single shot that I had to suffer in 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.509
 this only game that I recorded since 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.860
 we talk about it, I also tell you that in 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.989
 this video is not going to be very much 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.910
 less a festival of deaths between that 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.890
 We were only seven and as I say to the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.900
 net code lacks a polish because it was 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.519
 all something quite symbolic compared to 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.560
 what in theory may this offer 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.269
 project in the future let's try the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.890
 elbow and let's go to what's really important 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.140
 to the most essential thing that we will need to 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.880
 play if friends talk about chat 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.380
 I still see the chat is also in the 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.030
 long list of reforms that theoretically 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.560
 I should leave it the same as it is in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.120
 battlefield 4 so we can use it 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.690
 both the camps kit and in the middle of 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.280
 games 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.020
 and also as a gift we will also have 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.430
 a bar so we can go back 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.230
 in the for when there is salt seo and 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.300
 we lose the thread for killing and that 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.590
 that sometimes distracts and if it were not 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.540
 little bit of the chat we are also going to have 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.010
 some unimportant addition as per 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.870
 example the one that we will be able to moderate the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.550
 own mod and make it available to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.080
 other users is not the first time 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.940
 read a forum find me a piece of 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.350
 idea hopefully this is a method to be able 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.330
 see some of the many generalities 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.770
 who came to the community that if 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.110
 say it quietly lest it come to 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.430
 rockstar and cut us the roll before 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.230
 say goodbye, let's go back to this area 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.850
 outside let's go back to the garden because 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.080
 is that I have not yet been comfortable 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.850
 to see these colors and this is where 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.740
 you better see if this looks like the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.180
 Mayan bee country 'right now 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.530
 by the way is hosting a battle 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.300
 quite interesting to get out of 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.950
 our respawn and I personally am 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.570
 having a battle also pretty 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.830
 interesting with controlling the recoil 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.900
 of my weapon that had not played for a long time 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.370
 battlefield 3 and by the way where is the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.080
 kickback of battlefield 3 that is removed 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.030
 4 and leaving it on the street 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.800
 finally we are going to get charged 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.720
 one more m tried to duck but forfait 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.580
 says team there of puts me to sunbathe 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.560
 on top of a rock that I must be a 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.090
 little white or something 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.440
 but well I think we 've already seen a 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.730
 little above that is going to go this 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.440
 new community initiative and it's going 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.209
 It is time to get back to a Solomont 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.890
 so that he touches his subject that every time 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.910
 I hear it I like it more, do not forget about 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.709
 tell me in comments what has you 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.060
 similar what was shown and what do you think in 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.250
 general this new initiative for a 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.599
 game that is now four years old but 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.870
 it seems can still give us one last 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.190
 joy so nothing said this I 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.940
 dismissal 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.940
 goodbye kids
