00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.170
 who is missing 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.580
 Sandra Andra 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:15.310
 50 sandro went the boludo 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.000
 what's up with the exclusive of the nights 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.000
 of soccer 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.000
 you know that in Mexico 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:30.360
 It is customary for man 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.910
 ask for the hand of the bride 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.050
 if we were more or less seeing between the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.050
 ninja and what in itself 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.390
 much much much much more than that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.390
 limit through love 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.050
 but it is not true 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.930
 of the days 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.170
 that led to the production was 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.810
 show of a total starting you have to 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.250
 start with everything 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.610
 there is a photograph that they turn around 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.610
 to the world 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:22.960
 why I say that I burned with 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.350
 conquests and then what the written says 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.350
 which is below 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.310
 but let's try to make a 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.310
 close up 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.730
 because down 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.730
 there is a posture 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.240
 what for 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.230
 but antic 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.390
 that's what he says he delivered 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.790
 pearls and a palette points 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.800
 photography approach please 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.800
 here it is not more expensive 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.350
 hear 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.170
 it's as if 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.150
 invites 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.150
 now now the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.710
 now let's turn the can and go 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.300
 to rotation is not that technology here 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.300
 is to cover
