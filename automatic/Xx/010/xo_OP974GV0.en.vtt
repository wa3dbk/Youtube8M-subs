00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.060
 [applause] 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.060
 [music] 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.599
 the time came when the apple became 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.519
 play by the rules of users and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.810
 other companies and not vice versa 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.400
 Have a great day everyone and meet iphone 6 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.199
 trend of big screens launched as 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.540
 nor strange samsung and as a result 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.939
 now the throne of the apple is shared with them 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.399
 iphone has always been compact it is always 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.099
 We liked for its elegance but 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.669
 came 2013 and everything changed from up to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.920
 head 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.850
 someone stayed quite ascetic 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.559
 iphone 5s 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 and someone deftly jumped on android 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 smart phones with large and no one else 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.399
 argue comfortable screens 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.170
 moto x nexus 5 and galaxy s4 in the background 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.359
 small 5s they looked 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.629
 really more profitable but appeared 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.539
 iphone 6 screen iphone 6 much bigger 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.479
 iphone 5s 575 screen greater phone itself 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.469
 he is taller wider and a little harder while he 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.359
 noticeably thinner 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.429
 it is one of the thinnest in the world 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.589
 phones in hand feel like a dummy 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.659
 for this size it is very light 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 The external phone is similar to ipod touch 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 fifth generation and new ipad 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.480
 design of one concept is true behind 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.670
 there were strips that like 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.170
 far from everyone will repeat that they live 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.000
 look much better than in the photo 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.220
 so much to worry about it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 not worth it but in general iphone 6 is good 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.630
 1 background is being looked through and that is 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.910
 done in apple no doubt 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.160
 sadness is just something that is very strong from 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.690
 the body acts the camera it interferes 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.640
 phone when it lies on the table and 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.740
 spoils the design as a whole on the phone 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 nice rounded edges in hand he 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 lies unambiguously the best 5s which has 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.250
 sharp corners from this is cutting your hand this 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.910
 claims appeared long ago with the release 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.890
 iphone 5 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.360
 due to the fact that iphone 6 is thinner 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 smooth around the edges it is comfortable to hold 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.150
 with one hand 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.470
 to reach the top buttons 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.660
 enough to double tap 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 and systems on the screen go down addictive 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.040
 it happens instantly and when after 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.680
 that you take into your hand the old background you think about 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.690
 so small and who enjoys 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.830
 android shovels have felt this feeling already 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.680
 over a year ago 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.409
 colors on iphone 6 are the same as on 5s, but 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.289
 prices in Russia increased from 32,000 rubles to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.170
 42 but 32 gigabyte version disappeared 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.239
 but it appeared on the 128 phone by 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.880
 size is the same as nexus 5 only 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.710
 the last screen is 5 inches and the iphone 6 4 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.470
 7 to 3 tenths less 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.330
 again by the rules of the player 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.850
 mobile market button iphone 6 now 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.160
 is on the side of like android devices 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.260
 drink the right decision by the way what 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.210
 As for the buttons, they have improved 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.520
 rather than being pressed clearly without squeaks or 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.120
 iphone 6 screen tightness is called 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.760
 retina hd and has a resolution of 1 1334 on 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.980
 750 pixels dots per one 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.590
 same as iphone 5s 326 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.140
 I am ashamed to figure it but nevertheless competently 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.880
 compiled interface ios 8 turns 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.780
 this is not the best display in something 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.880
 nice looking 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.770
 The frames at the display are also shamefully big 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.740
 but rounded it adds comfort 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.780
 ios 8 system itself was adapted for 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.760
 new resolution some items 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.470
 remain the same size some steel 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.450
 more in the settings you can choose 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.070
 increased mode then the ratio 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.520
 screens of the entire system will be like on the iphone 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.740
 five 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.750
 icons will just be huge and fonts 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.300
 thick exactly on iphone 6 this 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.800
 looks awful to developers now 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.080
 will have to redo their applications 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.330
 under the new screen iphone 6 and 6 plus 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.010
 which have different resolutions most 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.290
 an advantageous solution would be the installation 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.480
 display sticks in both options but no 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.580
 Thought fell out buy from hd 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.950
 and developers will have more work, and then 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.850
 and the other truth iphone 6 works on 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.130
 apple processor 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.470
 a8 made by msi ms 20 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.269
 the nanometer process here is still 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.010
 one gigabyte of ram and yes 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.230
 overall phone performance remained 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.420
 at iphone 5s level in geekbench 3 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.940
 device gains 1600 points single 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.830
 test and almost 3000 in multi-core test 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.390
 games do not slow you down 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.890
 really fast besides yet 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.140
 there is a global optimization process 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.420
 games though the same infinity blade 3 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.910
 already looks great another chip a 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.590
 weight 8 is a third-party keyboard and the most 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.750
 most popular of them namely from the branch and 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.400
 board and swiftkey already in place as long as the truth 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.290
 do not support Russian yet 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.730
 The second important innovation of the system is 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.470
 widget curtain notifications 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.080
 it's not quite what we're all used to 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.970
 but come down and so updated and takachidi 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.340
 iphone now it works like this 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.380
 need no delays and permanent errors in 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.979
 determining fingerprint it works 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.500
 perfect 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.020
 the most exciting batteries here are we all 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.440
 know that iphone 5s is famous for its small 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.000
 autonomy iphone 6 Battery capacity 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.969
 1810 milliampere hours is little but 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.099
 finally the phone is full enough 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.869
 work developers have worked hard 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.689
 optimization, therefore, from morning to evening 

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:40.789
 he pulls along with floor 8 updated 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.799
 and the m8 coprocessor appeared in a and weight 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.599
 health app that integrates 

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.909
 functionality of many fitness programs and 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.769
 health surveillance programs sound 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:50.599
 the speaker is louder 

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:53.059
 noise reduction works fine 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.379
 thanks to multiple mic main 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.999
 the speaker also became louder 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.829
 little quality remained the same 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.749
 good level 

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:01.849
 but perhaps the most pleasant changes 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:04.129
 after an increased on-screen battery this 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.499
 camera camera, and before that was excellent as well 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.389
 now even better first iphone 6 is 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:10.849
 The first phone in the world who can shoot 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.639
 slow motion video with a frame rate of 240 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.289
 slowly and very nicely but of course 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.059
 understandable for what basically it will be 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.129
 used not for pretty pictures 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:21.199
 clearly autofocus work now 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.089
 extremely fast to me especially in the video 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.679
 Focus pixels technology allows 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.509
 focus on an object in motion 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.889
 automatically and with it 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.079
 automatically configured yet 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.569
 exposure panorama can now shoot 

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:33.979
 Up to 43 megapixels and 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.499
 in the hands of professionals it looks 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.349
 only one thing saddens the camera 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:41.479
 there is no support for shooting 4 but the thing is needed and 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:44.989
 in our time but foul wait for the phone to write 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.089
 at 60fps and hdr photos are almost done 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.889
 at the same rate as normal but 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:50.869
 it is really useful besides 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.999
 The photo of iphone 6 is very good 

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:54.589
 good and doubt can not be that 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:57.649
 This is one of the best mobile cameras in 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:59.419
 2014-15 years front camera has 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.429
 sensor resolution of only 1 and 2 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.199
 megapixels but the photos are obtained 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:06.019
 very high quality even surprising 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.639
 iphone 6 is nfc true to use 

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:09.619
 it is possible only for payments and on 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.419
 this moment only in usa pictures 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.189
 transfer to connect to the technique as in 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.860
 android using everything here is impossible 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:17.839
 as a result of the answer to the question than the iphone 6 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.869
 better iphone 5s would be a simple phrase 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:22.699
 he has better design and more iphone 6 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:24.829
 it's not exactly big by the standards of others 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.989
 devices phone he is very thin 

00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:28.789
 fits perfectly into the hand you say 

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:31.189
 no revolution and after it on the face 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.019
 people finally got everything for them 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:35.059
 wanted a big screen acceptable 

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:37.740
 autonomy timelapse in 240 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:39.930
 fps what else is needed for happiness 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.030
 Well, would not hurt full hd-display of course 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.099
 full on all and shooting in 4k and in 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.130
 the rest is all great so the apple is still 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:50.269
 that 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.269
