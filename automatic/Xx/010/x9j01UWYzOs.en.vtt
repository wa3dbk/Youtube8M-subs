00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello to you all hides the review on 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.320
 car for speed world 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.790
 Now such a machine porsche karera day 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.250
 I want to tell you that this is great 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.460
 car practical the coolest car 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.260
 whole game because as well here 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.350
 now at the maximum like yes 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.320
 maximum and she has eight hundred forty five 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 points in the car is good enough and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 control exactly maximum acceleration 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.460
 speed is also all great car 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.190
 made sweeping up out of spring this 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.190
 in general, they are very much like this here but 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.440
 it is empty almost without everything 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 In principle, I, and especially only 613 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.489
 everybody gave a ride 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.000
 and machine vs class so even in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.620
 mode 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.620
 so cool and so take this one 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.120
 behind her there are partitions in principle 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.989
 which means that it can for a dredge 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.420
 approach the permanent representative does not seem to attack 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.700
 more abruptly so let's see what by the way 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.570
 how much does it cost 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.880
 the price of this car but the car is fine on 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.630
 principle of course which car will 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.909
 bad for the cache all the more with the class all 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:25.479
 cars through and you wo n't run out of beads and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.910
 so cherish 13800 so exactly the same 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.800
 like we have everything with ultra everything in quality 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.090
 you can even put the spoiler on 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.270
 hood 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:43.119
 but without any drives what they want and have 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.700
 hour for 8600 and well and gift still in 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.659
 one day rent 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.649
 present such 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.359
 and so well it is of course you do not have it so 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.969
 you can not check to spend time 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:02:02.719
 and so they drove cool cool car 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.030
 rides great I really like 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.549
 quick divorce 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.420
 easily we can well just spent at all 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.420
 perfect i will say 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.660
 very quite the query can stand next to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.790
 pagani zonda 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.620
 and with mac laurent me and cheese and other it 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.220
 she will rather all the top machines from 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.840
 them and even it will be better to what extent 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.840
 because the car is very cool 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.940
 and the management is great in turning it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.090
 high enough speed 200 now 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.150
 in your turn though usually it is very 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.150
 hard to make rides great 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.760
 try now skid with handbrake 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.750
 okay let's go let's go ride us 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.960
 In principle, a ride in principle should 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.070
 now it seems to win me 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:17.110
 Of course everything happens it happens as 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:20.820
 me pc they are there any other bai 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.820
 evolution easier and you but 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.920
 all of what you just need to ride 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.040
 prilovchitsya we will find the track on 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.720
 which is most convenient to have on it 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.720
 principle win 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.030
 so 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.160
 auto 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:47.330
 about letting go of the moment because still waiting 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:51.240
 so I will miss 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:56.340
 Does anyone like that hit the ford summit? 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:59.250
 garbage and pumps in by the way even 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:05.790
 I do not know and umar is not Marcelo you 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:08.010
 you are 749 straight perfectly assembled and not even 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.850
 I know now who will be who will win I 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.000
 Of course the first time until I go to the race 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:18.750
 on this machine without even knowing the most 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:25.410
 listen to the birds turn in and the chemist well yes 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:29.360
 Okay, let's try March ford mustang 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.360
 and porsche boxes 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.770
 I do not know what happened I somehow 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.970
 flew the game turned off clearly was 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.730
 He writes that the server is disconnected Th for crap I 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.930
 did not understand who came in food after 20 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:13.380
 20 minutes to ascend finally found but arrived 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.770
 I can say a little bit there second 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.540
 did not have time in the second 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.360
 great car drove cool principle 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.350
 nothing can say where it is great 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.200
 so basically you can buy 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:33.900
 Well, how can 13 thousand bushes of course 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.940
 understood but still cool shot with you 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.440
