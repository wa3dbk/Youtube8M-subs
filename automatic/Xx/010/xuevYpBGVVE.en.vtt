00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.060 

I<00:00:06.970> think<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.090> value<00:00:08.510> of<00:00:08.780> the<00:00:09.500> rigor<00:00:09.740> of<00:00:09.860> our

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
I think the value of the rigor of our

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.010 
I think the value of the rigor of our
testing<00:00:10.610> is<00:00:10.820> that<00:00:11.240> it<00:00:11.480> gives<00:00:11.629> our<00:00:11.840> customers

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
testing is that it gives our customers

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.879 
testing is that it gives our customers
something<00:00:12.530> that<00:00:13.160> they<00:00:13.280> can<00:00:13.460> trust<00:00:13.670> in<00:00:14.740> when<00:00:15.740> we

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
something that they can trust in when we

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.589 
something that they can trust in when we
see<00:00:16.070> a<00:00:16.099> piece<00:00:16.309> of<00:00:16.460> equipment<00:00:16.910> that's<00:00:17.090> actually

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
see a piece of equipment that's actually

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.440 
see a piece of equipment that's actually
out<00:00:17.869> on<00:00:18.170> a<00:00:18.290> jobsite<00:00:18.800> someplace<00:00:19.460> if<00:00:19.790> it's<00:00:20.210> one

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
out on a jobsite someplace if it's one

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.120 
out on a jobsite someplace if it's one
that<00:00:20.660> you've<00:00:20.869> worked<00:00:21.020> on<00:00:21.260> you<00:00:21.770> know<00:00:21.800> you've

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
that you've worked on you know you've

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.859 
that you've worked on you know you've
touched<00:00:22.369> that<00:00:22.609> machine<00:00:22.730> you've<00:00:23.449> know<00:00:23.660> that

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
touched that machine you've know that

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.990 
touched that machine you've know that
you've<00:00:23.990> contributed<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:25.400> making<00:00:25.580> that<00:00:25.820> the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
you've contributed to making that the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.560 
you've contributed to making that the
best<00:00:26.180> machine<00:00:26.480> possible<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:29.119> one<00:00:29.269> issue<00:00:29.480> that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
best machine possible the one issue that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.839 
best machine possible the one issue that
we<00:00:29.810> wanted<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.140> avoid<00:00:30.529> is<00:00:30.920> inconsistency<00:00:31.730> of

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
we wanted to avoid is inconsistency of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.910 
we wanted to avoid is inconsistency of
material<00:00:32.330> so<00:00:32.660> we<00:00:32.780> built<00:00:33.019> this<00:00:33.140> loaf<00:00:33.470> as<00:00:33.769> they

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
material so we built this loaf as they

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.580 
material so we built this loaf as they
call<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.309> inside<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.360> our<00:00:35.480> facility<00:00:36.019> here<00:00:36.320> and

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
call it inside of our facility here and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.010 
call it inside of our facility here and
we<00:00:37.309> built<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:37.700> in<00:00:37.790> layers<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:38.420> it's<00:00:38.809> extremely

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
we built it in layers so it's extremely

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.549 
we built it in layers so it's extremely
consistent<00:00:39.920> all<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.010> way<00:00:40.130> through<00:00:41.410> when<00:00:42.410> we

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
consistent all the way through when we

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.110 
consistent all the way through when we
run<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:42.800> study<00:00:43.100> like<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:43.550> we<00:00:43.730> want<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.000> make

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
run a study like this we want to make

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.060 
run a study like this we want to make
sure<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.390> we're<00:00:44.540> doing<00:00:44.660> something<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.500> is

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
sure that we're doing something that is

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.610 
sure that we're doing something that is
representative<00:00:46.879> of<00:00:47.090> what<00:00:47.149> our<00:00:47.450> customers<00:00:48.440> do

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
representative of what our customers do

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.160 
representative of what our customers do
in<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.829> real<00:00:48.980> world<00:00:49.250> today<00:00:49.940> we<00:00:50.270> ran<00:00:50.539> a<00:00:50.840> short

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
in the real world today we ran a short

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.770 
in the real world today we ran a short
load<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.530> carry<00:00:51.680> cycle<00:00:52.280> which<00:00:52.460> was<00:00:52.700> roughly<00:00:53.600> a

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
load and carry cycle which was roughly a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.840 
load and carry cycle which was roughly a
hundred<00:00:54.230> meters<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.710> travel<00:00:55.190> with<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.460> loaded

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
hundred meters of travel with a loaded

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.360 
hundred meters of travel with a loaded
bucket<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:56.420> that's<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:57.350> represent<00:00:57.469> what<00:00:58.340> a

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
bucket and that's to represent what a

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.750 
bucket and that's to represent what a
customer<00:00:58.789> would<00:00:58.910> do<00:00:59.030> an<00:00:59.149> asphalt<00:00:59.570> plan<00:01:00.760> we

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
customer would do an asphalt plan we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.999 
customer would do an asphalt plan we
also<00:01:01.910> did<00:01:02.149> a<00:01:02.180> truck<00:01:02.420> loading<00:01:02.750> cycle<00:01:03.199> which<00:01:03.829> is

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
also did a truck loading cycle which is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.590 
also did a truck loading cycle which is
very<00:01:04.309> common<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:04.789> quarries<00:01:05.239> when<00:01:05.449> they're

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
very common in quarries when they're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.930 
very common in quarries when they're
loading<00:01:05.869> out<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.140> face<00:01:06.399> in<00:01:07.399> those<00:01:07.640> trucks

loading out of the face in those trucks

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.050 
loading out of the face in those trucks

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
that they'll haul to the crusher we have

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.850

they're<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.590> test<00:02:26.860> engineers<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.670> they're

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
they're the test engineers and they're

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.850 
they're the test engineers and they're
pulling<00:02:28.000> all<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.690> electronic<00:02:29.290> data<00:02:29.500> off<00:02:29.709> the

the<00:02:32.080> data<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.560> make<00:02:32.739> sense<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:33.519> you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the data and make sense of it so you

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.570 
the data and make sense of it so you
take<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.269> time<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.019> then<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.130> have<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.400> third

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
take the time and then we have the third

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.330 
take the time and then we have the third

as<00:04:19.799> possible<00:04:20.310> we<00:04:21.180> will<00:04:21.359> do<00:04:21.600> various<00:04:22.170> runs<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
as possible we will do various runs to

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.470 
as possible we will do various runs to
validate<00:04:23.520> those<00:04:23.670> numbers<00:04:24.090> under<00:04:24.300> different

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
validate those numbers under different

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.080 
validate those numbers under different
conditions<00:04:24.930> under<00:04:25.530> stationary<00:04:26.040> testing<00:04:26.520> so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
conditions under stationary testing so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.750 
conditions under stationary testing so
we<00:04:27.210> understand<00:04:27.660> what<00:04:27.840> our<00:04:27.920> fuel<00:04:28.920> burn<00:04:29.190> rate<00:04:29.460> is

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
we understand what our fuel burn rate is

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.000 
we understand what our fuel burn rate is
it<00:04:30.540> helps<00:04:30.780> them<00:04:30.900> be<00:04:31.020> successful<00:04:31.200> because<00:04:31.860> they

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
it helps them be successful because they

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.470 
it helps them be successful because they
can<00:04:32.160> make<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.340> better<00:04:32.550> choice<00:04:32.640> as<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.090> what

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
can make a better choice as to what

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.360 
can make a better choice as to what
machine<00:04:33.870> they<00:04:34.050> need<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.350> purchase<00:04:34.590> we're

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
making sure that what it says it burned

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.679 
making sure that what it says it burned
it<00:04:39.000> actually<00:04:39.270> did<00:04:39.450> burn

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.869 

what<00:04:45.289> I'm<00:04:45.379> really<00:04:45.679> after<00:04:45.860> is<00:04:46.189> this<00:04:46.519> machine

moves<00:04:47.239> this<00:04:47.389> much<00:04:47.629> material<00:04:47.779> and<00:04:48.319> burns<00:04:49.039> this

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:49.279 
moves this much material and burns this

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.249 
moves this much material and burns this
much<00:04:49.489> fuel<00:04:49.789> that's<00:04:50.539> what<00:04:50.689> the<00:04:50.779> data<00:04:50.929> that<00:04:51.110> we

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
much fuel that's what the data that we

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.719 
much fuel that's what the data that we
need<00:04:51.409> to<00:04:51.499> produce<00:04:51.619> to<00:04:52.039> our<00:04:52.129> customers<00:04:52.580> and
