00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.740
 I'm going to love it 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.099
 decoration and played as a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.099
 drip irrigation system a system 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.680
 to distribute the irrigation dropwise or 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.180
 micro-sprinkler allows you to save 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.920
 while ensuring growth 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 of plants 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.800
 will need a programmer at the beginning 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 followed by a simple 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.080
 hose and its connections one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.920
 irrigation center a distributor of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.170
 edu wolf 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.610
 gilt supports for the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.350
 hose joints lead producers 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.050
 and end-of-line stoppers 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.690
 a micro to the teachers a sprinkler 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.690
 can compute the installation 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.629
 shall be equipped with an x-act or a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.770
 cut and tubes and a mounting wrench 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 multiple function combinations per year 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 put a programmer by the tap 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.000
 and then follow a first 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.040
 power supply to the irrigation 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.159
 possibly a fertilizer distributor 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.780
 then with the installation teams 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 players for the vessels and servants and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.939
 teachers and the masses as 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.220
 install the practical distribution outlet 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.560
 to make automatic irrigation the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.119
 programmer on rocks simply in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.070
 garden lily faucet one of 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.250
 hose ends the outlet of the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.189
 programmer is central to irrigation 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.590
 feed the installation league the hose 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.350
 the edu exit starts with a hose 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.500
 with three millimeters in diameter 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.259
 right outside the control panel can 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 distributor of liquid fertilizer to 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.000
 cover of this rock for the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.969
 The fertilizer placement resumes with the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.190
 hose three millimeters in diameter 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.190
 I want to water potted plants 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.640
 has installed a tap in t is that the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.270
 model with reducer to pass the 3 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.350
 diameter of 4,6 thousand liters 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.210
 I allow deviation from a secondary line 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.590
 use a hose with 4,6 thousand 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.470
 liters for vessels at vessel level 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.390
 flowers places where he saw for entei 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.870
 form two new watering lines 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.970
 guti g2 in line on the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.370
 surface of each vessel the hose is 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.800
 equipped with on-line routers is 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 every 15 or 20 centimeters and after a 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:55.910
 end- of- line router carrying brains 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.740
 from the 1st t lead an installation 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.680
 a hose three millimeters 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.810
 diameter toward the ballot and make 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.140
 get close to the calculations of the bushes 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.380
 near the roots puts a router 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.960
 End of line next to each calculation 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.410
 To fix, make a hole with the 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.870
 mount and even slightly the router and 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.140
 wear hat to hold it to the bottom 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.170
 kabangu weaver to be placed next to 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.610
 side of the hose horizontally and 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.160
 for the calculation of the 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.280
 players puts the hose against the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:42.350
 blocking with the brackets to 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:44.240
 bury and also uses the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.880
 with three millimeters of 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.130
 diameter to water and micro 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.510
 teachers based on a derivation 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.510
 inter se 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.490
 teachers are land fed by 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.620
 three millimeters in diameter 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.720
 this one is able to arrive in fine rain 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.940
 over a few square meters 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.900
 this may be the growth of plants 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:13.130
 by attaching an extension tube to 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.530
 to end the irrigation circuit at the 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.320
 line the ways of three millimeters 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.810
 diameter are keys through a stopper 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.260
 there are also stoppers for hoses 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:28.540
 4.6mm diameter one system 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.540
 evolutionary easy to place
