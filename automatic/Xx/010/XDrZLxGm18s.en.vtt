00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
that looks like I've done a little bit

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.750 
that looks like I've done a little bit
smaller<00:03:34.740> twists<00:03:35.130> than<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.430> did<00:03:35.610> in<00:03:35.640> our

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.220 
smaller twists than I did in our
original<00:03:36.180> post<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.600> go<00:03:36.720> ahead<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:36.960> take<00:03:37.200> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
original post so go ahead and take a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.790 
original post so go ahead and take a
look<00:03:37.350> at<00:03:37.560> those<00:03:37.710> pictures<00:03:38.010> as<00:03:38.340> well<00:03:38.550> and

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
look at those pictures as well and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.870 
look at those pictures as well and
that's<00:03:40.800> how<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.070> do<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> back<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.670> forth

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
that's how you do the back and forth

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.540 
that's how you do the back and forth
half<00:03:42.060> up<00:03:42.240> twist
