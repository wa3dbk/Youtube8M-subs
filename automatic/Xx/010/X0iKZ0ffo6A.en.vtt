00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
cases because I want to curse thing is I

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.109 
cases because I want to curse thing is I
really<00:00:16.020> don't<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.350> many<00:00:16.650> cases<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.970> I

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
really don't have that many cases and I

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.700 
really don't have that many cases and I
couldn't<00:00:18.359> find<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> them<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:19.650> just

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
couldn't find all of them but I'm just

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.349 
couldn't find all of them but I'm just
gonna<00:00:19.890> make<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.850> got<00:00:21.060> right<00:00:21.210> now

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
gonna make do it what I got right now

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.300 
gonna make do it what I got right now
and<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:22.350> guess<00:00:22.529> I'll<00:00:22.680> start<00:00:22.769> off<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.130> this

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and I guess I'll start off with this

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.189 
and I guess I'll start off with this
case<00:00:23.550> cuz<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.180> got<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.600> case<00:00:24.779> file<00:00:25.019> two

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
case cuz I just got this case file two

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.710 
case cuz I just got this case file two
or<00:00:25.320> three<00:00:25.470> hours<00:00:25.740> ago<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.099> them<00:00:26.220> all<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
or three hours ago for them all and the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.970 
or three hours ago for them all and the
reason<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.320> case<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.650> much<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
reason I like this case so much is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.310 
reason I like this case so much is
because<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> little<00:00:30.539> soft<00:00:30.900> case

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
because first it has a little soft case

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.479 
because first it has a little soft case
and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> has<00:00:31.859> two<00:00:31.980> hard<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and then it has two hard one on the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
and then it has two hard one on the
outside<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.940> absolute<00:00:33.210> protection<00:00:33.530> they<00:00:34.530> got

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
outside for absolute protection they got

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.729 
outside for absolute protection they got
put<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.950> together<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:37.440> slip

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
put it together like that and you slip

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
put it together like that and you slip
it<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> couple<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> soft

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it on and I have a couple with the soft

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.760 
it on and I have a couple with the soft
and<00:00:39.960> hard<00:00:39.989> protection<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:42.500> all<00:00:43.500> they<00:00:43.620> got

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and hard protection and all they got

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
and hard protection and all they got
like<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.640> over<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.570> like

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
like one of them over here because like

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.240 
like one of them over here because like
I<00:00:45.960> said<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.170> gonna<00:00:46.260> find<00:00:46.559> other<00:00:46.829> ones<00:00:47.899> but

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
I said I'm gonna find other ones but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.020 
I said I'm gonna find other ones but
after<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> slip<00:00:50.640> down<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:52.219> yeah<00:00:53.570> one<00:00:54.570> second

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
after you slip down on yeah one second

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.840 
after you slip down on yeah one second
hate<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> can't<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> on

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.810 

and<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.050> all<00:01:07.290> though<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.580> main

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and that's not all though the main

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.600 
and that's not all though the main
reason<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.050> has<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> little

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
reason I like it because it has a little

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
reason I like it because it has a little
kickstand<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.050> it's<00:01:13.050> enough<00:01:13.290> sometimes

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
kickstand on it it's enough sometimes

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.690 
kickstand on it it's enough sometimes
you<00:01:13.830> don't<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.190> just<00:01:14.340> hold<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> you'll

the first case that I've ever got just a
Skullcandy<00:03:22.850> case<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:24.320> is<00:03:25.180> brown<00:03:26.180> with<00:03:26.480> the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
Skullcandy case and it is brown with the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.170 
Skullcandy case and it is brown with the
gold<00:03:26.900> trim<00:03:27.230> this<00:03:27.410> kind<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.680> dirty<00:03:27.920> so<00:03:28.220> probably

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
gold trim this kind of dirty so probably

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.240 
gold trim this kind of dirty so probably
have<00:03:29.390> cleaned<00:03:29.600> it

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
have cleaned it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.729 
have cleaned it
-<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.370> call<00:03:31.850> candy<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:33.110> offers<00:03:33.380> pretty<00:03:33.590> good

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
- you call candy it offers pretty good

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.199 
- you call candy it offers pretty good
protection<00:03:34.069> cuz<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.430> drop<00:03:34.670> this<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.850> couple<00:03:35.180> of

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
protection cuz I drop this a couple of

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.560 
protection cuz I drop this a couple of
times<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:36.850> doesn't<00:03:37.850> offer<00:03:38.030> any<00:03:38.330> protection

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
times this doesn't offer any protection

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.300 
times this doesn't offer any protection
because<00:03:39.440> all<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.680> girls<00:03:39.770> are<00:03:39.890> on<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.100> side

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
because all the girls are on the side

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.130 
because all the girls are on the side
but<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.790> adds<00:03:40.940> really<00:03:41.180> good<00:03:41.450> grip<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.780> the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
but it adds really good grip to the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.780 
but it adds really good grip to the
phone<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:44.050> what<00:03:45.050> you<00:03:45.170> do<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:46.250> just<00:03:46.280> slip<00:03:46.580> it<00:03:46.670> on

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
phone so what you do you just slip it on

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.340

in<00:03:51.590> your<00:03:51.739> hand<00:03:53.350> easier<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.470> hold<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.040> it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
in your hand easier to hold so it

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:03.180
