00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello youtube friends in this tutorial 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.179
 I'm going to show you how to clarify images 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.679
 dark in photoshop good first thing 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.900
 what they have to do is have an image 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.600
 that you want to clarify in my case 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.030
 I have this 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.400
 and well what I want to clarify itself 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.080
 are those dark parts that one by 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.970
 there he would like them to be a little 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.860
 clearer even if it had more contrast 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.640
 with the rest of the photo what I mean 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.140
 well these parts here those that remain 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 Backlight that are dark 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.239
 sometimes it is not very good so what 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.690
 today I 'm going to teach you is to illuminate this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.780
 type of dark parts 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.379
 without causing noise or pixelated like you 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.370
 want to call our image by the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.159
 final result that we would be 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.420
 getting this is the first one that I am 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.170
 when I have to do is make a 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.629
 new layer go to the brush select the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.910
 brush the first one that comes out in the list 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 which is blurred to an opacity 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.850
 in fish of 75% 60 71 flow to 100% 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 Now the color palette you 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.910
 they are going to select depends on how much 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.920
 They want to light up their area because they are going to 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.430
 be playing with what is white the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.240
 gray and finally the black so I 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.470
 first to choose a gray whose code is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.880
 to efe 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.820
 efe efe 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.480
 and what I 'm going to do is 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.290
 paint normal 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.390
 in the areas where I want 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.630
 clear out 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.010
 we finish now I am going to go playing with 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.270
 the different types of gray there are 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.520
 as I want 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.990
 clarify the image and once we have 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.289
 the result so the only thing we have 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.850
 which is to go to fusion mode in changing the 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.260
 Fusion mode or our layer to light 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.690
 soft 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.110
 and for you to see instead it's from 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.700
 dark lightens not if you do not like the tone 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.710
 that is in the neck you 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.970
 they keep making more layers playing with the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.410
 color gray or white paint 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.180
 to change it is always the fusion mode 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.400
 it has to be in the soft part 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.690
 the neck has already cleared you can do 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.690
 the same with the arm and good would be 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.220
 more or less like that 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.550
 It does not have to be perfect because 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.550
 as you can see, the whole image is clear 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.730
 and good finally if you want 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.519
 do some extra adjustment can start 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.170
 the background layer and change the levels and 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.359
 with changing levels moving this 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.950
 little arrow here does not matter when you 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.540
 make it will always be clear by 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.819
 the superimposed layers that it has over 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.859
 do not 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.450
 face remains a clear 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.329
 we make the astoria happened 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.450
 image so now I make them a before and 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.450
 one after 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.840
 so if we are just 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.880
 and so how do you fine adjustments 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.500
 They will say how they stayed, I hope you can 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.760
 serve this tutorial and use it 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.890
 for those others in the hours that good 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.069
 we all want to ever fix and we 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.870
 we will be seeing in the next
