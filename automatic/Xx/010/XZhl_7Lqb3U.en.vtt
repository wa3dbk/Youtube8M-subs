00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.389
 version of version 090 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:15.049
 maynkrafta Pocket edishn it Well 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:23.010
 let me show you what's here 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:26.130
 Well , we first added 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.670
 such things are really far from 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.800
 many can say how 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:40.019
 apply yes as many textures 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.640
 Well, just any additions as I can 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:47.000
 say that some blocks here even 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000
 removed 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:54.199
 This is of course a big minus but still 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:01:00.000
 also come up with a texture most likely 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:08.220
 here 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:13.250
 / Well, what else is an emerald block ? 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.250
 then redid the lamp 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:25.320
 also on the delivery of the boiler but now I will show 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.420
 everything is stage decor so to speak 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.620
 that is, in fact we can only 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:41.240
 put these items go in them no way 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:49.159
 Unfortunately, so far I can not also 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:53.250
 what else do we have a taxi grid I 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.820
 pretty much everything else here 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 story ore and spell table 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:04.260
 principle probably all told who 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.830
 wants to have this version on hota 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.830
 fake
