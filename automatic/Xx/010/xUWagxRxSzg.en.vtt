00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
stacking a debuff on them so what you

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.419 
stacking a debuff on them so what you
need<00:01:06.999> to<00:01:07.179> do<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.539> what<00:01:07.689> we<00:01:07.719> did<00:01:08.079> was<00:01:08.530> we<00:01:08.560> formed

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
need to do and what we did was we formed

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.419 
need to do and what we did was we formed
three<00:01:09.789> groups<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.329> people<00:01:11.109> and<00:01:11.320> we<00:01:11.679> stayed

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
three groups of people and we stayed

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.639 
three groups of people and we stayed
spread<00:01:12.700> out<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.119> then<00:01:13.479> one<00:01:13.780> group<00:01:14.020> stacked<00:01:14.439> up

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
spread out and then one group stacked up

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.889 
spread out and then one group stacked up
took<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.130> couple<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.520> spear<00:01:15.789> throws<00:01:16.149> then

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
took a couple of spear throws then

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.510 
took a couple of spear throws then
spread<00:01:17.259> out<00:01:17.380> again<00:01:17.619> another<00:01:17.890> group<00:01:18.189> stacked

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
spread out again another group stacked

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.309 
spread out again another group stacked
up<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.850> we<00:01:19.119> went<00:01:19.329> in<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.509> rotation<00:01:19.840> like<00:01:20.140> this

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
up and we went in a rotation like this

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.620 
up and we went in a rotation like this
to<00:01:20.679> keep<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.340> bosses<00:01:21.549> energy<00:01:22.030> under<00:01:22.240> control

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
to keep the bosses energy under control

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.200 
to keep the bosses energy under control
also<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.289> can<00:01:23.380> see<00:01:23.679> these<00:01:23.859> fire<00:01:24.310> lines<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:25.060> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
you can probably tell we're down one

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
during this phase as well so nothing new

there and the boss is only other ability
during<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.000> phase<00:03:46.240> is<00:03:46.300> that<00:03:46.630> he<00:03:46.900> stuns<00:03:47.560> a

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
during this phase is that he stuns a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.610 
during this phase is that he stuns a
random<00:03:48.250> player<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:48.940> then<00:03:49.480> does<00:03:50.050> frost<00:03:50.410> damage

to<00:03:50.890> everyone<00:03:51.160> around<00:03:51.250> him<00:03:51.580> after<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:51.880> few

seconds<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.990> is<00:03:53.110> probably<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.590> easiest<00:03:53.620> of

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
seconds this is probably the easiest of

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.949 
seconds this is probably the easiest of
the<00:03:54.280> three<00:03:54.430> phases<00:03:54.820> assuming<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.870> was

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.540 

here<00:04:27.540> after<00:04:28.020> exactly<00:04:28.560> 10<00:04:28.770> minutes<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.370> boss

enraged but we were still quite far from
killing<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.420> is<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.720> only<00:04:33.900> attempt

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
killing it this is the only attempt

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.720

where<00:04:34.440> we<00:04:34.530> actually<00:04:34.620> caught<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.310> far<00:04:35.550> into

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
where we actually caught this far into

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.670 
where we actually caught this far into
the<00:04:35.910> fight<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.540> we<00:04:36.750> didn't<00:04:37.170> really<00:04:37.290> have<00:04:37.500> any

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
the fight so we didn't really have any

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.770

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
experience this feels like a final burn

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.980

buff and the enrage timer is probably

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.300 
buff and the enrage timer is probably
going<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.840> be<00:04:54.930> bearing<00:04:55.380> down<00:04:55.590> quite<00:04:55.980> heavily

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310
