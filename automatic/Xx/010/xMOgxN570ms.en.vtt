00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
this is very prone to cracking now you

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.929 
this is very prone to cracking now you

them<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.510> they<00:00:41.660> really<00:00:41.930> wanted<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.230> bark<00:00:42.500> to

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
them and they really wanted the bark to

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.979 
them and they really wanted the bark to
stay<00:00:42.920> on<00:00:43.100> some<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:44.030> look<00:00:44.329> nice<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:44.719> what<00:00:44.870> was

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
stay on some but look nice so what was

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.869 
stay on some but look nice so what was
your<00:00:45.079> approach<00:00:45.320> for<00:00:45.589> that<00:00:45.710> well<00:00:46.219> it<00:00:46.699> took<00:00:46.820> a

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
your approach for that well it took a

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.829 
your approach for that well it took a
green<00:00:47.120> log<00:00:47.329> which<00:00:47.600> someone<00:00:48.260> gave<00:00:48.410> me<00:00:48.589> and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
green log which someone gave me and

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.090 
green log which someone gave me and
tried<00:00:50.839> a<00:00:50.870> couple<00:00:51.199> of<00:00:51.260> methods<00:00:51.469> for<00:00:51.829> cutting

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
tried a couple of methods for cutting

tried a couple of methods for cutting
them<00:00:52.219> but<00:00:52.339> getting<00:00:52.789> them<00:00:52.969> even<00:00:53.300> was<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.480> bit<00:00:53.719> of

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
them but getting them even was a bit of

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.930 
them but getting them even was a bit of
a<00:00:53.870> problem<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:54.440> end<00:00:54.949> up<00:00:55.039> making<00:00:55.219> a<00:00:55.460> sled<00:00:55.730> for

that's been sitting here in my shop the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.310 
that's been sitting here in my shop the
whole<00:01:46.280> time<00:01:46.490> it's<00:01:46.670> pretty<00:01:46.910> dry<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.420> here<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.170> if

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
whole time it's pretty dry in here so if

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.690 
whole time it's pretty dry in here so if
anything<00:01:48.560> was<00:01:48.860> going<00:01:48.980> to<00:01:49.070> cause<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.490> thing

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
anything was going to cause this thing

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.880 
anything was going to cause this thing
to<00:01:49.790> crack<00:01:50.060> being<00:01:50.420> in<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:50.780> environment<00:01:51.170> sure

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
to crack being in this environment sure

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.980 
to crack being in this environment sure
would<00:01:52.070> have<00:01:52.130> made<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.430> happen<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.120> a<00:01:53.300> couple

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
would have made that happen so a couple

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.630 
would have made that happen so a couple
little<00:01:54.140> hairline<00:01:54.620> checks<00:01:55.010> but<00:01:55.220> no<00:01:55.370> Grand

right<00:02:26.770> but<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.860> was<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.070> about<00:02:28.190> blade

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
right but it was all about blade

right but it was all about blade
selection<00:02:29.030> right<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> used<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.780> real<00:02:29.990> fine

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200

six toothbrush blade and the finish came

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.040 
six toothbrush blade and the finish came
out<00:02:36.230> because<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.740> wood<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:36.950> fairly<00:02:37.720> soft<00:02:38.720> when

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
out because the wood is fairly soft when

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.990 
out because the wood is fairly soft when
it's<00:02:39.230> wet<00:02:39.410> like<00:02:39.620> this<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.430> came<00:02:40.610> out<00:02:40.760> very<00:02:40.970> much

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
it's wet like this it came out very much

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.120 
it's wet like this it came out very much
and<00:02:41.810> that's<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.020> big<00:02:42.200> deal<00:02:42.380> because<00:02:42.650> sand<00:02:43.010> and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
and that's a big deal because sand and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.860 
and that's a big deal because sand and
the<00:02:43.190> strip<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.700> grew<00:02:44.060> up<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.270> green<00:02:44.540> wet

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the strip and we grew up in green wet

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.800 
the strip and we grew up in green wet
wood<00:02:45.230> would<00:02:45.890> clog<00:02:46.340> your<00:02:46.520> sandpaper<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.270> like

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
wood would clog your sandpaper just like

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.840 
wood would clog your sandpaper just like
that<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.590> right<00:02:48.860> off<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.190> went<00:02:49.340> right<00:02:49.700> off<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
that so right off you went right off the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.060 
that so right off you went right off the
bandsaw<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.690> Penta<00:02:51.020> crow<00:02:51.320> once<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
bandsaw to the Penta crow once the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.860 
bandsaw to the Penta crow once the
pentagirls<00:02:52.430> had<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.640> chance<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.060> do<00:02:53.180> which<00:02:53.330> job

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
pentagirls had a chance to do which job

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.840 
pentagirls had a chance to do which job
a<00:02:54.170> little<00:02:54.740> bit<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.950> top<00:02:55.130> coat<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.520> here<00:02:55.700> what'd

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
a little bit of top coat on here what'd

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.000 
a little bit of top coat on here what'd
you<00:02:55.940> use<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:56.600> used<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.020> just<00:02:57.830> a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
you use for that I used to just a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.430 
you use for that I used to just a
polyurethane<00:02:58.490> said<00:02:59.060> okay<00:02:59.600> so<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.380> a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
polyurethane said okay so this is a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.350 
polyurethane said okay so this is a
great<00:03:00.650> recipe<00:03:00.830> AJ<00:03:01.340> came<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.760> with<00:03:01.940> here<00:03:02.150> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
great recipe AJ came up with here a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.780 
great recipe AJ came up with here a
bunch<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.840> components<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.350> think<00:03:03.590> about<00:03:03.790> that

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
bunch of components to think about that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
sled is on the wwg Oh a site so you can

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.650

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
have a look at that make sure you're

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.160 
have a look at that make sure you're
cutting<00:03:08.840> these<00:03:09.020> things<00:03:09.080> safely<00:03:09.680> then<00:03:10.400> the
