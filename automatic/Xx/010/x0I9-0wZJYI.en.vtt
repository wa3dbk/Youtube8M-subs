keyboard<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.330> 10.1<00:01:19.870> inch<00:01:20.020> netbook<00:01:20.470> on

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
keyboard on this 10.1 inch netbook on

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.490 
keyboard on this 10.1 inch netbook on
the<00:01:22.030> front<00:01:22.270> we<00:01:22.390> have<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.600> power<00:01:22.900> this<00:01:23.350> is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
the front we have the power this is

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.020 
the front we have the power this is
where<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.740> battery<00:01:24.040> would<00:01:24.190> go<00:01:24.340> it's<00:01:24.640> actually

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
where the battery would go it's actually

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.750 
where the battery would go it's actually
a<00:01:25.060> four<00:01:25.330> cell<00:01:25.570> battery<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.040> should<00:01:27.220> for

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
a four cell battery so we should for

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.130 
a four cell battery so we should for
these<00:01:27.880> four<00:01:28.150> thousand<00:01:28.510> four<00:01:28.690> hundred<00:01:28.780> milli

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
these four thousand four hundred milli

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.860 
these four thousand four hundred milli
amperes<00:01:29.470> or<00:01:29.560> four<00:01:29.770> thousand<00:01:30.130> eight<00:01:30.280> hundred

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
amperes or four thousand eight hundred

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.210 
amperes or four thousand eight hundred
so<00:01:31.870> we're<00:01:32.170> looking<00:01:32.410> at<00:01:32.500> about<00:01:32.619> four<00:01:32.860> hours<00:01:32.979> of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
so we're looking at about four hours of

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.130 
so we're looking at about four hours of
online<00:01:33.369> ton<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:33.880> model<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:34.390> I'm<00:01:34.540> told

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
online ton of this model so I'm told

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.820 
online ton of this model so I'm told
so<00:01:35.710> one<00:01:36.700> point<00:01:36.940> for<00:01:37.119> me<00:01:37.150> pixel<00:01:37.570> camera<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
so one point for me pixel camera and the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.490 
so one point for me pixel camera and the
microphone<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:39.550> down<00:01:39.760> here<00:01:40.050> do<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.080> quick<00:01:41.320> walk

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
microphone is down here do a quick walk

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.760 
microphone is down here do a quick walk
around<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.920> system<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:44.020> similar<00:01:44.350> than<00:01:44.650> you

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
around the system very similar than you

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.120 
around the system very similar than you
but<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.420> battery<00:01:46.780> life<00:01:46.960> definitely<00:01:47.860> makes<00:01:48.009> a

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
but the battery life definitely makes a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.790 
but the battery life definitely makes a
little<00:01:48.250> bit<00:01:48.369> different<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:50.290> will<00:01:50.470> walk<00:01:50.619> around

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
little bit different so will walk around

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.840
