00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.940
 you are a fan of video games six 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.890
 by chance a penniless student a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.839
 poor worker who lives on a few 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.490
 small change a month for sure 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.799
 prefers to spend to survive 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.360
 rather than for his passions 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.279
 you would often like to buy games 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.429
 interesting but video game stores 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.500
 pieces say you are fired evenly 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:30.269
 to the sizes of the sought after in one piece 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 well, your cocks are a joke of course 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.560
 even a poor level like you has 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.780
 right to play something without 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.170
 download anyway pirated games 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.840
 that then they throw you virus in the pc even if 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.000
 actually we know very well that it is not 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 for downloaded games you find yourself 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.060
 smallpox virus 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.790
 in any case what it does for you is a 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.240
 practical help to have original games 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.290
 at low prices but I say lows 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.690
 very low 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:06.000
 let's start right away with the simple rules 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.220
 that the number one can help you 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.890
 PC games cost less than those 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.320
 for consoles, however, don't worry 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 I will also design how good games for 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.260
 console at lower prices in small 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 consular number two 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.000
 digital games are cheaper than 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 the physical ones but I know equally well that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 if some of you don't put on a stove 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.340
 of the package just opened not 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 They are sure of the number 3 charity 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 it is good not only for the parma but sometimes 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.320
 also to the portfolio for some of you 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.110
 this sentence will seem a troika but in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.000
 reality and the number four is not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.950
 find out your game and see if 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.280
 actually the case of spending on it 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.440
 above cioni have an idea about the game 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.869
 it means the stila trauma forum reveals it 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.950
 series reviews can help 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.259
 however no gameplay thanks number 5 though 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.659
 I like a game you don't have to force a 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.200
 buy it from the devil especially if you are 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.590
 is a future flow number 6 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.790
 at Christmas time under the holidays are all 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 more good 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.940
 or almost number7 download illegally 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.780
 it doesn't make sense especially if it is 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.480
 of your favorite games number 8 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.000
 Online purchases can help more 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.910
 of any card level 3 from of 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.209
 fuck number 9 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.209
 sorry my dear consular but the pc 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.910
 always has an extra gear and more 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.220
 for digital not only for prices but 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.489
 also by way of leinÃ¬ kakuro who do the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.160
 video cards number 10 regulates more 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.769
 important only because it costs little not 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.780
 it means that the purchase is worth it 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.480
 be the game and fashion can be the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.970
 cooler game but if in principle not 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 you like it or even worse you are not 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.140
 capable 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.019
 let it go and don't waste money on it 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.900
 a cagata means having more of it 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.850
 future for a more beautiful unless 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.660
 be it a gift but in that case 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.989
 you are right well and this is alone 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.100
 the beginning that the aera of spenders 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.100
 penniless start
