00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.570
 hello everyone ruslan with you again and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.690
 today we will do the next 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:20.619
 dent that's such a longitudinal strip 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:25.750
 she is at the bottom of the door to do 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:28.359
 we will be her that way the door will be at 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.680
 we filmed for this we have already removed 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:47.860
 lining the dent we got on 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:50.290
 amplifier amplifier as she 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.310
 amplifier rested we see here 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.890
 here are the bumps though he walks in and 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.750
 she has such bumps here of course 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.900
 grow a little metal 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.130
 but the shape of the door itself will allow us 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.770
 make it impossible to see it 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.590
 we have more nuance is not a door at 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.750
 Crash Well, let's get down to the new 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:21.690
 the door and we will do it here we look like 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:27.659
 we have a dent already taken parts 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:35.940
 now I will show you try painting 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.940
 such paint here was not behind the door 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.150
 we see that painting is like budget 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.979
 whoever painted us doesn't care about 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.299
 principle we have a challenge 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:56.610
 align this dents also also 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.610
 budget for a minimum of money 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.420
 We will not immediately cut off the amplifiers 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.860
 first we align those places go us 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.190
 there is free access 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.739
 and then cut it off because it's not there 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.750
 stretched it will play if its 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.760
 Immediately cut 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.950
 here we have suppressed part here and here 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.980
 this part of us falls clearly on 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.760
 power there tight sealant here here 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.760
 such a knife such a knife is now cut 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:43.390
 We look at the intermediate version like this 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:47.560
 here is the form we see a little metal here 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:52.840
 stretched but this lump as if it can be 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:57.310
 pull here and here failure here 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.109
 so not for you of course he is all 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.109
 much better 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:16.349
 still a little bit by doing again 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.230
 I repeat we do not need and lead to the ideal 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:23.560
 see here also here chipped 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.840
 upon impact form an edge well and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:32.890
 window dressing but here it is the finished result as 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.340
 I spoke to the butt so we look 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.579
 nothing is visible when viewed at an angle 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.860
 then there is such a rough usa crap metal 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.829
 slightly stretched 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:53.340
 angle can be seen and small smooth 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:56.370
 Bending in the form of cones made three 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.879
 I'll throw it out by sea according to the requirements 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.879
 who asked
