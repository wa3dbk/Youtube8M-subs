the last quite a while as well which is
really<00:00:45.390> good<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.780> me<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:47.039> home<00:00:47.219> bargains<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950 
bought her some of the super-compressed
snowflake<00:00:50.129> meadow<00:00:50.370> hay<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.690> only<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
snowflake meadow hay and it was only a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
snowflake meadow hay and it was only a
pound<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.620> thought<00:00:52.829> I'd<00:00:53.070> buy<00:00:53.309> some<00:00:53.640> for

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
pound so I thought I'd buy some for

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.729 
pound so I thought I'd buy some for
since<00:00:54.239> she<00:00:54.390> hasn't<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.020> any<00:00:55.199> before<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
since she hasn't really had any before I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.260 
since she hasn't really had any before I
actually<00:00:55.890> did<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> review<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.820> them<00:00:57.059> which<00:00:57.239> is

actually did a review on them which is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090 
actually did a review on them which is
why<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> bags<00:00:57.840> slightly<00:00:58.350> open<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:58.829> bit

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
why the bags slightly open a little bit

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979
