as<00:05:26.190> well<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:27.570> know<00:05:27.690> if<00:05:27.810> you're<00:05:27.960> getting

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
as well and you know if you're getting

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.200 
as well and you know if you're getting
paid<00:05:28.380> $25<00:05:29.130> an<00:05:29.220> hour<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.520> can<00:05:29.640> pay<00:05:29.790> somebody<00:05:30.030> in

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
paid $25 an hour you can pay somebody in

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.430 
paid $25 an hour you can pay somebody in
the<00:05:30.270> Philippines<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.840> do<00:05:30.960> for<00:05:31.169> three<00:05:31.260> dollars

the Philippines to do for three dollars

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.740 
the Philippines to do for three dollars
an<00:05:31.770> hour<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.220> thereby<00:05:32.820> gain<00:05:33.210> some<00:05:33.419> serious

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
an hour and thereby gain some serious

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.430 
an hour and thereby gain some serious
leverage<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.430> there's<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:36.450> overall<00:05:36.930> concept

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
leverage so there's the overall concept

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.790 
leverage so there's the overall concept

important things at that time and that's
such<00:06:18.390> a<00:06:18.419> bad<00:06:18.690> way<00:06:18.720> of<00:06:18.990> putting<00:06:19.290> it<00:06:19.410> but<00:06:19.470> you

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
such a bad way of putting it but you

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.460 
such a bad way of putting it but you

doesn't<00:06:27.479> make<00:06:27.750> a<00:06:27.810> difference<00:06:27.900> if<00:06:28.530> you

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
doesn't make a difference if you

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.590 
doesn't make a difference if you
source<00:06:29.250> everything<00:06:29.730> if<00:06:30.000> the<00:06:30.210> things<00:06:30.420> that

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
source everything if the things that

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.790 
source everything if the things that
you're<00:06:30.660> outsourcing<00:06:30.960> are<00:06:31.320> important<00:06:31.650> to<00:06:31.710> the
