00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
easily you can add Ram when you need to

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.350 
easily you can add Ram when you need to
video<00:04:25.380> cards<00:04:25.890> Amisha<00:04:26.580> well<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:26.970> mean<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.240> can

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
video cards Amisha well I mean you can

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.120 
video cards Amisha well I mean you can
do<00:04:27.420> that<00:04:27.570> any<00:04:27.780> system<00:04:28.110> but<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> point<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.950> is

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
do that any system but the point is is

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.510 
do that any system but the point is is
that<00:04:29.160> HP's<00:04:29.790> engineers<00:04:30.300> took<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.780> time<00:04:31.520> to

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
that HP's engineers took the time to

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.990 
that HP's engineers took the time to
make<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:32.820> easier<00:04:33.150> yeah<00:04:33.960> yes<00:04:34.890> much<00:04:35.220> easier<00:04:35.640> much

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
make it easier yeah yes much easier much

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.550 
make it easier yeah yes much easier much
easier<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.750> they're<00:04:36.900> on<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.140> right<00:04:37.260> track

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
easier so they're on the right track

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.390 
easier so they're on the right track
yeah<00:04:39.260> that's<00:04:40.260> your<00:04:40.650> opinion<00:04:40.920> about<00:04:41.340> it

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
yeah that's your opinion about it

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.010 
yeah that's your opinion about it
because<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:42.000> don't<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.390> know<00:04:42.540> that's<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.990> really

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
because I don't I know that's a really

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.640 
because I don't I know that's a really
great<00:04:43.350> gaming<00:04:43.710> PC<00:04:44.480> console<00:04:45.480> but<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.470> just

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
great gaming PC console but I just

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.560 
great gaming PC console but I just
wanted<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:46.980> know<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.160> what<00:04:47.910> kind<00:04:47.970> what<00:04:48.390> does

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
wanted to know like what kind what does

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.240 
wanted to know like what kind what does
it<00:04:48.690> do<00:04:48.840> as<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.050> computer<00:04:49.910> well<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.180> I<00:04:51.390> mean<00:04:51.750> and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
it do as a computer well it's I mean and

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.970 
it do as a computer well it's I mean and
at<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.400> baseline<00:04:53.670> it's<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.720> computer<00:04:55.110> okay<00:04:55.470> you

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
at the baseline it's a computer okay you

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.590 
at the baseline it's a computer okay you
have<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.280> look<00:04:56.370> at<00:04:56.520> everything<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.300> goes

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
have to look at everything that goes

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.240 
have to look at everything that goes
into<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.870> as<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.140> point<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.560> out<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.920> you're

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
into it as you point it out and you're

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.100 
into it as you point it out and you're
looking<00:04:59.430> at<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.760> right<00:04:59.940> things<00:05:00.240> they<00:05:00.780> took

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
looking at the right things they took

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.550 
looking at the right things they took
their<00:05:01.470> time<00:05:01.790> with<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:03.300> computer<00:05:03.900> they<00:05:04.260> took

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
their time with the computer they took

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.650 
their time with the computer they took
their<00:05:04.800> time<00:05:04.830> with<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.580> you<00:05:05.970> see<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.450> and

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
their time with it and you see that and

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.230 
their time with it and you see that and
you<00:05:06.990> understand<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.370> they

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
you understand that and that they

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.090 
you understand that and that they
deserve<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.600> be<00:05:09.840> validated<00:05:10.380> for<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.770> point

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
deserve to be validated for that point

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.060 
deserve to be validated for that point
specifically<00:05:12.030> why<00:05:12.780> I<00:05:12.810> don't<00:05:13.680> know<00:05:13.770> why<00:05:13.890> you'd

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
specifically why I don't know why you'd

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.040 
specifically why I don't know why you'd
even<00:05:14.130> be<00:05:14.310> thinking<00:05:14.700> about<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.970> Mac<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.540> don't

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
even be thinking about a Mac I don't

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.780 
even be thinking about a Mac I don't
yeah<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:19.670> good<00:05:20.670> computer<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:22.770> don't<00:05:23.070> have<00:05:23.400> one<00:05:23.610> I

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
yeah a good computer I don't have one I

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.980 
yeah a good computer I don't have one I
can't<00:05:24.030> tell<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.330> whether<00:05:24.510> or<00:05:24.600> not<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.870> is<00:05:24.900> a

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
can't tell you whether or not it is a

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.920 
can't tell you whether or not it is a
good<00:05:25.230> one<00:05:25.350> or<00:05:25.410> not<00:05:25.530> but<00:05:25.950> I<00:05:26.850> know<00:05:27.300> the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
good one or not but I know the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.380 
good one or not but I know the
engineering<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:28.620> went<00:05:28.860> into<00:05:29.010> it<00:05:29.460> was<00:05:30.150> more

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
engineering that went into it was more

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.180 
engineering that went into it was more
than<00:05:30.540> just<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.870> slap<00:05:31.290> a<00:05:31.320> component<00:05:31.800> here<00:05:31.890> slap<00:05:32.160> a

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
than just a slap a component here slap a

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.000 
than just a slap a component here slap a
component<00:05:32.520> there<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.410> is<00:05:34.410> much<00:05:34.800> more

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
component there and that is much more

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.760 
component there and that is much more
important<00:05:35.490> is<00:05:36.270> it<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.570> good<00:05:36.720> computer<00:05:37.050> oh<00:05:37.320> I

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
important is it a good computer oh I

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.940 
important is it a good computer oh I
don't<00:05:37.890> I<00:05:38.220> don't<00:05:38.280> have<00:05:38.460> one<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:39.500> can't<00:05:40.500> afford<00:05:40.650> to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
don't I don't have one I can't afford to

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.840 
don't I don't have one I can't afford to
buy<00:05:41.220> some<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:42.000> only<00:05:42.720> have<00:05:42.930> so<00:05:43.110> much<00:05:43.260> space<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.980> I

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
buy some I only have so much space and I

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.040 
buy some I only have so much space and I
can<00:05:45.030> afford<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.720> buy<00:05:45.840> so<00:05:46.140> much<00:05:46.290> hardware<00:05:48.050> but

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
can afford to buy so much hardware but

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.990 
can afford to buy so much hardware but
no<00:05:49.230> if<00:05:49.350> you<00:05:49.830> do<00:05:49.950> get<00:05:50.130> decide<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.580> get<00:05:50.700> one<00:05:50.850> it
