00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.100
 one of the basic survival rule 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.650
 says we can be three minutes without 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.049
 air three days without water three weeks without 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 food and that's very relative that would have 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.860
 be in perfect condition without 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.120
 make efforts here in the snow 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.990
 besides the effort that we have of 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.359
 walk 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.490
 we have the typical shooting we found in 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 hypothermia that spends a lot of energy 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 if we see that energy is being wasted 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.210
 and we can not continue it 's time to stop 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.439
 to eat and replenish that energy here in the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.330
 nature if we do not find anything in the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.309
 backpack you can find food if 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.890
 you know how for example here we have 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.930
 pine trees that with the pine needle on 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.450
 all with the youngest needles these 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.790
 here 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.000
 you can make an infusion if you can 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.440
 catch the tip is worth here where 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.110
 we would find all the pollen with which 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.840
 the infusion gains a lot inside this 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.280
 we have also 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 I think that what we are going to 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 find between the outer bark 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.910
 and what would be the trunk 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.280
 there is a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.650
 like a filament called changes 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.740
 which is precisely so called because 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.030
 is where the outer crust ends and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.290
 will start the inner trunk that is eaten 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.290
 those that have a great flavor 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.040
 because I have a great flavor but if not 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.040
 we have nothing else is edible 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.170
 this here is this that is white 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.049
 and brown 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.940
 this here is the change this from here 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.450
 yes yes you boil it that way 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.760
 hard to eat is not bad but if you do 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.910
 a boil out of the fiber and it's 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.500
 much better to eat finally if 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.050
 we need protein what we will have 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.490
 what to do is look for a dry trunk and see 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 if we find some kind of insect 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.250
 termite also inside that we can 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.350
 ingest to be able to eat protein 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.380
 as you see here this something fallen we have 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.550
 a lot of holes is to say that this 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.780
 tree is being attacked by the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.270
 termites what are we going to do now 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.319
 is to lift the bark to try 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.319
 look for these termites 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.600
 it is here there are enough that are of a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.860
 family is very tiny little 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.860
 I could see her with the Kabbalah 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.230
 so you realize 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.100
 the meat protein of the cow by 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.620
 example would be around 23% 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.560
 what would be insects termites of this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.760
 guy would be hovering around 70 so 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.640
 you understand that all add up and that they are 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.200
 you can go eating the fact 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.000
 of eating this is what can mark the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.680
 difference between leaving here or you 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.680
 hit a power slump and not get out
