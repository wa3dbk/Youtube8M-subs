00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
radiator down at the front of the case

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.369 
radiator down at the front of the case
you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.110> behind<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:39.379> I've

you can see just behind here and I've
got<00:00:40.800> four<00:00:41.340> hundred<00:00:41.670> twenty<00:00:41.940> millimeter<00:00:42.480> fans

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
got four hundred twenty millimeter fans

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
got four hundred twenty millimeter fans
so<00:00:44.670> I've<00:00:44.789> attached<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> case<00:00:45.719> fans<00:00:46.020> at

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
so I've attached it to the case fans at

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
so I've attached it to the case fans at
the<00:00:46.289> front<00:00:47.210> which<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:49.760> pushing<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the front which are pushing and then to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.959 
the front which are pushing and then to
120<00:00:52.680> millimeter<00:00:53.039> fans<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> back<00:00:53.579> which

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
120 millimeter fans on the back which

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.779 
120 millimeter fans on the back which
are<00:00:54.239> pulling<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:55.649> basically<00:00:56.039> mean<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.520> can

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
are pulling which basically mean I can

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.990 
are pulling which basically mean I can
run<00:00:56.940> my<00:00:56.969> CPU<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.170> didn't<00:00:59.010> want<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> increase<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
run my CPU I didn't want to increase the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520 
run my CPU I didn't want to increase the
Volt's<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.390> anything<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.140> running<00:01:01.440> out

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Volt's or anything so it's running out

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.340 
Volt's or anything so it's running out
for<00:01:01.800> gigs<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:03.210> keeps<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.690> very<00:01:04.019> cool

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
for gigs and it keeps it very cool

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.370 
for gigs and it keeps it very cool
indeed<00:01:06.049> unfortunately<00:01:07.049> when<00:01:07.140> you've<00:01:07.260> got

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
indeed unfortunately when you've got

indeed unfortunately when you've got
this<00:01:07.500> many<00:01:07.770> fans<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.400> into<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.939> computer

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
this many fans going into your computer

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.770 
this many fans going into your computer
it<00:01:09.960> does<00:01:10.409> take<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.880> lot<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.150> dust<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> can

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it does take in a lot of dust as you can

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.820 
it does take in a lot of dust as you can
see<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.549> just<00:01:14.549> had<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> clean<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.540> out

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
but as you can see it is possible to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.600 
but as you can see it is possible to
mount<00:01:19.380> an<00:01:19.740> H<00:01:19.920> 100<00:01:20.610> inside<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.600> intact<00:01:22.140> and

even remember now I think it was less
than<00:01:34.409> 80<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.820> maybe<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> was<00:01:36.210> even<00:01:36.299> 70<00:01:36.720> less

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
than 80 and or maybe it was even 70 less

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.140 
than 80 and or maybe it was even 70 less
than<00:01:36.990> 70<00:01:37.350> pounds<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:39.030> hundred

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
than 70 pounds that is about hundred

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.260 
than 70 pounds that is about hundred
dollars<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.530> fully<00:01:40.799> recommend<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.430> I've

that<00:01:57.990> they're<00:01:58.140> fairly<00:01:58.350> good<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:58.920> such

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that they're fairly good and if such

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.100 
that they're fairly good and if such
nightmares<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.180> happen<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.869> basically

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
nightmares do happen and they basically

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
nightmares do happen and they basically
like<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.890> pay<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.430> all<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> damage<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.119> cost

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
like I pay for all the damage this cost

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
like I pay for all the damage this cost
hopefully<00:02:04.409> doesn't<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:04.860> hard<00:02:05.009> drives

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
hopefully doesn't get your hard drives

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.719 
hopefully doesn't get your hard drives
so<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.360> can<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.509> down<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.640> because<00:02:08.640> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so as you can see down there I because I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
so as you can see down there I because I
installed<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> radiator<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.140> took<00:02:10.319> up

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
installed the radiator it took up

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.320 
installed the radiator it took up
basically<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> slots<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> had<00:02:12.209> to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
basically all of the slots and I had to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.580 
basically all of the slots and I had to
take

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
take

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.650 
take
Cathi<00:02:13.040> hard<00:02:13.879> drive<00:02:14.239> cage<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.620> instead<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.660> got

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
Cathi hard drive cage so instead I got

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.050 
Cathi hard drive cage so instead I got
one<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.959> these<00:02:18.550> three<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.670> half<00:02:19.819> inch

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
one of these three and a half inch

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.610 
one of these three and a half inch
mounts<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:21.670> whatever<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.849> is<00:02:23.410> basically<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
mounts to whatever it is basically the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.530 
mounts to whatever it is basically the
mount<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.950> make<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.370> fit<00:02:25.580> inside<00:02:25.940> these<00:02:26.180> slots

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
mount to make it fit inside these slots

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.800 
mount to make it fit inside these slots
I<00:02:26.720> can't<00:02:26.959> remember<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.410> inches<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:29.750> I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
I can't remember the inches and so I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.270 
I can't remember the inches and so I
mounted<00:02:30.110> my<00:02:30.170> hard<00:02:30.349> drive<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.680> there<00:02:30.890> which<00:02:31.160> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
mounted my hard drive up there which is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.530 
mounted my hard drive up there which is
just<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.519> standard<00:02:31.700> hard<00:02:31.970> drive<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.299> now<00:02:32.390> we've

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
just a standard hard drive and now we've

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.830 
just a standard hard drive and now we've
got<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.750> blu-ray<00:02:32.930> drive<00:02:33.230> above<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
got the blu-ray drive above it and that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.630 
got the blu-ray drive above it and that
means<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.349> there's<00:02:36.530> barely<00:02:36.709> any<00:02:36.950> room<00:02:37.190> for

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
means that there's barely any room for

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.430 
means that there's barely any room for
the<00:02:37.970> solid<00:02:38.450> state<00:02:38.629> drive<00:02:38.840> which<00:02:39.049> I<00:02:39.230> I

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the solid state drive which I I

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.080 
the solid state drive which I I
basically<00:02:39.860> have<00:02:40.040> at<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.220> bottom<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.819> just

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
basically have at the bottom and I just

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.539 
basically have at the bottom and I just
randomly<00:02:41.720> attached<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.440> mount<00:02:42.650> with<00:02:42.950> one<00:02:43.220> screw

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
randomly attached a mount with one screw

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.250 
randomly attached a mount with one screw
and<00:02:43.670> there<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.480> go<00:02:44.599> it<00:02:44.690> seems<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.049> be<00:02:45.140> working

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
and there you go it seems to be working

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.370 
and there you go it seems to be working
out<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:45.860> that's<00:02:46.040> fine<00:02:47.049> even<00:02:48.049> though<00:02:48.170> I'm

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
out so that's fine even though I'm

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.370 
out so that's fine even though I'm
running<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:49.400> quad<00:02:50.180> core<00:02:50.390> at<00:02:50.569> four<00:02:50.810> gigs<00:02:51.049> and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
running a quad core at four gigs and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.589 
running a quad core at four gigs and
I've<00:02:51.530> also<00:02:51.680> got<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.989> gtx<00:02:53.989> 560<00:02:54.290> TI<00:02:55.450> which<00:02:56.450> is

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
I've also got this gtx 560 TI which is

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.259 
I've also got this gtx 560 TI which is
actually<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> triple<00:02:57.260> slot<00:02:57.950> cooler<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:59.000> I

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
actually a triple slot cooler but I

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.509 
actually a triple slot cooler but I
don't<00:02:59.569> think<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.750> cool<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.079> that<00:03:00.230> good<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.650> only

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
don't think the cool is that good I only

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.550 
don't think the cool is that good I only
got<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:01.879> because<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.360> was<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.540> cheapest<00:03:02.930> 560

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
got this because it was the cheapest 560

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.860 
got this because it was the cheapest 560
Ti<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.220> was<00:03:04.340> mispriced<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.510> managed<00:03:05.810> to

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
Ti that was mispriced and I managed to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.789 
Ti that was mispriced and I managed to
get<00:03:06.049> it<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.410> year<00:03:07.099> ago<00:03:07.340> now<00:03:07.549> for<00:03:08.290> 125<00:03:09.290> pounds

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
get it a year ago now for 125 pounds

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:10.949 
get it a year ago now for 125 pounds
which<00:03:09.920> was<00:03:10.069> pretty<00:03:10.250> decent

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
which was pretty decent

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.020 
which was pretty decent
but<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.470> power<00:03:12.709> supply<00:03:13.099> I<00:03:13.280> fully<00:03:13.700> recommend

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
but this power supply I fully recommend

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.000 
but this power supply I fully recommend
course<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.540> knows<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.900> written<00:03:15.620> upside<00:03:15.860> down

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
course I knows is written upside down

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.289 
course I knows is written upside down
which<00:03:16.129> is<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.340> stupid<00:03:16.549> considering<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.120> fan

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
which is this stupid considering the fan

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.430 
which is this stupid considering the fan
will<00:03:17.450> go<00:03:17.540> up<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.720> way<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.930> guess<00:03:18.139> this<00:03:18.290> is

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
will go up that way I guess this is

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.110 
will go up that way I guess this is

you have in the bottom one thing I will

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
getting this rig to start so what I

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.539 
getting this rig to start so what I
ended<00:04:04.430> up<00:04:04.519> doing<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:05.000> using<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.660> paperclip

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
ended up doing is using the paperclip

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.520 
ended up doing is using the paperclip
you<00:04:07.549> attach<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:08.060> paperclip<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.290> green

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
you attach the paperclip to the green

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.069 
you attach the paperclip to the green
wire<00:04:09.739> that<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:10.069> see<00:04:10.250> there<00:04:10.459> on<00:04:10.639> your<00:04:11.079> 24-pin

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
wire that you see there on your 24-pin

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.520 
wire that you see there on your 24-pin
motherboard<00:04:12.880> power<00:04:13.880> supply<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.419> then<00:04:15.290> you

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
motherboard power supply and then you

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.469 
motherboard power supply and then you
wire<00:04:15.889> it<00:04:15.919> up<00:04:16.099> to<00:04:16.220> one<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.459> blacks<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.060> then

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
wire it up to one of the blacks and then

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.080 
wire it up to one of the blacks and then
you<00:04:17.720> should<00:04:17.900> be<00:04:18.019> able<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.459> start<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.760> power

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
you should be able to start the power

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.759 
you should be able to start the power
supply<00:04:20.450> without<00:04:20.750> actually<00:04:21.229> having<00:04:21.440> a

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
supply without actually having a

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.529 
supply without actually having a
attached<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.789> motherboard<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.270> everything

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
attached to a motherboard and everything

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.430 
attached to a motherboard and everything
anyway<00:04:24.080> guys<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.650> hope<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.099> liked<00:04:25.729> looking

anyway guys I hope you liked looking
side<00:04:26.710> my<00:04:27.070> computer<00:04:27.670> and<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.990> can<00:04:29.110> see<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.260> keep

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
side my computer and you can see I keep

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.100 
side my computer and you can see I keep
it<00:04:29.560> very<00:04:29.710> tidy<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:30.220> I'm<00:04:30.310> not<00:04:30.430> like<00:04:30.700> completely

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
it very tidy but I'm not like completely

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.500 
it very tidy but I'm not like completely
ridiculously<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.560> know<00:04:32.920> about<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.460> wiring<00:04:34.360> as

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
ridiculously I know about the wiring as

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.530 
ridiculously I know about the wiring as
you<00:04:34.600> can<00:04:34.780> see<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.830> when<00:04:36.670> you've<00:04:36.790> got<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:37.030> closed

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
you can see but when you've got a closed

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.940 
you can see but when you've got a closed
circuit<00:04:38.200> water<00:04:38.380> cooler

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
circuit water cooler

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.590 
circuit water cooler
really<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.460> air<00:04:39.580> through<00:04:39.850> through<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.330> clay

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
really the air through through the clay

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.780 
really the air through through the clay
the<00:04:40.930> case<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.410> case<00:04:41.650> isn't<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.280> important

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
the case the case isn't that important

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.210 
the case the case isn't that important
so<00:04:43.510> yeah<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.350> we<00:04:44.530> do<00:04:44.680> also<00:04:44.890> have<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.420> fatality

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
ex by card which are probably completely

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.330 
ex by card which are probably completely
pointless<00:04:50.080> maybe<00:04:50.560> one<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.920> guys<00:04:51.100> will

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
pointless maybe one of you guys will

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.950 
pointless maybe one of you guys will
tell<00:04:51.520> me<00:04:51.700> if<00:04:51.820> my<00:04:52.030> motherboard<00:04:52.360> sound<00:04:52.810> is

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
tell me if my motherboard sound is

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.470 
tell me if my motherboard sound is
actually<00:04:53.110> better<00:04:53.530> than<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.890> dedicated<00:04:54.700> XY<00:04:55.150> card

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
actually better than a dedicated XY card

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.100 
actually better than a dedicated XY card
or<00:04:55.630> not<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.990> don't<00:04:56.410> even<00:04:56.590> know<00:04:56.860> our<00:04:57.810> outputs<00:04:58.810> for

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
or not I don't even know our outputs for

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.110 
or not I don't even know our outputs for
the<00:04:59.170> motherboard<00:04:59.500> sound<00:04:59.950> we<00:05:00.700> actually<00:05:01.000> even

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
the motherboard sound we actually even

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.120 
the motherboard sound we actually even
have<00:05:01.330> a<00:05:01.360> an<00:05:01.840> optical<00:05:02.350> cable<00:05:02.530> output<00:05:03.010> there

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
have a an optical cable output there

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.220 
have a an optical cable output there
which<00:05:03.250> is<00:05:03.340> quite<00:05:03.460> nice<00:05:03.700> but<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.390> blew<00:05:05.020> some

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
speakers up so to say which is quite

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.770

disappointing<00:05:08.460> but<00:05:09.460> yeah<00:05:09.700> this<00:05:10.480> motherboard

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
disappointing but yeah this motherboard

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.910 
disappointing but yeah this motherboard
is<00:05:10.930> really<00:05:11.080> good<00:05:11.200> has<00:05:11.290> even<00:05:11.470> got<00:05:11.590> an<00:05:11.650> eSATA

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
is really good has even got an eSATA

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.060 
is really good has even got an eSATA
which<00:05:12.460> is<00:05:12.670> pretty<00:05:13.360> nice<00:05:13.740> for<00:05:14.740> when<00:05:14.920> you're
