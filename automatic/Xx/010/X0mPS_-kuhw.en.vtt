00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.580
 b 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.710
 there does 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.190
 The scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Sciences 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.579
 Genetics this method the key of the human genome 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.369
 they were already involved in the human genome project 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.689
 A project of Licher scope is the 1000 genome project that of a 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.800
 Consortium of leading international institutes is organized recently 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.279
 The NBA researchers know that they are the only German institute 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.359
 take part 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.699
 but it was prettier than deliberate fee from earlier you had on that 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.700
 I believe him then this message could do 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.710
 around 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.020
 was it like that? 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.410
 as if to pat each other on the back a few minutes after more 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.840
 Months of hard work, we managed to hear that in this circle 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.980
 in this illustrious circle of percent 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.170
 large-linden world-renowned institutes 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.370
 participate 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.450
 around 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.540
 We always made it through 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.400
 innovative ideas 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.290
 less funds than the other institutes involved in these major projects 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.860
 to be able to do what you already paid now per cent 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.910
 genome project a similar project with similar meaning also the foundations 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.910
 have been created for many other projects 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.149
 Professor Hans Lehrach coordinates the German part of the project 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.969
 The genome of more than 1000 people is to be decrypted. The goal is it 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.470
 to find the genetic differences between humans too 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.950
 thousand-new project will try the variations in the genes 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.220
 Arn in different human populations understand and this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.580
 Variation is very important the best way this world can understand and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.020
 we can not test better either 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.090
 common diseases 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.210
 Percentages that affect each of us immediately the better we can hope 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.400
 the patients 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.610
 to treat 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 the researchers already have with the sequencing 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.550
 project Manager 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.550
 sent by people from all over the world 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.100
 the percent Elin we have 4 4 â€‹â€‹in the percent the widow information of 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.300
 Decrypted people from Nigeria 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.490
 but in the further course of the project mainly percent 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.369
 European 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.429
 investigate 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.769
 and we want to concentrate on the new tour from Tuscany 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.069
 and we hope 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.110
 that this Walter has a special ambience clock 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.959
 By developing new sequenced technologies can be much faster 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.860
 and be worked cheaper 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.719
 than at the time of the Human Genome Project 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.629
 the NPD the scientists are convinced that the thousand 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.629
 genom project will shape the following research 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.559
 the human genome project 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:43.419
 was a project place big impact on all the following 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.909
 biomedical percent 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.169
 Had projects 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.679
 and we assume that as a 1000 young project similar effects 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.679
 will have 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:55.849
 Where 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:56.909
