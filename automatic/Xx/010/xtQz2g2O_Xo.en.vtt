my dream survival games map would be the
size<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> size<00:01:20.250> wouldn't<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.580> too

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
size of it now the size wouldn't be too

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
size of it now the size wouldn't be too
big<00:01:20.939> wouldn't<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.390> too<00:01:21.540> small<00:01:22.070> probably

should<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.310> somewhere<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.210> size<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
should be somewhere around the size of

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.899 
should be somewhere around the size of
let's<00:01:26.610> say<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> size<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.810> I'll<00:01:27.930> give<00:01:28.380> us<00:01:28.470> four

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
let's say the size of I'll give us four

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.920 
let's say the size of I'll give us four
because<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.180> size<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> map<00:01:30.750> it's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
because I like the size of the map it's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
because I like the size of the map it's
not<00:01:31.290> too<00:01:31.439> big<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.650> too<00:01:31.860> small<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.189> just

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
not too big not too small just just

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.060 
not too big not too small just just
about<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.090> size<00:01:33.530> well<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.979> next

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
about the right size well then the next

I'm stuck in one spot for the entire
game<00:02:56.740> because<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.790> gets<00:02:57.940> boring

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
game because that's just it gets boring

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.550 
game because that's just it gets boring
odds<00:02:58.600> are<00:02:58.840> i'll<00:02:58.930> just<00:02:59.080> leave<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.320> gamer<00:02:59.470> i

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
odds are i'll just leave the gamer i

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.200 
odds are i'll just leave the gamer i
want<00:02:59.710> to<00:02:59.770> get<00:02:59.830> put<00:03:00.100> put<00:03:00.490> into<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.790> i<00:03:00.940> guess<00:03:01.090> it's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
want to get put put into it i guess it's

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.060 
want to get put put into it i guess it's
more<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.480> troll<00:03:01.750> than<00:03:01.930> anything<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.410> that's

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
more of a troll than anything so that's

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.370 
more of a troll than anything so that's
pretty<00:03:03.220> much<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.600> i<00:03:04.630> guess<00:03:05.260> that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
pretty much that it and i guess that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.650 
pretty much that it and i guess that
sums<00:03:05.620> up<00:03:05.740> all<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.370> want<00:03:06.550> my<00:03:06.790> idealist

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
sums up all that I want my idealist

survival<00:03:43.000> games<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.950> basically<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.280> thing

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
survival games and basically the thing

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.290 
survival games and basically the thing
that's<00:03:45.580> different<00:03:45.670> about<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.090> survival

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
that's different about the survival

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.840 
that's different about the survival
games<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.950> what<00:03:47.950> happens<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.520> put<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.820> a

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
games is what happens is you put on a

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.570 
games is what happens is you put on a
skin<00:03:49.210> that<00:03:50.050> they<00:03:50.200> give<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.070> no<00:03:51.220> one<00:03:51.370> knows

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
skin that they give you so no one knows

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.760 
skin that they give you so no one knows
what<00:03:52.240> you<00:03:52.330> look<00:03:52.450> like<00:03:52.510> they<00:03:53.140> take<00:03:53.560> away<00:03:53.740> all

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
what you look like they take away all

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.680 
what you look like they take away all
nameplates<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:54.550> you<00:03:54.640> can't<00:03:54.820> see<00:03:55.000> what<00:03:55.450> the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
nameplates so you can't see what the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.500 
nameplates so you can't see what the
people's<00:03:55.960> name<00:03:56.110> above<00:03:56.290> their<00:03:56.440> head<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.740> they

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
people's name above their head and they

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.640 
people's name above their head and they
drop<00:03:58.510> you<00:03:58.540> in<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.870> map<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.110> you've<00:03:59.380> never<00:03:59.530> seen

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
drop you in a map that you've never seen

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.190 
drop you in a map that you've never seen
before<00:03:59.890> which<00:04:00.790> I'm<00:04:01.420> assuming<00:04:01.600> is<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.080> like<00:04:02.170> a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
before which I'm assuming is just like a

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.960 
before which I'm assuming is just like a
map<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.410> they<00:04:02.650> made<00:04:02.830> custom<00:04:03.460> for<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.850> hell

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
map that they made custom for the hell

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.180 
map that they made custom for the hell
games<00:04:04.180> itself<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.410> that's<00:04:05.770> pretty<00:04:06.010> cool

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
games itself so that that's pretty cool

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.330 
games itself so that that's pretty cool
and<00:04:07.180> basically<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.900> since<00:04:08.800> this<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.160> third

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
and basically a since this is the third

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.100 
and basically a since this is the third
one<00:04:09.580> it's<00:04:09.790> like<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.000> quarterly<00:04:10.360> survival

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
one it's like the quarterly survival

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.300 
one it's like the quarterly survival
games<00:04:11.260> i<00:04:11.380> guess<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.709> something<00:04:11.950> in<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.100> actual

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
games i guess is something in the actual

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.110 
games i guess is something in the actual
hunger<00:04:12.580> games<00:04:12.760> makes<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:13.720> when<00:04:13.990> you<00:04:15.120> when

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
hunger games makes it so when you when

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.930 
hunger games makes it so when you when
you<00:04:16.180> call<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:17.070> like<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.100> for<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> every

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
you call it a like and for the every

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.640 
you call it a like and for the every
quarter<00:04:19.299> they<00:04:19.570> vote<00:04:19.870> for<00:04:20.109> who<00:04:20.200> they<00:04:20.350> want<00:04:20.500> the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650
