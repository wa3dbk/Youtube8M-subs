 sits there 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.110
 is that your dad told me that I 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.840
 I was inviting you to breakfast today 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.840
 my dad invited you to breakfast yes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.010
 He said he was going to give you a scrambled egg 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:51.780
 that that that that yes that me 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.400
 he forgot not good I do not know 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.760
 today, however, because the burden of my 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.460
 door 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.280
 is that one day I had also been invited 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.400
 your dad for breakfast but when he arrives 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.290
 he had already left then that's why 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.550
 now I stayed since last night asleep here 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.550
 so that it does not escape 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.700
 hey but it's very early 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.019
 I remember that my dad gets up very 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.790
 Monday afternoon especially if I remember 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.790
 that a Monday woke up on Tuesday 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.990
 He is not afraid if he is afraid of me 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.210
 especially as it snores 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.580
 when he never reminds me of the dog of the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:46.170
 neighbor when I was dying 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:49.020
 and you white not me not when you know 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.190
 because once they call me asleep to see 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.190
 if they are digging and not 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.540
 I'm going to prescribe what I can wake him up about 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.540
 the bear 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.530
 I say what's wrong with you, nothing, I'm 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.630
 doing my morning exercises 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.630
 this exercise is called the bicycle 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.200
 but that the bicycle when you do so 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.010
 I do not know if I clear away Perez 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.010
 right now I'm going down 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.909
 now yes he woke up yes 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.190
 Come on, he told me that you invited him 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:36.879
 have breakfast like this if it's true if you wait 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.879
 exercising 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.380
 Y 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.569

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.610

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:14.590
 Yeah sure 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.590
 that's how it ended all your fights 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.389
 that makes me want the habit of 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:24.410
 sleep so much 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.280
 come to visit you too 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.280
 hold 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.790
 he has thrown if he has not passed or half 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.790
 minute 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.720
 but I had forgotten that he invited me to 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.530
 have a clear breakfast 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.530
 the crowd has arrived 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.340
 I have a better news 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.499
 if the mountain does not come to us 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.540
 I do not have to, I'm going to help an egg 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.160
 scrambled 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.160
 and what is the good news 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.639
 the opera is multiple 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.160
 54 games 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.450
 what did you say 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.450
 it sparked me Sold 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.360
 you did not see some eggs that he has in the 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.400

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.400
