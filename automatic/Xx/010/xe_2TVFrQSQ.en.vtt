exceeding<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> other<00:02:01.290> two<00:02:01.500> by<00:02:01.680> four<00:02:01.979> points

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
exceeding the other two by four points

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.480 
exceeding the other two by four points
so<00:02:03.119> that's<00:02:03.659> pretty<00:02:03.869> interesting<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:05.040> terms<00:02:05.280> of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
so that's pretty interesting in terms of

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.249 
so that's pretty interesting in terms of
del<00:02:05.670> Fox's<00:02:06.060> moves<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.509> I'd<00:02:06.659> recommend<00:02:06.840> giving

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
del Fox's moves so I'd recommend giving

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.469 
del Fox's moves so I'd recommend giving
it<00:02:07.439> powerful<00:02:08.099> special<00:02:08.399> based<00:02:08.729> attacks<00:02:09.119> like

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it powerful special based attacks like

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.880 
it powerful special based attacks like
flamethrower<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.349> psychic

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
flamethrower and psychic

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.710 
flamethrower and psychic
you<00:02:12.310> could<00:02:12.460> also<00:02:12.610> give<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> five<00:02:13.180> less<00:02:13.480> if<00:02:13.630> you

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you could also give it five less if you

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.290 
you could also give it five less if you
weren't<00:02:13.930> too<00:02:14.110> worried<00:02:14.440> about<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.710> accuracy

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
weren't too worried about the accuracy

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.100 
weren't too worried about the accuracy
it<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.600> learn<00:02:16.840> light<00:02:17.230> screen<00:02:17.770> by<00:02:18.310> TM<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.870> not

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
it can learn light screen by TM but not

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.820 
it can learn light screen by TM but not
the<00:02:20.319> other<00:02:20.590> barrier<00:02:21.490> type<00:02:21.880> moves<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.830> light

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
the other barrier type moves just light

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.680 
the other barrier type moves just light
screen<00:02:24.160> light<00:02:24.790> screen<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.150> good<00:02:25.300> because<00:02:25.480> it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
screen light screen is good because it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.240 
screen light screen is good because it
will<00:02:25.780> boost<00:02:25.959> its<00:02:26.260> special<00:02:26.650> defense<00:02:26.920> which<00:02:27.220> is

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
will boost its special defense which is

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.400 
will boost its special defense which is
already<00:02:27.580> pretty<00:02:27.880> high<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.870> I'd<00:02:29.200> maybe

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
already pretty high so I'd maybe

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.690 
already pretty high so I'd maybe
recommend<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.160> conjunction<00:02:30.310> with

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
recommend that in conjunction with

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.400 
recommend that in conjunction with
either<00:02:30.880> flamethrower<00:02:31.540> five<00:02:31.780> last<00:02:32.110> and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
either flamethrower five last and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.980 
either flamethrower five last and
psychic<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.490> then<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.240> fill<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.750> fourth

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
psychic and then you can fill the fourth

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.949 
psychic and then you can fill the fourth
mood<00:02:35.230> slot<00:02:35.530> any<00:02:35.770> way<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.010> want<00:02:36.630> okay<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:37.690> let's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
water type and at level 16 evolved into

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.600 
water type and at level 16 evolved into
frogadier<00:02:43.300> now<00:02:44.200> frogadier<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.950> still<00:02:45.340> appeal

one type when that reaches level thirty

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.220 
one type when that reaches level thirty
six<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:48.760> will<00:02:48.910> evolve<00:02:49.120> into<00:02:49.330> greninja<00:02:49.780> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
six it will evolve into greninja and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.250 
six it will evolve into greninja and
greninja<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.340> water<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.880> dark<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.050> like

it's<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.670> first<00:02:54.940> starter<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.780> has<00:02:55.930> ever

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
it's the first starter that has ever

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.380 
it's the first starter that has ever
been<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:56.620> type<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.580> first<00:02:57.820> start<00:02:58.150> that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
has ever been a dark type so that's

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.280 
has ever been a dark type so that's
pretty<00:03:00.550> interesting

type<00:05:31.570> Elite<00:05:31.900> Four<00:05:32.169> and<00:05:32.409> not<00:05:32.620> actually<00:05:33.310> weak<00:05:33.490> to

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
type Elite Four and not actually weak to

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
any of the other members okay let's have

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:38.730 
any of the other members okay let's have
a<00:05:37.690> quick<00:05:37.870> look<00:05:38.020> at<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.199> fennekin<00:05:38.560> line

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
a quick look at the fennekin line

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.770 
a quick look at the fennekin line
fennekin<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.550> only<00:05:39.760> going<00:05:39.880> to<00:05:39.940> be<00:05:40.000> weak<00:05:40.240> to<00:05:40.570> one

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
fennekin is only going to be weak to one

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.570 
fennekin is only going to be weak to one
type<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.199> that's<00:05:41.349> rock<00:05:41.650> I<00:05:41.979> suppose

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
type and that's rock I suppose

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.950 
type and that's rock I suppose
technically<00:05:42.970> it<00:05:43.150> could<00:05:43.300> be<00:05:43.419> weak<00:05:43.599> to<00:05:43.720> the<00:05:43.750> bug

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
technically it could be weak to the bug

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.779 
technically it could be weak to the bug
type<00:05:44.169> line<00:05:44.380> but<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.680> probably<00:05:44.860> won't<00:05:45.550> be

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
type line but it probably won't be

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.189 
type line but it probably won't be
because<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:46.150> won't<00:05:46.360> have<00:05:46.539> evolved<00:05:46.990> it<00:05:47.080> it's

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
because you won't have evolved it it's

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.420 
because you won't have evolved it it's
delphox<00:05:47.650> by<00:05:47.919> them<00:05:48.360> so<00:05:49.360> as<00:05:50.050> in<00:05:51.039> terms<00:05:51.220> of

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
delphox by them so as in terms of

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.839 
delphox by them so as in terms of
strength

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
strength

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.000 
strength
fennekin<00:05:52.599> itself<00:05:52.990> will<00:05:53.320> be<00:05:53.440> strong<00:05:53.710> against

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
fennekin itself will be strong against

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.950 
fennekin itself will be strong against
bug<00:05:54.340> because<00:05:54.610> fire<00:05:55.030> beats<00:05:55.300> bug<00:05:55.539> you<00:05:55.780> should

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
bug because fire beats bug you should

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.379 
bug because fire beats bug you should
know<00:05:56.110> that<00:05:56.289> it<00:05:57.099> should<00:05:57.340> it<00:05:57.610> would<00:05:57.970> be<00:05:58.150> strong

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
know that it should it would be strong

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.670 
know that it should it would be strong
against<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.690> fighting<00:05:59.110> type<00:05:59.260> him<00:05:59.440> he

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
against the fighting type him he

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.890 
against the fighting type him he
devolved<00:06:00.130> into<00:06:00.279> delphox<00:06:01.240> by<00:06:01.479> them<00:06:01.659> but<00:06:01.870> I

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
devolved into delphox by them but I

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.050 
devolved into delphox by them but I
don't<00:06:02.020> know<00:06:02.320> if<00:06:02.409> you<00:06:02.500> will

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
don't know if you will

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.640 
don't know if you will
it<00:06:04.599> will<00:06:04.720> also<00:06:04.870> be<00:06:05.110> strong<00:06:05.319> against<00:06:05.530> the

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
it will also be strong against the

grass-type gym resistant to the ferry

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.159 
grass-type gym resistant to the ferry

type<00:06:11.410> game<00:06:11.669> so<00:06:12.870> pretty<00:06:13.870> good<00:06:13.930> coverage<00:06:14.530> on

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
type game so pretty good coverage on

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.650

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
types for fennekin line

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.150 
types for fennekin line
okay<00:06:17.110> so<00:06:17.169> let's<00:06:17.440> quickly<00:06:17.650> talk<00:06:17.860> about<00:06:17.919> the

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
okay so let's quickly talk about the

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.089 
okay so let's quickly talk about the
Elite<00:06:18.460> Four<00:06:18.490> for<00:06:18.940> fennekin<00:06:19.830> fennekin<00:06:20.830> is

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
Elite Four for fennekin fennekin is

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.650 
Elite Four for fennekin fennekin is
going<00:06:21.220> to<00:06:21.280> be<00:06:21.370> weak<00:06:21.520> Siebold<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.419> Elite

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
going to be weak Siebold of the Elite

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.070 
going to be weak Siebold of the Elite
Four<00:06:22.690> who<00:06:23.169> uses<00:06:23.440> wall<00:06:23.770> sipes<00:06:24.099> and<00:06:25.080> strong

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
Four who uses wall sipes and strong

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.559 
Four who uses wall sipes and strong
against<00:06:26.500> Wickstrom<00:06:27.430> who<00:06:27.639> uses<00:06:27.849> steel<00:06:28.270> types

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:28.569 
against Wickstrom who uses steel types

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.339 
against Wickstrom who uses steel types
so<00:06:29.229> that's<00:06:29.800> pretty<00:06:30.220> much<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:31.360> for<00:06:31.419> fennekin

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
so that's pretty much it for fennekin

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:35.969 
so that's pretty much it for fennekin
fennekin<00:06:32.740> has<00:06:33.729> the<00:06:34.210> least<00:06:34.449> weaknesses<00:06:35.259> out<00:06:35.560> of

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
fennekin has the least weaknesses out of

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.249 
fennekin has the least weaknesses out of
the<00:06:36.400> three<00:06:36.699> starters<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.479> probably<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:38.020> most

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
the three starters and probably the most

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.409 
the three starters and probably the most
strengths<00:06:39.039> over<00:06:39.190> them<00:06:39.639> so<00:06:39.819> it's<00:06:39.940> probably<00:06:40.270> the

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
strengths over them so it's probably the

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.320 
strengths over them so it's probably the
easiest<00:06:40.690> one<00:06:40.870> to<00:06:40.930> use<00:06:41.729> okay<00:06:42.729> guys<00:06:42.909> so<00:06:43.150> that's

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
easiest one to use okay guys so that's

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.909 
easiest one to use okay guys so that's
it<00:06:43.479> for<00:06:43.630> today<00:06:43.870> thank<00:06:44.169> you<00:06:44.229> so<00:06:44.319> much<00:06:44.740> for
