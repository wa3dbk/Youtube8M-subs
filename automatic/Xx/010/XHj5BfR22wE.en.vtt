00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
of them but I mean this seems kind of

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
at a standpoint of modern operating

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.050 
at a standpoint of modern operating
systems<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:29.019> like<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.220> xbox<00:03:30.579> one<00:03:30.880> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
systems so like with the xbox one the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.430 
systems so like with the xbox one the
reason<00:03:31.299> is<00:03:31.390> taking<00:03:31.660> up<00:03:31.720> three<00:03:31.930> gigs<00:03:32.109> of<00:03:32.230> RAM<00:03:32.350> is

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
reason is taking up three gigs of RAM is

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.720 
reason is taking up three gigs of RAM is
because<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:32.739> running<00:03:32.950> off<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.100> triple<00:03:33.579> boot

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
because it's running off a triple boot

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.340 
because it's running off a triple boot
setup<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.600> there's<00:03:34.930> going<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.109> be<00:03:35.140> three

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
setup so there's going to be three

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.440 
setup so there's going to be three
operating<00:03:35.859> systems<00:03:35.950> connected<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.030> xbox

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
operating systems connected to the xbox

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.410 
operating systems connected to the xbox
one<00:03:37.720> with<00:03:38.590> one<00:03:38.799> gigs<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.130> RAM<00:03:39.340> each<00:03:39.609> you<00:03:40.299> know

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
one with one gigs of RAM each you know

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.599 
one with one gigs of RAM each you know
one<00:03:40.660> gig<00:03:40.900> for<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.470> specific<00:03:41.650> operation<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.459> a

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
one gig for this specific operation of a

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.759 
one gig for this specific operation of a
camera<00:03:43.090> which<00:03:43.680> what<00:03:44.680> task<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.250> xbox<00:03:45.609> one's<00:03:45.880> a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
the xbox one's operating systems are

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.229 
the xbox one's operating systems are
necessarily<00:03:56.650> doing<00:03:57.010> but<00:03:57.670> they<00:03:57.760> have<00:03:57.910> three<00:03:58.150> of

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
each now whether or not this rumor turns

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.020 
each now whether or not this rumor turns
out<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.139> be<00:04:02.170> true<00:04:02.410> or<00:04:02.500> not<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.920> swear<00:04:03.579> a<00:04:03.730> while

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
out to be true or not I swear a while

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.420 
out to be true or not I swear a while
back<00:04:04.329> wasn't<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.109> marked<00:04:05.470> journey<00:04:05.769> who

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
back wasn't it marked journey who

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.890 
back wasn't it marked journey who
actually<00:04:06.790> confirmed<00:04:07.359> that<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.569> place<00:04:07.780> that

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
actually confirmed that the place that

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.379 
actually confirmed that the place that
report<00:04:08.170> was<00:04:08.230> going<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.650> using<00:04:08.889> one<00:04:09.730> gig<00:04:10.090> of

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
report was going to be using one gig of

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.270 
report was going to be using one gig of
operating<00:04:11.139> system<00:04:11.440> allocation<00:04:12.010> from<00:04:12.100> the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
operating system allocation from the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.430 
operating system allocation from the
rest<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.609> RAM<00:04:12.790> giving<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.299> seven<00:04:13.959> gigs<00:04:14.200> of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
rest of the RAM giving it seven gigs of

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.920 
rest of the RAM giving it seven gigs of
total<00:04:15.100> memory<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:16.150> that's<00:04:16.450> another<00:04:16.720> reason

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
total memory so that's another reason

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.930 
total memory so that's another reason
why<00:04:17.109> I'm<00:04:17.320> still<00:04:17.560> dictating<00:04:18.340> this<00:04:18.729> as<00:04:18.910> a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
why I'm still dictating this as a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.330 
why I'm still dictating this as a
complete<00:04:19.419> if<00:04:19.539> not<00:04:19.720> total<00:04:20.019> rumor<00:04:20.349> so<00:04:20.919> i'll<00:04:21.130> have

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
complete if not total rumor so i'll have

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.950 
complete if not total rumor so i'll have

was<00:04:26.789> during<00:04:26.909> a<00:04:27.060> conference<00:04:27.539> but<00:04:28.349> even<00:04:28.800> if<00:04:29.009> it

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
was during a conference but even if it

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
is even if this rumor is actually true

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.379 
is even if this rumor is actually true
and<00:04:31.439> it's<00:04:31.560> going<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.800> be<00:04:31.919> put<00:04:32.099> at<00:04:32.189> 3.5<00:04:32.819> gigs<00:04:33.240> of

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
that rd can still reduce the amurri

ram<00:05:02.520> now<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:04.169> operating<00:05:04.560> system<00:05:04.800> took<00:05:04.919> up

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
ram now the operating system took up

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.999 
ram now the operating system took up
about<00:05:05.250> 512<00:05:06.120> megabytes<00:05:06.599> of<00:05:06.690> ram<00:05:06.930> although<00:05:07.590> that

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
about 512 megabytes of ram although that

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.420 
about 512 megabytes of ram although that
was<00:05:08.250> at<00:05:08.520> in<00:05:09.270> 2010<00:05:10.020> now<00:05:10.800> bringing<00:05:11.099> it<00:05:11.280> all<00:05:11.370> the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
was at in 2010 now bringing it all the

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.230 
was at in 2010 now bringing it all the
way<00:05:11.610> out<00:05:11.639> to<00:05:11.789> 2011<00:05:12.780> or<00:05:12.870> was<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.169> 2012<00:05:14.240> sony

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
way out to 2011 or was it 2012 sony

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.240 
way out to 2011 or was it 2012 sony
actually<00:05:15.780> found<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:16.080> way<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.289> reduce<00:05:16.770> the

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
actually found a way to reduce the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.730 
actually found a way to reduce the
operating<00:05:17.370> system's<00:05:18.029> memory<00:05:18.479> put<00:05:18.930> put<00:05:19.169> memory

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
operating system's memory put put memory

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.499 
operating system's memory put put memory
footprint<00:05:20.159> all<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.460> way<00:05:20.550> down<00:05:20.699> to<00:05:20.729> about<00:05:21.000> 70

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
footprint all the way down to about 70

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.990 
footprint all the way down to about 70
megabits<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.169> ram<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.129> as<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.520> large

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
megabits of ram and as a large

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.570 
megabits of ram and as a large
difference<00:05:24.569> so<00:05:25.199> maybe<00:05:25.650> Sony's<00:05:26.069> goal<00:05:26.250> is

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
difference so maybe Sony's goal is

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.700 
difference so maybe Sony's goal is
actually<00:05:26.849> one<00:05:27.300> gig<00:05:27.479> of<00:05:27.629> ram<00:05:27.719> and<00:05:28.050> currently

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
actually one gig of ram and currently

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.950 
actually one gig of ram and currently
it's<00:05:28.889> allocating<00:05:29.430> 3.5<00:05:29.969> megabits<00:05:30.449> of<00:05:30.569> ram<00:05:30.750> I

it's allocating 3.5 megabits of ram I

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.589 
it's allocating 3.5 megabits of ram I
don't<00:05:31.500> know<00:05:31.590> but<00:05:31.849> this<00:05:32.849> is<00:05:32.909> a<00:05:33.029> rumor<00:05:33.360> but<00:05:33.539> I
