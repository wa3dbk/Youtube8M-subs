00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.520
 you see here below in the title is the top 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.040
 December 5 the products that during 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.930
 the month I have used the most is a tad 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 I'm sorry, but it's been super 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.189
 You know that I always record in 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.930
 January of December in February of January 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.669
 in March of February but this month of 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.619
 January has been a chaos with all the 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.779
 rebates and yet we have worked a 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.880
 lots of hours and good has been a month 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.200
 a little chaos and the truth is that the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.700
 holes that I had free was 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.700
 so tired they call me on the phone 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.260
 hello anime 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.260
 now 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.220
 OK OK 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.329
 I do not know what he's saying but let's go 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.469
 It has been a pretty month 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.780
 complicated a pretty good month 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.400
 busy rather well the challenges that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.229
 I have had so small 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.190
 I've dedicated them to taking me on the couch 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.190
 why 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.690
 is that I was up to here from the truth of 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.190
 work and go to work at nine o'clock 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.410
 and leave at seven count to work at 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.300
 nine thirty and I left at eight and 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.010
 average or the truth is that you do not have 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.660
 a lot of life so if I do not roll up 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.040
 many I will teach you any 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.360
 interest well and who is interested 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.130
 I'm sorry I'll try to make the month that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.900
 comes a little more in time 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.940
 but I could not do anything else 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.350
 so I show you at number one 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.200
 five has placed these powders of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 benefit are the professionals are the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.790
 powders that I really like not to put the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
 dust quality that also but about 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.149
 all for the format for the packaging 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.290
 because good is very comfortable to carry 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.610
 in the bag 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.899
 every day I put makeup on the subway 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.340
 at full speed because the truth is that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.750
 I was so tired that early on 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.820
 more to put on makeup gives me a prey 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.700
 terrible so what I was doing was 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.530
 in the subway 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.539
 give me four things the four things that 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.149
 I'm going to teach you and well, these 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.119
 the powders simply open the this 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.729
 I have made a turn here and then 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.590
 below the brush comes out the brush with 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.870
 this together and it is already the truth is that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.250
 It is super super comfortable when I spend 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.319
 in trying it with a funnel 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.880
 here product of another powder that I have 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.620
 because the truth is that I find it very 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.450
 comfortable it is grace the quality of the powder is 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.610
 very good is very fine is a powder that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.650
 It also feels very good faces very 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.330
 pretty as very unified and I have 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.970
 liked but jolin cost thirty and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.470
 peak euros if they have seven grams 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.230
 then I think it does not compensate I prefer to 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.269
 the best a powder 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.250
 maybe even do not let me so good 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.580
 look cheaper because I think 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.519
 a lot of money so if I get to put 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 another one in here I'll use it because I 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.819
 I like a lot I also teach you in the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.819
 position number 4 and eyebrow fixer with 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.860
 katrice not with Christ the gas fixer 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.090
 with catherine color I like it a lot 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.769
 because it is very comfortable and I do not have to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.450
 fill my eyebrow and then fix it 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.670
 with this product I get to do both 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.170
 things in one step and the truth is that 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.480
 when you have so little time is something 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.280
 that is appreciated and good because it is a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.599
 little color like that brown I think it's going 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.790
 with all kinds of eyebrows 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.290
 I find it very comfortable and good at the same time 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.420
 that gives them a little bit of color 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.470
 and the truth is that every time I think 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.150
 most important a good eyebrows 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.069
 defined so it's a product that I 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.470
 I like it a lot and he created and used it a lot 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.060
 third place and placed the balm 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.280
 lipstick because the truth is that 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.900
 With these colder days no one is 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.569
 they feel a little bit besides he's had a 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.340
 hot on the lips pretty bad so 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.530
 that during December and January is a 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.329
 product that used quite is one 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.739
 of my favorite lip balms 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.750
 selective the nor the carmen are those that 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.040
 I like the most I applied it all 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.269
 nights and good these days of December 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.230
 Well I tell you that I have also used 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.000
 for 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.220
 to work on the lips to have the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.540
 hydrated lips and alright so good 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.040
 It is a product that I recommend a lot and 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.980
 that I love at number 2 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.989
 placed this correctors the eraser 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.659
 anti age treatment corrector 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.170
 maybelline 3 68 milliliters and I like 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.430
 much your logic here and it's coming out 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.959
 yes it is true that the theme of the nuns 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.549
 a bit cooked because like no 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.250
 clean in the end is a bit like that 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.260
 but good to me I like everything 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.910
 I have applied in the area of ​​the ojera and in 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.799
 the area where I had imperfections but 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.060
 It is also true that many days I 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.310
 had applied a little bit all over the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.079
 face in plan and very well and then I have 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.669
 extended a bit because the tone 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.709
 it looks pretty good, it's pretty similar 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.039
 to my skin so it was not appreciated that 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.120
 I was carrying some ferrets or nothing was applying a 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.220
 little by all parts of the face 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.750
 and extended in the light of mine bull and 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.630
 the truth is that I like quite a lot about 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.070
 everything a bit for that as a bit of ya 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.680
 not only to correct the eyes but 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.270
 to give the face a little bit of tone 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.620
 just give it a little and that in the post 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.680
 number one then all this mask of 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.930
 eyelashes are called the is wild the flames 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.979
 they are called the bias wild the essence and 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.880
 that more than lashes that has 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.160
 I really liked that surprised me 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.990
 many format trailers as well as the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.930
 of there as you remember of them has this 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.180
 opinion that makes like little balls and the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.669
 I really like it, it leaves me 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.490
 a few pretty defined eyelashes too 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.440
 I think it has something to do with the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.600
 lashes with the ex the ones that I'm 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.340
 using lately that I'm going to a 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.020
 streak using but the truth is that 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.580
 I really like how to leave the eyelashes 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.930
 This mask seems to define me 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.759
 a lot and it gives them a lot of length and 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.710
 volume so I'm very happy with 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.120
 I think it cost me three euros with 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.070
 something and I bought it with day they were 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.150
 retiring and the arts that I like 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.530
 a lot and it's a pity that they withdraw it 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.630
 because for me it is a very good mask 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.820
 I already tell you that there are stool masks 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.590
 some that I liked more or less 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.300
 others that I did not like anything but 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.710
 none that I'm crazy and there's the 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.650
 I really like it very much 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.120
 so very happy with her and nothing else 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.380
 These are the five products most has 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.729
 used in December and you can see that 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.070
 I make up a lot of it and that I have not 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.419
 had too much time for it like this 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.979
 that things are pretty basic 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.539
 I hope you liked it in the box 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.099

 I leave what I have on my cheeks and 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.550

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.110
