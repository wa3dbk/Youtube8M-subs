00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello hello hello i'm mars the 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.980
 very exactly gets to a new video 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.480
 where this sentence I would never have 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.280
 I still expect this sentence 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.710
 once in my microphone daimler one 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.119
 but it feels damn good 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.180
 I have such a tingling in my stomach 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.039
 Still , I really shit 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.260
 How long is it made eleven months 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.269
 maybe even longer and before that 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.490
 take a break if you still have it 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.500
 Nobody ever hears anyone there 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.960
 and if not then it's probably mine 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.850
 but I still have to blame 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.700
 I want to continue and especially 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.250
 so to speak, my little commentator me 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.620
 assume that every cod player is in 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.539
 his heart has a little commentator 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.550
 and if there is the flame of that 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.309
 then you get passion again 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.170
 you bock and that is the case with me 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.059
 no matter where we go from where 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.620
 I will be here all the time though 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.250
 I still in a separate video 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.170
 to explain 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.750
 in short i was fine i have 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.460
 i enjoyed my life i had a lot of fun 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.500
 and I hope that was with you 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.110
 of course, but of course 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.150
 you also have a lot of fun with youtube at the same time 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.990
 I would definitely have my one in any case 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.260
 the gameplay 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.200
 get ready now it's a luca 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.940
 fail and my name 'is pretty 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.580
 stupid for all this time 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.740
 I played no call of duty 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.710
 really no i feel like that 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.080
 Last beginners like the biggest one 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.670
 but still it works slowly 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.900
 You have to look for weeks now 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.850
 to get back to the same level 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.220
 reached after a few days it works 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.230
 I would say better already 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.300
 but i 'm also pretty much ingame 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.740
 advanced noticed for weeks he is 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.010
 the community flopped for me 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.010
 personally also after my 7 facto 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.710
 why the game is cool but completely new 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.870
 things have finally come somehow 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.920
 I say, whether in call of duty or 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.810
 in the community 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.000
 I feel slow meadow and senior 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.240
 somehow no plan of anything 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.220
 Has 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.960
 how such an old pensioner because it works 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.790
 new things open 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.950
 the gameplay is faster so if i am 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.670
 really black ops two games everywhere 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.319
 only these whole suitcases and many 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.090
 German I have to say frankly 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.950
 Of course I know what was once Graf but 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.709
 I have no force controller myself 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.110
 play with a nearly eight-year-old 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.610
 ps3 controller and slowly I feel 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.349
 me a bit outdated but hey it 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.450
 the time has come that I am 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.739
 again a bit hans modern 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.780
 happen to adapt 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.180
 the community has also become extreme 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.340
 right now I have changed 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.280
 this video recorded that happens 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.110
 now two days after aimless 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 semi-final and I have to say right now 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.319
 this tournament has me a bit 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.930
 given inspiration because I found it 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.580
 some really exciting especially the team 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.790
 red against thomas l 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.230
 a bombing match so really crass and 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.640
 I think that's because of that 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.799
 bit that I again bock 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.630
 youtube got because the scene has 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.610
 Damn it changed sooner 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.830
 It was quite different now clear there 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.660
 it's negative features youtube 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.420
 have become completely commercial all just want 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.180
 nor money, etc. I personally find 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.790
 that the call of duty community is extreme 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.880
 grown in positive are now 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.290
 not on the number of members 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.480
 I say in quotation marks 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.709
 but also from the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.750
 characteristics of the whole 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.489
 commentators clearly there are many new ones 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.750
 some of which I still remember 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.660
 nothing I am, so to speak 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.090
 Dinosaurs but I'm pretty good 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.519
 like this is because the social 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.709
 Commentators work together they are 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.470
 many times frivolous I say as 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.060
 earlier in the past there was always a dispute 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.280
 between several factions each 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.030
 version 5 there was a bit for itself 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.130
 I say 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.980
 and now in this goal 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.930
 the community pioneer all have themselves 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.049
 I love it less, of course 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.409
 but you just have fun together 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.590
 unit and I want that mega nice 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.750
 really and in the future there are black 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.109
 ops three literally because we will probably 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.239
 neatly hanging the robot out 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.889
 let and how that will I have none 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.670
 I know this time and I will be the game 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.040
 do not hold 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.739
 I 'll just wait patiently 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.530
 will happen to me but I like it 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.509
 is gone again and I still feel 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.009
 a bit uncomfortable not a bit 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.840
 Unwell, I say unusual times 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.520
 because for me it's all still complete 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.380
 new but i watch that i am in the 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.289
 next few days will work right down 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.669
 of course continue to produce videos 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.860
 because otherwise it would be total 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.330
 stupid I tell you a little bit 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.039
 this video will not upload anything 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.130
 you can come to me you can do that to me 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:41.300
 I do a lot of damage until I really 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.310
 then drop dead and finally what 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.470
 with this short announcement video 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.509
 a classic commentary I mean 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.669
 do a little bit back to back to 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.419
 the roots but still I want to face 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.010
 continue game &amp; co and people says 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.760
 I just have something in me 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.710
 missed time 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.300
 and if something is on your heart 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.490
 Do you really want to puke me out because of me? 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.349
 just did not keep my word 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.300
 like such a bad politician 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.940
 it does when you logan log me 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.729
 I care leave comment shows 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.590
 the video as well as the spreads the 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.630
 rejoice the message that massa 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.020
 back there he does what you want it to do 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.289
 well and wien sorry for me 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.800
 left you so unannounced until 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.229
 then 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.229
 that was massive adiÃ³s
