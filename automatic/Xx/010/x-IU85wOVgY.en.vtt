the this is the scapular right here
scapula<00:00:06.240> would<00:00:06.390> go<00:00:06.480> back<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> lawn<00:00:07.080> we're

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
scapula would go back to the lawn we're

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.620 
scapula would go back to the lawn we're
gonna<00:00:07.379> fabricate<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.950> loin<00:00:08.189> tomorrow<00:00:08.630> this

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
gonna fabricate the loin tomorrow this

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.020 
gonna fabricate the loin tomorrow this
is<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.320> lower<00:00:10.500> part<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.010> scapula<00:00:11.519> that

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
is the lower part of the scapula that

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.390 
is the lower part of the scapula that
would<00:00:12.150> actually<00:00:12.420> go<00:00:12.540> into<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.139> 50<00:00:13.410> cam<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
would actually go into the 50 cam and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.420 
would actually go into the 50 cam and
then<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.389> head<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.780> front<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> that

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
then you have the head in front of that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.310 
then you have the head in front of that
below<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.240> you'd<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.449> picnic<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.080> hip

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
below and you'd have picnic in the hip

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
below and you'd have picnic in the hip
hop's<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:20.250> would<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> Fox<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.119> itself

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
hop's this would be the Fox about itself

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.570 
hop's this would be the Fox about itself
if<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> Boston<00:00:22.769> butt<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.340> think

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
if you have the Boston butt and think

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.359 
if you have the Boston butt and think
you<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.850> connect<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.180> shoulder<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.980> Boston

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
you can connect that shoulder the Boston

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.130 
you can connect that shoulder the Boston
but<00:00:26.519> then<00:00:26.730> separates<00:00:27.180> goes<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> loin

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
but then separates goes here to the loin

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
but then separates goes here to the loin
behind<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:28.980> fresh<00:00:29.279> Hanna<00:00:29.550> come

come in from the corner the easiest way
is<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> scapula<00:00:40.460> either

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is to do it so that the scapula either

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
is to do it so that the scapula either
side<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.910> bone<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.390> seen<00:00:42.690> away<00:00:43.020> from

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
side of the bone can be seen away from

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
side of the bone can be seen away from
you're<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> come<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> corner

right now you can kind of see the

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.469 
right now you can kind of see the
outline<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:32.429> that<00:01:32.549> bomb<00:01:32.609> looks<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:35.479> now

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
outline of what that bomb looks like now

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.849 
outline of what that bomb looks like now
I'm<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> pull<00:01:36.990> under<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.380> use<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> as

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
I'm going to pull under that use that as

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.620 
I'm going to pull under that use that as
a<00:01:37.890> handle<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.579> come<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.829> cut<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
a handle and come in and just cut that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
a handle and come in and just cut that
the<00:01:42.630> bottom<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> knee<00:01:43.560> pop<00:01:43.909> let<00:01:44.909> gravity

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the bottom of that knee pop let gravity

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
the bottom of that knee pop let gravity
pull<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.810> mean<00:01:45.960> away<00:01:46.079> gravity<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.860> your

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pull the mean away gravity is your

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.510 
pull the mean away gravity is your
friend<00:01:47.280> sometimes<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.420> hold<00:01:51.719> on<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
friend sometimes and then hold on to it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.260 
friend sometimes and then hold on to it
but<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.819> bottom<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.209> the<00:01:54.299> bone<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> that's

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
but at the bottom of the bone so that's

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.059 
but at the bottom of the bone so that's
basically<00:02:00.929> all<00:02:01.049> we're<00:02:01.380> doing<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.799> pull<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
basically all we're doing to pull the

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.219 
basically all we're doing to pull the
bone<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:03.569> so<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:03.989> we're<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
bone out and now so if we're going to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.660 
bone out and now so if we're going to
use<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.799> brennick<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.429> was<00:02:05.549> going

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
use this for brennick now if I was going

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.279 
use this for brennick now if I was going
to<00:02:05.700> make<00:02:05.849> barbecue<00:02:06.060> out<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.539> this<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.840> would

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
to make barbecue out of this I would

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.410 
to make barbecue out of this I would
just<00:02:07.439> take<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.739> like<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:09.060> would<00:02:09.119> rub

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.460 
it I would rub in that little fold there
I'd<00:02:12.150> rub<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.780> I'd<00:02:12.989> let<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.170> sit<00:02:13.440> overnight

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

and then I cook it following day but
we're<00:02:16.349> actually<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.829> cut<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.370> for

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
we're actually going to cut this up for

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.460 
we're actually going to cut this up for
brain<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.630> we're<00:02:18.720> gonna<00:02:18.840> take<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> bone<00:02:19.319> out

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
brain so we're gonna take the bone out

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.100 
brain so we're gonna take the bone out
we're<00:02:19.980> gonna<00:02:20.040> take<00:02:20.310> off<00:02:20.459> any<00:02:20.700> way<00:02:21.660> no<00:02:21.900> matter

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
we're gonna take off any way no matter

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
now see this right here this is where

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.120 
now see this right here this is where
the<00:02:23.970> carotid<00:02:24.420> artery<00:02:24.720> was<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.739> that's<00:02:25.890> there

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
the carotid artery was and that's there

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.910 
the carotid artery was and that's there
from<00:02:26.459> dispatcher<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.500> we're<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.769> get

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
from dispatcher so we're going to get

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.619 
from dispatcher so we're going to get
rid<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.000> then<00:02:30.120> we're<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.360> going<00:02:30.599> to

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
rid of that and then we're just going to

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:38.540 
rid of that and then we're just going to
basically<00:02:30.750> cut<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.769> open<00:02:31.950> cut<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.489> in<00:02:32.579> half

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.760 

and<00:02:39.090> we're<00:02:39.390> looking<00:02:39.480> for<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.930> that's<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.470> plan

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
and we're looking for that that's a plan

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.950 
and we're looking for that that's a plan
right<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:41.970> want<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.420> gland<00:02:42.720> out

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
right so we want to get that gland out

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.870 
right so we want to get that gland out
of<00:02:43.170> there<00:02:43.290> because<00:02:44.190> even<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.640> we're<00:02:44.760> making

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
of there because even if we're making

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.460 
of there because even if we're making
sausages<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.810> doesn't<00:02:46.050> matter<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.350> we're

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
sausages it doesn't matter what we're

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.070 
sausages it doesn't matter what we're
doing<00:02:47.120> its<00:02:48.120> vinaigrette<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:48.840> take<00:02:49.050> that

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
doing its vinaigrette so we take that

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.710 
doing its vinaigrette so we take that
gland<00:02:49.470> out<00:02:50.060> all<00:02:51.060> right<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:51.420> we're<00:02:51.570> ready

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
gland out all right and now we're ready

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.890 
gland out all right and now we're ready
to<00:02:52.490> basically<00:02:53.490> cut<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.880> into<00:02:54.000> cubes<00:02:54.270> for

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
to basically cut it into cubes for

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.750 
to basically cut it into cubes for
grinding<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.890> all<00:02:56.250> we're<00:02:56.370> gonna<00:02:56.460> do<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.670> just

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
grinding and all we're gonna do is just

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.350 
grinding and all we're gonna do is just
cut<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.180> into<00:02:57.330> nice<00:02:57.570> sized<00:02:57.840> chunks<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.790> pork

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
cut it into nice sized chunks the pork

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.880 
cut it into nice sized chunks the pork
butt<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.570> basically<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.170> cornerstone<00:03:01.830> of

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
butt is basically the cornerstone of

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.250 
butt is basically the cornerstone of
charcuterie<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.970> used<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.300> tons<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:04.050> stuff

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
charcuterie it's used for tons of stuff

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.650 
charcuterie it's used for tons of stuff
so<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.430> make<00:03:05.580> tatsu<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.330> this<00:03:06.420> we<00:03:06.540> can

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
so we can make tatsu out of this we can

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.240 
so we can make tatsu out of this we can
you<00:03:06.720> turn<00:03:06.930> someone<00:03:07.380> we're<00:03:07.890> basically<00:03:08.130> just

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
you turn someone we're basically just

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.720 
you turn someone we're basically just
going<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.580> cut<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.790> into<00:03:09.570> cubes<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.730> for

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
going to cut it into cubes like this for

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.330 
going to cut it into cubes like this for
grinding

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
grinding

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.770 
grinding
and<00:03:13.520> that's<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.030> we<00:03:14.150> get<00:03:14.300> cubes<00:03:14.510> for

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
and that's it so we get cubes for

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.979 
and that's it so we get cubes for
grinding<00:03:15.140> we<00:03:15.770> get<00:03:15.950> some<00:03:16.220> glandular<00:03:16.459> matter

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
grinding we get some glandular matter

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.040 
grinding we get some glandular matter
then<00:03:17.989> we<00:03:18.110> get<00:03:18.200> bones<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:20.569> that's<00:03:20.750> what<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:20.930> got

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
then we get bones and that's what we got

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.130 
then we get bones and that's what we got
and<00:03:21.620> that's<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.950> bus
