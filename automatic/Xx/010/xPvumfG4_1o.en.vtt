00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.909 

now<00:05:44.449> remove<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:44.840> camera<00:05:45.289> from<00:05:45.319> the<00:05:45.620> logic

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
now remove the camera from the logic

00:05:45.919 --> 00:06:00.350 
now remove the camera from the logic
board

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.850 

now<00:06:01.360> loosen<00:06:01.629> the<00:06:01.840> logic<00:06:02.169> board<00:06:02.349> so<00:06:02.590> that<00:06:02.740> the

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
now loosen the logic board so that the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.070 
now loosen the logic board so that the
protective<00:06:03.340> piece<00:06:03.550> of<00:06:03.849> the<00:06:04.330> iSight<00:06:04.690> camera

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
protective piece of the iSight camera

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.269 
protective piece of the iSight camera
will<00:06:05.229> fall<00:06:05.440> free

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.149 

once<00:06:12.209> that's<00:06:12.419> complete<00:06:12.809> now<00:06:13.349> disconnect<00:06:14.039> the

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
once that's complete now disconnect the

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:26.340 
once that's complete now disconnect the
LCD<00:06:14.609> cable<00:06:14.639> from<00:06:15.119> the<00:06:15.239> logic<00:06:15.329> board

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.800 

now<00:06:27.350> just<00:06:27.650> keep<00:06:27.800> working<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.250> logic<00:06:28.580> board

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
now just keep working the logic board

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.750 
now just keep working the logic board
until<00:06:29.810> the<00:06:29.930> battery<00:06:30.320> is<00:06:30.470> almost<00:06:30.920> free<00:06:31.400> from

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
until the battery is almost free from

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.210 
until the battery is almost free from
the<00:06:31.880> LCD<00:06:32.240> assembly<00:06:35.380> now<00:06:36.380> flip<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:36.680> unit<00:06:36.950> over

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
the LCD assembly now flip the unit over

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.520 
the LCD assembly now flip the unit over
and<00:06:38.980> remove<00:06:39.980> the<00:06:40.130> speaker<00:06:41.080> the<00:06:42.080> speaker<00:06:42.110> is

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
and remove the speaker the speaker is

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.230 
and remove the speaker the speaker is
only<00:06:42.650> held<00:06:43.010> on<00:06:43.160> by<00:06:43.430> double<00:06:43.730> sided<00:06:43.940> tape<00:06:46.240> once

only held on by double sided tape once
that<00:06:47.420> is<00:06:47.540> removed<00:06:48.520> remove<00:06:49.520> the<00:06:49.670> logic<00:06:49.970> board

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
that is removed remove the logic board

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.270 
that is removed remove the logic board
