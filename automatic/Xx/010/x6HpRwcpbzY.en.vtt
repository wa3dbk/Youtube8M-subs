00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
it in their book and you don't even need

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.600 
it in their book and you don't even need
to<00:03:02.260> measure<00:03:02.440> in<00:03:02.709> fact<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.070> think<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.430> great

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
to measure in fact I think it is great

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.210 
to measure in fact I think it is great
if<00:03:03.760> they<00:03:03.910> try<00:03:04.750> not<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.320> make<00:03:05.410> them<00:03:05.590> match<00:03:05.830> up<00:03:06.070> so

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
if they try not to make them match up so

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.770 
if they try not to make them match up so
you<00:03:06.580> can<00:03:06.700> just<00:03:06.820> do<00:03:06.940> different<00:03:07.269> lengths

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
you can just do different lengths

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.660 
you can just do different lengths
different<00:03:07.810> different<00:03:08.410> widths<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:08.980> as<00:03:09.550> it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
different different widths and as it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.280 
different different widths and as it
goes<00:03:09.820> across<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.390> then<00:03:10.540> what<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.720> did<00:03:11.110> when<00:03:11.230> I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
goes across and then what I did when I

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.060 
goes across and then what I did when I
was<00:03:11.470> done<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:12.730> take<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.090> down<00:03:13.299> is<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.530> simply

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
was done to take this down is I simply

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.130 
was done to take this down is I simply
went<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.700> just<00:03:16.390> walking<00:03:16.600> forth<00:03:16.930> until

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
went like this just walking forth until

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.330 
went like this just walking forth until
the<00:03:17.260> ends<00:03:17.500> were<00:03:17.590> kind<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.830> frayed<00:03:18.070> because<00:03:18.160> I

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
the ends were kind of frayed because I

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.030 
the ends were kind of frayed because I
wanted<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.299> nice<00:03:19.650> more<00:03:20.650> look

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
wanted it to have that nice more look

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.280 
wanted it to have that nice more look
all<00:03:21.370> right<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.850> then<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.570> purchase<00:03:23.140> a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
all right and then you can purchase a

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.500 
all right and then you can purchase a
little<00:03:23.590> handles<00:03:23.890> at<00:03:24.010> Joanne's<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.579> figured

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
little handles at Joanne's and I figured

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.000 
little handles at Joanne's and I figured
out<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> neat<00:03:26.290> little<00:03:26.440> trick<00:03:26.620> because<00:03:26.829> the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
out a neat little trick because the

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.979 
out a neat little trick because the
handles<00:03:27.340> can<00:03:27.459> be<00:03:27.610> anywhere<00:03:28.120> from<00:03:28.329> like<00:03:28.720> five

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
handles can be anywhere from like five

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.800 
handles can be anywhere from like five
to<00:03:29.230> twelve<00:03:29.470> dollars<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.459> if<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.180> simply<00:03:31.570> sew

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
to twelve dollars so if you simply sew

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.009 
to twelve dollars so if you simply sew
the<00:03:32.019> ribbon<00:03:32.200> on<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.130> project<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:34.630> handle

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the ribbon on to the project the handle

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.720 
the ribbon on to the project the handle
becomes<00:03:35.290> removable<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:36.400> use<00:03:36.610> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
becomes removable so you can use the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.009 
becomes removable so you can use the
same<00:03:36.910> handle<00:03:37.329> on<00:03:37.480> various<00:03:37.900> different
