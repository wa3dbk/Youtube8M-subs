00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
couldn't climb up the rope vines you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.910 
couldn't climb up the rope vines you
actually<00:02:22.519> can<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:23.209> there's<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.510> wall<00:02:23.870> by<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.170> but

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
actually can if there's a wall by it but

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.900 
actually can if there's a wall by it but
yeah<00:02:25.700> that's<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.480> works<00:02:27.080> like<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.290> ladder

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
yeah that's it it works like a ladder

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.509 
yeah that's it it works like a ladder
you<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.150> need<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> wall<00:02:29.690> by<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:29.989> that's<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.860> so

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
you just need a wall by it that's it so

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.400 
you just need a wall by it that's it so
you<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.880> actually<00:02:32.060> climb<00:02:32.720> up<00:02:32.959> there<00:02:33.170> just

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
you can actually climb up there just

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.710 
you can actually climb up there just
shimmy<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:34.070> rope<00:02:34.250> line<00:02:34.489> if<00:02:34.850> there's<00:02:35.630> a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
shimmy up the rope line if there's a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.620 
shimmy up the rope line if there's a
wall<00:02:36.080> next<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.459> that's<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.510> little

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
wall next to it so that's a little

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.350 
wall next to it so that's a little
addition<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.290> i<00:02:39.350> forgot<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.660> chickens<00:02:41.660> are
