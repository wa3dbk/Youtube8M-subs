with<00:00:46.810> yourself<00:00:47.200> and<00:00:47.350> then<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.560> stopped

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
with yourself and then you stopped

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.290 
with yourself and then you stopped
counting<00:00:48.190> while<00:00:48.730> you're<00:00:48.850> struggling<00:00:49.060> to<00:00:49.180> get

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
that's what a metronome is for it just

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.680 
that's what a metronome is for it just

somebody<00:00:59.560> else<00:00:59.710> counts<00:01:00.010> or<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:01.210> find<00:01:01.390> some

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
somebody else counts or you find some

somebody else counts or you find some
way<00:01:01.870> to<00:01:01.930> have<00:01:02.170> something<00:01:02.440> that's<00:01:02.710> making<00:01:02.860> a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
way to have something that's making a

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.030 
way to have something that's making a
regular<00:01:03.610> noise<00:01:06.990> whatever<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.170> takes<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:08.979> you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
regular noise whatever it takes so you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.130 
regular noise whatever it takes so you
don't<00:01:09.490> have<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.759> count<00:01:09.939> if<00:01:10.149> you<00:01:10.659> want<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:10.960> count

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.630 
don't have to count if you want to count
if<00:01:11.439> you<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.710> count<00:01:11.920> one<00:01:12.040> playing<00:01:12.369> great

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
if you can count one playing great

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.910 
if you can count one playing great
otherwise<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.689> can<00:01:13.840> get<00:01:14.020> some<00:01:14.229> tool<00:01:14.499> to<00:01:14.740> do<00:01:14.829> it

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
otherwise you can get some tool to do it

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.730 
otherwise you can get some tool to do it
for<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:17.069> so<00:01:18.069> again<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.210> idea<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:20.439> want<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.679> be

that clicking that metronome is actually

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:19.250 
that clicking that metronome is actually
time<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.680> what<00:03:02.250> I'm<00:03:02.430> counting<00:03:02.879> here<00:03:03.389> is

it's not too bad if you don't get it
immediately<00:03:27.700> as<00:03:28.239> long<00:03:28.780> as<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.989> get<00:03:29.109> some<00:03:29.349> of

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
immediately as long as you get some of

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.000 
immediately as long as you get some of
it<00:03:29.620> what's<00:03:30.159> bad<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:31.079> waiting<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.109> strum<00:03:32.560> when

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
it what's bad is waiting to strum when

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.039 
it what's bad is waiting to strum when
your<00:03:33.129> fingers<00:03:33.400> aren't<00:03:33.609> there<00:03:33.939> sure<00:03:34.569> if<00:03:34.810> none

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
messed up it's not going to sound so

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.809 
messed up it's not going to sound so
great<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.069> could<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.430> get<00:03:39.760> one

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
great but if you could just get one

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.089 
great but if you could just get one
finger<00:03:40.359> down<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:41.290> get<00:03:41.439> it<00:03:41.470> bit<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:41.920> then<00:03:42.010> the

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
finger down and get it bit and then the

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.330 
finger down and get it bit and then the
other<00:03:42.129> ones<00:03:42.430> come<00:03:42.609> in<00:03:42.760> later<00:03:43.049> that'll<00:03:44.049> work

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
other ones come in later that'll work

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.759 
other ones come in later that'll work
that'll<00:03:45.340> work<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.750> what's<00:03:47.200> happening<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.709> the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
that'll work so what's happening in the

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.039 
that'll work so what's happening in the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.160 

or<00:04:15.150> notice<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.300> I<00:04:16.360> blew<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.750> there<00:04:17.020> at<00:04:17.080> the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
or notice that I blew it there at the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.410 
or notice that I blew it there at the
beginning<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.740> I<00:04:17.800> could<00:04:18.100> have<00:04:18.280> been<00:04:18.970> going<00:04:19.330> on

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
beginning and I could have been going on

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.480 
beginning and I could have been going on
the<00:04:19.570> one<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.020> the<00:04:20.080> two<00:04:20.170> I<00:04:20.620> could<00:04:21.040> count<00:04:21.310> this

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490 
the one and the two I could count this

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:30.200 
the one and the two I could count this
differently<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.150> could<00:04:22.420> count<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.900> this

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.090 

but<00:04:31.210> that's<00:04:31.390> actually<00:04:31.570> not<00:04:31.870> right<00:04:32.440> there's

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
but that's actually not right there's

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.550 
but that's actually not right there's
something<00:04:33.340> going<00:04:33.760> on<00:04:33.910> in<00:04:34.300> this<00:04:34.450> song<00:04:34.780> count

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
something going on in this song count

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.370 
something going on in this song count
why's<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:36.160> also<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.180> helpful<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.750> that<00:04:38.140> is

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
why's that also is helpful and that is

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.290 
why's that also is helpful and that is
the<00:04:38.770> chord<00:04:39.070> changes<00:04:39.160> are<00:04:39.580> always<00:04:40.060> coming

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
the chord changes are always coming

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.570 
the chord changes are always coming
after<00:04:40.720> four<00:04:41.020> beats<00:04:41.320> after<00:04:42.130> four<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.490> these

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
after four beats after four of these

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:50.070 
after four beats after four of these
counts<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.480> it's<00:04:43.630> one<00:04:43.990> two<00:04:44.070> three<00:04:49.080> don't

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
counts so it's one two three don't

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.080 
counts so it's one two three don't
change<00:04:51.420> or<00:04:52.420> so<00:04:53.050> it's<00:04:53.260> four<00:04:53.680> cats<00:04:54.010> g<00:04:54.340> four

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
change or so it's four cats g four

talked about the rhythm now what I've

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.390 
talked about the rhythm now what I've
done<00:06:04.879> here<00:06:04.939> is<00:06:05.180> very<00:06:05.689> very<00:06:06.020> simple<00:06:06.439> rhythm<00:06:06.860> for

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
done here is very very simple rhythm for

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.089 
done here is very very simple rhythm for
me<00:06:07.610> as<00:06:08.569> I<00:06:08.719> said<00:06:08.960> that<00:06:09.169> wouldn't<00:06:09.530> cut<00:06:09.770> it<00:06:09.800> I

me as I said that wouldn't cut it I
wouldn't<00:06:10.939> really<00:06:11.120> feel<00:06:11.449> what<00:06:11.659> I<00:06:11.719> think<00:06:12.020> is<00:06:12.110> the

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
wouldn't really feel what I think is the

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.619 
wouldn't really feel what I think is the
heart<00:06:12.500> of<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.620> song<00:06:12.889> they're<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:13.849> lean<00:06:14.509> do

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
something just a little bit more complex

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.640 
something just a little bit more complex
you<00:06:17.270> might<00:06:17.449> want<00:06:17.599> to<00:06:17.659> turn<00:06:17.780> it<00:06:17.900> off<00:06:17.990> now<00:06:18.229> and
