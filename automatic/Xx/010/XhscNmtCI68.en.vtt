00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.439
 It is beautiful Thank you in advance 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.930
 Thank you so much today I always watch youtube videos fun 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:18.000
 Since it is also coming from the way of saying , please give me a bench for drawing 2 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:24.740
 This person is 20 g of pheasant sugar 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.740
 I'm staying in the body by hard training to limit 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.340
 The number of Buber 20g came out probably 10 of low carb diet 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.730
 Studying a little 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.910
 I think but I have a low carb diet 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.920
 Say Well smoked hydrogen are people who say that after Come to the machine wind 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:01:00.830
 Of such Well it'd have been said to be told such a case it is the carbohydrate of 11 20g 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:03.329
 I'm telling you that if you look at it, maybe it 's okay if you're looking to the end 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:14.390
 Well I that I think that it is clear Te 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:14.390
 After all the loss to today's modern people 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:26.380
 I said booboo here till 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.300
 There is no doubt that unity is too much 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.330
 so 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.920
 At that time, if you say that the muscles are small, it will seem to be smaller at first, but later 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 It will recover 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.340
 In out theory, such as in it, even after all the theoretical go is Well satisfied with dependent are saying is that Dr. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 Also I'd Teru 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.290
 After all that glycogen is not enough , I wonder if it becomes tiny together 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:55.210
 It means that 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:02:01.960
 Because it is too tweet I get limited sugar from patties that can only handle magic 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:06.550
 By the way, the fifth ade case will be usable 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.310
 That I manufacturing I have a energy to say does not have the manufacturing that do not have someday 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.429
 Also 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.860
 Well that at room that say it is ketone bodies 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:20.120
 Well, I know that woman who is coconut oil diet quite recently. 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.330
 I think it's going to be there , but it's still going on, but until you say something about that cake body 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.290
 It 's like the entrance to a diet , but 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.340
 that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.780
 The ketone body is only protein specialization 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:39.200
 When fat is left in the body 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.090
 Perhaps that lack of carbohydrates breaks down proteins and fats in the liver to make things of energy 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.880
 I think I get to make 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:51.090
 It is something like a ketone body 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:56.250
 So make hair present such efficiency that can make well and is a waste of that energy 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:00.900
 There is no one in the shift that will disappear, and it will eventually become difficult to die . Ketone 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 Since creating a body waste is cut to use even as energy use as an oil other energy 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.930
 It will be easier 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:13.130
 In But the Tteyuu when the sugar is full Zuuman is've spent in favor of the sugar 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.450
 Also up is that death and whether the protein Te 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.950
 I think I'm not a ketone table 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.300
 So he can not use it as an energy source 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:31.000
 That's about 2 weeks for a certain period, but 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:36.440
 It's close to the state, such as the Well carbohydrate poisoning by get carbohydrate restriction in 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.290
 I actually get an teasing even more because it is the root that has become addicted 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.330
 Do not use do not make also ketone bodies from between the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.430
 So one week 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:51.280
 If you have patience 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:57.510
 Toka or become still irritated or Toka another something emotional instability as Yap forbidden Bishop 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.349
 I'm also a devil but I think it's a magazine with forbidden symptoms and I'll spend the period 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.340
 Ketone body is 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.450
 You can use it with cards and you can still make it 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.090
 Ok it will be available ok 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.700
 That of the muscle 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:16.410
 Substance that also I no I ketone bodies that say would deflated is that 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.959
 It will produce the energy on behalf of the sugar on behalf of 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:27.900
 In in say Another is that a long time I can not be used as the only energy glucose to the brain 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.380
 I met you, but it is also wrong and ketone bodies can reach the brain 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.689
 Ne 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.510
 Just because it is too much glucose 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:37.560
 that 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:42.180
 It is Sefu dock property Ketone body did not go to the brain but 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.050
 Is I know the I headed also ketone bodies to the brain by limiting glucose 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.260
 right 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:52.080
 Well, though it is not good if we use the carbohydrate limited diet from the old days of our body feeling 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.349
 I thought for interest but 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:59.520
 If you think about it, there are no people who are breaking the liver with it 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:04.080
 After about two weeks , I still support it as a head chamber. 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:11.099
 After all is you You're phenomenon is there always one by that he had said to be creative 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:12.100
 So that in that one week by to the that over carbohydrate restriction 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:17.170
 Middle duo 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.190
 I think that it might be fit physically to say that you can get out of holes and use the hole problem 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.920
 Ne 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.630
 I am thankful for my arm 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.740
 But there was but Well life 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.740
 I heard Te 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:50.040
 bouvet is already something after woman say was not able to 1 win 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:54.900
 One thing that has been studied recently 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.890
 I I'm also told the I mean not that Dung blur because they too take the glucose 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:02.529
 After all 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:08.319
 And the Tteyuu ball cable is has become not reach glucose to the brain 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:11.709
 A hole boss when is it So that I'm likely to come more and more atrophy brain 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:16.869
 no 5 that seems to be accepted 

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:17.859
 So maybe too much glucose consumption is causing a phenomenon called blur 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:22.550
 It does not 

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:24.770
 The body is well limited due to the invasion of blur 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.280
 that 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:37.750
 Nishiano It is kill a stop to come possibility of Tteyuu is a has been now study 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:41.910
 There is harm to the body of Tteyuu fact sugar than is everyone's thought because it is so Well 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:45.930
 It is quite high Rutteyuu possibility too take in things 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:51.150
 Mother that I thought Well too 0.00 Yamane 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:54.150
 Well it seems that you do not have the original functionality you 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:58.770
 Well originally originally this sugar is positive 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:03.300
 The culture that you should have 3 eating villages a day is to get a poster for Edison 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:05.740
 It is good to say that there is almost no scientific basis because it is made publicity 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:13.000
 from long ago 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:19.100
 And that to also know from the old days there is also the variety of buying by the day Minister bone 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.390
 I will think whether not it be better to little I had once review the take the way of sugar 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.390
 I understand 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:26.560
 Thank you there 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:31.090
 For example Thank always Thank you for seeing the videos

 Subscribe to My Subscribe to Youtube Subscribe 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:41.500
 Since Well looks like that notification is go to the future reverse left and right-conditioned 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:46.150
 I 'd like to receive that by all means, because we update about twice a week 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.580
 It is after that I want to tell the information are in that the order 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.020
 Email 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:54.439
 If you have already done it and have registered your e-mail magazine 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:08:00.919
 Actually this is not introduced on youtube 

00:07:54.439 --> 00:08:04.150
 Because the next animation of that real child is something a little more done, registration of the graduation person is also by all means 

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:04.150
 Thank you in advance
