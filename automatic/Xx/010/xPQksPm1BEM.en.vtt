to take for this I'm tracking first off

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.850 
to take for this I'm tracking first off
this<00:04:43.410> triple<00:04:44.160> 7<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:45.300> wings<00:04:45.510> are<00:04:45.810> just<00:04:46.380> about

bear<00:04:53.040> we<00:04:53.640> got<00:04:55.220> then<00:04:56.220> one<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.610> them<00:04:56.730> triple<00:04:57.180> 7

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
bear we got then one of them triple 7

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.200 
bear we got then one of them triple 7
there's<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.800> tail<00:04:59.160> section<00:05:01.670> it's<00:05:02.670> also<00:05:02.850> way

there's the tail section it's also way

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.160 
there's the tail section it's also way
bigger<00:05:04.910> you<00:05:05.910> can<00:05:06.090> see<00:05:06.330> that<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:09.510> you<00:05:09.540> see<00:05:09.960> it

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
bigger you can see that and you see it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.740 
bigger you can see that and you see it
has<00:05:10.350> more<00:05:10.650> remaining<00:05:11.490> years<00:05:11.820> that's

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
has more remaining years that's

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.800 
has more remaining years that's
necessary<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.710> course<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:15.210> engines<00:05:15.570> are

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
necessary of course the engines are

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.120 
necessary of course the engines are
smaller<00:05:16.170> for<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.220> guys<00:05:17.400> who<00:05:17.760> want<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.180> do<00:05:18.330> this

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
smaller for the guys who want to do this

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.540 
smaller for the guys who want to do this
yes<00:05:20.130> they<00:05:20.580> are<00:05:20.610> smaller<00:05:21.090> smaller<00:05:22.020> smaller

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
yes they are smaller smaller smaller

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.430 
yes they are smaller smaller smaller
don't<00:05:23.550> know<00:05:23.670> which<00:05:24.000> engines<00:05:24.810> they<00:05:25.020> are<00:05:25.170> there

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
don't know which engines they are there

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.500 
don't know which engines they are there
could<00:05:25.620> be<00:05:25.760> General<00:05:26.760> Electric<00:05:27.270> or<00:05:27.480> a

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
could be General Electric or a

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.380 
could be General Electric or a
rolls-royce<00:05:28.190> if<00:05:29.190> you<00:05:29.340> like<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:29.850> you<00:05:30.180> go

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
rolls-royce if you like that you go

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.590 
rolls-royce if you like that you go
search<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:31.280> tell<00:05:32.280> me<00:05:32.430> if<00:05:32.820> you<00:05:33.030> move<00:05:33.270> it

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
search it tell me if you move it

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.130 
search it tell me if you move it
of<00:05:34.110> course<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.560> 747<00:05:35.370> is<00:05:35.460> wider<00:05:35.900> then<00:05:36.900> it's

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
of course the 747 is wider then it's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:47.270 
of course the 747 is wider then it's
triple<00:05:37.860> 7<00:05:39.530> but<00:05:40.530> yeah<00:05:40.770> that's<00:05:41.040> just<00:05:42.590> no<00:05:45.920> new<00:05:46.920> for

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
triple 7 but yeah that's just no new for

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.030 
triple 7 but yeah that's just no new for
you<00:05:47.400> guys<00:05:48.230> first<00:05:49.230> off<00:05:49.380> start<00:05:49.530> off<00:05:49.770> with<00:05:49.920> the

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
you guys first off start off with the

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.940 
you guys first off start off with the
engines<00:05:50.400> on<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.730> a380<00:05:51.240> of<00:05:51.420> Emirates<00:05:51.950> they're

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
engines on the a380 of Emirates they're

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.250 
engines on the a380 of Emirates they're
way<00:05:53.130> bigger<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.730> then<00:05:54.600> of<00:05:54.750> 100<00:05:55.170> 747<00:05:55.980> -<00:05:56.100> wings

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
way bigger and then of 100 747 - wings

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.740 
way bigger and then of 100 747 - wings
are<00:05:58.260> also<00:05:58.530> oh<00:05:58.830> my<00:05:59.010> god<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.880> looks<00:05:59.910> just<00:06:00.450> one<00:06:00.660> of

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
are also oh my god it looks just one of

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.960 
are also oh my god it looks just one of
its<00:06:00.930> gears<00:06:01.370> need<00:06:02.370> to<00:06:02.520> repair<00:06:02.880> that<00:06:04.820> we'll<00:06:05.820> need

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
its gears need to repair that we'll need

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.240 
its gears need to repair that we'll need
to<00:06:06.150> repair<00:06:06.510> it<00:06:06.630> at<00:06:06.750> some<00:06:06.990> other<00:06:07.080> day<00:06:10.010> the<00:06:11.010> wings

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
to repair it at some other day the wings

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.360 
to repair it at some other day the wings
are<00:06:11.520> very<00:06:11.550> bigger<00:06:11.970> as<00:06:12.390> you<00:06:12.510> can<00:06:12.750> see<00:06:13.340> now<00:06:14.340> you

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
are very bigger as you can see now you

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.850 
are very bigger as you can see now you
can<00:06:14.700> see<00:06:14.910> because<00:06:15.150> I<00:06:15.330> zoomed<00:06:15.780> in<00:06:15.900> I'm<00:06:16.350> a<00:06:16.410> lazy

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
can see because I zoomed in I'm a lazy

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.950 
can see because I zoomed in I'm a lazy
idiot<00:06:17.400> I<00:06:17.490> can<00:06:17.790> zoom<00:06:18.000> out<00:06:18.180> anyway

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
idiot I can zoom out anyway

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.590 
idiot I can zoom out anyway
it's<00:06:19.560> long<00:06:19.800> worthy<00:06:20.190> amirite<00:06:20.460> it's<00:06:21.060> 2<00:06:21.360> meter

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
it's long worthy amirite it's 2 meter

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.899 
it's long worthy amirite it's 2 meter
longer<00:06:22.080> and

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 
longer and

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.359 
longer and
these<00:06:23.909> are<00:06:24.119> way<00:06:24.299> bigger<00:06:24.709> in<00:06:25.709> real<00:06:25.739> life<00:06:26.129> it's

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:26.369 
these are way bigger in real life it's

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.399 
these are way bigger in real life it's
two<00:06:26.639> meter<00:06:26.909> longer<00:06:27.329> and<00:06:27.599> I<00:06:27.809> don't<00:06:27.899> know<00:06:28.169> it's

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
two meter longer and I don't know it's

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.259 
two meter longer and I don't know it's
for<00:06:28.709> this<00:06:29.329> but<00:06:30.329> it<00:06:30.509> seems<00:06:30.989> to<00:06:31.229> be<00:06:31.349> that<00:06:31.379> the

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:32.269 
for this but it seems to be that the

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:35.899 
for this but it seems to be that the
747-8<00:06:33.269> it's<00:06:34.199> longer<00:06:34.499> than<00:06:34.739> the<00:06:34.889> a380<00:06:35.459> I<00:06:35.549> don't

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
747-8 it's longer than the a380 I don't

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.959 
747-8 it's longer than the a380 I don't
know<00:06:35.999> that<00:06:36.239> exactly<00:06:37.049> you<00:06:37.829> should<00:06:37.859> go<00:06:38.249> and<00:06:38.519> find

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
know that exactly you should go and find

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:40.969 
know that exactly you should go and find
it<00:06:39.119> on<00:06:39.239> Wikipedia<00:06:39.869> or<00:06:39.929> something<00:06:39.989> you<00:06:40.649> can<00:06:40.829> go
