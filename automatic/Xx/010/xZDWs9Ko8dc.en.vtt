 all people today I show you as you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.970
 a free server at cod4 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.759
 created so there are different 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.009
 possibilities to create a server 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.590
 you want the easiest one here 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.199
 Let's have one first 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.050
 free providers can be found here 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.240
 example of freedom hosting would have to be on the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.300
 people have to go then you've got to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 we register and then your data 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.760
 approach and then confirm 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.660
 on your e-mail account and then you 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.579
 Sign in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.399
 I am already registered I would like 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.730
 me now with my e mail and the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.730
 password 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.870
 ok if he is logged in, it looks like that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.420
 out 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.510
 here you have the password 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.230
 change your mind here but yes we do 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.520
 now have to go to the control panel 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.100
 Here you can use different servers 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.309
 different play east and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.080
 administer 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.110
 we are better now the area can 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.500
 one also with her for example css or 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.250
 do so 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.729
 Here you can start the servers 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.480
 to stop 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.250
 meditate and delete 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.560
 ever have a new server first 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.140
 by going adserver here or 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.540
 here you have the check mark here 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.730
 and then start stopping 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.020
 or imitate 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.940
 that looks like this you can do here 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.300
 then enter the name 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.530
 because how many players the server 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.540
 should have maximum 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.400
 Of course, the map changes again 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.070
 personally with voting we do 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.500
 this map order in game cube den 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.070
 can also change while playing 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.890
 escape and vote for example whether 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.640
 her motto wolz here is now no time 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.010
 against the out while otherwise the mods 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.260
 if they are not yet doctors and if you are 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.130
 then the superbike himself 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.330
 automatically under the motto frank tinker 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.050
 and tv streaming I have too 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.390
 ordered passport theme mono made 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.010
 I can to take out ok safe and then 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.390
 you have to put it in here you see 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.890
 how many servers 3 are 183 260 later 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.100
 that is to eat it freely to logically 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.500
 shoot as many free and as 70 free 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.070
 the beautiful we can get one to 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.830
 rescue 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:46.080
 i did not mean states relax 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:53.480
 you did it because the ip he would 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.480
 mark what am I doing here so 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:05.340
 she drinks and then you have to open cod 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.350
 so if you have a password you have to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.070
 go to game every password 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.040
 enter 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.590
 that was okay but we do not want any 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.720
 have set second 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.240
 then you can here new favorite the ip 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.970
 go so I do not do that 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:31.170
 you are faster and then easy 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.090
 carrying paper 1 along and very important 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.040
 once you have started the server and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.410
 nobody is in it is the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.140
 automatically has you must within 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.970
 if ten minutes or so go in 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.620
 you will soon be starting us 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.940
 automatically cleared again and that 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.280
 Charging and since we have one again 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.269
 start new okay that connects 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.720
 here I am not so fast 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.720
 Internet 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.680

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.290

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.260
 somewhere else 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.820
 and then you can play if you 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.560
 want to make a local server 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.690
 You order to order such a local 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.959
