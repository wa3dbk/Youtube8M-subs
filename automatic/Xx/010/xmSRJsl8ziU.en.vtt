that<00:05:09.860> they're<00:05:10.009> not<00:05:10.160> manipulating<00:05:10.940> I<00:05:11.060> guess<00:05:11.300> is

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
that they're not manipulating I guess is

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.629 
that they're not manipulating I guess is
is<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:12.259> silver<00:05:12.530> market<00:05:12.770> everybody<00:05:13.400> knows

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
is the silver market everybody knows

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:14.950 
is the silver market everybody knows
they<00:05:13.820> were<00:05:13.880> involved<00:05:14.150> in<00:05:14.389> the<00:05:14.449> LIBOR<00:05:14.930> scandal

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
they were involved in the LIBOR scandal

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.290

what<00:05:15.949> just<00:05:16.130> gold<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.610> silver<00:05:17.000> they're<00:05:17.150> not

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
what just gold and silver they're not

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.480 
what just gold and silver they're not
manipulating<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:18.740> that's<00:05:19.009> just<00:05:19.220> one

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
manipulating so but that's just one

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.900 
manipulating so but that's just one
thing<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.419> I<00:05:20.449> think<00:05:21.050> we<00:05:21.229> can<00:05:21.729> explain<00:05:22.729> it

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
thing and I I think we can explain it

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.170 
thing and I I think we can explain it
from<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.180> goddess<00:05:23.570> standpoint<00:05:24.169> is<00:05:24.349> that<00:05:24.380> the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
from a goddess standpoint is that the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.339 
from a goddess standpoint is that the
investigators<00:05:26.180> are<00:05:26.479> checking<00:05:27.139> everything

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
investigators are checking everything

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.990 
investigators are checking everything
out<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:27.650> they're<00:05:27.919> realizing<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.639> their<00:05:28.849> own

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
out and they're realizing that their own

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.600 
out and they're realizing that their own
government<00:05:29.330> is<00:05:29.750> part<00:05:30.080> of<00:05:30.289> the<00:05:30.610> manipulation

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
government is part of the manipulation

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.310 
government is part of the manipulation

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
the gander well I guess some people

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.890 
the gander well I guess some people
would<00:06:01.370> argue<00:06:01.430> that's<00:06:01.759> the<00:06:02.090> exact<00:06:02.360> reason<00:06:02.449> gold

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
would argue that's the exact reason gold

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.600 
would argue that's the exact reason gold
is<00:06:03.050> going<00:06:03.320> down<00:06:03.530> because<00:06:03.889> the<00:06:04.009> stock<00:06:04.250> market

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.480 
is going down because the stock market
is<00:06:04.729> rallying<00:06:05.830> well<00:06:06.830> they<00:06:06.979> can<00:06:07.159> say<00:06:07.310> what<00:06:07.460> they
