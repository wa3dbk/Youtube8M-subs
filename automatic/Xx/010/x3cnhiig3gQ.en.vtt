you<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.270> stopped<00:02:18.690> doing<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
you that I stopped doing the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.229 
you that I stopped doing the
only<00:02:19.799> because<00:02:20.159> it's<00:02:20.400> immature<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.090> stupid

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
only because it's immature and stupid

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.630 
only because it's immature and stupid
but<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> truth<00:02:22.439> is<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.860> stopped<00:02:23.129> doing<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
but the truth is I stopped doing it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.460 
but the truth is I stopped doing it
because<00:02:23.909> experience<00:02:24.510> has<00:02:24.659> taught<00:02:24.840> me<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.260> it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
because experience has taught me that it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.259 
because experience has taught me that it
really<00:02:25.739> doesn't<00:02:26.159> work<00:02:26.250> very<00:02:26.549> well<00:02:26.610> at<00:02:26.909> all

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
really doesn't work very well at all

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.390 
really doesn't work very well at all
now<00:02:27.870> there<00:02:28.049> can<00:02:28.230> frequently<00:02:28.530> be<00:02:28.739> a<00:02:28.920> lapse<00:02:29.220> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
now there can frequently be a lapse of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.610 
now there can frequently be a lapse of
time<00:02:29.610> between<00:02:30.120> when<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.569> person<00:02:31.049> says<00:02:31.319> they

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
time between when a person says they

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589 
time between when a person says they
forgive<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.189> and<00:02:32.370> when<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:32.909> actually<00:02:33.090> do

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
forgive you and when they actually do

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.420 
forgive you and when they actually do
forgive<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.439> guess<00:02:35.069> I've<00:02:35.250> been<00:02:35.280> in

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
