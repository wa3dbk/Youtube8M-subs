00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.760
 ae 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 already gave 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 No, I'm not a Corinthian, just a religious. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.909
 your sister selma 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.600
 For those of you who do not know me, I work with 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.250
 exceptional children 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 not that she is but I like to treat 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.820
 them like that 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:11.670
 I really would like to be here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.690
 singing but the grace that is superior here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.060
 within and guided in the sense that 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.640
 there are many priests many nuns 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:28.850
 launching cds featuring 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.850
 tv but that nuns humorists have points 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:39.780
 so we are launching as a 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:47.100
 nun humorous because second to grace 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:50.179
 It's just a show of humor, finally, God. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.979
 You know what you do, do not you? 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.759
 I do not want your money 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.110
 just want to keep my job here 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.220
 because it is with this money that I go 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.220
 build an orphanage 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.709
 I really want to be afraid of you 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:24.810
 because I think looking after children is 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 something that relaxes people and me 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.519
 I keep my job here, the thing is going 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.000
 work the following way I count 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.000
 joke 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:50.110
 And you see me leaving on this 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:57.730
 joke in the sisters' convent that will 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.730
 It's okay, but they died. 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:19.909
 I pray for them and it happens to my sister. 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:22.329
 magness is quadriplegic sister cynthia 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.069

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.319
