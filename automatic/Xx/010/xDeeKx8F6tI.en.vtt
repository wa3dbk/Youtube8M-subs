let's see if you kind do this see here

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.930 
let's see if you kind do this see here
but<00:03:42.940> that's<00:03:43.209> just<00:03:43.510> because<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.350> clip

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
but that's just because of the clip

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.400 
but that's just because of the clip
that's<00:03:45.940> it's<00:03:46.359> pretty<00:03:46.630> big<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.989> see<00:03:53.200> this

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
that's it's pretty big so you see this

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.509 
that's it's pretty big so you see this
is<00:03:54.120> pretty<00:03:55.120> much<00:03:55.269> bigger<00:03:56.010> because<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.190> click

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
is pretty much bigger because a click

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:05.370 
is pretty much bigger because a click
wheel<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.299> everything<00:03:59.220> video<00:04:00.220> camera<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:05.139> but

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
wheel and everything video camera so but

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.160 
wheel and everything video camera so but
I<00:04:05.410> think<00:04:05.650> neozen<00:04:05.980> great<00:04:06.519> because<00:04:06.940> it's<00:04:07.139> has<00:04:08.139> a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
I think neozen great because it's has a

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.670 
I think neozen great because it's has a
multi-touch<00:04:09.069> screen<00:04:09.549> like<00:04:10.299> it<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.620> I
