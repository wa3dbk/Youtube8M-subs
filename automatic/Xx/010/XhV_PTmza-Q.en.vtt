00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
really not a lot of information

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.280 
really not a lot of information
regarding<00:01:04.949> Lucas<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.549> terms<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.570> custom<00:01:07.049> moves

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
regarding Lucas in terms of custom moves

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.890 
regarding Lucas in terms of custom moves
in<00:01:07.590> terms<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> move<00:01:08.250> set<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.659> terms<00:01:09.689> of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
in terms of move set at all in terms of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350 
in terms of move set at all in terms of
how<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.080> works<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
how he works at all is really just in a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.020 
how he works at all is really just in a
release<00:01:13.260> date<00:01:13.290> announcement<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
release date announcement I'm going to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840 
release date announcement I'm going to
assume<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.299> Lucas<00:01:15.869> has<00:01:16.049> no<00:01:16.500> custom<00:01:17.430> moves

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
assume that Lucas has no custom moves

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670 
assume that Lucas has no custom moves
simply<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.630> Mewtwo<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.200> no<00:01:19.320> custom

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
simply because Mewtwo had no custom

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.800 
simply because Mewtwo had no custom
moves<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.040> YouTube<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.460> also<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> dlc<00:01:21.420> character

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
moves in YouTube is also a dlc character

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.570 
moves in YouTube is also a dlc character
so<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> assume<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> time

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so I'm going to assume that for the time

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
so I'm going to assume that for the time
being<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> custom<00:01:24.390> characters<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.409> DLC

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
being the custom characters or the DLC

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
being the custom characters or the DLC
characters<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.939> any

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
characters are not going to have any

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.960 
characters are not going to have any
custom<00:01:27.689> moves<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.920> might<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.430> them<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
custom moves we might see them in a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.850 
custom moves we might see them in a
later<00:01:30.299> patch<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> moment

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
later patch but I think for the moment

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.590 
later patch but I think for the moment
they<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.369> focusing<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.850> getting<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
they are just focusing on getting the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.370 
they are just focusing on getting the
actual<00:01:34.790> character<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.299> two<00:01:36.750> people<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
actual character out and two people and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
actual character out and two people and
then<00:01:37.500> getting<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> balanced<00:01:38.369> speaking<00:01:39.119> of

of left in the dark there's been no news

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.610 
of left in the dark there's been no news
on<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:11.730> until<00:04:11.850> now<00:04:12.240> which<00:04:12.600> they're<00:04:12.810> saying<00:04:13.050> we

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
on it until now which they're saying we

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.990 
on it until now which they're saying we
are<00:04:13.740> finally<00:04:14.130> going<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.340> get<00:04:14.460> it<00:04:14.610> when<00:04:14.790> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
are finally going to get it when the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.930 
are finally going to get it when the
lucas<00:04:15.390> patch<00:04:15.630> drops<00:04:16.130> which<00:04:17.130> does<00:04:17.489> give<00:04:17.820> us

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
lucas patch drops which does give us

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.690 
lucas patch drops which does give us
also<00:04:18.150> some<00:04:18.450> insight<00:04:18.810> into<00:04:18.840> tournament<00:04:19.530> mode

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
also some insight into tournament mode

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.979 
also some insight into tournament mode
which<00:04:20.700> means<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.210> probably<00:04:21.450> won't<00:04:21.780> get

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
which means that we probably won't get

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.750 
which means that we probably won't get
any<00:04:22.229> information<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:23.010> tournament<00:04:23.370> mode<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.669> it

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
any information in tournament mode so it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
any information in tournament mode so it
sort<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:23.970> really<00:04:24.180> doesn't<00:04:24.419> give<00:04:24.510> us<00:04:24.630> any

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
sort of really doesn't give us any

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.100 
sort of really doesn't give us any
insight<00:04:24.960> at<00:04:25.229> all<00:04:25.350> but<00:04:25.830> we're

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
insight at all but we're

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.779 
insight at all but we're
really<00:04:26.349> probably<00:04:27.219> not<00:04:27.340> going<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.550> get<00:04:27.639> any

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
really probably not going to get any

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.580 
really probably not going to get any
news<00:04:28.060> on<00:04:28.240> tournament<00:04:28.750> mode<00:04:28.840> until<00:04:29.110> they<00:04:29.560> are

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
news on tournament mode until they are

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.589 
news on tournament mode until they are
ready<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:30.129> release<00:04:30.460> it<00:04:30.669> with<00:04:31.150> in<00:04:31.240> which<00:04:31.389> case

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
ready to release it with in which case

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:32.850

I'm<00:05:05.199> sort<00:05:05.379> of<00:05:05.500> looking<00:05:05.680> forward<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:06.069> see<00:05:06.219> how

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
I'm sort of looking forward to see how

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.700 
I'm sort of looking forward to see how
the<00:05:06.400> other<00:05:06.490> earthbound<00:05:07.210> series<00:05:08.139> or<00:05:08.409> I<00:05:08.439> guess<00:05:08.680> a

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
the other earthbound series or I guess a

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.550 
the other earthbound series or I guess a
mother<00:05:08.979> series<00:05:09.460> character<00:05:09.939> is<00:05:10.930> going<00:05:11.289> to<00:05:11.379> work

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
mother series character is going to work

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.850 
mother series character is going to work
because<00:05:11.770> they<00:05:12.099> work<00:05:12.250> similarly<00:05:12.699> in<00:05:13.229> brawl<00:05:14.229> so

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
because they work similarly in brawl so

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.080 
because they work similarly in brawl so
I'm<00:05:14.949> really<00:05:15.099> hoping<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.520> they<00:05:15.639> will<00:05:15.849> be

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
I'm really hoping that they will be

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.820 
I'm really hoping that they will be
similar<00:05:16.389> so<00:05:16.689> I<00:05:16.750> can<00:05:16.900> sort<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.199> dual<00:05:17.379> main<00:05:17.620> them

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
similar so I can sort of dual main them

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.439 
similar so I can sort of dual main them
because<00:05:18.069> that<00:05:18.189> would<00:05:18.279> be<00:05:18.340> really<00:05:18.610> really<00:05:19.060> cool

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
because that would be really really cool

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:20.909 
because that would be really really cool
so<00:05:20.020> let<00:05:20.139> me<00:05:20.199> know<00:05:20.289> what<00:05:20.439> you<00:05:20.500> guys<00:05:20.620> think<00:05:20.770> in
