00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
with the Intel in 2840 just because this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.890 
with the Intel in 2840 just because this
is<00:00:22.070> one<00:00:22.189> of<00:00:22.279> those<00:00:22.340> processors<00:00:22.880> it<00:00:23.180> doesn't

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
is one of those processors it doesn't

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.170 
is one of those processors it doesn't
matter<00:00:24.080> which<00:00:24.349> laptops<00:00:24.950> it<00:00:25.160> it's<00:00:25.490> in<00:00:25.700> you're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
this holiday season 24 28 30 and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.260 
this holiday season 24 28 30 and
especially<00:00:33.830> the<00:00:34.070> 200<00:00:34.730> ollar<00:00:34.910> HP<00:00:35.300> stream<00:00:37.270> 11

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
especially the 200 ollar HP stream 11

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.650 
especially the 200 ollar HP stream 11
and<00:00:38.480> HP<00:00:39.410> stream<00:00:39.559> 13<00:00:40.129> have<00:00:40.730> this<00:00:40.879> processor<00:00:41.449> and

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
and HP stream 13 have this processor and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.030 
and HP stream 13 have this processor and
I<00:00:42.940> believe<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:44.510> you're<00:00:45.200> gonna<00:00:45.350> probably

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
I believe that you're gonna probably

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.380 
I believe that you're gonna probably
have<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.309> whole<00:00:46.460> raft<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.880> other<00:00:47.030> ones<00:00:47.239> out

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
have a whole raft of other ones out

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.590 
have a whole raft of other ones out
there<00:00:47.480> using<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.870> all<00:00:48.320> under<00:00:49.010> $300<00:00:49.790> this<00:00:50.420> is<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
there using it all under $300 this is a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.139 
there using it all under $300 this is a
$250<00:00:51.260> laptop<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:53.270> stream<00:00:53.860> 11th<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:55.280> think

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
$250 laptop and the stream 11th is think

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.360 
$250 laptop and the stream 11th is think
about<00:00:56.300> 200<00:00:56.690> hours<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:57.460> we'll<00:00:58.460> just<00:00:58.610> run<00:00:58.700> some

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
about 200 hours so we'll just run some

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.709 
about 200 hours so we'll just run some
little<00:01:01.370> game<00:01:01.700> tests<00:01:02.000> here<00:01:02.180> with<00:01:02.329> two<00:01:02.510> marine

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
little game tests here with two marine

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.889 
little game tests here with two marine
or<00:01:02.870> Tomb<00:01:03.020> Raider<00:01:03.050> is<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.440> pretty<00:01:04.280> heavy-duty

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
or Tomb Raider is a pretty heavy-duty

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.540 
or Tomb Raider is a pretty heavy-duty
game<00:01:05.899> engine<00:01:07.149> so<00:01:08.149> it's<00:01:08.990> always<00:01:09.289> one<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:09.710> you

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
game engine so it's always one that you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.190 
game engine so it's always one that you
know<00:01:10.670> graphics<00:01:10.880> cards<00:01:11.420> they<00:01:11.509> like<00:01:11.660> to<00:01:11.810> run<00:01:11.960> the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
know graphics cards they like to run the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.880 
know graphics cards they like to run the
the<00:01:12.440> Tomb<00:01:12.710> Raider<00:01:12.740> benchmark<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.679> see<00:01:15.679> how<00:01:15.770> it

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
the Tomb Raider benchmark and see how it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.650 
the Tomb Raider benchmark and see how it
is<00:01:15.979> now<00:01:16.160> this<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.580> low<00:01:16.819> settings<00:01:17.330> it<00:01:17.539> is

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
is now this is the low settings it is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:27.899 
is now this is the low settings it is
set<00:01:17.929> to<00:01:18.340> 800<00:01:19.340> by<00:01:19.399> 600<00:01:21.670> so

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.710 

but<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.030> seems<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.479> have<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:32.320> good<00:01:33.320> luck<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.799> it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
but it seems to have a a good luck to it

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.660 
but it seems to have a a good luck to it
some<00:01:35.720> nice<00:01:35.930> nice<00:01:36.530> effects<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:37.159> even<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.520> Tomb

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
some nice nice effects of even the Tomb

00:01:37.670 --> 00:02:08.820 
some nice nice effects of even the Tomb
Raider<00:01:37.700> engines

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.310 

so<00:02:09.400> after<00:02:09.760> this<00:02:09.880> mate<00:02:10.150> we'll<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.600> do<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
so after this mate we'll just do a

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.500 
so after this mate we'll just do a
little<00:02:11.620> bit<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.860> gameplay<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.310> don't<00:02:12.610> wanna<00:02:12.850> run

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
little bit of gameplay I don't wanna run

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.070 
little bit of gameplay I don't wanna run
optimize<00:02:14.460> your<00:02:15.460> time<00:02:15.760> you're<00:02:16.030> watching<00:02:16.210> to

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
optimize your time you're watching to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.420 
optimize your time you're watching to
rate<00:02:17.320> anything<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.710> find<00:02:17.860> out<00:02:18.070> what<00:02:18.160> it's<00:02:18.280> all

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
rate anything you find out what it's all

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.820 
rate anything you find out what it's all
about<00:02:18.460> but<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.210> so<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.390> get<00:02:19.570> an<00:02:19.630> idea<00:02:19.900> how<00:02:20.650> it

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
about but just so you get an idea how it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.350 
about but just so you get an idea how it
performs<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:22.060> little<00:02:22.390> chip<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:24.300> what<00:02:25.300> do

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
performs on this little chip and what do

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.130 
performs on this little chip and what do
we<00:02:25.480> got<00:02:25.660> there

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
we got there

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.250 
we got there
I've<00:02:27.010> got<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.550> you'll<00:02:28.450> notice<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.990> minimum

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
I've got the you'll notice the minimum

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.950 
I've got the you'll notice the minimum
frame<00:02:29.440> rate<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:30.280> point<00:02:30.550> three<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
frame rate is what point three of a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.170 
frame rate is what point three of a
frame<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.700> keep<00:02:33.700> mind<00:02:33.910> I've<00:02:34.060> got<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:36.180> vsync

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
frame so keep mind I've got the vsync

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.120 
frame so keep mind I've got the vsync
off<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.900> that's<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.560> part<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.890> frame

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
off so that's just part of the frame

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.830 
off so that's just part of the frame
buffer<00:02:39.340> there<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> pay<00:02:40.060> no<00:02:40.120> attention<00:02:40.240> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
buffer there the pay no attention to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.240 
buffer there the pay no attention to
that<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.360> maximum<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.020> 24<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
that and the maximum is 24 in the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.670 
that and the maximum is 24 in the
average<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:48.030> 19.3<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.330> not<00:02:50.020> too<00:02:50.140> bad

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.010 

considering<00:02:53.680> it's<00:02:53.980> tomb<00:02:54.550> raider<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.750> anyway

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
considering it's tomb raider so anyway

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.500 
considering it's tomb raider so anyway
what<00:02:56.230> we'll<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:56.980> do<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> little<00:02:57.820> bit<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.300> run

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
what we'll just do a little bit of a run

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.590 
what we'll just do a little bit of a run
you're<00:02:59.380> not<00:02:59.410> much<00:02:59.910> but<00:03:00.910> just<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.300> you<00:03:01.360> get<00:03:01.510> an

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
you're not much but just so you get an

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.670 
you're not much but just so you get an
idea<00:03:03.180> little<00:03:04.180> devices<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.840> mean<00:03:04.990> it<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.620> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
idea little devices I mean it for the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.400 
idea little devices I mean it for the
processor<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.030> cost<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:08.080> you're

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
processor that's in the cost that you're

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.930 
processor that's in the cost that you're
paying<00:03:08.650> for<00:03:08.830> these<00:03:08.920> guys<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:10.290> pretty<00:03:11.290> good

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
paying for these guys it's pretty good

was talking about the in 2840 I had to
talk<00:04:07.189> about<00:04:07.250> how<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:07.939> a<00:04:08.060> dual<00:04:08.269> core<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:10.959> you

talk about how it's a dual core and you
know<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:12.109> can't<00:04:12.500> expect<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.370> lot<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.879> modern

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
know you can't expect a lot of modern

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.789 
know you can't expect a lot of modern
games<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.689> take<00:04:14.870> advantage<00:04:15.319> of<00:04:15.409> multiple

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
games to take advantage of multiple

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.449 
games to take advantage of multiple
cores<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.789> because<00:04:17.500> it's<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.709> do<00:04:18.889> a<00:04:18.919> forum<00:04:19.310> um

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
cores just because it's to do a forum um

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.570 
cores just because it's to do a forum um
things<00:04:19.699> are<00:04:19.820> kind<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.090> learn<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.539> to<00:04:20.900> Quad<00:04:21.139> four

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
things are kind of learn to to Quad four

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.279 
things are kind of learn to to Quad four
so<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.610> guess<00:04:23.389> I'm<00:04:23.509> supposed<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.780> meet<00:04:23.960> here

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.779 

they<00:04:30.289> don't<00:04:30.530> make<00:04:30.740> three<00:04:31.070> bridges<00:04:31.280> like<00:04:31.610> they

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
they don't make three bridges like they

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:39.939 
they don't make three bridges like they
used<00:04:32.000> to<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:34.370> our<00:04:34.580> lady<00:04:38.110> much<00:04:39.110> better<00:04:39.380> much

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
used to and our lady much better much

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.529 
used to and our lady much better much
better<00:04:39.979> than<00:04:40.370> my<00:04:40.460> last<00:04:40.490> attempt<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.360> these

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
better than my last attempt on these

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:56.280 
better than my last attempt on these
streams<00:04:41.780> ever

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.020 

so<00:04:56.830> even<00:04:57.010> though<00:04:57.130> we've<00:04:57.250> got<00:04:57.280> low<00:04:57.640> settings

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
so even though we've got low settings

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.100 
so even though we've got low settings
because<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.630> Tomb<00:04:58.840> Raider<00:04:58.870> engine<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.850> a

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
because the the Tomb Raider engine is a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.950 
because the the Tomb Raider engine is a
nice-looking<00:05:02.110> one<00:05:03.540> there's<00:05:04.540> not<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> lot<00:05:05.020> of

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
nice-looking one there's not a lot of

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.710 
nice-looking one there's not a lot of
compromises<00:05:07.960> in<00:05:08.110> terms<00:05:08.350> of<00:05:09.300> losing<00:05:10.300> graphical

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
compromises in terms of losing graphical

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.450 
compromises in terms of losing graphical
fidelity<00:05:10.870> it<00:05:11.320> does<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.650> does<00:05:11.770> look<00:05:11.950> quite<00:05:12.220> nice

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
fidelity it does it does look quite nice

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.800 
fidelity it does it does look quite nice
still<00:05:12.790> even<00:05:13.120> at<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.330> most<00:05:13.480> hitting<00:05:18.630> one<00:05:19.630> I'll

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
still even at the most hitting one I'll

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:27.810 
still even at the most hitting one I'll

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
I'm just kind of off in a second they

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.040 
I'm just kind of off in a second they
don't<00:05:59.560> want<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.770> hear<00:06:00.010> then<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.280> scream<00:06:01.050> all

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050

right<00:06:02.110> one<00:06:02.560> more<00:06:02.680> time<00:06:03.210> big<00:06:04.210> time<00:06:04.419> -<00:06:04.510> charlie

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.800 

all<00:06:12.190> right<00:06:12.370> then<00:06:12.610> you've<00:06:13.060> got<00:06:13.389> an<00:06:13.480> idea<00:06:13.690> of

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
all right then you've got an idea of

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.900 
all right then you've got an idea of
what<00:06:13.990> -<00:06:14.530> Rader<00:06:14.830> is<00:06:15.040> on<00:06:15.280> this<00:06:15.460> n<00:06:16.290> 28:40<00:06:17.320> so<00:06:18.100> and

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
what - Rader is on this n 28:40 so and

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.150 
what - Rader is on this n 28:40 so and
hopefully<00:06:19.840> that<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:21.840> helps<00:06:22.860> make<00:06:23.860> you<00:06:23.950> think

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
hopefully that that helps make you think

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.469 
hopefully that that helps make you think
that<00:06:24.310> if<00:06:24.400> you<00:06:24.430> end<00:06:24.639> up<00:06:24.729> with<00:06:25.000> one<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.300> these
