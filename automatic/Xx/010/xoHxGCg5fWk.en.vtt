very comfortable with this um it's time

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.439 
very comfortable with this um it's time
to<00:00:16.740> make<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.250> first<00:00:17.609> sound<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:20.300> there's<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
to make your first sound and there's a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.900 
to make your first sound and there's a
couple<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.080> tricks<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.949> doing<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.699> help

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
couple of tricks for doing this to help

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.490 
couple of tricks for doing this to help
reduce<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.570> frustration<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.910> is

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
reduce the frustration the first one is

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.450 
reduce the frustration the first one is
use<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> very<00:00:28.949> small<00:00:29.340> section<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> bow<00:00:31.460> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
use a very small section of the bow the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
use a very small section of the bow the
coordination<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.480> takes<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.960> get<00:00:34.110> from

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
coordination that it takes to get from

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.119 
coordination that it takes to get from
here<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.059> way<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> constant

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
here all the way to here with a constant

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.790 
here all the way to here with a constant
sound<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.790> completely<00:00:39.719> unnecessary<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
sound it's completely unnecessary to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
sound it's completely unnecessary to
deal<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.520> first<00:00:41.579> that's<00:00:42.570> where<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> lot<00:00:43.230> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
deal with at first that's where a lot of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160 
deal with at first that's where a lot of
the<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.980> sound<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.730> screeching<00:00:45.300> cat<00:00:45.510> kind

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the I sound like a screeching cat kind

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650 
the I sound like a screeching cat kind
of<00:00:46.320> stuff<00:00:46.590> comes<00:00:46.890> from<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
of stuff comes from is just because it

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
of stuff comes from is just because it
takes<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.140> while<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.070> all<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> those<00:00:50.489> things

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
takes a while to get all of those things

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
takes a while to get all of those things
coordinated<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.410> don't<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> deal

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
coordinated and you don't have to deal

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
coordinated and you don't have to deal
with<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.520> first<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.570> make<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.750> great

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
with that at first you can make a great

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.470 
with that at first you can make a great
sound<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.850> much<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
sound with just about this much of the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
sound with just about this much of the
bow<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.500> even<00:00:58.680> put<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.430> fun

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
bow you can even put a little fun

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.360 
bow you can even put a little fun
sticker<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.620> remind<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.340> not

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
sticker here and here to remind you not

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
sticker here and here to remind you not
to<00:01:02.730> leave<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.390> section<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.049> bow<00:01:04.320> at

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to leave that section of the bow at

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.460 
to leave that section of the bow at
first<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.990> what<00:01:06.990> we're<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.729> is

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
first and what we're going to do is

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.090 
first and what we're going to do is
place<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.360> bow<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.020> string<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.890> your

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
place the bow on the string at your

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.219 
place the bow on the string at your
bottom<00:01:14.580> sticker<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.689> probably<00:01:15.960> should<00:01:16.200> have

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bottom sticker I probably should have

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.289 
bottom sticker I probably should have
put<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.850> didn't

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
put some on here for this but I didn't

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
put some on here for this but I didn't
so<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:19.140> imagine<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.650> there's<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> dot<00:01:20.250> here

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
so just imagine that there's a dot here

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
so just imagine that there's a dot here
and<00:01:20.640> another<00:01:20.939> dot<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.720> we're<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and another dot here and we're just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.450 
and another dot here and we're just
going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> start<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> lower<00:01:23.610> dot<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:26.400> now

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
going to start at the lower dot and now

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.789 
going to start at the lower dot and now
here's<00:01:26.939> something<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> do

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
here's something that I want you to do

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
here's something that I want you to do
before<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.400> make<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> sound

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
before you make a sound

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.870 
before you make a sound
once<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.350> bow<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> rested<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> string<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
once the bow is rested on the string and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.460 
once the bow is rested on the string and
it's<00:01:33.150> kind<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.420> tricky<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.990> me<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it's kind of tricky for me to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.700 
it's kind of tricky for me to
demonstrate<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.570> without<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> cameraman<00:01:37.229> um

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
demonstrate it without a cameraman um

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.410 
demonstrate it without a cameraman um
but<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.990> mirror<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
but it is to look in the mirror and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.020 
but it is to look in the mirror and
before<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> even<00:01:42.720> try<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> make<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> sound

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
before you even try to make a sound

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210 
before you even try to make a sound
check<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.770> move<00:01:47.040> your

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
check this out that if you move your

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.569 
check this out that if you move your
hand<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:47.930> it's<00:01:48.930> even<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.680> tiny<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.310> it's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
hand this way it's even a tiny bit it's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.060 
hand this way it's even a tiny bit it's
going<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.030> drastically<00:01:51.720> change<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.500> angle<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
going to drastically change the angle of

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.359 
going to drastically change the angle of
the<00:01:53.220> bow<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.790> strings<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:55.040> for<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> best

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the bow to the strings and for the best

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.300 
the bow to the strings and for the best
sound<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.969> always<00:01:57.630> want<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.439> bow<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.159> be

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
sound you always want the bow to be

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.459 
sound you always want the bow to be
completely<00:01:59.850> perpendicular<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.170> string

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
completely perpendicular to the string

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.889 
completely perpendicular to the string
and<00:02:01.909> that's<00:02:02.909> another<00:02:03.210> thing<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:03.750> just

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
and that's another thing that's just

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.310 
and that's another thing that's just
going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> take<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.950> little<00:02:05.189> getting<00:02:05.549> used<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
going to take a little getting used to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
going to take a little getting used to
because<00:02:07.320> there's<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.429> many<00:02:08.759> ways<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
because there's just so many ways that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.490 
because there's just so many ways that
our<00:02:09.509> arms<00:02:10.080> go<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.860> you're<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
our arms go and you're going to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.590 
our arms go and you're going to
this<00:02:13.070> little<00:02:13.400> path<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.060> want<00:02:14.240> your<00:02:14.360> arm

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
this little path that you want your arm

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.710 
this little path that you want your arm
and<00:02:15.260> risk<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.830> stay<00:02:16.130> on<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.640> it's<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.480> going

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
and risk to stay on and it's just going

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.020 
and risk to stay on and it's just going
to<00:02:17.780> take<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> little<00:02:18.260> practice<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.760> more

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
to take a little practice but the more

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.900 
to take a little practice but the more
times<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.720> do<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.020> right<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.910> other

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
times that you do it right in other

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.060 
times that you do it right in other
words<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.780> more<00:02:23.960> time<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.530> take<00:02:24.860> the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
words the more time that you take the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.360 
words the more time that you take the
very<00:02:25.310> first<00:02:25.460> time<00:02:26.000> before<00:02:26.360> making<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.020> sound

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
very first time before making the sound

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.860 
very first time before making the sound
the<00:02:28.370> less<00:02:28.550> bad<00:02:28.760> habits<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.330> you'll<00:02:29.540> create

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
the less bad habits that you'll create

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.310 
the less bad habits that you'll create
and<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.950> sooner<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.400> you'll<00:02:31.760> actually

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
and the sooner that you'll actually

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.410 
and the sooner that you'll actually
learn<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:34.070> with<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.820> this<00:02:34.940> violence

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
learn it so as with all of this violence

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.680 
learn it so as with all of this violence
stuff<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:36.050> don't<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.830> in<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.010> rush<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.610> as<00:02:38.540> you

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
stuff just don't be in a rush and as you

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.040 
stuff just don't be in a rush and as you
look<00:02:38.930> into<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.290> mirror<00:02:40.690> you'll<00:02:41.690> find<00:02:41.959> that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
look into the mirror you'll find that

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.390 
look into the mirror you'll find that
it's<00:02:42.230> kind<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.470> weird<00:02:42.740> at<00:02:42.890> first<00:02:42.920> because

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
it's kind of weird at first because

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.060 
it's kind of weird at first because
you're<00:02:43.700> seeing<00:02:44.000> your<00:02:44.209> reverse<00:02:44.750> image<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:45.950> if

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
you're seeing your reverse image but if

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.640 
you're seeing your reverse image but if
you<00:02:46.250> can<00:02:46.459> line<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.790> up<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.510> where<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.350> bridge

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
you can line it up to where this bridge

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.160 
you can line it up to where this bridge
looks<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.550> single<00:02:50.030> line<00:02:50.300> in<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.780> mirror

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
looks like a single line in the mirror

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.440 
looks like a single line in the mirror
instead<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.610> know<00:02:52.640> I'm<00:02:52.940> not<00:02:53.060> sure<00:02:53.120> if<00:02:53.390> I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
instead of you know I'm not sure if I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.640 
instead of you know I'm not sure if I
have<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.690> lined<00:02:53.900> up<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.170> camera<00:02:54.410> right<00:02:54.590> now

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
have it lined up to the camera right now

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.710 
have it lined up to the camera right now
but<00:02:54.950> maybe<00:02:55.580> in<00:02:55.730> one<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.120> these<00:02:56.239> angles<00:02:56.450> you'll

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
but maybe in one of these angles you'll

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.660 
but maybe in one of these angles you'll
see<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.200> bridge<00:02:57.440> becomes<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:58.550> a

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
see that the bridge becomes just a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.880 
see that the bridge becomes just a
little<00:02:58.910> line<00:02:59.150> instead<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.810> seeing<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.320> the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
little line instead of seeing that the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.770 
little line instead of seeing that the
surface<00:03:01.280> side<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.670> bridge<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.239> that's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
surface side of the bridge and that's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.090 
surface side of the bridge and that's
what<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.140> want<00:03:03.290> that's<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.650> position<00:03:03.830> that

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
what you want that's the position that

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.340 
what you want that's the position that
you<00:03:04.310> want<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.610> find<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.270> mirror<00:03:05.690> that's

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
you want to find in the mirror that's

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.110 
you want to find in the mirror that's
going<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> make<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.010> easier<00:03:07.370> for<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.790> tell

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
going to make it easier for you to tell

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.650 
going to make it easier for you to tell
when<00:03:09.080> your<00:03:09.440> bow<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:10.209> perpendicular<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
when your bow is perpendicular to the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.449 
when your bow is perpendicular to the
string<00:03:11.900> otherwise<00:03:12.530> it's<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.890> little<00:03:13.100> deceiving

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
string otherwise it's a little deceiving

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.350 
string otherwise it's a little deceiving
and<00:03:13.790> then<00:03:14.630> you're<00:03:15.020> going<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.260> want<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:16.360> change

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
and then you're going to want to change

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.990 
and then you're going to want to change
this<00:03:19.540> slowly<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.780> with<00:03:20.900> no<00:03:21.080> frustration

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
this slowly and with no frustration

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.080 
this slowly and with no frustration
until<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:24.080> are<00:03:24.459> perpendicular<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.940> I'm

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
until you are perpendicular and I'm

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.400 
until you are perpendicular and I'm
going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.299> guess<00:03:26.450> it's<00:03:26.660> somewhere<00:03:26.989> right

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
going to guess it's somewhere right

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.110 
going to guess it's somewhere right
about<00:03:27.640> there<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:30.670> when<00:03:31.670> you're<00:03:31.790> totally

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
about there and when you're totally

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.810 
about there and when you're totally
ready<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:33.170> bow<00:03:33.350> is<00:03:33.560> silently<00:03:34.070> sitting<00:03:34.640> on

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
ready and the bow is silently sitting on

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.180 
ready and the bow is silently sitting on
the<00:03:34.910> string<00:03:35.239> then<00:03:36.170> you'll<00:03:36.530> be<00:03:36.680> ready<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.040> make

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
the string then you'll be ready to make

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.130 
the string then you'll be ready to make
your<00:03:37.340> sound<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:39.140> just<00:03:39.320> draw<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.709> down<00:03:41.140> to

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
your sound and you just draw it down to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.530 
your sound and you just draw it down to
the<00:03:42.260> other<00:03:42.410> sticker<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:44.090> sounds<00:03:44.420> just

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
the other sticker and the sounds just

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.130 
the other sticker and the sounds just
going<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.840> last<00:03:44.989> for<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.380> second<00:03:45.950> or<00:03:46.100> two<00:03:47.049> but<00:03:48.049> it

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
going to last for a second or two but it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.020 
going to last for a second or two but it
should<00:03:48.320> be<00:03:48.350> easier<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:48.890> get<00:03:49.130> a<00:03:49.160> nice<00:03:49.400> tone<00:03:49.790> than

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
should be easier to get a nice tone than

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.030 
should be easier to get a nice tone than
if<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.269> were<00:03:50.390> trying<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.840> do<00:03:50.959> really<00:03:51.470> long<00:03:51.739> bow

freeze um don't don't keep playing
because<00:03:59.989> now<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.010> wonderful<00:04:01.730> time<00:04:02.000> to

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
because now is a wonderful time to

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.530 
because now is a wonderful time to
assess<00:04:02.870> if<00:04:03.170> you're<00:04:03.440> still<00:04:04.299> perpendicular<00:04:05.299> um

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
assess if you're still perpendicular um

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.539 
assess if you're still perpendicular um
so<00:04:06.140> this<00:04:06.350> whole<00:04:06.560> thing<00:04:06.799> should<00:04:07.160> be<00:04:07.220> taking

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
so this whole thing should be taking

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.000 
so this whole thing should be taking
place<00:04:07.670> in<00:04:07.760> front<00:04:07.970> of<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.269> mirror<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:09.010> then

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
place in front of the mirror and then

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.530 
place in front of the mirror and then
when<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.250> get<00:04:10.400> there<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.910> can<00:04:10.940> see<00:04:11.360> what<00:04:11.480> it

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
when you get there you can see what it

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.800 
when you get there you can see what it
looks<00:04:11.720> like<00:04:11.780> here<00:04:12.290> look<00:04:13.040> in<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.280> mirror<00:04:13.810> get

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
looks like here look in the mirror get

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.710 
looks like here look in the mirror get
perpendicular<00:04:15.530> again<00:04:15.829> and<00:04:16.160> then<00:04:17.150> do<00:04:17.450> an<00:04:17.570> up

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
perpendicular again and then do an up

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.680 
perpendicular again and then do an up
bow<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:19.400> anytime<00:04:19.669> you're<00:04:20.060> starting<00:04:20.510> at<00:04:20.599> the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
bow so anytime you're starting at the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.420 
bow so anytime you're starting at the
bottom<00:04:20.810> sticker<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:21.500> going<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:21.919> stop<00:04:22.160> one

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
bottom sticker and going to the stop one

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.020 
bottom sticker and going to the stop one
I<00:04:22.640> mean<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.599> top<00:04:23.840> one

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
I mean to the top one

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.010 
I mean to the top one
that's<00:04:25.450> called<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:26.050> down<00:04:26.260> bow<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.970> then<00:04:28.840> when

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
that's called a down bow and then when

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.660 
that's called a down bow and then when
you're<00:04:29.140> returning<00:04:29.470> from<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.920> top<00:04:30.130> sticker<00:04:30.460> to

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
you're returning from the top sticker to

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.920 
you're returning from the top sticker to
the<00:04:30.700> bottom<00:04:31.090> one<00:04:31.270> that's<00:04:31.480> an<00:04:31.600> up<00:04:31.780> bow<00:04:31.990> and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
the bottom one that's an up bow and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.180 
the bottom one that's an up bow and
hopefully<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.140> gets<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.500> started<00:04:35.530> on

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
hopefully that gets you started on

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.930 
hopefully that gets you started on
making<00:04:36.460> your<00:04:36.760> first<00:04:36.970> sound<00:04:37.860> if<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:39.670> still

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
making your first sound if you still

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.220 
making your first sound if you still
have<00:04:40.060> questions<00:04:40.090> which<00:04:40.630> you<00:04:40.720> probably<00:04:40.930> will

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
have questions which you probably will

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.960 
have questions which you probably will
because<00:04:41.440> there<00:04:41.680> are<00:04:41.770> some<00:04:41.950> other<00:04:42.100> factors

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
because there are some other factors

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.330 
because there are some other factors
