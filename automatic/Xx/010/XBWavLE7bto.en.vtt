vicinity to 200 side is for and then for
on<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> other<00:00:21.810> side<00:00:22.020> mixtape

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.470 

now<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.170> other<00:00:38.320> side<00:00:38.970> on<00:00:39.970> this<00:00:40.120> side<00:00:40.330> you're

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
now the other side on this side you're

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.200 
now the other side on this side you're
going<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.660> need<00:00:40.810> one<00:00:41.410> inch<00:00:41.980> screws<00:00:42.310> and<00:00:42.910> Ceaser

going to need one inch screws and Ceaser

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:56.650 
going to need one inch screws and Ceaser
counterbored

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.560 

okay<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:57.560> on<00:00:58.310> this<00:00:58.460> side<00:00:58.670> will<00:00:59.000> need<00:00:59.180> it's

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
okay so on this side will need it's

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.790 
okay so on this side will need it's
going<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.780> be<00:00:59.900> oriented<00:01:00.290> in<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:00.620> direction

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
going to be oriented in this direction

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.180 
going to be oriented in this direction
provides<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.600> correct<00:01:02.930> distance<00:01:03.470> or<00:01:04.129> the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
provides the the correct distance or the

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.350 
provides the the correct distance or the
correct<00:01:05.290> parallel<00:01:06.290> rod<00:01:06.500> condition<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:08.180> use

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
correct parallel rod condition so we use

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:21.630 
correct parallel rod condition so we use
to<00:01:08.600> one<00:01:08.810> inch<00:01:08.960> screws<00:01:09.260> again<00:01:10.190> on<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:10.729> side

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.149 

okay<00:01:22.240> okay<00:01:22.960> now<00:01:23.500> we're<00:01:23.620> going<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.770> use<00:01:23.920> wire

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
okay okay now we're going to use wire

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.969 
okay okay now we're going to use wire
ties<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.700> keep<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:26.229> going<00:01:26.440> left<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:26.920> right

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
ties to keep it from going left to right

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.310 
ties to keep it from going left to right
this<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.460> an<00:01:27.729> alternative<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.540> using<00:01:28.810> cotter

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
this is an alternative to using cotter

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.440 
this is an alternative to using cotter
pins<00:01:29.590> but<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.430> like<00:01:30.610> wire<00:01:30.790> types<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.150> use<00:01:31.330> hard

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
pins but I like wire types I use hard

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.760 
pins but I like wire types I use hard
drives<00:01:31.720> all<00:01:31.840> over<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.020> place<00:01:32.200> I'm<00:01:32.530> just<00:01:32.590> going

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
drives all over the place I'm just going

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.130 
drives all over the place I'm just going
to<00:01:32.800> put<00:01:32.860> one<00:01:33.130> in<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.369> front<00:01:33.580> one<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.110> back

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
to put one in the front one in the back

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.430 
to put one in the front one in the back
and<00:01:35.590> I'm<00:01:36.490> keeping<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.390> site<00:01:37.750> free<00:01:38.140> of<00:01:38.259> wire

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
and I'm keeping that site free of wire

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.719 
and I'm keeping that site free of wire
ties<00:01:38.740> because<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.070> could<00:01:39.280> have<00:01:39.369> just<00:01:39.520> put<00:01:39.610> them

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
ties because I could have just put them

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.219 
ties because I could have just put them
on<00:01:39.880> bus<00:01:40.030> on<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.300> inside<00:01:40.690> of<00:01:40.720> both<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
on bus on the inside of both on the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.620 
on bus on the inside of both on the
outside<00:01:41.560> because<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.220> want<00:01:42.460> place<00:01:42.850> for<00:01:43.150> you<00:01:43.390> two

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
outside because I want place for you two

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.960 
outside because I want place for you two
to<00:01:44.020> be<00:01:44.979> able<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.490> add<00:01:45.909> a<00:01:45.940> real<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.790> 1

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
to be able to add a real to it so it's 1

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.870 
to be able to add a real to it so it's 1
over<00:01:49.000> here<00:01:49.479> make<00:01:49.990> sure<00:01:50.020> it's<00:01:50.430> pretty<00:01:51.430> close<00:01:51.700> to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
over here make sure it's pretty close to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.420 
over here make sure it's pretty close to
the<00:01:52.000> edge<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.810> have<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.890> deal<00:01:54.039> with<00:01:54.190> anything

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
the edge so I have to deal with anything

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.770 
the edge so I have to deal with anything
sticking<00:01:55.000> out<00:01:55.180> too<00:01:55.330> much<00:01:56.910> all<00:01:57.910> right<00:01:58.060> little

similar<00:02:15.360> let<00:02:16.360> me<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:16.570> explain<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:18.070> can

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
similar let me just explain this you can

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.280 
similar let me just explain this you can
essentially<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.180> take<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.900> reels<00:02:20.080> off

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
essentially just take all the reels off

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.620 
essentially just take all the reels off
printer<00:02:20.830> back<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.330> they're<00:02:22.330> not<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.570> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
printer back on they're not going to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.880 
printer back on they're not going to
slide<00:02:22.930> back<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.260> forth<00:02:26.640> okay<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.890> you're

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
slide back and forth okay because you're

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.199 
slide back and forth okay because you're
not<00:02:30.010> going<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> be<00:02:30.340> you're<00:02:30.670> going<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:31.030> to

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
not going to be you're going to have to

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.220 
not going to be you're going to have to
essentially<00:02:31.780> take<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.560> out<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.610> way

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
essentially take this out in this way

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.449 
essentially take this out in this way
okay<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.290> for<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:35.709> one<00:02:35.890> we're<00:02:36.130> just<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.370> to

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
okay so for this one we're just going to

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.150 
okay so for this one we're just going to
put<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.570> side<00:02:37.600> essentially<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.829> long

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
put it on one side essentially it's long

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160 
put it on one side essentially it's long
enough<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.730> do<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> little<00:02:40.690> bit<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.930> sliding

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.960 
enough to do a little bit of sliding
before<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.799> actually<00:02:42.010> gets<00:02:42.250> up<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.790> it's

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
before it actually gets up and it's

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.390 
before it actually gets up and it's
actually<00:02:43.480> quite<00:02:43.660> tight<00:02:44.110> as<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:45.010> push

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
actually quite tight as it is you push

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.100 
actually quite tight as it is you push
it<00:02:45.549> down<00:02:45.700> all<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:45.940> way<00:02:46.030> that's<00:02:46.570> not<00:02:46.840> actually

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
it down all the way that's not actually

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.069 
it down all the way that's not actually
moving<00:02:47.470> at<00:02:47.829> all<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.459> put<00:02:49.209> one<00:02:49.390> more<00:02:49.570> attack<00:02:49.900> on

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
moving at all so put one more attack on

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.310 
moving at all so put one more attack on
the<00:02:50.230> outside<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.799> that's<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.200> it

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
the outside and that's it so it

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.410 
the outside and that's it so it
restricts<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.799> from<00:02:53.950> at<00:02:54.070> least<00:02:54.190> one<00:02:54.340> direction

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.320 

now<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.480> can<00:02:59.010> need<00:03:00.010> reals<00:03:00.340> put<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.150> can

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
now you can need reals put in you can

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.809 
now you can need reals put in you can
slide<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:01.990> out<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.650> way<00:03:02.830> put<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> reels<00:03:03.610> on

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
slide it out this way put the reels on

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.949 
slide it out this way put the reels on
take<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.510> law<00:03:04.690> for<00:03:04.959> dinner<00:03:05.670> then<00:03:06.720> begins<00:03:07.720> if

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
take the law for dinner then begins if

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.160 
take the law for dinner then begins if
press<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.440> down<00:03:08.470> as<00:03:08.740> much<00:03:08.830> as<00:03:08.890> possible
