some of you guys may know that in a new
snapshot<00:00:16.330> Mojang<00:00:17.259> added<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.710> ability<00:00:18.070> for

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
snapshot Mojang added the ability for

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.659 
snapshot Mojang added the ability for
slime<00:00:18.939> blocks<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.570> be<00:00:19.750> sticky<00:00:20.410> oh<00:00:20.710> right<00:00:21.310> it's

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
slime blocks to be sticky oh right it's

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:26.609 
slime blocks to be sticky oh right it's
stuck<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.090> floor<00:00:24.810> let<00:00:25.810> me<00:00:25.960> try<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.439> come

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
stuck to the floor let me try and come

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.829 
stuck to the floor let me try and come
up<00:00:26.650> with<00:00:26.800> an<00:00:26.919> example<00:00:27.250> real<00:00:28.150> fast<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:31.269> all

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
up with an example real fast there all

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.590 
up with an example real fast there all
the<00:00:32.169> slime<00:00:32.379> blocks<00:00:32.619> got<00:00:32.890> pushed<00:00:33.100> at<00:00:33.250> once

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the slime blocks got pushed at once

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.640 
the slime blocks got pushed at once
there<00:00:34.600> isn't<00:00:34.839> why<00:00:34.989> I<00:00:35.019> have<00:00:35.199> to<00:00:35.350> come<00:00:35.500> up<00:00:35.559> with

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
there isn't why I have to come up with

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.970 
there isn't why I have to come up with
an<00:00:35.800> example<00:00:36.070> fast<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:38.350> this<00:00:38.559> thing<00:00:38.829> is

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
an example fast because this thing is

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.520 
an example fast because this thing is
barreling<00:00:39.460> down<00:00:39.519> on<00:00:39.699> me<00:00:43.140> yeah

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
barreling down on me yeah

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.750 
barreling down on me yeah
the<00:00:45.309> Mojang<00:00:46.059> just<00:00:46.270> added<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.629> ability<00:00:46.719> for

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the Mojang just added the ability for

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.729 
the Mojang just added the ability for
slum<00:00:48.760> blocks<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.180> be<00:00:49.270> sticky<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:49.809> this<00:00:50.500> now

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
slum blocks to be sticky and this now

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.319 
slum blocks to be sticky and this now
allows<00:00:50.949> for<00:00:51.399> something<00:00:51.789> that<00:00:51.940> people<00:00:52.059> have

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
allows for something that people have

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
allows for something that people have
been<00:00:52.510> trying<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.960> do<00:00:53.260> for<00:00:54.420> years<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.870> mean

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
been trying to do for years I mean

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.349 
been trying to do for years I mean
people<00:00:58.300> have<00:00:58.390> been<00:00:58.539> trying<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.930> make<00:00:59.170> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
people have been trying to make a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.729 
people have been trying to make a
Minecraft<00:01:01.359> machine<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:02.019> moves<00:01:02.260> itself

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
Minecraft machine that moves itself

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.600 
Minecraft machine that moves itself
since<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.960> Pistons<00:01:05.500> were<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.770> thing<00:01:06.070> pretty

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
since like Pistons were a thing pretty

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.779 
since like Pistons were a thing pretty
much<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:08.170> now<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.410> can<00:01:08.890> actually<00:01:09.070> do<00:01:09.490> it<00:01:09.640> with

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
much but now you can actually do it with

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.980 
much but now you can actually do it with
the<00:01:10.210> new<00:01:10.979> sticky<00:01:11.979> slime<00:01:12.250> blocks<00:01:12.869> which<00:01:13.869> are

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
the new sticky slime blocks which are

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.630 
the new sticky slime blocks which are
thanks<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.560> zip<00:01:14.770> Kratt<00:01:15.009> by<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.280> way<00:01:15.460> they

thanks to the zip Kratt by the way they

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.760 
thanks to the zip Kratt by the way they
actually<00:01:15.850> made<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.690> code<00:01:16.899> fort<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:17.530> moat

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
actually made the code fort and moat

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.540 
actually made the code fort and moat
hang<00:01:18.009> decide<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.789> put<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.470> kudos<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
hang decide to put it in so kudos to the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.350 
hang decide to put it in so kudos to the
zip<00:01:21.700> crowd<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:22.360> setting<00:01:23.050> this<00:01:23.170> up<00:01:23.319> and<00:01:24.360> this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
zip crowd for setting this up and this

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.350 
zip crowd for setting this up and this
is<00:01:25.569> one<00:01:26.319> of<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.560> many<00:01:27.489> cool<00:01:27.759> things<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.239> you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
is one of the many cool things that you

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.690 
is one of the many cool things that you
can<00:01:28.450> do<00:01:28.690> with<00:01:28.810> it

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
can do with it

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.899 
can do with it
this<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.509> obviously<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.290> pretty<00:01:33.280> simple

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
this is obviously a pretty simple

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.030 
this is obviously a pretty simple
version<00:01:34.330> actually<00:01:34.600> tried<00:01:35.259> doing<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.860> with<00:01:36.009> two

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
version actually tried doing it with two

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.679 
version actually tried doing it with two
Pistons<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:36.640> first<00:01:36.909> didn't<00:01:37.330> work

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
Pistons the first didn't work

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.350 
Pistons the first didn't work
so<00:01:37.900> apparently<00:01:38.580> because<00:01:39.580> of<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.820> timings<00:01:40.210> I'm

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
so apparently because of the timings I'm

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.039 
so apparently because of the timings I'm
sure<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:41.560> have<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.890> go<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.490> three<00:01:42.759> Pistons<00:01:43.299> to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
sure you have to go to three Pistons to

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.039 
sure you have to go to three Pistons to
get<00:01:44.229> your<00:01:44.890> motor<00:01:45.729> going<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.479> can<00:01:46.600> probably<00:01:46.810> go

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
get your motor going you can probably go

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.969 
get your motor going you can probably go
more<00:01:47.080> if<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.500> want<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.049> a<00:01:50.229> pretty

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
more if you want to this is a pretty

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.029 
more if you want to this is a pretty
cool<00:01:51.369> system<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:52.390> bet<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.380> would<00:01:53.619> be<00:01:53.799> possible

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
cool system I bet it would be possible

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.719 
cool system I bet it would be possible
although<00:01:55.020> maybe<00:01:56.020> not<00:01:56.170> very<00:01:56.590> practical<00:01:57.189> to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
although maybe not very practical to

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.210 
although maybe not very practical to
make<00:01:57.850> like<00:01:58.180> an<00:01:58.330> entire<00:01:58.659> house<00:01:58.930> move<00:01:59.409> although

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
make like an entire house move although

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.749 
make like an entire house move although
there's<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.720> limits<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.369> how<00:02:03.369> many<00:02:03.550> blocks

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
there's the limits to how many blocks

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.550 
there's the limits to how many blocks
can<00:02:04.090> be<00:02:04.119> pushed<00:02:04.479> by<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.720> single<00:02:05.050> piston<00:02:05.440> are

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
can be pushed by a single piston are

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.330 
can be pushed by a single piston are
pretty<00:02:05.770> stringent<00:02:06.600> we'll<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:08.310> how<00:02:11.190> we'll<00:02:12.190> see

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
pretty stringent we'll see how we'll see

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
pretty stringent we'll see how we'll see
what<00:02:12.489> people<00:02:12.700> can<00:02:12.850> do<00:02:12.970> with<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.209> I'm<00:02:13.330> sure

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
what people can do with it I'm sure

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.670 
what people can do with it I'm sure
there's<00:02:13.720> lots<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.019> cool<00:02:14.170> things<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.590> can

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
there's lots of cool things that you can

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.309 
there's lots of cool things that you can
do<00:02:15.120> one<00:02:16.120> thing<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.480> thought<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.080> would<00:02:17.290> be

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
do one thing I thought of that would be

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.550 
do one thing I thought of that would be
pretty<00:02:17.890> cool<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.760> don't<00:02:18.819> know<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
pretty cool and I don't know if this is

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.250 
pretty cool and I don't know if this is
yet<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> thing<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:22.209> now<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.959> push

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
yet a thing but now that you can push

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.770 
yet a thing but now that you can push
connected<00:02:24.160> areas<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.910> blocks<00:02:25.150> it'd<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.540> cool

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
connected areas of blocks it'd be cool

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.770 
connected areas of blocks it'd be cool
if<00:02:26.080> having<00:02:26.650> two<00:02:27.220> Pistons<00:02:27.760> push<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.330> connected

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
if having two Pistons push a connected

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.740 
if having two Pistons push a connected
area<00:02:28.989> block<00:02:29.319> like<00:02:29.739> it<00:02:29.920> push<00:02:30.540> connected<00:02:31.540> area

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
area block like it push connected area

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.870 
area block like it push connected area
blocks<00:02:32.220> allowed<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.430> push<00:02:33.700> place<00:02:33.970> as<00:02:34.150> many

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
blocks allowed you to push place as many

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.430 
blocks allowed you to push place as many
so<00:02:36.510> say<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.020> had<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:38.870> don't<00:02:39.870> remember<00:02:40.170> exactly

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
so say you had I don't remember exactly

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.930 
so say you had I don't remember exactly
what<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.130> number<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.460> blocks<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.360> but

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
what the number of blocks is but but

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.320 
what the number of blocks is but but
stopped<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.470> sorry

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.060 

good<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> know<00:02:49.960> that<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.260> can't<00:02:50.470> stop<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.890> like

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
good to know that you can't stop it like

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.670 
good to know that you can't stop it like
that<00:02:51.220> though<00:02:51.870> like

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.830 

so<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.740> get<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.280> stop<00:02:59.520> just<00:03:00.300> connect<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.750> to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
so you get to stop just connect it to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.060 
so you get to stop just connect it to
the<00:03:00.930> ground<00:03:02.150> anchor<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.270> down<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:04.830> can<00:03:04.950> also

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
the ground anchor it down you can also

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.290 
the ground anchor it down you can also
get<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.490> the<00:03:05.610> stuff<00:03:05.880> by<00:03:06.530> push<00:03:07.530> putting<00:03:08.270> like<00:03:09.270> a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
get it the stuff by push putting like a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.850 
get it the stuff by push putting like a
block<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> obsidian<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.380> front<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.770> it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
block of obsidian in front of it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.060 
block of obsidian in front of it
anywhere<00:03:11.540> because<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.900> can't<00:03:13.200> push<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
anywhere because it can't push the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.210 
anywhere because it can't push the
obsidian<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.590> don't<00:03:16.770> block<00:03:17.010> update

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
obsidian and if you don't block update

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.910 
obsidian and if you don't block update
it<00:03:17.520> then<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.540> stops<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.590> good<00:03:19.800> to

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
it then it just stops that is good to

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.890 
it then it just stops that is good to
know<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.340> probably<00:03:21.030> should<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.360> used<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.780> at

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
know I probably should have used that at

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.850 
know I probably should have used that at
the<00:03:21.960> beginning<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.410> video<00:03:23.210> but<00:03:24.800> this<00:03:25.800> is

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
the beginning of this video but this is

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.060 
the beginning of this video but this is
sort<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.060> feature<00:03:27.900> request<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.620> guess

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
sort of a feature request I guess

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.000 
sort of a feature request I guess
so<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.450> number<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.750> blocks<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.590> piston

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
so the number of blocks that a piston

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.950 
so the number of blocks that a piston
can<00:03:32.220> push<00:03:32.520> i<00:03:32.880> believe<00:03:33.300> it's<00:03:33.480> somewhere<00:03:33.750> around

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
can push i believe it's somewhere around

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
can push i believe it's somewhere around
15<00:03:36.110> or<00:03:37.110> something<00:03:39.710> this<00:03:40.710> is

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.130 

I'm<00:03:43.400> not<00:03:43.580> even<00:03:43.760> sure<00:03:43.970> how<00:03:44.150> many<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.629> is<00:03:44.810> I

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
I'm not even sure how many that is I

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.660 
I'm not even sure how many that is I
think<00:03:45.200> that's<00:03:45.470> 15<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.099> put<00:03:46.310> down<00:03:46.489> right

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
think that's 15 that I put down right

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.920 
think that's 15 that I put down right
there<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.140> can't<00:03:48.530> push<00:03:49.060> with<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.209> team

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.820 

okay<00:03:53.930> what<00:03:54.140> was<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.319> then

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
okay what was it then

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.240 
okay what was it then
that<00:03:56.490> that's<00:03:56.850> 12<00:03:57.450> okay<00:03:58.050> so<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.470> piston<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.040> push

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
that that's 12 okay so a piston can push

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.370 
that that's 12 okay so a piston can push
12<00:03:59.550> blocks<00:04:00.200> what<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:02.040> could<00:04:02.250> push<00:04:03.380> more

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
12 blocks what if you could push more

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.920 
12 blocks what if you could push more
than<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.770> if<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.520> power<00:04:05.910> two<00:04:06.330> Pistons<00:04:06.750> at

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
than that if you power two Pistons at

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.830 
than that if you power two Pistons at
once<00:04:07.640> so<00:04:08.640> say<00:04:11.240> this<00:04:12.240> is<00:04:12.300> going<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.750> be

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
once so say this is going to be

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.710 
once so say this is going to be
difficult<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.230> place<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.680> Pistons<00:04:14.270> say<00:04:15.270> I<00:04:15.330> had

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
difficult to place the Pistons say I had

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.229 
difficult to place the Pistons say I had
these<00:04:15.900> two<00:04:15.960> Pistons<00:04:16.530> right<00:04:16.769> here<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.280> power

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
these two Pistons right here I power

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.840 
these two Pistons right here I power
them<00:04:18.480> both<00:04:18.950> they<00:04:19.950> would<00:04:20.100> be<00:04:20.250> able<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.489> push

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
them both they would be able to push

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.390 
them both they would be able to push
this<00:04:21.239> whole<00:04:21.540> block<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:22.380> blocks<00:04:22.920> even<00:04:23.190> though

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
this whole block of blocks even though

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.130 
this whole block of blocks even though
it's<00:04:23.520> more<00:04:23.700> than<00:04:23.850> 12<00:04:24.090> because<00:04:24.600> there<00:04:24.840> are<00:04:24.960> two

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
it's more than 12 because there are two

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.760 
it's more than 12 because there are two
Pistons<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:26.060> would<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.270> something<00:04:28.230> that

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
Pistons that would be something that

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.130 
Pistons that would be something that
would<00:04:29.250> be<00:04:29.490> really<00:04:29.850> cool<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.090> see<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.660> that

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
would be really cool to see and that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.590 
would be really cool to see and that
would<00:04:31.320> certainly<00:04:31.560> allow<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.370> make<00:04:32.600> like

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
would certainly allow you to make like

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.560 
would certainly allow you to make like
large<00:04:34.560> structures<00:04:35.280> movable<00:04:35.970> using<00:04:36.450> these

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
large structures movable using these

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.520 
large structures movable using these
slam<00:04:36.930> blocks<00:04:37.230> because<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:39.360> could<00:04:39.570> push<00:04:40.200> a

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
slam blocks because you could push a

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.490 
slam blocks because you could push a
large<00:04:41.190> structure<00:04:41.550> all<00:04:41.820> at<00:04:41.970> once<00:04:42.180> if<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.200> had

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
large structure all at once if you had

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.340 
large structure all at once if you had
enough<00:04:44.010> distance<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.990> that<00:04:46.140> would<00:04:46.230> be

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
enough distance so that would be

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.370 
enough distance so that would be
something<00:04:46.590> really<00:04:46.950> cool<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.280> see<00:04:47.870> his<00:04:48.870> if<00:04:49.110> card

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
something really cool to see his if card

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.580 
something really cool to see his if card
get<00:04:49.560> on<00:04:49.680> inside<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.250> demo<00:04:50.580> J<00:04:50.960> but<00:04:51.960> yeah<00:04:52.140> that

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
get on inside a demo J but yeah that

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.460 
get on inside a demo J but yeah that
would<00:04:52.740> be<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:53.430> very<00:04:54.030> cool<00:04:54.360> addition<00:04:54.660> I'd<00:04:55.200> love

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
would be a very cool addition I'd love

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.180 
would be a very cool addition I'd love
to<00:04:55.620> see<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:57.350> it<00:04:58.350> sort<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:58.740> makes<00:04:58.920> sense

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
to see that and it sort of makes sense

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.520 
to see that and it sort of makes sense
considering<00:04:59.790> that<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:00.930> now<00:05:01.140> connect

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
considering that you can now connect

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.370 
considering that you can now connect
blocks<00:05:01.830> together<00:05:02.070> like<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.790> that<00:05:03.720> you'd<00:05:04.140> be

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
blocks together like this that you'd be

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.670 
blocks together like this that you'd be
able<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.800> hook<00:05:04.919> two<00:05:05.250> Pistons<00:05:05.700> up<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.090> one<00:05:06.680> thing

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
able to hook two Pistons up to one thing

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.409 
able to hook two Pistons up to one thing
to<00:05:07.860> be<00:05:07.980> pushed<00:05:08.250> so<00:05:10.580> yeah<00:05:11.580> I'd<00:05:11.880> love<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.240> see

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
to be pushed so yeah I'd love to see

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.260 
to be pushed so yeah I'd love to see
that<00:05:12.570> although<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:14.700> I'm<00:05:14.880> thinking<00:05:15.210> about

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
that although and I'm thinking about

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.960 
that although and I'm thinking about
that<00:05:15.540> might<00:05:15.690> also<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:16.380> think<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:17.760> would

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
that might also I think that this would

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.280 
that might also I think that this would
be<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> good<00:05:18.300> thing<00:05:18.540> but<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:18.990> don't<00:05:19.140> know<00:05:19.230> if

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
be a good thing but I don't know if

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.900 
be a good thing but I don't know if
Mojang<00:05:19.650> would<00:05:19.830> consider<00:05:20.190> just<00:05:20.460> be<00:05:20.669> over

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
Mojang would consider just be over

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.400 
Mojang would consider just be over
powered<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.419> would<00:05:21.510> also<00:05:21.600> mean<00:05:21.990> that<00:05:22.020> if<00:05:22.440> you

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
powered that would also mean that if you

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.800 
powered that would also mean that if you
set<00:05:25.410> up<00:05:25.610> something<00:05:26.610> longer<00:05:27.090> than<00:05:27.360> twelve

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
set up something longer than twelve

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.470 
set up something longer than twelve
blocks<00:05:28.169> but<00:05:29.130> you<00:05:29.190> add<00:05:29.430> two<00:05:29.669> Pitons<00:05:30.090> hooked<00:05:30.330> up

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
blocks but you add two Pitons hooked up

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.300 
blocks but you add two Pitons hooked up
to<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.690> through<00:05:31.080> sign<00:05:31.380> blocks<00:05:31.680> then<00:05:32.040> you'd<00:05:32.190> be

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
to it through sign blocks then you'd be

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.950 
to it through sign blocks then you'd be
able<00:05:32.400> to<00:05:32.520> push<00:05:32.730> that

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
able to push that

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.040 
able to push that
so<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:34.860> would<00:05:34.979> extended<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:35.850> piston<00:05:36.300> length

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
so that would extended the piston length

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.409 
so that would extended the piston length
limit<00:05:37.740> as<00:05:37.949> well<00:05:38.280> by<00:05:38.759> allowing<00:05:39.030> you<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.300> use

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
limit as well by allowing you to use

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.830 
limit as well by allowing you to use
multiple<00:05:40.289> businesses<00:05:40.710> to<00:05:40.979> push<00:05:41.220> one<00:05:41.840> one

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
multiple businesses to push one one

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.730 
multiple businesses to push one one
object<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:43.910> think<00:05:44.910> that'd<00:05:45.330> be<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.960> cool<00:05:47.389> addition

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
object I think that'd be a cool addition

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.590 
object I think that'd be a cool addition
but<00:05:50.180> we'll<00:05:51.180> see<00:05:51.419> if<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:52.740> powers<00:05:53.070> that<00:05:53.100> be

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
but we'll see if the powers that be

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.070 
but we'll see if the powers that be
consider<00:05:54.600> that<00:05:54.840> to<00:05:55.380> be<00:05:56.780> something<00:05:57.780> that<00:05:57.810> they

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
consider that to be something that they

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.320 
consider that to be something that they
could<00:05:58.259> do<00:05:58.380> or<00:05:59.100> if<00:05:59.190> they<00:05:59.340> even<00:05:59.370> see<00:06:00.030> this<00:06:00.180> video

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
could do or if they even see this video

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.290 
could do or if they even see this video
probably<00:06:00.690> wouldn't<00:06:01.139> but<00:06:01.440> I<00:06:01.850> believe<00:06:02.850> someone

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
probably wouldn't but I believe someone

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.140 
probably wouldn't but I believe someone
will<00:06:03.539> suggest<00:06:04.530> this<00:06:04.919> to<00:06:04.979> people<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:06.000> they'll

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
will suggest this to people and they'll

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.379 
will suggest this to people and they'll
see<00:06:08.060> maybe<00:06:09.060> I'll<00:06:09.240> post<00:06:09.449> it<00:06:09.570> on<00:06:09.690> reddit<00:06:09.900> anyways

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
see maybe I'll post it on reddit anyways

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:18.170 
see maybe I'll post it on reddit anyways
the<00:06:12.389> point<00:06:12.660> is<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:14.000> piston<00:06:15.000> worm<00:06:17.180> infinitely

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
the point is the piston worm infinitely

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.730 
the point is the piston worm infinitely
pushing<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:18.750> piston<00:06:18.900> worms<00:06:19.380> are<00:06:19.620> now

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
pushing the piston worms are now

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.420 
pushing the piston worms are now
possible

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
possible

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.610 
possible
well<00:06:20.580> not<00:06:21.000> worms<00:06:21.389> so<00:06:21.870> much<00:06:22.050> as<00:06:22.199> complicated

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
well not worms so much as complicated

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.800 
well not worms so much as complicated
engines<00:06:23.190> but<00:06:23.580> you<00:06:23.759> can<00:06:23.940> now<00:06:24.120> make<00:06:24.330> Pistons

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
engines but you can now make Pistons

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.480 
engines but you can now make Pistons
that<00:06:26.030> move<00:06:27.030> forever<00:06:27.720> and<00:06:28.130> it's<00:06:29.130> awesome

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
that move forever and it's awesome

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.790 
that move forever and it's awesome
so<00:06:30.850> thanks<00:06:31.150> for<00:06:31.180> watching<00:06:31.300> guys<00:06:31.720> and<00:06:31.990> I<00:06:32.740> will

see you guys next video which will

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.420 
see you guys next video which will
probably<00:06:34.840> be<00:06:35.020> feed<00:06:35.350> the<00:06:35.470> beast<00:06:35.650> related<00:06:36.100> I'm

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
probably be feed the beast related I'm

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.190 
probably be feed the beast related I'm
not<00:06:36.580> sure<00:06:36.790> if<00:06:36.910> it<00:06:37.000> will<00:06:37.120> be<00:06:37.150> that<00:06:37.540> whether<00:06:37.840> farm

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
not sure if it will be that whether farm

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.590 
not sure if it will be that whether farm
I<00:06:39.180> gave<00:06:40.180> you<00:06:40.300> guys<00:06:40.420> a<00:06:40.480> preview<00:06:40.900> of<00:06:41.190> because

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
I gave you guys a preview of because

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.870 
I gave you guys a preview of because
well<00:06:43.600> I<00:06:43.920> think<00:06:44.920> I<00:06:45.100> can<00:06:45.280> put<00:06:45.460> out<00:06:45.550> a<00:06:45.580> bit<00:06:45.790> you

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
well I think I can put out a bit you

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.030 
well I think I can put out a bit you
know<00:06:45.910> on<00:06:46.060> that<00:06:46.090> I<00:06:46.570> actually<00:06:47.230> stopped<00:06:47.740> playing

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
know on that I actually stopped playing

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.690 
know on that I actually stopped playing
on<00:06:48.280> the<00:06:48.400> server<00:06:48.640> that<00:06:48.730> that<00:06:49.030> is<00:06:49.180> on<00:06:49.450> because<00:06:50.700> me

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
on the server that that is on because me

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.580 
on the server that that is on because me
and<00:06:51.910> some<00:06:52.180> of<00:06:52.240> the<00:06:52.330> other<00:06:52.480> freak<00:06:52.840> craft<00:06:53.200> peeps

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
and some of the other freak craft peeps

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.610 
and some of the other freak craft peeps
set<00:06:54.340> up<00:06:54.460> our<00:06:54.760> own<00:06:55.350> b2b<00:06:56.350> server<00:06:56.650> so<00:06:57.430> we<00:06:58.620> actually

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
set up our own b2b server so we actually

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.440 
set up our own b2b server so we actually
have<00:06:59.830> the<00:07:00.010> free<00:07:00.190> crafty<00:07:00.670> the<00:07:00.790> beast<00:07:00.970> now<00:07:01.180> I'll

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
have the free crafty the beast now I'll

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.620 
have the free crafty the beast now I'll
probably<00:07:01.720> make<00:07:01.960> videos<00:07:02.290> on<00:07:02.470> that<00:07:02.560> as<00:07:02.740> well

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
probably make videos on that as well

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.440 
probably make videos on that as well
and<00:07:04.710> I'll<00:07:05.710> probably<00:07:06.100> make<00:07:06.760> some<00:07:07.000> more<00:07:07.090> videos

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
and I'll probably make some more videos

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.870 
and I'll probably make some more videos
about<00:07:07.780> these<00:07:08.110> fancy<00:07:08.860> new<00:07:09.190> slime<00:07:09.520> blocks

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
about these fancy new slime blocks

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.160 
about these fancy new slime blocks
because<00:07:10.180> these<00:07:10.510> are<00:07:10.870> cool<00:07:12.540> but<00:07:13.540> anyways<00:07:13.930> guys

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.170 
because these are cool but anyways guys

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.950 
because these are cool but anyways guys
thanks<00:07:15.070> for<00:07:15.130> watching<00:07:15.420> I'm<00:07:16.420> pretty<00:07:16.660> shorter
