00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.470
 that people are wrong not against me 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.939
 I hope you're fine, so I'll tell you 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.080
 found for the first tots trueview 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.060
 of this fifa 14 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.490
 the ad is finally available in 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.050
 kick packs we start strong with the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.540
 Colombian scorer of FC Porto 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.160
 jackson martinez in sim of the 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.450
 season you have these statistics that 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.739
 are scrolling I invite you 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.420
 so put on pause or put in a 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.239
 a little observed at the team level 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.670
 it's the team destroying the team that 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.140
 I have presented quite a few times that this 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.550
 meaning present to his team or even I 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.589
 does a squat builder around this 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.769
 team I just take off the martinez 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.409
 regular for m the martinez sim version 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.780
 of the season at level 2 the fork 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.070
 price of the jackson it remains high it's 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.239
 of toc that even though it's true that I 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.949
 still expected to see prices 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.690
 maybe a little bit more expensive the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.870
 jackson martinez are taken on xbox 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.600
 between 240 miles and 360 miles on 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.000
 playstation between 370 and 500,000 credit 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.490
 price differentials again even though 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.440
 on xbox from now on you 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.670
 can already get him to 241 1000 in 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.170
 immediate purchase there really is 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.670
 enormously it's true that the state is I 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.409
 was expecting a galley for the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.060
 find on the market but it's 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.170
 really not the case except some 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.600
 players overall they are 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.189
 really very easy to find on the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.360
 transfer market so the jackson 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.520
 martinez stages are back in the vivid 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.229
 of the subject the positives there is 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.640
 no negative point already so we 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.250
 starts very well no negative point 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.619
 for the first result so is the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.479
 first positive point is at the level of 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.450
 the hitting I encompass everything that is 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.909
 strike because ben it's good 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.409
 everywhere pretty good everywhere 92 in finish 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.329
 in front of the cages he is really very 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.090
 very good it's a killer the hits in 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.909
 force really does havoc then 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.890
 1.91 in hitting power there 1.70 in 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.780
 cat to note that despite the 79 of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.219
 far strikes by very very well I 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.539
 did not score the big prize but 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.409
 the whole thing goes pretty well knowing 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.780
 that he does not even have the characteristic 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.300
 shooters from afar it's true that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.560
 you can expect the balloon 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.920
 was leaving badly but not his door is 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.670
 really very very well after we have the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.050
 striking power 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.490
 the flight soaring 89 years volleying 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.420
 go see a moment for those who 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.350
 follow on social networks you 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.930
 have seen it from elsewhere 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.610
 now i think that would have been the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.450
 goal of the year this is the goal of 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.660
 the year if it comes back 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.070
 Sombrero control control 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.230
 behind you go on with a big 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.490
 recovery of I do not know how many meters 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.920
 on the crossbar 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.740
 volleying is crazy 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.420
 after speed 86 in speed on the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.850
 card one really feels in game that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.500
 the jackson martinez has speed the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.660
 regular already it's going to regular know 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.280
 but here the toss you can type all 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.650
 right without problem in for the followers 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.840
 all right straight with the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.690
 jackson martinez stocks are possible 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.100
 physically bages and where I was I 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.050
 put everything in the physical box 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.690
 that is, force 90 in strength at 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.400
 the shoulder he destroys you defenders 75 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.740
 in balance he holds very very much of course 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.360
 these people 90 in strength 75 in balance 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.640
 it's just low a combination to say 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.380
 perfect 89 years knowing that it makes a 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.470
 meter 85 in the aerial game it is 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.440
 monstrous 84 in agility 1.86 without 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.730
 brief reaction it's terminator actually 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.330
 it's a terminator a player who goes 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.360
 super fast 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.280
 ultra physics in the head game sound 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.410
 play maybe 94 in head accuracy 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.570
 so as I specify m to 89 years to 1 m 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 85 AC allows him to take a lot 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.989
 head balloon in the aerial game 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.400
 he made me think so it's clear that 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.739
 the comparison is still a little daring 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.120
 but in the air field on the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.200
 some centers that I did on him 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.630
 and I still thought about 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.920
 cristiano ronaldo at the level of 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.260
 relax the way he takes the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.640
 balloons they show super heroes and ben 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.830
 it's very very interesting to have a 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.030
 scorer able to score scoring 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.350
 goals of the head every time you 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.370
 center almost even though it's true that 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.920
 I did not score and I'm fed up 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.120
 someone because I do not have too much spam 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.890
 and centers but on the few are 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.020
 that I tried each time the ball 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.640
 was really very good 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.110
 pass quality I did not put in 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.850
 the most but here it is able to 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.250
 to make some nice openings I 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.320
 held good to specify to 86 in aggressiveness 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.420
 really still without a ball carrier 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.700
 and so combine with his stats in 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.590
 physical and speed I can tell you 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.209
 that he is shit defenders he 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.640
 is really pissed off very very 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.380
 often 91 years old always positioning 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.820
 very well placed very easy to find 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.430
 in the field it is really good 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.720
 call each time the 4 stars the 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.000
 technical gestures technically it's from 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.370
 madness here technically it's not 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.790
 finally the ronaldo shop and the stop and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.290
 turn 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.000
 they wreak havoc on his home so he has 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.340
 than 82 in dribbling game it's true that 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.080
 it can be a little disappointing for intox 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.940
 but at the execution of the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.410
 voice there it goes really very well 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.700
 in addition here are the four floors is 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.680
 technical blow you can do some 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.560
 four-star gestures that are 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.090
 devastating with the jackson martinez 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.550
 by the way four bad foot star 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.840
 so that's really very interesting 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.000
 for a scorer because you can really 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.740
 hit in all directions with so there 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.240
 you have the record of jackson martinez 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.280
 tons what appears before your eyes 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.900
 so at the level of the positive points the 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.550
 striking finish longhot pane effect the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.800
 Balloon is really very good 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.240
 the speed he goes fast dribbles 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.520
 technically very impressive despite 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.020
 a stack of which 82 is a good stat 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.740
 but you can expect maybe more 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.979
 of this intox 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.490
 the physical here is force balance under 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.050
 tents and agility everything everything is 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.580
 perfect everything is perfect the game you are 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.530
 very dangerous in the air 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.090
 aggression the four bad stars 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.470
 foot he has both feet positioning 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.250
 still from last year very easy to 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.750
 find 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.850
 the four stars technical gesture you 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.500
 can skill with the power of typing 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.270
 the ball is really very strong 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.220
 and so you see the stats with seven 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.780
 matches 13 goals and three assists 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.030
 decisive stats really very 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.200
 complex knowing that I typed the bar 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.229
 transversal at least four or five 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.610
 times during this review 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.290

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.820
