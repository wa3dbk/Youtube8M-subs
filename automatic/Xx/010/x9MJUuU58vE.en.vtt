okay<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.260> video<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.920> gonna<00:00:11.040> show<00:00:11.370> you

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
okay in this video I'm gonna show you

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.600 
okay in this video I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.450> clean<00:00:12.750> off<00:00:12.929> thermal<00:00:13.500> paste<00:00:13.740> from<00:00:14.490> a

how to clean off thermal paste from a

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.849 
how to clean off thermal paste from a
CPU<00:00:15.179> now<00:00:15.870> I've<00:00:15.990> actually<00:00:16.109> done<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
CPU now I've actually done this in a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.950 
CPU now I've actually done this in a
couple<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.369> other<00:00:17.400> videos<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.300> building<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
couple of my other videos on building a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.859 
couple of my other videos on building a
PC<00:00:19.410> or<00:00:19.740> replacing<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.640> motherboard<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.539> fried

PC or replacing a motherboard a fried
motherboard<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> PC<00:00:22.980> but<00:00:23.850> I've<00:00:24.119> never<00:00:24.330> done

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
motherboard in a PC but I've never done

motherboard in a PC but I've never done
a<00:00:24.630> video<00:00:24.920> explicitly<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.640> cleaning<00:00:27.269> off

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
a video explicitly just on cleaning off

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
a video explicitly just on cleaning off
thermal<00:00:27.900> paste<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.890> only<00:00:29.039> reason<00:00:29.310> I'm

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
thermal paste and the only reason I'm

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
thermal paste and the only reason I'm
doing<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.599> couple<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.019> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
doing this is because a couple of you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.530 
doing this is because a couple of you
have<00:00:31.199> asked<00:00:31.679> me<00:00:31.740> how<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> think<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
have asked me how to do it so I think it

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.670 
have asked me how to do it so I think it
would<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.690> great<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> standalone

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
would be great to have a standalone

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
would be great to have a standalone
video<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.520> how<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> do<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.420> it's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
video on how to do this and it's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.170 
video on how to do this and it's
actually<00:00:36.750> pretty<00:00:37.230> simple<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:38.059> let<00:00:39.059> me<00:00:39.090> show

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
actually pretty simple to do let me show

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.670 
actually pretty simple to do let me show

to zoom in here so you can take a little

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.480 
to zoom in here so you can take a little
bit<00:01:17.820> closer<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
bit closer look on this and see how it's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.990 
bit closer look on this and see how it's
done<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:21.030> close<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.600> personal<00:01:22.189> okay<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
done up close and personal okay as you
can<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.170> thermal<00:01:25.560> paste

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
can see there is some thermal paste

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.999 
can see there is some thermal paste
smeared<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> CPU<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
smeared on to the CPU there now the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.499 
smeared on to the CPU there now the
first<00:01:29.280> thing<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> want<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.210> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
first thing I'm going to want to do is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.469 
first thing I'm going to want to do is
clean<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> majority<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.979> off<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.119> I'm

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
clean the majority of that off so I'm

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
clean the majority of that off so I'm
going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.750> grab<00:01:33.930> my<00:01:33.960> paper<00:01:34.380> towel<00:01:34.790> right<00:01:35.790> here

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
going to grab my paper towel right here

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.770 
going to grab my paper towel right here
and<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:38.040> rub<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.390> thermal

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and I'm going to just rub the thermal

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.069 
and I'm going to just rub the thermal
paste<00:01:39.990> off<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.100> CPU<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> try<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
paste off of the CPU here and try and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.609 
paste off of the CPU here and try and
get<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> bulk<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:47.659> as<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
get the bulk of it off as you can see it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.899 
get the bulk of it off as you can see it
starts<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.070> come<00:01:50.250> off<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.610> as<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> name

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
starts to come off and as the name

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.410 
starts to come off and as the name
implies<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:55.380> got<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> paste<00:01:56.040> consistency<00:01:56.420> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
implies it's got a paste consistency to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.080 
implies it's got a paste consistency to
it<00:01:59.299> and<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:01.259> silver

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
it and it's silver

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:12.509 
it and it's silver
there<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.210> go

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.610 

now<00:02:13.519> rub<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.849> majority<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.690> off<00:02:14.840> here<00:02:15.440> on

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
now rub the majority of it off here on

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.280 
now rub the majority of it off here on
the<00:02:15.860> paper<00:02:16.010> towel<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.900> there's<00:02:17.900> still<00:02:18.140> little

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the paper towel and there's still little

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.080 
the paper towel and there's still little
remnants<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.040> there<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.459> want<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.819> get<00:02:19.970> it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
remnants on there I want to get it

and then all I want to do is just rub it
across<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:05.440> CPU<00:03:06.440> here<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:07.519> get<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.970> excess

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
across the CPU here to get the excess

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.020 
across the CPU here to get the excess
thermal<00:03:09.560> paste<00:03:09.769> off<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:12.519> as<00:03:13.519> you<00:03:13.609> can<00:03:13.639> see

components and you want to make sure

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.410 
components and you want to make sure
that<00:03:34.130> when<00:03:34.639> you're<00:03:35.650> rubbing<00:03:36.650> off<00:03:36.829> the<00:03:37.420> thermal

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
that when you're rubbing off the thermal

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.819 
that when you're rubbing off the thermal
paste<00:03:38.569> especially<00:03:39.230> when<00:03:39.380> there's<00:03:39.530> rubbing

alcohol on your q-tip that it's not

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.440 
alcohol on your q-tip that it's not
gushing<00:03:42.590> with<00:03:43.040> alcohol<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.180> don't<00:03:44.359> get

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
gushing with alcohol so you don't get

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.780 
gushing with alcohol so you don't get
any<00:03:44.510> components<00:03:45.290> wet<00:03:45.470> you're<00:03:46.010> just<00:03:46.220> using<00:03:46.549> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
any components wet you're just using the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.319 
any components wet you're just using the
rubbing<00:03:47.090> alcohol<00:03:47.209> basically<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:48.590> get<00:03:48.829> the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
rubbing alcohol basically to get the

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.030 
rubbing alcohol basically to get the
thermal<00:03:50.329> paste<00:03:50.510> off<00:03:50.780> basically<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.500> use<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.829> as

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
thermal paste off basically to use it as

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.020 
thermal paste off basically to use it as
a<00:03:52.340> solvent<00:03:53.169> okay<00:03:54.190> now<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.220> got<00:03:55.459> most<00:03:55.669> of<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:55.880> off

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
a solvent okay now I got most of it off

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.210 
a solvent okay now I got most of it off
there<00:03:56.419> but<00:03:57.169> I'm<00:03:57.440> going<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.680> go<00:03:57.829> with<00:03:58.010> one<00:03:58.190> more

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
q-tip I'm going to dip it again in the

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.599 
q-tip I'm going to dip it again in the
alcohol<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:02.200> go<00:04:03.200> one<00:04:03.530> more<00:04:03.739> pass<00:04:04.069> on<00:04:04.430> this

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
alcohol and go one more pass on this

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.490 
alcohol and go one more pass on this
thing<00:04:07.120> just<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.299> make<00:04:08.480> sure<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:09.049> it's<00:04:09.230> nice

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
and clean I'm going to dab off my q-tip

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.060 
and clean I'm going to dab off my q-tip

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
again make sure it's not going and just

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:27.830 
again make sure it's not going and just
the<00:04:18.130> remainder<00:04:18.520> off<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:19.060> here

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:39.970
