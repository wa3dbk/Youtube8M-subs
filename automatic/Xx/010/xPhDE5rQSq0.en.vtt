a<00:03:18.400> lot<00:03:18.849> but<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.569> reason<00:03:19.720> I'm<00:03:20.019> upping<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.650> again

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
is because it's getting towards the end

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.619 
is because it's getting towards the end
of<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.349> three-month<00:03:23.829> period<00:03:24.180> where<00:03:25.180> that<00:03:25.540> was
