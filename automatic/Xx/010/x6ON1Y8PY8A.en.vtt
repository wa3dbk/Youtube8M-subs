00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 those who finally got rid of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.940
 cheap prejudice and began to understand 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.859
 that the car should not only be 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 big not only black and not only 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.820
 sedan increasingly pays attention to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.099
 so-called generalists increased 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.960
 patency comfort kompaktvena 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 patency of the crossover and the price as at 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.920
 cars but still have to admit that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.010
 unfortunately the main players of this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.840
 segment price is still high say audi 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.480
 allroad or volvo xc70 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 although wait there is one variation of skoda 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.230
 octavia scout 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.120
 audi for the poor tell you let me 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.719
 you do not agree for the basis of course 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.280
 was taken 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350
 the usual skoda 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.629
 octavia combi lining added 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.670
 thresholds on the wheel arches are changed front and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.739
 rear bumpers this time their bottom 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.300
 the part is not painted in order not to be 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.460
 scary to climb at least in the light but still 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.289
 Offroad in the rest of course tastes not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.360
 argue but I think the car turned out 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.350
 harmonious especially when you consider that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.600
 still wagon 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 the scout's interior is practically nothing 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.379
 different from normal octave 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.050
 the off-road of this car allocates only 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.229
 inscription 4 on 4 on the gear lever 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 and here's a pseudo jeepers pen for 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.860
 front passenger but thank god that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.280
 said this serious off-road is not by 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.409
 teeth 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 and then the passenger would fly out of the chair 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.210
 with this pen too she 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 fake but what is the seat here 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.960
 what a cool feeling it is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 cars are not off-road but for 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.369
 serious racing great profile 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.979
 excellent lateral support finish 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.170
 leather on the sides and alcantara in the middle 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 general, even if you want you can not fly 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 turn but in principle hag but mickey 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 and driving comfort find fault very 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.590
 everything is difficult in its place everything is available 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.320
 everything is nice to touch everything is pressed 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.290
 switches in general car for 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.270
 driver and for convenience by the way I wanted 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.680
 would appeal to those who complained about 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.350
 lack of electric seat 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.060
 scout to confess honestly for all these 10 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.009
 days of the test that I had to spend 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.590
 in this car I adjusted 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.110
 sitting only once 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.399
 first got into this car more 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.680
 I didn't have to do this 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.689
 ranges of adjustments think enough for 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.600
 a person with any height plus this 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.250
 it is also governed by the role and 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.819
 two planes it is already with a very large 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.920
 range 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.480
 so tweaking once more 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 do not likely have and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.629
 these settings will be enough 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.310
 for a long time but if you often don’t 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.310
 change drivers but in the back row 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.409
 you feel like sitting in a sedan 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.629
 business class space is more than enough 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.810
 reasons for rear passengers have such 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.730
 the pleasures of life as deflectors blowing 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.659
 heated seats and all sorts of shades 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.290
 for trifles individual light and 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.209
 multifunction armrest 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.220
 firstly there is such a comfortable one 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.430
 don't shut ari for papers either for phone 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.510
 but for every little thing and of course 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.049
 Required for such cars 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.269
 class access to the trunk or 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.129
 in order to transport all kinds 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.170
 length gauges to the third person here 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.870
 do clearly nothing and not because 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.769
 that the car is narrow but because 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.510
 cars are all-wheel drive and 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.920
 so he has pretty 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.870
 impressive central tunnel 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.790
 but together there is a very comfortable one 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.450
 seat molded no worse than 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.690
 front generally behind no worse than 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.690
 in front 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.799
 and scout's trunk as it should be 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.450
 car of this class is just huge 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.620
 even with the seats spread out each 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.530
 cubic centimeter of space 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.640
 used for case bottom spare and 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.890
 jack to the right 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.900
 niche for first aid kit and fire extinguisher on the left 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.209
 for any utensils but in the trunk 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
 all possible hooks and fasteners and mesh 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.620
 in general, a full car for the family 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.829
 travel well it's time 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.260
 talk about driving ahead 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.319
 You can generally characterize the memory 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.299
 how skoda octavia scout behaves 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.209
 reasonable enough and measured 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.819
 the engine is installed here pretty 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.689
 known by car concern 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.790
 volkswagen 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.220
 this move is far from new 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.810
 1 liter capacity of 105 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.719
 horsepower which is achieved for 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.269
 using turbocharger this 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:02.280
 engine as i said earlier it 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.099
 just reason is enough for 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.689
 to keep quite confidently in 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.000
 city ​​traffic is enough for that 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.069
 so pretty bold and again 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.599
 overtaking confidently and safely 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.220
 track in order to maintain 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.409
 pretty high cruising 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.269
 speed on the track i.e. its quite 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:20.669
 sufficient enough to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.889
 without much damage to the speakers 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.810
 carry as much as possible 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.560
 luggage which is provided for this 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.510
 car there are four people and 250 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.669
 300 kilograms of cargo, of course, for 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.970
 like a car that still 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.940
 Oriented though light but UV road 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.039
 the presence of a diesel engine would be more logical and he 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.580
 so there is a two-liter turbodiesel 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.470
 140 horsepower to my 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.110
 a glance of this motor is more than enough 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.849
 but again this car will still 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.849
 more measured but more 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.580
 high-torque in the zone of low speed that 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.669
 more important off-road 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.080
 powertrain here provided for 2 if 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.610
 not supplied with a gasoline engine 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.689
 6-speed manual only 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.699
 gearbox what for diesel 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.830
 movable provided only 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:12.119
 seven-speed robotic box 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.469
 dsg which is again famous by many 

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:16.509
 car course concern volkswagen and 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.709
 audi and volkswagen and skoda it 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.779
 robotic box with two 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:21.969
 clutches she's very good herself 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.559
 has already recommended that 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.939
 installed on many car 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.529
 pretty quickly switches 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.779
 the transfer does not select the most important 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.679
 engine power how to do it 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.519
 most automatic full 

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:35.879
 hydrotransformer gearboxes 

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:39.429
 continuing the topic of reasonable sufficiency 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:42.189
 and you can tell about the suspension which 

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:43.839
 also not something mean between 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.939
 comfort and handling she 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:49.029
 pretty nagaenko she possesses 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.589
 good running smoothness and even if you 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:54.219
 didn't notice some kind of a serious breakdown 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:57.279
 the suspension is likely to swallow it then 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.779
 have bring the suspension to breakdown in 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.269
 the principle of difficult cornering machine 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.849
 holding too very confidently quite a lot 

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:07.269
 merit in this large gauge 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.219
 pretty long base but enough 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:12.099
 this car load more than 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:14.169
 half say so and of course 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.300
 the rocks it appears already palpable rolls 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.329
 which is clearly not 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.129
 don't make control of better safer 

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:23.769
 more confident as many other German 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.699
 Skoda Octavia scout cars are quite 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:27.879
 quiet 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.589
 that is, road noises are not transmitted 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.179
 aerodynamic noise too little 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.809
 the only thing on the back 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:37.719
 for 3000 starts pretty clearly 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:40.179
 hear exhaust sound and sound 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:43.949
 the whole skoda octavia engine itself 

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:46.029
 car for those who appreciate it 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:49.419
 adequate number of cars for 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:50.110
 adequate amount of money and not ready 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.969
 overpay 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.769
 or just do not want to overpay just 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:56.800
 for a beautiful nameplate or for some 

00:06:53.769 --> 00:07:00.009
 fashioned shiny plastic 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.319
 detail or something else a person who 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.360
 buying something buying a car in order 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.699
 to ride such a kind of workhorse 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.039
 this is also the image is doomed not the worst 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:10.929
 so that's what we have as a result we take 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.159
 say audi allroad cost from two seconds 

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:14.740
 half to three and a half million 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:16.089
 rubles discard expensive label about 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.649
 100 horsepower 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:18.380
 automatic transmission and 

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:20.060
 gets 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.790
 skoda octavia scout in base 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.710
 complete set but for 990 thousand rubles 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.080
 car similar in concept by 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.130
 equipment and build quality add 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.900
 here the diesel engine and 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.370
 automatic transmission and price 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.590
 increase to 1 million 100 thousand 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.660
 rubles but as for the high cost and 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.850
 quality finishes and materials then about it 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.630
 you can talk endlessly too 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.630
 everything is relative
