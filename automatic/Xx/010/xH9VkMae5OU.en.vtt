think is the unrated once I don't know
what<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.940> main<00:02:37.120> difference<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.630> with<00:02:37.780> its<00:02:37.959> why

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
what the main difference is with its why

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.440 
what the main difference is with its why
and<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.549> maniac<00:02:40.060> I'm<00:02:40.269> gonna

because of it the horror section is even

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.050 
because of it the horror section is even
smaller

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060

this is like less things in it now

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.500 
this is like less things in it now
because<00:03:30.800> they<00:03:30.920> like<00:03:31.130> spread<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.180> out<00:03:32.270> like

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
because they like spread it out like

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.900 
because they like spread it out like

this really weird this change it they've
done<00:03:35.150> yeah<00:03:35.750> sorting<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.230> up<00:03:36.319> funny<00:03:36.500> thin<00:03:36.890> there

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
done yeah sorting it up funny thin there

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.979 
done yeah sorting it up funny thin there
I<00:03:37.310> don't<00:03:37.819> love<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.090> new<00:03:38.450> thing<00:03:38.840> they're

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
I don't love that new thing they're

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.420 
I don't love that new thing they're
doing<00:03:39.110> like<00:03:39.380> by<00:03:39.530> putting<00:03:39.800> those<00:03:39.860> price<00:03:40.160> tags

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
doing like by putting those price tags

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.250 
doing like by putting those price tags
in<00:03:40.610> front<00:03:40.790> like<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.750> think<00:03:42.170> it's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
in front like that I I think it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.059 
in front like that I I think it's
because<00:03:42.319> they're<00:03:42.500> trying<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.739> get<00:03:42.860> rid<00:03:43.010> of

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
because they're trying to get rid of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.309 
because they're trying to get rid of
stuff<00:03:43.400> but<00:03:44.030> by<00:03:44.180> doing<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.569> it's<00:03:44.959> like<00:03:45.110> so

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
stuff but by doing that it's like so

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.710 
stuff but by doing that it's like so
much<00:03:45.470> less<00:03:45.800> stuff<00:03:46.250> now<00:03:46.519> because<00:03:46.790> kind<00:03:47.630> of

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
much less stuff now because kind of

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.600 
much less stuff now because kind of
makes<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.230> by<00:03:48.380> with<00:03:48.590> like<00:03:48.830> also<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.459> think

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
makes it so by with like also I think

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.890 
makes it so by with like also I think
it'd<00:03:49.819> be<00:03:49.880> such<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.120> pain<00:03:50.420> because<00:03:50.569> you<00:03:50.720> have<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
it'd be such a pain because you have to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.650 
it'd be such a pain because you have to
change<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.530> all<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.430> time<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:53.450> know<00:03:53.569> when

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
change that all the time you know when

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.390 
change that all the time you know when
you<00:03:53.720> get<00:03:53.810> stuff<00:03:54.050> new<00:03:54.290> it's<00:03:54.500> kind<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.739> like<00:03:54.890> with

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
you get stuff new it's kind of like with
