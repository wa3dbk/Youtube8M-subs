00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.609
 good soldiers here you have this little 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.609
 speed test you have to do it 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.260
 with everything closed in emule la play 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.900
 any other page to make it what 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.930
 I have more contracted 45 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.330
 ono megas with wifi always always on 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.810
 half so that data of 17 with 6 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.640
 meg roughly approximate the 45,000 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.500
 seconds is since I see a 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.930
 otherwise until he sees me the let's say that 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.270
 there is a delay then half a tenth of 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.570
 second is good enough a good 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.000
 Connection 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.660
 and we will make the rise that with that is with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 what we play in play 2 with double 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.960
 gas from a mega already we can be 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.970
 host of a game that data are the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.940
 important the rise and the thousands 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.460
 seconds from 100 all 50 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.460
 Milliseconds we're already fucked up 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.739
 because we are missing without good truth here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.980
 we have we go to options where we see it 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.739
 in the play we go to options and within 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.559
 that page we give the select button 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.260
 system information there we have it 2 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.910
 with 2 megabytes bandwidth 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.980
 relatively good connection to be the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.230
 host so that all the companions who 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.920
 join can play and good 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.020
 relatively well with this connection it 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 can play pretty well how we know 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.400
 what is the jose in a game there is a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.800
 change of the games and we are giving 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 continuously to the button select the button 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.630
 you will be cl button and until this appears 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 screen there we see it all a lazio is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.810
 the host of the game someone has left 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.620
 there is a host change and the next one is 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.470
 this lad 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.960
 we see that from there he is the one 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.240
 deal with your connection to others 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.890
 players if it's good then pretty much 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.630
 everyone will play well and if 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.780
 sister then everyone except the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.340
 will play badly is what has happened this end 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.070
 of the week these last days has had 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 a terrible connection has had problems 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.100
 with one there we see my last games 0 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.080
 0 0 0 0 1 1 between the half get 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.030
 kill 3 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.200
 they did not kill me three and get nine 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.380
 good and there we see my games a 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.910
 authentic disaster and this of these people 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.280
 to shut up the shot as if I pulled 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.570
 the change does not pull the cable simply 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.190
 I have collision problems which is what 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.020
 what happens when one pulls the card 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.410
 it means that it ends the games 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.240
 before then for the moment you are warned that 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.610
 increase is marking with that you have 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.740
 that finishing the games can not stop 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.540
 in half you can not leave it and in 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.180
 consequence if you pass up the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.430
 observation of me keep you during 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.800
 five minutes in observation so that 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.959
 can not play you're there hanging 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.670
 hung watching how the 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.650
 time not one but all the times that 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.140
 need each time from now 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.120
 every time the game ends, you go 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.620
 to be in observation happened to me in 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.070
 repeated times this weekend has 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 been pretty annoyed so it's 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.450
 kids our advice this week 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.150
 do not pull the terminal cable 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.819
 canteens because the consequence is that you 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.189
 they go in and I started the account zero 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.870
 thank you very much for your attention we 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.870
 we see a greeting on the battlefield
