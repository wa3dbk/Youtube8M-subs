right okay and so but and it comes with
a<00:02:06.219> 4<00:02:06.549> 250<00:02:06.939> while<00:02:07.090> prob<00:02:07.329> power<00:02:07.929> supplies<00:02:08.380> okay

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
a 4 250 while prob power supplies okay

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.520 
a 4 250 while prob power supplies okay
and<00:02:09.009> also<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:10.119> comes<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.570> docking<00:02:10.960> also<00:02:11.230> adds

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and also it comes the docking also adds

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.320 
and also it comes the docking also adds
additional<00:02:11.740> ports<00:02:12.400> as<00:02:12.700> well<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.150> got

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.550 
that uses a killer networking part okay
and<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:25.010> speaker<00:02:25.490> system<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:26.260> front<00:02:27.260> grille

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and a speaker system this front grille

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.140 
and a speaker system this front grille
here<00:02:27.800> actually<00:02:28.070> inside<00:02:28.610> there's<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.910> speaker

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
here actually inside there's a speaker

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.110 
here actually inside there's a speaker
system<00:02:29.270> ok<00:02:29.960> so<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.440> itself<00:02:30.800> it's<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:31.910> almost

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
system ok so in itself it's it's almost

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.780 
system ok so in itself it's it's almost
like<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> mini<00:02:32.780> pc<00:02:33.260> when<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.250> connect<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.730> all

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
like a mini pc when you connect it all

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.520 
like a mini pc when you connect it all
together<00:02:34.970> there<00:02:35.210> becomes<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> powerhouse

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
together there becomes like a powerhouse

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.000 
together there becomes like a powerhouse
like<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.580> went<00:02:37.760> out<00:02:37.850> on<00:02:38.000> home<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:39.410> to

actually<00:02:40.370> just<00:02:40.970> remove<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.750> system<00:02:42.470> from<00:02:42.560> a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
actually just remove the system from a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.830 
actually just remove the system from a
me<00:02:42.860> doc<00:02:43.070> it's<00:02:43.250> very<00:02:43.460> simple<00:02:43.730> let's<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.300> shut

great<00:03:33.470> thing<00:03:33.530> about<00:03:33.890> this<00:03:34.750> entire<00:03:35.750> system<00:03:36.500> is

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
great thing about this entire system is

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.000 
great thing about this entire system is
that<00:03:37.640> we're<00:03:38.240> using<00:03:38.510> our<00:03:38.930> over<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.530> prior<00:03:39.830> to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
that we're using our over the prior to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.180 
that we're using our over the prior to
bury<00:03:40.160> docking<00:03:41.060> slot<00:03:41.960> this<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.500> pcie<00:03:43.310> 3.0

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
bury docking slot this is a pcie 3.0

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.250 
bury docking slot this is a pcie 3.0
also<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.550> this<00:03:47.150> was<00:03:47.360> using<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> entire

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
also this is this was using the entire

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.750 
also this is this was using the entire
bandwidth<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.580> desktop<00:03:49.970> cpu<00:03:50.480> okay<00:03:50.990> so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
bandwidth of the desktop cpu okay so

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.800 
bandwidth of the desktop cpu okay so
compared<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> somehow<00:03:53.030> fellow<00:03:53.270> competitors

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
compared to somehow fellow competitors

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.810 
compared to somehow fellow competitors
of<00:03:54.080> their<00:03:54.709> you're<00:03:55.070> actually<00:03:55.190> using<00:03:55.340> like<00:03:55.700> a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
of their you're actually using like a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.540 
of their you're actually using like a
pcie<00:03:56.330> x<00:03:57.250> 40<00:03:58.270> slot<00:03:59.270> which<00:04:00.110> actually<00:04:00.550> doesn't

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
pcie x 40 slot which actually doesn't

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.270 
pcie x 40 slot which actually doesn't
really<00:04:02.240> take<00:04:02.870> advantage<00:04:02.990> of<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.470> entire<00:04:03.740> GPU

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
really take advantage of the entire GPU

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.610 
really take advantage of the entire GPU
performance<00:04:04.430> whereas<00:04:05.240> this<00:04:05.900> system<00:04:06.410> you

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
performance whereas this system you

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.900 
performance whereas this system you
actually<00:04:06.920> are<00:04:06.980> getting<00:04:07.250> everything<00:04:07.430> out<00:04:07.850> of

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
actually are getting everything out of

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.990 
actually are getting everything out of
just<00:04:08.330> like<00:04:08.510> as<00:04:08.780> you<00:04:08.990> would<00:04:09.200> your<00:04:09.700> desktop<00:04:10.700> pc

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
just like as you would your desktop pc

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.480 
just like as you would your desktop pc
at<00:04:11.180> home<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:12.050> you<00:04:12.470> really<00:04:12.740> have<00:04:12.770> a<00:04:13.010> lot<00:04:13.430> of

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
at home so you really have a lot of

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.790 
at home so you really have a lot of
power<00:04:13.880> here<00:04:14.300> you<00:04:14.480> can<00:04:14.660> we've<00:04:14.930> actually<00:04:15.140> tested

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
power here you can we've actually tested

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.849 
power here you can we've actually tested
of<00:04:15.920> wide<00:04:16.459> range<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.440> graphics<00:04:18.440> cards<00:04:18.739> already
