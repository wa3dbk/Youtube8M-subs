organics and I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.210> create<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.659> small<00:00:04.290> compost<00:00:05.240> bucket<00:00:06.240> and

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
to create a small compost bucket and

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.950 
to create a small compost bucket and
this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.230> just<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.470> five<00:00:07.649> gallon<00:00:07.980> bucket<00:00:08.429> and

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
this is just a five gallon bucket and

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.839 
this is just a five gallon bucket and
this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.830> regular<00:00:11.160> old<00:00:11.340> lid<00:00:11.610> if

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
this is just a just a regular old lid if

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.280 
this is just a just a regular old lid if
you<00:00:12.090> had<00:00:12.360> one<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> lids<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.080> will

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
you had one of the lids that will

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.660 
you had one of the lids that will
actually<00:00:13.440> screw<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.070> where<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.280> pound<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
actually screw on where you pound the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.490 
actually screw on where you pound the
ring<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.240> then<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> has<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> screw<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.470> lid

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
ring on and then it has a screw on lid

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.050 
ring on and then it has a screw on lid
that's<00:00:16.980> actually<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> be<00:00:17.670> better<00:00:17.820> than

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
that's actually going to be better than

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.460 
that's actually going to be better than
this<00:00:18.150> because<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.539> easier<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.289> lid

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
this because it's easier to get that lid

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.080 
this because it's easier to get that lid
off<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.250> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.520> ahead<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.970> just

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
off but I'm going to go ahead and just

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.050 
off but I'm going to go ahead and just
pound<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.570> lid<00:00:21.779> back<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.820> if<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> got<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
pound the lid back on if you got a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.700 
pound the lid back on if you got a
little<00:00:24.420> opener<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:24.810> these<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.140> great<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
little opener for these are great and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.370 
little opener for these are great and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
then we just want to drill some holes in

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.990 
then we just want to drill some holes in
this<00:00:28.529> baby<00:00:34.309> probably<00:00:35.309> gonna<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.700> about

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
this baby probably gonna want about

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.590 
this baby probably gonna want about
eight<00:00:36.719> holes<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> top<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.100> thing

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.750 

there's<00:00:42.600> some<00:00:42.719> random<00:00:43.170> spots<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.550> want

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
there's some random spots here we want

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.920 
there's some random spots here we want
air<00:00:44.969> circulation<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:47.390> we<00:00:48.390> don't<00:00:48.600> want<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
air circulation in here we don't want it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619 
air circulation in here we don't want it
to<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.579> anaerobic<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:50.730> means<00:00:51.000> no<00:00:51.329> air

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
to be anaerobic which means no air

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
to be anaerobic which means no air
getting<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> gets<00:00:52.800> really

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
getting to it because it gets really

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
getting to it because it gets really
smelly<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.820> way<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.530> we're<00:00:55.620> gonna

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
smelly that way and then we're gonna

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.930 
smelly that way and then we're gonna
flip<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.100> its<00:00:56.250> side<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.930> again

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
flip it on its side and do this again

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
flip it on its side and do this again
I'm<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.090> gonna<00:01:00.210> put<00:01:00.480> free<00:01:00.719> hauls<00:01:01.129> if<00:01:02.129> you've
