00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.189
 I want him to mutilate and kill the children of 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.990
 a small American town because 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.940
 cyclically arrives the horror to derry in 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.610
 form of a sinister clown that goes 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.190
 sowing destruction in its wake after 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.560
 27 years of tranquility and remoteness 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.450
 old child promise makes them come back 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.630
 to the place where they lived their childhood 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.310
 and youth as a terrible nightmare 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.470
 They return to Barry to face their 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.300
 past and finally bury the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.670
 threatens to make you bitter during your childhood 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 they know they can die but they are 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.480
 aware that they will not know peace 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.739
 of this that that thing is destroyed 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.690
 forever after the flood 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.480
 1957 the terror that would not end by 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.789
 another 28 years if it ended any 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.070
 once started as far as I can 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.989
 have a boat made from a sheet of 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.269
 a newspaper although it floated along the 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.550
 stream of a street flooded with rain the 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.440
 little boat nodded tilted back to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.390
 straighten up in the middle of treacherous 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.039
 swirls and continued its march by 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.790
 whitham street 'to the traffic light that 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.340
 marked 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.110
 intersection of this jump are the three 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.120
 vertical lenses on the sides of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.310
 traffic lights were dark and also 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.210
 all the houses on that afternoon of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.370
 autumn of 1957 it rained incessantly from 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.160
 a week and two days ago 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.410
 the winds had also come from 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.390
 then most of terry had 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.700
 gone without electric current and still 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.500
 He was still a boy in a raincoat 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.140
 yellow and red boots still 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.090
 happily to the paper boat the rain 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.820
 it was not heavy but at last it was 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.770
 marinated hit on the hood 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.980
 yellow of the raincoat sounding 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.260
 ears of the child 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.960
 from a shed a comforting sound 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.710
 kid's cozy grace of raincoat 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.220
 yellow was god 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.840
 he was six years old williams his brother to 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.880
 who almost all the children of the school 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.520
 primary have and even the teachers 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.750
 although they would never have used the nickname 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.270
 in front of him they knew as life 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.440
 He was in his house passing the remains of 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.780
 a pretty flu would be in that fall of 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.270
 1957 eight months before they started 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.490
 really the horrors and 28 years earlier 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.070
 of the final outcome or of singing 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.990
 I was 10 years old was Bill who had done 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.840
 the boat next to which ran george 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.610
 he had done it sitting on his bed with the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.830
 back supported on a lot of 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.870
 pillows while the mother played for 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.940
 smooth on the piano in the room and the rain 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.730
 tirelessly swept the window of his 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.380
 bedroom to a third of apple way 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.040
 of the intersection and the traffic light 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.020
 off 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.030
 William Street was closed to traffic 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.790
 by several barrels of pitch and four 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.130
 orange easels in each of 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.010
 those easels were seen town hall of 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.780
 jerry public works department 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.910
 after them the rain had overflowed 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.280
 Clogged culverts with branches 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.400
 stones and clusters of sticky leaves 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.680
 autumn the water had gone 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.379
 at first started then large 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.930
 greedy pieces all this towards the 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.090
 third day of the rains towards the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.129
 midday of the fourth great day 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.349
 pieces of pavement were dragged by 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.780
 the intersection of jackson william how 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.819
 miniature ice floes many 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.890
 derry inhabitants had begun by 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.140
 then to make nervous jokes about 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.090
 the ark the works department 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.310
 public had managed to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.260
 keep open to jackson street but 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.030
 William was impassable from the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.280
 barriers to the very center of the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.560
 city and everyone agreed 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.959
 However, the worst had happened 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.940
 the river that I looked for had grown 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.340
 almost to its margins in the serials 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.140
 and until very few centimeters below 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.120
 of the cement walls of the canal that 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.700
 constrained his passage through the center of the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.830
 city at those times a group of 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.080
 men among them sad imbroglio the 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.209
 weak george's father was retiring 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.760
 the sandbags that had launched the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.430
 previous day with terrified haste a 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.400
 day before the flood and its expensive 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.380
 damage had seemed almost inevitable 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.130
 well did god know that it had already happened 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.170
 previously the flood of 1931 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.330
 it had been a disaster with a cost of 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.620
 millions of dollars and more than 20 lives 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.540
 that was a long time ago but 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.909
 people out there who remembered him for 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.739
 scare one of our victims 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.900
 of the flood had been found in 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.479
 bus for about 40 kilometers from 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.880
 distance the fish had eaten 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.250
 that unfortunate gentleman eyes three 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.680
 fingers the penis and most of the foot 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.110
 left grabbed by what remained of 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.960
 his hands had appeared the steering wheel of 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.850
 a ford now however the river was 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.620
 backing up and when the 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.870
 new hydraulic dam from bangor 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.810
 upstream would cease to be a 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.180
 threat at least that said harold that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.800
 he worked at hydroelectric abandoned in 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.350
 As for the other good 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.900
 future floods would wait for what 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.880
 important was to leave this one return the 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.729
 electric current and then forget it 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.010
 in derry that of forgetting the tragedy and the 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.930
 disaster was almost an art such as bill 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.480
 of mere would come to discover with the 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.580
 weather 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.500
 georges stopped just behind the 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.660
 barriers to the edge of a deep crack 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.090
 that had opened on the surface of 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.280
 william string this 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.330
 ravine ran almost exactly 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.729
 diagonal 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.979
 end of the street about 12 meters from 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.379
 where he was down hill 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.210
 to the right he laughed aloud 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.430
 sound of lonely childhood joy 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.740
 saving you're on that gray afternoon 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.719
 while a whim of the overflowed water 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.610
 He carried her to a paper boat 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.889
 cataract scales formed by another 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.990
 crack in the pavement the water had 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.939
 open with its urgency a channel that 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.800
 ran along the diagonal and by 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.659
 the ship was going from one side to the other 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.550
 the street dragged so fast by the 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:44.430
 current that georges had to run 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.979
 to follow the water stretched under their 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.629
 boots forming sheets of mud their 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.729
 seeds sounded with a jubilant 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.129
 tinkle while of the system broke 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.229
 ran towards his strange death and the 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.659
 feeling that I was taking at that moment 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.370
 he was clear and simply love towards his 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.590
 brother love and also a certain 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.360
 sadness why bill could not be 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.270
 there to see that and share it 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.279
 clear that he would try to describe what 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.740
 when I returned home but I knew that 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.539
 I could never make it look good 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.449
 how bill would have made him see him 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:16.580
 in reverse situation 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.529
 He excelled in reading and writing but 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.599
 even at his age God had capacity 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:22.729
 enough to understand that no 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.159
 that's why he had the best skills 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.169
 notes was not the only reason that 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.809
 the teachers would like their 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.419
 compositions the way of telling was 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:34.819
 only part of the matter living knew 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.650
 see the little boat almost whistled along 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.539
 of that channel only one page ripped 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.969
 of the classified ads section 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:42.889
 of the 'derry news but I'll tell you 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.020
 imagined like a billboard in a 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.759
 war movie that I used to see 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.430
 in the theater of ree with bill in the 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.139
 Saturday machines a movie of 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.539
 war in which I no fighting me 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.430
 against the Japanese the bow of the ship 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.650
 of paper raised waves on each side 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.090
 while continuing his hasty course 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.820
 towards the ditch on the left side of the 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.710
 At that point a new duel was over 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.260
 the open crack in the pavement 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.030
 creating a pretty large swirl 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.340
 George thought the boat would tip over 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.410
 going to me who waited so 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.590
 alarming but then straightened turned and 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.300
 He sailed quickly to the intersection 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:21.210
 George Jahn shouts with joy and ran 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.520
 to reach it on his head a 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.270
 torva gust of wind did not whistle 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.639
 the trees 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.889
 almost completely released from their charge 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:32.810
 of leaves because of the storm that that 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:32.810
 year had been a relentless harvester
