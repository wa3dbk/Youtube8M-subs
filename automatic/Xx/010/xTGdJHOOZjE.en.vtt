00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.100
 go to a restaurant and gold 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.590
 I'll tell you why this particular restaurant 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.780
 and chose to study Japanese 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.000
 culinary philosophy and go 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.740
 this is a real corner of the land of the ascendant 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.920
 sunshine in bishkek 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.350
 the owner is the same chef arrived from osaka 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.960
 and not just to do business here and 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.420
 first of all for dating Kyrgyz 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.420
 with the culture of hospitality of their country 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.450
 I have a high restaurant there very often 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.079
 students came from kyrgyzstan we 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.850
 became friends 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.070
 and when they returned home very much 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.710
 often wrote me madly missing 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.750
 in my kitchen, I decided to come to Bishkek so 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.000
 appeared played staff recruited from 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.950
 local guys but they all know japanese 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.460
 and very carefully treat our 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.460
 traditions 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.210
 on the one hand, we all seem to be 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.670
 well learned japanese food but how 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.439
 says cook but masan what bishkek 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.990
 give out for sushi and rolls 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.020
 not at all like native Japanese 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.569
 dishes are not to your taste not to cooking 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.119
 the same kitchen is much more diverse than 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.819
 standard rolls philadelphia and unagi 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.509
 poppies 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.979
 Japanese cuisine is on the list 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.000
 intangible cultural heritage 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.530
 UNESCO 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.210
 due to its uniqueness 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.159
 naturalness rich history and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.110
 traditions and of course with nothing 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.810
 comparable taste what's the secret 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.209
 Our cooks have found 5 taste for a long time 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.549
 minds whose perception mechanisms 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.590
 scientists have become clear only now 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.140
 Umami appears when used 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.000
 natural protein food its source 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.519
 glutamate and other amino acids 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.019
 minds are present in most 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.530
 seafood in soybean crops and some 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.530
 of vegetables 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.099
 today everywhere use harmful 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.500
 artificial glutamate but here it is not 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.920
 held a delicious dish done only for 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.170
 score 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.239
 natural products today we have on 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.560
 dinner of truth japanese sashimi dish 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.349
 nigiri sushi 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.299
 and chicken teriyaki just right on 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.519
 our eyes he cooked these 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.439

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.840

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.389
 played out incredibly but we are here for 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.760
 In order to understand try 5 taste and 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.389
 we will do it with a real Japanese 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.150
 sashin 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.220
 what to say about minds determine everything 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.889
 still difficult still need more 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.739
 train your taste buds well 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.169
 that tasty is incredibly accurate 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.470
 I wonder what in Japan and therefore in this 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.720
 the restaurant is also accompanied by every step 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.329
