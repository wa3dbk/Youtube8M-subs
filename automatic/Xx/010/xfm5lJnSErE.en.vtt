this<00:02:12.019> is<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.319> 70<00:02:12.739> 40<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.400> see<00:02:13.640> how<00:02:13.819> this

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
this is the 70 40 you can see how this

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.149 
this is the 70 40 you can see how this
is<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.239> lot<00:02:14.540> stouter<00:02:15.080> than<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.470> last<00:02:15.620> two<00:02:15.980> that

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
is a lot stouter than the last two that

is a lot stouter than the last two that
I<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.459> showed<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.909> this<00:02:17.629> thing<00:02:17.930> shuts<00:02:18.230> off

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
I just showed you this thing shuts off

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.930 
I just showed you this thing shuts off
pretty<00:02:19.010> fast<00:02:19.690> very<00:02:20.690> slow<00:02:21.049> taper<00:02:21.379> it's<00:02:22.340> very

take anything bigger than that would

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.660 
take anything bigger than that would
probably<00:02:35.480> be<00:02:35.629> you<00:02:35.989> know<00:02:36.110> testing<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.739> but<00:02:36.920> for

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
strong 40 pound rod you could use it for

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.710

all<00:02:42.590> different<00:02:42.860> types<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.430> things<00:02:43.549> but<00:02:43.849> could

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
all different types of things but could

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.720 
all different types of things but could
see<00:02:44.959> how<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.920> guide<00:02:46.099> placing<00:02:46.609> and

see how with the guide placing and
everything<00:02:47.060> else<00:02:47.209> this<00:02:48.079> thing<00:02:48.140> is<00:02:48.470> laid<00:02:48.739> out

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
everything else this thing is laid out

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.349 
everything else this thing is laid out
just<00:02:49.340> right<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:51.010> more<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.340> in<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.760> rod<00:02:53.030> this

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
just right and more so in this rod this

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.080 
just right and more so in this rod this
rod<00:02:53.599> pretty<00:02:53.870> much<00:02:54.079> shuts<00:02:54.590> off<00:02:54.829> right<00:02:55.099> here<00:02:55.370> but

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
rod pretty much shuts off right here but

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.449 
rod pretty much shuts off right here but
the<00:02:56.239> more<00:02:56.569> power<00:02:57.079> that's<00:02:57.470> placed<00:02:57.829> on<00:02:58.099> this<00:02:58.250> rod

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
the more power that's placed on this rod

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.009 
the more power that's placed on this rod
will<00:02:58.730> do<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.000> same<00:02:59.180> thing<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.569> other<00:02:59.599> ones<00:02:59.870> do

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
will do the same thing the other ones do

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.979 
will do the same thing the other ones do
it<00:03:00.590> will<00:03:00.739> transfer<00:03:01.340> back<00:03:01.609> here<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.420> bed<00:03:02.690> and

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
it will transfer back here this bed and

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.250 
it will transfer back here this bed and
as<00:03:03.109> this<00:03:03.349> band<00:03:03.620> transfers<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:05.599> gets<00:03:05.930> rid

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
as this band transfers and it gets rid

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.099 
as this band transfers and it gets rid
of<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.430> length<00:03:07.760> between<00:03:08.120> your<00:03:08.540> butt<00:03:08.810> and

to<00:04:09.680> fish<00:04:09.920> like<00:04:10.219> tackle<00:04:10.879> to<00:04:11.060> can<00:04:11.329> fish<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.720> run

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
to fish like tackle to can fish this run

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.250 
to fish like tackle to can fish this run
but<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.549> see<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.150> rod<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.599> dynamics<00:04:15.169> of

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
but you can see the rod the dynamics of

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.620 
but you can see the rod the dynamics of
the<00:04:15.349> rod<00:04:15.530> changed<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:16.310> in<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.609> in<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:17.509> way

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
the rod changed just in the in the way

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.420 
the rod changed just in the in the way
this<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.049> spinning<00:04:18.500> but<00:04:18.650> we<00:04:18.799> are<00:04:18.949> using<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
this is a spinning but we are using the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.140 
this is a spinning but we are using the
same<00:04:19.639> blanks<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.750> very<00:04:21.620> powerful<00:04:21.880> yet<00:04:22.880> very

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
same blanks so very powerful yet very

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.910 
same blanks so very powerful yet very
effective

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.890 

okay<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.130> second<00:04:29.580> plank<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.000> Sr<00:04:30.420> series

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
okay the second plank in the Sr series

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.310 
okay the second plank in the Sr series
this<00:04:31.230> is<00:04:31.290> an<00:04:31.590> SR<00:04:32.510> 70/30<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.720> can<00:04:33.900> see<00:04:34.140> that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
this is an SR 70/30 you can see that

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.370 
this is an SR 70/30 you can see that
this<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:35.010> bit<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:36.750> still<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.050> fast

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
this is a little bit it's still a fast

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.250 
this is a little bit it's still a fast
paper<00:04:37.680> here<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.090> basically<00:04:39.270> starts<00:04:40.080> to

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
paper here but it basically starts to

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.190 
paper here but it basically starts to
slow<00:04:40.500> down<00:04:40.680> here<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.640> 70/30<00:04:42.510> is<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:42.840> great

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
slow down here this 70/30 is of great

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.160 
slow down here this 70/30 is of great
rot<00:04:43.500> for<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.460> next<00:04:44.790> size<00:04:45.000> up<00:04:45.180> like<00:04:45.510> 50<00:04:45.930> pound

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
rot for the next size up like 50 pound

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.320 
rot for the next size up like 50 pound
tennis<00:04:46.620> or<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.070> know<00:04:47.550> something<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.270> that

sort maybe a smaller bail fish you know

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.250 
sort maybe a smaller bail fish you know
but<00:04:52.890> this<00:04:53.100> is<00:04:53.280> good<00:04:53.580> with<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.150> sr20<00:04:54.960> this<00:04:55.110> is

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
but this is good with the sr20 this is

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.340 
but this is good with the sr20 this is
an<00:04:55.350> absolutely<00:04:56.250> awesome<00:04:56.760> rod<00:04:57.300> with<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.630> sr20
