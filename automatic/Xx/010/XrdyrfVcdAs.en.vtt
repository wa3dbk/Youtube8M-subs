00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960 
actually put the tablet into portrait
mode<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.409> set<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.369> too<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
mode and set it up this way too if you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
mode and set it up this way too if you
want<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.079> got<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> extra<00:01:40.770> setting

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
right there in portrait mode so that's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.120 
right there in portrait mode so that's
something<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.740> different<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
something a little bit different that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
something a little bit different that
you<00:01:44.670> don't<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.030> most<00:01:45.240> have<00:01:45.450> tablet

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
covers all right so this has been a look

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.740 
I think there was someone for like ten
bucks<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> little<00:01:59.700> bit<00:01:59.820> more<00:01:59.939> basic<00:02:00.329> but

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
bucks it was a little bit more basic but

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.120 
bucks it was a little bit more basic but
it's<00:02:01.200> pretty<00:02:01.380> nice<00:02:01.469> covered<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> price

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it's pretty nice covered for the price
