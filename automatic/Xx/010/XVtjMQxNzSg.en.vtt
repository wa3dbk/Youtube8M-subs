00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:21.369
 was to look and explain what is going after 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.740
 We enter the consultation and we look at 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.019
 see what he says so much that he had a warning 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.470
 that has a mesecito to see with a month 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.810
 it's perfect to adopt it because before 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.060
 kittens that are with the mother the mother 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.780
 it is who cares who feeds them 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.360
 who cleans them 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.690
 and good if we have to do it 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 it is quite laborious to the animals more 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.100
 little ones 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.140
 you have to be a lot for them 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.969
 they need even when they have not yet 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.159
 they have teeth and they have to drink milk 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.610
 you should be giving them every two 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.739
 hours of eating you should rub them 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.309
 the tummy to make pee and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.920
 poop thing that good and who better than 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.100
 mother to do it and to feed her 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.979
 which is as tiny as the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.259
 I have to do look how until now 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.440
 been with the mother so far been 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.929
 drinking milk then I would do the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.420
 change gradually I would first give a 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:24.330
 little milk of kitten never milk of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.970
 cow and gradually we will put 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.649
 some balls of feed as if they were 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.289
 the morning cereals that leave 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.170
 softening and you will see that 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.860
 you can go thinking you can go chewing 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.690
 those damp little balls and little by little I 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 I think in four or five days already 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.150
 you can go making the change 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.430
 to a meal only dry how many 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.700
 times a day I put him to eat with a 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.550
 good month you can eat in fact you can already 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.720
 eat the throughout the day the hours 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.270
 they want if it had been more 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.210
 little girl every two hours I would need 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.100
 eat some milk and I would have to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 find a bottle or a syringe 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.210
 look in case you see that it is not going 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.710
 Belly or that does not pee that I 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.440
 I think he's going to do it but just in case 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.590
 I teach you how to stimulate it is worth it 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.190
 ideal is to have a little house 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.810
 and I moisten them a little with serum 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.390
 I always have his was a little here 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.849
 but even with tap water what 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.860
 you could do we'll hold it here from 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.340
 neck as if we were the mom 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.340
 and you with the house there, yes, perfect 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.800
 you're rubbing here on the belly this is 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.770
 as if it were his mother's tongue that 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.140
 deflate and stimulates them to do the pp and 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.450
 to win it when it does when 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.710
 grow we'll see her sometime look at what 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.740
 first thing we will do is a 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.870
 deworming and then after two 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.140
 weeks when they already have 6 to 8 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.580
 weeks we do the first vaccination and 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.580
 that vaccination has to be repeated 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.550
 just like a baby that has to put on 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.520
 the reminder and to teach him how to do 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.890
 of pee the tray is worth me this is what 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.290
 easier than this is only with 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.350
 what if she gets used to it 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.330
 this is a little bit your site sure they 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.370
 they feel very good then if here 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.280
 she feels calm you put her near 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.460
 the food and the water and next to it 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.100
 you put a box with sand 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.470
 and she only if you want to put it on 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.110
 moment over and you scratch it a little to 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.810
 that she understands that there she can scratch and 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.000
 can do your needs but you can not 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.910
 will require nothing else the data are very 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.330
 clean and it's rare that they do it outside of 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.330
 the sand 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.860
 remember when anything that 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.950
 have as we see them in three days 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.310
 if before you saw that the kitten that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.280
 eat does not do your needs and it's not going 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.740
 well stimulate the a is very stop 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.930
 If all this did not do, you call me or 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.510
 you come before and if everything goes well then 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.880
 three days we see each other and wormed and 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.880
 we started the whole vaccine pattern 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.810
 and
