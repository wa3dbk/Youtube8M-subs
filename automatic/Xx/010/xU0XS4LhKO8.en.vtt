mean he just likes his territory oh yeah
in<00:03:32.680> here<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:34.080> switched<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.260> around<00:03:35.319> in<00:03:35.620> here

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
in here I switched it around in here

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.970 
in here I switched it around in here
also<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.489> it's<00:03:36.670> basically<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.600> same<00:03:38.670> he<00:03:39.670> fell

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
also but it's basically the same he fell

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.140 
also but it's basically the same he fell
okay<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:46.420> difference<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.850> is

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
okay so the difference is that this is

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.750 
okay so the difference is that this is
now<00:03:49.360> moved<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.080> their<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.489> side<00:03:51.730> and

so you can hang on a wire cage this

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.720 
so you can hang on a wire cage this
isn't<00:04:54.750> really<00:04:54.840> work<00:04:55.110> since<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> top<00:04:55.920> it's

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
isn't really work since on the top it's

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.260 
isn't really work since on the top it's
all<00:04:56.910> plastic<00:04:57.480> but<00:04:58.380> here<00:04:58.650> bricks<00:04:59.130> because<00:04:59.430> this

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
all plastic but here bricks because this

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.090 
all plastic but here bricks because this
thing's<00:05:00.510> wired<00:05:00.780> so<00:05:01.380> I'd<00:05:01.500> only<00:05:01.680> put<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:01.950> hooks

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
thing's wired so I'd only put the hooks

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.190 
thing's wired so I'd only put the hooks
on<00:05:02.250> when<00:05:02.940> I<00:05:02.970> put<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.210> in<00:05:03.330> his<00:05:03.420> cage<00:05:03.690> but<00:05:03.960> that

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
on when I put it in his cage but that

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.840 
on when I put it in his cage but that
doesn't<00:05:04.500> really<00:05:04.620> matter<00:05:04.830> since<00:05:05.130> he<00:05:05.520> likes<00:05:05.730> it

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
doesn't really matter since he likes it
