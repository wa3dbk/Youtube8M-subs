claims to be 24 hours and i think it's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.950 
claims to be 24 hours and i think it's
supposed<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> waterproof<00:00:28.890> eyeliner<00:00:29.130> pen

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
supposed to be a waterproof eyeliner pen

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:40.660 
supposed to be a waterproof eyeliner pen
i<00:00:30.960> did<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> demo<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.130> i'm<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.550> to

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:01:21.180 

you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.780 

this<00:01:21.910> eyeliner<00:01:22.770> claims<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:24.040> be<00:01:24.070> waterproof

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
this eyeliner claims to be waterproof

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.340 
this eyeliner claims to be waterproof
which<00:01:25.390> I<00:01:26.020> think<00:01:26.680> it's<00:01:26.860> not<00:01:27.130> waterproof

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
which I think it's not waterproof

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.950 
which I think it's not waterproof
because<00:01:29.350> I've<00:01:29.500> tried<00:01:29.680> it<00:01:29.890> alone<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.670> lot<00:01:30.960> around

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
because I've tried it alone a lot around

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.190 
because I've tried it alone a lot around
two<00:01:32.440> weeks<00:01:32.470> two<00:01:32.830> days<00:01:32.860> ago<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.660> I<00:01:34.660> cried<00:01:35.170> a

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
two weeks two days ago and I cried a

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.820 
two weeks two days ago and I cried a
little<00:01:35.560> bit<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.490> smudges<00:01:36.820> because<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.840> like

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
little bit and it smudges because I like

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.130 
little bit and it smudges because I like
to<00:01:38.860> wing<00:01:39.280> my<00:01:39.430> eyeliner<00:01:39.760> like<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.480> if<00:01:40.930> you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
to wing my eyeliner like that and if you

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.330 
to wing my eyeliner like that and if you
touch<00:01:41.530> it<00:01:41.680> like<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:42.070> it's<00:01:42.340> much<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:43.270> see<00:01:44.340> so

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
touch it like that it's much so see so

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.310 
touch it like that it's much so see so
it's<00:01:45.520> not<00:01:45.700> really<00:01:45.760> waterproof<00:01:48.480> but<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:50.050> does

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
it's not really waterproof but it does

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.430 
it's not really waterproof but it does
it<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.610> thing<00:01:51.790> is<00:01:51.850> I'm<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:52.690> think<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.260> will

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
it and the thing is I'm I think it will

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.210 
it and the thing is I'm I think it will
dry<00:01:53.650> easily<00:01:53.890> because<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.500> formula<00:01:56.920> right<00:01:57.040> now

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
dry easily because the formula right now

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.240 
dry easily because the formula right now
is<00:01:57.400> really<00:01:57.430> good<00:01:57.940> actually<00:01:58.410> barrel<00:01:59.410> I<00:01:59.650> think

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
is really good actually barrel I think

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.420 
is really good actually barrel I think
as<00:02:00.460> time<00:02:01.390> goes<00:02:01.600> by<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.980> product<00:02:02.980> will<00:02:03.130> dry<00:02:03.400> out

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
as time goes by the product will dry out

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.969 
as time goes by the product will dry out
really<00:02:03.760> not<00:02:04.240> easily<00:02:04.720> because<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.620> product

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
really not easily because the product

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.120 
really not easily because the product
the<00:02:06.460> cap<00:02:06.760> won't<00:02:07.540> shut<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:08.110> off<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:08.890> it

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
the cap won't shut it off like it

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.400 
the cap won't shut it off like it
doesn't<00:02:09.670> click<00:02:10.149> off<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:10.630> just<00:02:10.840> kind<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.350> like

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
doesn't click off it's just kind of like

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.400 
doesn't click off it's just kind of like
just<00:02:11.710> like<00:02:11.830> that<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:13.240> yeah<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.020> doesn't<00:02:14.170> close

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
just like that so yeah it doesn't close

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.530 
just like that so yeah it doesn't close
really<00:02:14.770> nicely<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:18.370> pan<00:02:18.670> itself<00:02:18.970> is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
really nicely and the the pan itself is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.380 
really nicely and the the pan itself is
really<00:02:19.750> nice<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.920> thick<00:02:21.370> enough<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.090> I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
really nice it's thick enough that I I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.350 
really nice it's thick enough that I I
could<00:02:22.720> do<00:02:22.900> my<00:02:23.140> wing<00:02:23.680> really<00:02:24.160> nicely<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.970> it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
could do my wing really nicely and it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.870 
could do my wing really nicely and it
kind<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.080> kind<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.860> size<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
one is really good this one I'll tell us

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.610 
one is really good this one I'll tell us
you<00:02:45.880> don't<00:02:45.970> wing<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.540> outside<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.320> won't

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
you don't wing it outside it won't

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.280 
you don't wing it outside it won't
smudge<00:02:47.770> like<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.760> know<00:02:48.880> because<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:50.050> wing

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
smudge like you know because the wing

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.670 
smudge like you know because the wing
that<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.190> create<00:02:51.550> outside<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.540> one<00:02:53.440> that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
that you create outside is the one that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.780 
that you create outside is the one that
is<00:02:53.739> prone<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.190> smudging<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.989> C

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
is prone to smudging and the one in C

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.170 
is prone to smudging and the one in C
see<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.660> actually<00:03:01.870> smudges<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:04.000> can

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
see that it actually smudges you can

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.559 
see that it actually smudges you can
already<00:03:04.450> see<00:03:05.050> this<00:03:05.260> much<00:03:05.560> right<00:03:05.890> here

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.160 

so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.100 

I<00:03:13.260> do<00:03:13.770> not<00:03:14.099> know<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.700> don't<00:03:15.060> really<00:03:15.510> recommend

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
I do not know I don't really recommend

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.580
