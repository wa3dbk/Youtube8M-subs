the<00:01:09.259> way<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.619> top<00:01:09.829> and<00:01:11.530> check<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.770> pitch

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
the way to the top and check the pitch

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.899 
the way to the top and check the pitch
again<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.350> issued<00:01:15.350> weight<00:01:15.619> around<00:01:15.920> 7<00:01:16.609> degrees

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
again and issued weight around 7 degrees

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.279 
again and issued weight around 7 degrees
+<00:01:17.749> 7<00:01:18.229> degrees<00:01:18.499> so<00:01:19.569> now<00:01:20.569> right<00:01:20.749> now<00:01:20.929> because

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
+ 7 degrees so now right now because

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.679 
+ 7 degrees so now right now because
this<00:01:21.439> presets<00:01:22.189> already<00:01:22.369> knows<00:01:22.759> pretty<00:01:23.569> much

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
this presets already knows pretty much

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.129 
this presets already knows pretty much
at<00:01:23.899> 7<00:01:24.200> degrees<00:01:24.520> okay<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.759> then<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.139> the

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:27.139 
at 7 degrees okay and then just the

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:28.629 
at 7 degrees okay and then just the
final<00:01:27.439> check<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.799> moved<00:01:28.039> to<00:01:28.159> stick<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
final check is moved to stick to the

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:33.760 
final check is moved to stick to the
middle<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.670> right<00:01:32.600> now<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:32.779> peach<00:01:33.139> the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
middle and right now the peach the

middle and right now the peach the
picture<00:01:34.069> of<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.219> angle<00:01:34.549> should<00:01:34.729> be<00:01:34.909> around<00:01:35.209> 2

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
picture of the angle should be around 2

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.749 
picture of the angle should be around 2
to<00:01:35.929> 3<00:01:36.170> degrees<00:01:36.319> which<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:36.829> your<00:01:37.279> half<00:01:37.549> the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
to 3 degrees which is your half the

to 3 degrees which is your half the
patient<00:01:38.149> right<00:01:38.270> now

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770
