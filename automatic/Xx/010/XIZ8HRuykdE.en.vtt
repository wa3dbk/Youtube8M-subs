00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
sounds that really take it an entirely

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.750 
sounds that really take it an entirely
different<00:01:40.570> direction<00:01:41.050> so<00:01:41.770> when<00:01:42.370> we<00:01:42.490> start

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
different direction so when we start

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.100 
different direction so when we start
combining

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.890

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
it really goes to places that most

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.180 
it really goes to places that most
digital<00:01:50.630> pianos<00:01:51.020> do<00:01:51.260> not<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.860> highlight<00:01:52.160> of
