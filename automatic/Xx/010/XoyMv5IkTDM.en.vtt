 the resident evil or break is a game released for ps2 exclusively for this 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.140
 console and the first resident evil in playing are omitted 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.550
 the game conforms to scenarios that are 5 4 in principles that relate the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.280
 history of the destruction of raccoon city but from the points of view of 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.420
 eight characters a policeman a waitress a reporter a student a guard 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.760
 security a plumber a doctor and a meter worker 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.190
 come we weigh history 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 main shows the destruction of raccoon city from the point of view of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.829
 the eight characters each takes place in the streets of Raccoon City 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.969
 underground laboratories at the end of the game shows the destruction of 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.390
 raccoon city 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.360
 Now graphics are 3d scenarios with a good graphic finish both in detail 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.830
 how light effects 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.060
 hua and movement the characters enjoy a more than good detail as well as their 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.910
 animations 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.900
 the enemies also have to stand out the biker that really impresses their 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.100
 level of detail the light effected by the shots is sublime pretty good 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.400
 as well as the video sequences 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.800
 the zombies are not cloned together they are different depending on the scenario and the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.440
 where you found them 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.610
 the scenarios are great and to finish the game does not suffer 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120
 slowdown is in no time 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.799
 Now keep playing and lida 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.609
 the game is made up of five stages 4 in principle the streets of raccoon 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.579
 city ​​called epidemic the laboratories of umbrella called subzero the 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.340
 raccoon city hospital called 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.700
 the hive the hotel on foot inflamed 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.050
 hell and finally the raccoon city university called 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.230
 the moment of truth the gameplay is classic but with notable improvements 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.160
 example to free us from a zombie sa and to do a combination of buttons 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.440
 to get rid of it quickly every character will have a skill and 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.670
 Special attack that activates with r1 plus circle 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 as well as unique items for each person, four 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.330
 objects in the inventory except for the student who has a bag that 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.580
 It allows to carry eight objects 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.009
 also each one has its parameters speed vitality strength 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.779
 a new element is the infection bar that increases over time 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.729
 increases with time and enemy attacks in addition to using body weapons 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.029
 to body like tubes or sticks in addition to new items like pills and weapons 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.279
 new 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.860
 now follow realism 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.940
 the game enjoys a good realism example if the character is in danger 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.530
 and receives too much damage will fall invalid to the floor and does not rise up 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.610
 that another character comes to help you, and when you are in danger you have 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.380
 a hemorrhage the express character is there when I say press that expresses 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.810
 easy for zombies since it is very slow and some can not even 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.890
 fight melee you can combine objects like a tube with a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.469
 battery and a series of cables to form an electric baton 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.539
 you can help a friend who is badly hurt and we can get in the way of 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.609
 the doors to prevent the zombies in train as they hit the character 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.650
 can hide in lockers and under furniture to evade zombies 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.819
 now music the musical themes are pretty good and so according to the 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.629
 situation highlighted two of them the intro and the final boss of the hour 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.559
 of the truth 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.679
 they are well defined 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:19.520
 control 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.050
 is the classic control of the saga with notable improvements with r1 plus x for 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.370
 shoot r1 more circle for a special action 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.569
 triangle to see the map or communicate with colleagues and the 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.670
 right lever to give orders how to help me follow me let's go and wait 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.139
 artificial intelligence 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.790
 It is very good that of the enemies 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.290
 but the one of the companions leaves much to be desired in what the management of 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.299
 weapons referred to me once I gave a mp4 to my partner and when I look at a 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.650
 zombie emptied the charger to the zombie 40 bullets to kill a zombie that owed 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.989
 have died at three or four bullets 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.009
 but they respond well in helping you whenever they help me they are 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.929
 there 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:02.439
 well the story is interesting but it is too much used the gameplay klien a 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.859
 number of incredible improvements the controls are the classic the sound and 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.199
 the music is fine and the artificial intelligence equal its classification is 9 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.239
 5 out of 10 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.739
 now let's go with the second this game I will not analyze it basically this is like 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.639
 an expansion of the first with five more scenarios to make the total 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.659
 10 you have the same characters plus the extras that we will have to buy them in the 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:26.169
 store 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.379
 the music highlights those of the 'beginning and end' there are some new enemies and now 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.330
 the characters can shoot while they move which makes it even better 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.490
 control the scenarios are the raccoon city zoo an abandoned hospital 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.599
 in the forest the subway station the police station and the facilities of 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:43.809
 umbrella 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.379
 xuclá dif and song in view that it has almost everything of the first with 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.219
 some improvements is 9 8 out of 10 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.389
 Well I hope you liked the video a greeting ee
