believe<00:01:51.030> me<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> difference<00:01:51.570> between<00:01:51.630> 30<00:01:52.439> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
believe me the difference between 30 and

believe me the difference between 30 and
60<00:01:52.890> frames<00:01:53.159> per<00:01:53.369> second<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.820> huge<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.720> I'll<00:01:55.500> be

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
60 frames per second is huge and I'll be

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
60 frames per second is huge and I'll be
recording<00:01:55.829> some<00:01:56.219> fast<00:01:56.460> moving<00:01:56.670> objects<00:01:57.149> with

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
recording some fast moving objects with

recording some fast moving objects with
that<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.229> let's<00:01:58.259> get<00:01:58.829> into<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.070> sample

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
that so let's get into some sample

that so let's get into some sample
pictures<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.189> enough<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> video<00:02:02.850> you

cording so we're gonna do is actually

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.920

take<00:03:28.199> a<00:03:29.480> picture<00:03:31.879> with<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.150> light<00:03:33.629> streak

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.599 
take a picture with the light streak
effect<00:03:34.260> which<00:03:34.889> I'll<00:03:35.129> leave<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> shutter

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609

speed at a slow setting I believe the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.860 
speed at a slow setting I believe the
shutter<00:03:38.310> speed<00:03:38.549> will<00:03:38.669> be<00:03:38.760> open<00:03:39.120> for<00:03:39.329> about<00:03:39.569> 3

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.890 
or higher when you upload it on YouTube
it'll<00:04:20.530> play<00:04:21.430> back<00:04:21.730> at<00:04:21.910> 30<00:04:22.120> frames<00:04:22.330> per<00:04:22.420> second

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
it'll play back at 30 frames per second

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.480 
it'll play back at 30 frames per second
it's<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:23.080> limitation<00:04:23.410> of<00:04:23.620> YouTube<00:04:23.920> it<00:04:24.010> caps<00:04:24.280> at

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
it's a limitation of YouTube it caps at

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.590 
it's a limitation of YouTube it caps at
30<00:04:24.670> frames<00:04:24.820> per<00:04:24.970> second<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:27.390> basically<00:04:28.390> you

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
30 frames per second so basically you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.240 
30 frames per second so basically you
won't<00:04:28.690> see<00:04:28.990> what<00:04:29.230> exactly<00:04:29.530> I'm<00:04:29.800> talking<00:04:30.070> about

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
won't see what exactly I'm talking about

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.590 
won't see what exactly I'm talking about
for<00:04:30.490> those<00:04:30.610> of<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:30.880> who<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.390> have

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
for those of you who that have

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.410 
for those of you who that have
downloaded<00:04:31.990> this<00:04:32.170> clip<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.790> you<00:04:34.120> watch<00:04:34.300> on

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
downloaded this clip and you watch on

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.880 
downloaded this clip and you watch on
your<00:04:34.540> computer<00:04:34.600> you'll<00:04:35.170> notice<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.560> when

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
your computer you'll notice that when

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.550 
your computer you'll notice that when
I'm<00:04:36.010> spinning<00:04:36.460> around<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:37.810> looks<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.110> bit<00:04:38.140> too

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
I'm spinning around it looks a bit too

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.510 
I'm spinning around it looks a bit too
smooth<00:04:39.180> like<00:04:40.920> it's<00:04:41.920> kind<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.160> being<00:04:42.310> fast

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
smooth like it's kind of being fast

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.390 
smooth like it's kind of being fast
forward<00:04:42.940> slightly<00:04:43.300> and<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.890> reason<00:04:45.190> for<00:04:45.220> that

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
forward slightly and the reason for that

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.190 
forward slightly and the reason for that
is<00:04:45.580> because<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.300> human<00:04:46.600> eye<00:04:46.660> is<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:46.900> used<00:04:47.110> to

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
is because the human eye is not used to

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.110 
is because the human eye is not used to
seeing<00:04:47.470> 60<00:04:47.830> frames<00:04:48.010> per<00:04:48.100> second<00:04:48.580> at<00:04:48.700> least<00:04:48.760> on

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
seeing 60 frames per second at least on

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.080 
seeing 60 frames per second at least on
a<00:04:49.150> screen<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.950> technology<00:04:51.520> is<00:04:51.580> really<00:04:51.910> old

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
a screen the technology is really old

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.820 
a screen the technology is really old
it's<00:04:52.330> been<00:04:52.450> off<00:04:52.570> for<00:04:52.750> decades<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.320> decades

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
it's been off for decades and decades

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.100 
it's been off for decades and decades
it's<00:04:54.310> just<00:04:54.550> Hollywood<00:04:55.030> hasn't<00:04:55.240> adapted<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.960> it

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
it's just Hollywood hasn't adapted to it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.890 
it's just Hollywood hasn't adapted to it
they<00:04:56.260> haven't<00:04:56.500> adopted<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:57.010> too<00:04:57.160> much<00:04:57.310> because

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
they haven't adopted it too much because

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.930 
they haven't adopted it too much because
audiences<00:04:59.130> decades<00:05:00.130> ago<00:05:00.340> just<00:05:00.610> didn't<00:05:00.820> like

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
audiences decades ago just didn't like

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.430 
audiences decades ago just didn't like
it<00:05:01.060> they<00:05:01.150> thought<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.390> was<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.510> bit<00:05:01.660> too<00:05:01.990> smooth

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
it they thought it was a bit too smooth

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.570 
it they thought it was a bit too smooth
for<00:05:02.470> their<00:05:02.860> eye<00:05:02.890> and<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:06.040> prove<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.310> this

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
for their eye and to prove that this

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.370 
for their eye and to prove that this
clip<00:05:06.850> is<00:05:07.000> not<00:05:07.120> actually<00:05:07.480> fast<00:05:07.690> forwarded<00:05:08.230> if

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
clip is not actually fast forwarded if

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.560 
clip is not actually fast forwarded if
you<00:05:08.470> downloaded<00:05:09.040> this<00:05:09.250> file<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.790> not

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
you downloaded this file and not

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.840 
you downloaded this file and not
watching<00:05:10.750> on<00:05:10.900> YouTube<00:05:11.230> is<00:05:11.380> that<00:05:11.610> you'll<00:05:12.610> see

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
watching on YouTube is that you'll see

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.600 
watching on YouTube is that you'll see
from<00:05:13.150> my<00:05:13.450> lips<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:14.500> audio<00:05:14.920> is<00:05:14.980> not<00:05:15.130> at<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.310> sync

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
from my lips the audio is not at a sync

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.920 
from my lips the audio is not at a sync
so<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.450> clip<00:05:16.780> is<00:05:16.930> not<00:05:17.020> fast<00:05:17.320> forwarded<00:05:17.680> at<00:05:17.920> all

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
so the clip is not fast forwarded at all

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.800 
so the clip is not fast forwarded at all
so<00:05:20.760> this<00:05:21.760> is<00:05:21.880> what<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:22.090> looks<00:05:22.240> like<00:05:22.420> this<00:05:22.690> is

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
so this is what it looks like this is

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.410 
so this is what it looks like this is
the<00:05:23.430> full<00:05:24.430> potential<00:05:24.820> of<00:05:24.910> 60<00:05:25.150> frames<00:05:25.330> per

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
the full potential of 60 frames per

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.570 
the full potential of 60 frames per
second<00:05:25.930> you're<00:05:26.890> just<00:05:27.040> getting<00:05:27.280> everything<00:05:27.520> a

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
second you're just getting everything a

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.870 
second you're just getting everything a
lot<00:05:27.730> smoother<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:29.250> odd<00:05:30.250> thing<00:05:30.520> is<00:05:30.610> if<00:05:30.820> you

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
lot smoother and the odd thing is if you

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.070 
lot smoother and the odd thing is if you
try<00:05:31.030> playing<00:05:31.330> this<00:05:31.480> with<00:05:31.660> an<00:05:31.780> advanced

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
try playing this with an advanced

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.120 
try playing this with an advanced
program<00:05:32.650> like<00:05:32.860> VLC<00:05:33.190> player<00:05:33.520> on<00:05:33.790> your<00:05:33.910> computer

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
program like VLC player on your computer

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.950 
program like VLC player on your computer
for<00:05:36.130> some<00:05:36.280> reason<00:05:36.520> VLC<00:05:36.910> player<00:05:37.060> caps<00:05:37.570> off<00:05:37.780> at

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
for some reason VLC player caps off at

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.930 
for some reason VLC player caps off at
30<00:05:38.200> frames<00:05:38.470> per<00:05:38.560> second<00:05:39.010> as<00:05:39.100> well<00:05:39.220> oddly

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
30 frames per second as well oddly

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.810 
30 frames per second as well oddly
enough<00:05:40.150> Windows<00:05:40.780> Media<00:05:40.960> Player<00:05:41.610> plays<00:05:42.610> it

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
enough Windows Media Player plays it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.330 
enough Windows Media Player plays it
just<00:05:43.030> fine<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.600> plays<00:05:44.290> back<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.500> full<00:05:45.010> 60

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
just fine it plays back the full 60

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.700 
just fine it plays back the full 60
frames<00:05:45.550> per<00:05:45.640> second<00:05:46.210> which<00:05:46.960> I<00:05:47.170> find<00:05:47.470> really

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
frames per second which I find really

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.430 
frames per second which I find really
hard<00:05:48.040> because<00:05:48.660> Windows<00:05:49.660> Media<00:05:49.810> Player<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:50.290> the

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
hard because Windows Media Player is the

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.090 
hard because Windows Media Player is the
most<00:05:50.620> basic<00:05:50.920> of<00:05:51.340> media<00:05:51.760> players<00:05:52.000> available<00:05:53.100> so

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
most basic of media players available so

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.190 
most basic of media players available so
it's<00:05:54.250> an<00:05:54.310> mts<00:05:54.640> file<00:05:54.940> type<00:05:55.270> Windows<00:05:56.050> Media

it's an mts file type Windows Media

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.510 
it's an mts file type Windows Media
Player<00:05:56.320> should<00:05:56.650> be<00:05:56.740> able<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:56.890> run<00:05:57.070> it<00:05:57.250> if<00:05:57.340> not

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
Player should be able to run it if not

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.360 
Player should be able to run it if not
find<00:05:57.850> a<00:05:57.940> Korac<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.990> play<00:05:59.200> mts<00:05:59.650> files<00:05:59.950> on

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
Windows Media Player and it should work

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.429 
Windows Media Player and it should work
just<00:06:02.230> fine

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:06.439 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:11.360 

and<00:06:09.199> it<00:06:10.199> was<00:06:10.349> someone<00:06:10.590> walking<00:06:10.800> by<00:06:11.069> here

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
and it was someone walking by here

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.709 
and it was someone walking by here
looking<00:06:11.669> at<00:06:11.909> me<00:06:12.060> thought<00:06:12.240> I'm<00:06:12.330> talking<00:06:12.629> to

looking at me thought I'm talking to

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:14.719 
looking at me thought I'm talking to

watching<00:06:28.860> this<00:06:29.099> for<00:06:29.250> the<00:06:29.340> first<00:06:29.490> time<00:06:29.759> you

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:29.939 
watching this for the first time you

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.429 
watching this for the first time you
probably<00:06:30.090> think<00:06:30.330> 60<00:06:30.599> frames<00:06:30.810> per<00:06:30.870> second<00:06:31.349> when

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:31.439 
probably think 60 frames per second when

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.770 
probably think 60 frames per second when
I<00:06:31.469> turn<00:06:31.770> around<00:06:31.800> it's<00:06:32.580> too<00:06:32.939> smooth<00:06:33.360> like<00:06:33.659> I

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
I turn around it's too smooth like I

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.020 
I turn around it's too smooth like I
said<00:06:33.990> it's<00:06:34.139> going<00:06:34.409> fast<00:06:34.800> forward<00:06:35.159> mode<00:06:35.280> if<00:06:35.940> you

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
said it's going fast forward mode if you

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.689 
said it's going fast forward mode if you
piss<00:06:36.360> exact<00:06:36.810> clip<00:06:37.050> back<00:06:37.289> on<00:06:37.469> YouTube<00:06:37.919> after

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
piss exact clip back on YouTube after

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:40.550 
piss exact clip back on YouTube after
watching<00:06:38.849> the<00:06:39.090> 60<00:06:39.389> frames<00:06:39.599> per<00:06:39.690> second<00:06:40.229> the

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
watching the 60 frames per second the

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.830 
watching the 60 frames per second the
file<00:06:40.860> you'll<00:06:41.610> see<00:06:41.789> that<00:06:41.909> the<00:06:42.030> YouTube<00:06:42.419> version

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
file you'll see that the YouTube version

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.300 
file you'll see that the YouTube version
which<00:06:42.990> is<00:06:43.110> 30<00:06:43.349> frames<00:06:43.500> per<00:06:43.800> second<00:06:44.159> is

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
which is 30 frames per second is

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.010 
which is 30 frames per second is
actually<00:06:44.639> lagging<00:06:45.090> like<00:06:45.330> it's<00:06:45.509> too<00:06:45.659> slow

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
actually lagging like it's too slow

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.020 
actually lagging like it's too slow
that's<00:06:46.770> because<00:06:47.069> your<00:06:47.219> brain<00:06:47.639> has<00:06:47.940> already
