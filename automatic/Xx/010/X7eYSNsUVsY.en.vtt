00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.440 
country with with people here in New
York

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.120 

where<00:04:19.110> I<00:04:19.190> initially<00:04:20.190> came<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.610> Gardens<00:04:22.130> was

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
where I initially came to Gardens was

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.330 
where I initially came to Gardens was
from<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.490> environmental<00:04:24.090> point<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.360> view<00:04:24.420> and

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
from the environmental point of view and

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.830 
from the environmental point of view and
I<00:04:26.340> just<00:04:26.880> thought<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.150> was<00:04:27.210> such<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.480> positive

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
I just thought it was such a positive

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.510 
I just thought it was such a positive
example<00:04:28.260> of<00:04:28.890> what<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:30.440> very<00:04:31.440> small<00:04:32.100> number<00:04:32.160> of

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
example of what a very small number of

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.350 
example of what a very small number of
people<00:04:32.610> can<00:04:33.180> do<00:04:33.540> on<00:04:33.780> such<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> large<00:04:34.410> scale<00:04:34.590> and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
people can do on such a large scale and

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.710 
people can do on such a large scale and
I<00:04:36.360> thought<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.870> was<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.020> really<00:04:37.400> lovely<00:04:38.720> way

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
I thought that was a really lovely way

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.320 
I thought that was a really lovely way
to<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:40.320> look<00:04:40.470> at<00:04:40.650> man's<00:04:40.890> impact<00:04:41.700> on<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.970> planet
