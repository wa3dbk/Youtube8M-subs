00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.280 
there has got to be a small lip here
which<00:03:17.640> means<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.000> isn't<00:03:18.120> completely<00:03:18.750> flush

which means it isn't completely flush
but<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:19.980> not<00:03:20.100> much<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.700> payoff<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.120> any

party check is this seat here which

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.949 
party check is this seat here which
cantilevers<00:03:29.580> with<00:03:29.610> its<00:03:29.790> backrest<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.870> in

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
cantilevers with its backrest so that in

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.810 
cantilevers with its backrest so that in
this<00:03:31.020> position<00:03:31.230> we<00:03:31.530> can<00:03:31.739> sit<00:03:32.400> back<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:32.730> look

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
this position we can sit back and look

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.699 
this position we can sit back and look
out<00:03:33.000> over<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.300> water<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.290> entire

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
out over the water but this entire

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.710 
out over the water but this entire
little<00:03:35.130> unit<00:03:35.430> here<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:35.730> mount<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.239> sail<00:03:36.480> rail

so<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.560> swap<00:03:38.340> slides<00:03:38.760> all<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.150> way<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.300> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
so this swap slides all the way to the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.880 
so this swap slides all the way to the
front<00:03:39.690> where<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.020> can<00:03:40.140> either<00:03:40.230> become<00:03:40.650> part<00:03:40.860> of

donut or but the backrest this way and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.120 
donut or but the backrest this way and
you<00:03:44.070> have<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> fully<00:03:44.640> facing<00:03:45.090> navigators<00:03:45.600> seat

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
you have a fully facing navigators seat
