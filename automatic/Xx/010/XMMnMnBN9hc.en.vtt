00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:12.990
 fortunately not well you either 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:25.890
 wish you a fantastic new year 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:36.360
 happy new year oh thank you 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:39.090
 happy new year oh my god be on 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 that just an attack viewers but I want 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.780
 yours of course also a happy one 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.000
 I wish you a whole new year 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.770
 had fun years and that you do 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.289
 have been careful with fireworks 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.899
 because we are testing I would say do one 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.640
 thumbs up if you still have it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.640
 we are going to start after the intro is over 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.640
 highest 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.740
 if you could cover the crop here, by the way 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.480
 a fantastic chic thank you for 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.810
 all my jogging pants are not allowed 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.240
 ok it's the beginning of the year and then 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.180
 very many people have good intentions 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.540
 but almost as many people fail 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.910
 to adhere to it and to you 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.550
 little bit on the way, I now have two 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.530
 tips that helped me a lot 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.690
 First of all it doesn't matter what you do 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.880
 good intention is but if you want something 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
 change yourself then you have to 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.810
 only do it because you don't want to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.850
 because others don't want you to 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.340
 than in a better light with others 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.710
 side but just because you 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.570
 yes you prefer to feel better than yourself 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.760
 because very often good intentions become 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.680
 based on your uncertainty 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.780
 You are very unsure about what he thinks 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.010
 I will change that this year 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.990
 but if you remain yourself 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.390
 do you compare to others 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.180
 always find someone in your eyes 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.000
 is better at something than you are 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.060
 sportier is better is better figures 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 makes it more popular but at the end 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.239
 of the day no one is that good 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.520
 in being you if you are like that and if you are 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.730
 really want to change something themselves 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.230
 just start now see this video as 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.320
 it was like starting school and that is 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.120
 maybe one but whatever your goal is or 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.590
 it is now large or maybe just me 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.300
 very small 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.640
 I'm sure if you do in a year 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.780
 look back you are very happy that you 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.510
 started today 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.600
 so just start today or even better 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.550
 now start something completely different 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.670
 I usually place a call 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.320
 when it's almost my birthday you say me 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.150
 am a mine hunter you can meet each other 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.970
 will open in the video and that is 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.970
 nice but last year i got this 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.280
 deliberately not done because I wanted you 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.800
 tickets actually don't save for that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.739
 myself but for someone I think 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.400
 that she really deserves it 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.829
 Grandma Miep's birthday is on 3 February 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.739
 it's not just a birthday she 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.599
 namely 80 years and I want grandma that day 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.269
 miep is very happy to be in the spotlight 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.989
 so she will never forget that thought 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.540
 how can I do that 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.260
 well grandma miep is really crazy about cards with 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.939
 Christmas 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.409
 she always makes the same cards as well 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.780
 spider mite is just super fun to have 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.489
 to send a card but probably 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.780
 even better to get one 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.120
 i would like to walk on one 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.280
 want to give unforgettable day with 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.629
 you tickets so if you have something 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.420
 especially not her 80th birthday 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.769
 want to send it can to this address 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.989
 also once in the description 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.659
 and then do that for 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.159
 January 29th on that day I am going to the 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.379
 pick up tickets so you can just do it 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.629
 now if last if only for the 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.189
 29th is it might be one for you 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.260
 small effort to send a card 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.549
 for which not all is very bad 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.709
 very special i know for sure 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.720
 and I just want to be whole that way 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.510
 thank you very much for that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.030
 yeah that grandma squeak is that she is always like that 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.609
 great and they set an example for that 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.109
 me is that later i hope i will 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.989
 something of the character of monique de 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.970
 positivity may have as I later 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.470
 the word and then I naturally go one 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.329
 make video about 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.620
 I really sit there and then 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.090
 one more thing 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.280
 I recently had a weird package of mine 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.229
 mailbox it was just packed and 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.760
 paper only my name no off 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.940
 will not include a letter 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.820
 I unpacked it and it was this 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.530
 and what is this i thought i hope first 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.020
 maybe it's an iphone standard 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.340
 but that doesn't fit for some sort 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.770
 cutting board 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.360
 but no, that seems a bit strange to me 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.849
 so it started to look a bit better and yes 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.250
 here you have those weird hinges 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.220
 but there is something wrong joop jopie 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.270
 salt so well but that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.490
 is not possible because there is another one 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.090
 pen in so I think so what 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.400
 is this 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.400
 I want to know if there is something in it or something 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.390
 you just cut out on 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.180
 I can of course go stalking too 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.850
 but that would be a shame i think it 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.950
 open in one way or another so if 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.900
 Do you know how to make things too 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.000
 please know in the 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.380
 responses I'm so curious what's in here 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.970
 sit 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.140
 if there is something in it and why do you send it 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.450
 appreciates 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.290
 according to available simple message or 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.940

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.400

 I just want to know what 's in it 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.570
 but that also means that 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.820
 you can leave new questions 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.760
