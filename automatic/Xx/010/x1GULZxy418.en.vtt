00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
there's a lot of attempts to make

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.509 
respected you'll have like a bike lane
that<00:00:44.720> goes<00:00:44.899> for<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> street<00:00:45.769> and<00:00:45.890> then<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.250> next

for<00:00:52.760> bicycles<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.719> continuity<00:00:54.440> doesn't

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
for bicycles the continuity doesn't

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.819 
for bicycles the continuity doesn't
really<00:00:54.920> add<00:00:55.160> up<00:00:55.370> here

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.920 

so<00:01:00.430> what<00:01:00.550> ends<00:01:00.730> up<00:01:00.850> happening<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.600> you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
so what ends up happening is you

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.960 
so what ends up happening is you
basically<00:01:02.620> just<00:01:02.950> share<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.489> road<00:01:03.640> with<00:01:03.670> the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
basically just share the road with the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.520 
basically just share the road with the
drivers<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.540> it's<00:01:04.839> totally<00:01:05.019> cool<00:01:05.199> the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
drivers and it's totally cool the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.200 
drivers and it's totally cool the
drivers<00:01:05.890> are<00:01:06.070> really<00:01:06.400> good<00:01:06.550> about<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.820> they're

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
drivers are really good about it they're

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.510 
drivers are really good about it they're
they<00:01:07.540> watch<00:01:07.720> out<00:01:07.930> for<00:01:08.110> bicyclists<00:01:08.650> cars<00:01:09.340> have

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
they watch out for bicyclists cars have

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.859 
they watch out for bicyclists cars have
to<00:01:09.640> watch<00:01:09.790> out<00:01:09.970> for<00:01:10.000> bicyclists<00:01:10.630> and

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
to watch out for bicyclists and

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:11.910 
to watch out for bicyclists and
bicyclists<00:01:11.380> have<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.590> watch<00:01:11.740> out<00:01:11.890> for

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
bicyclists have to watch out for

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.380 
bicyclists have to watch out for
pedestrians<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:13.450> are<00:01:13.960> all<00:01:15.390> illegally

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
pedestrians these are all illegally

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.899 
pedestrians these are all illegally
parked<00:01:16.750> bikes<00:01:17.220> parking<00:01:18.220> your<00:01:18.310> bike<00:01:18.369> anywhere

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
parked bikes parking your bike anywhere

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.210 
parked bikes parking your bike anywhere
on<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.509> street<00:01:19.840> in<00:01:20.020> an<00:01:20.200> unmarked<00:01:20.890> place

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
on it on the street in an unmarked place

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.880 
on it on the street in an unmarked place
is<00:01:21.550> considered<00:01:22.210> illegal<00:01:22.780> bike<00:01:23.229> parking

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
is considered illegal bike parking

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.899 
is considered illegal bike parking
probably<00:01:24.520> because<00:01:24.700> Tokyo<00:01:25.270> is<00:01:25.450> so<00:01:25.930> crowded<00:01:26.229> or

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
probably because Tokyo is so crowded or

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.060 
probably because Tokyo is so crowded or
maybe<00:01:27.909> just<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.560> institute<00:01:29.560> some<00:01:29.770> kind<00:01:29.979> of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
maybe just to institute some kind of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.010 
maybe just to institute some kind of
infrastructure<00:01:30.700> this<00:01:31.270> behind<00:01:31.630> me<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:31.810> what

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
infrastructure this behind me is what

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.779 
infrastructure this behind me is what
dedicated<00:01:32.649> bike<00:01:32.830> parking<00:01:33.220> looks<00:01:33.430> like<00:01:33.610> and

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
dedicated bike parking looks like and

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.190 
dedicated bike parking looks like and
unfortunately<00:01:34.330> there<00:01:34.570> dis<00:01:34.720> aren't<00:01:34.990> enough

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
unfortunately there dis aren't enough

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.320 
unfortunately there dis aren't enough
around<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.160> city<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.670> end<00:01:36.820> up<00:01:36.880> with<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.090> lot

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
around the city so you end up with a lot

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.260 
around the city so you end up with a lot
of<00:01:37.360> illegally<00:01:38.020> parked<00:01:38.289> bicycles<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.970> nearest

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
of illegally parked bicycles the nearest

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.389 
of illegally parked bicycles the nearest
one<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.539> my<00:01:40.810> apartment<00:01:41.380> for<00:01:41.649> example<00:01:42.160> that<00:01:42.310> I

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
one to my apartment for example that I

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.400 
one to my apartment for example that I
can<00:01:42.580> think<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.270> one<00:01:43.539> and<00:01:43.810> it's<00:01:44.050> about

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
can think of is this one and it's about

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.639 
can think of is this one and it's about
15<00:01:44.979> minutes<00:01:45.310> away<00:01:45.460> by<00:01:45.789> foot<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:47.170> comparison

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
15 minutes away by foot so in comparison

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.830 
15 minutes away by foot so in comparison
to<00:01:47.950> Chicago<00:01:48.429> I<00:01:48.580> would<00:01:48.729> say<00:01:48.910> there<00:01:49.149> are<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.360> lot

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
to Chicago I would say there are a lot

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.139 
to Chicago I would say there are a lot
of<00:01:49.869> bicyclists<00:01:50.679> here<00:01:51.070> it's<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:52.030> very

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
of bicyclists here it's a very

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.999 
of bicyclists here it's a very
convenient<00:01:52.899> way<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.170> get<00:01:53.410> around<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:53.830> city

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
convenient way to get around the city

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.850 
convenient way to get around the city
because<00:01:54.750> cars<00:01:55.750> are<00:01:55.929> not<00:01:56.080> so<00:01:56.259> convenient<00:01:56.619> here

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
because cars are not so convenient here

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.469 
because cars are not so convenient here
and<00:01:57.009> expensive<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.909> you<00:01:58.179> have<00:01:58.330> the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
and expensive and you have the

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.029 
and expensive and you have the
transportation<00:01:59.170> system<00:01:59.470> but<00:01:59.500> if<00:01:59.679> you<00:01:59.770> want<00:01:59.950> to

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
transportation system but if you want to

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.350 
transportation system but if you want to
get<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> short<00:02:00.520> distance<00:02:00.700> bikes<00:02:01.119> are<00:02:01.330> really

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
get a short distance bikes are really

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.749 
get a short distance bikes are really
convenient<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.409> because<00:02:02.890> drivers<00:02:03.280> are<00:02:03.550> used

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
convenient and because drivers are used

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.940 
convenient and because drivers are used
to<00:02:03.940> bicyclists<00:02:04.539> here<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.959> don't<00:02:05.619> mind<00:02:05.830> the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
to bicyclists here I don't mind the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.190 
to bicyclists here I don't mind the
system<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.520> trust<00:02:06.940> drivers<00:02:07.209> I<00:02:07.599> trust<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.050> they

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
system I trust drivers I trust that they

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.139 
system I trust drivers I trust that they
won't<00:02:08.349> hit<00:02:08.590> me<00:02:08.739> no<00:02:09.099> one<00:02:09.280> really<00:02:09.489> drives<00:02:09.759> super

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
won't hit me no one really drives super
