00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.109 
and how easy it would be for little
fingers<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:16.680> pull<00:01:17.280> these<00:01:17.880> pieces<00:01:18.720> off<00:01:20.119> I'm

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
fingers to pull these pieces off I'm

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
fingers to pull these pieces off I'm
thinking<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.630> my<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.530> monkey<00:01:22.740> might

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
thinking that my little monkey might

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.850 
thinking that my little monkey might
figure<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.520> how<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.869> let<00:01:25.560> me<00:01:25.650> show

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860

unlatch those things at the top and open
this<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.939> slide<00:01:36.299> your<00:01:36.920> iPad<00:01:37.920> in

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the silicone case it's really not that

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.560 
the silicone case it's really not that
hard<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.490> takes<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.000> bit<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.210> time

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.300 

okay<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.630> now<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> silicon<00:01:58.740> park<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
okay so now it's in the silicon park and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.340 
okay so now it's in the silicon park and
then<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.450> put<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> over<00:02:01.829> top<00:02:03.350> make

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
then you just put this over top make

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.870 
then you just put this over top make
sure<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:05.009> fit<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.490> all<00:02:05.579> down<00:02:05.850> in

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
sure that's like fit it all down in

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.580 
sure that's like fit it all down in
there<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.329> press<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.990> there

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
there and press it in there

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.790 
there and press it in there
so<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.220> sort<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.459> locks<00:02:09.700> down<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.650> do

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
so it sort of locks down and then you do

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.850 
so it sort of locks down and then you do
these<00:02:11.920> locks<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.569> I<00:02:13.870> really<00:02:14.440> felt<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.739> I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
these locks so I I really felt that I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.350 
these locks so I I really felt that I
was<00:02:14.980> going<00:02:15.129> to<00:02:15.190> love<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.550> case<00:02:15.849> because<00:02:16.239> it

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360

I<00:02:26.140> thought<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.590> would<00:02:26.769> really<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.129> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
I thought that this would really do the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.759 
I thought that this would really do the
trick<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.549> protect<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.319> say<00:02:29.560> it's

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
trick to protect it I have to say it's

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.869 
trick to protect it I have to say it's
sort<00:02:30.129> of<00:02:30.190> annoying<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.819> me<00:02:30.849> because<00:02:31.720> um

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
sort of annoying to me because um

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.339 
sort of annoying to me because um
there's<00:02:33.879> just<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.360> like<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.629> little<00:02:35.019> bit<00:02:35.170> of

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
there's just this like a little bit of

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.280 
there's just this like a little bit of
an<00:02:35.440> air<00:02:35.650> pocket<00:02:36.120> that's<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.420> between<00:02:37.540> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
an air pocket that's in between the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.069 
an air pocket that's in between the
screen<00:02:38.650> protector<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.840> screen<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:41.049> the

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
screen protector and the screen of the

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.240 
screen protector and the screen of the
iPad<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.810> don't<00:02:43.989> really<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.680> now

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
iPad and I just don't really like it now

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.890 
iPad and I just don't really like it now
some<00:02:45.519> people<00:02:45.670> might<00:02:45.880> not<00:02:46.180> mind<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.660> at<00:02:46.780> all

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
some people might not mind that at all

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.690 
some people might not mind that at all
and<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.340> keeps<00:02:48.489> it

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and really just like that it keeps it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.930 
and really just like that it keeps it
clean<00:02:48.940> but<00:02:49.750> um<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.349> don't<00:02:51.069> know<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.549> like<00:02:51.700> takes

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
clean but um I don't know it like takes

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.699 
clean but um I don't know it like takes
away<00:02:52.030> from<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> sleekness<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.989> being<00:02:53.410> able<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
away from the sleekness of being able to

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.550 
away from the sleekness of being able to
just<00:02:53.769> touch<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> screen<00:02:54.549> I<00:02:54.670> think<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:56.290> can

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
just touch the screen I think and it can

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.720 
just touch the screen I think and it can
interfere<00:02:56.920> with<00:02:57.190> some<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:59.280> games<00:03:00.280> and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
interfere with some of the games and

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.580 
interfere with some of the games and
apps<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.450> things<00:03:01.569> like<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.230> play

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
apps and things like that that you play

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.069 
apps and things like that that you play
because<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.989> game<00:03:05.260> might<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.849> detect

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
because that the game might not detect

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.920 
because that the game might not detect
like<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.290> cars<00:03:08.590> disney<00:03:09.370> at<00:03:09.670> mates<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.269> don't<00:03:10.569> it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
like the cars disney at mates I don't it

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.660 
like the cars disney at mates I don't it
might<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.590> know<00:03:11.709> interfere<00:03:12.129> with<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.370> some

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
might you know interfere with that some

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.160 
might you know interfere with that some
with<00:03:12.970> having<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.329> screen<00:03:13.540> protector<00:03:13.900> I'm<00:03:14.019> not

with having the screen protector I'm not
really<00:03:14.319> sure<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> back<00:03:16.870> looks<00:03:17.170> great<00:03:17.500> i

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
really sure but the back looks great i

this two-tone design the hinges on top

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.460 
this two-tone design the hinges on top
might<00:03:25.209> be<00:03:25.239> a<00:03:25.420> little<00:03:25.569> bit<00:03:25.750> inviting<00:03:26.200> for

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
might be a little bit inviting for

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.050 
might be a little bit inviting for
little<00:03:26.680> fingers<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.190> play<00:03:27.340> with<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:27.940> to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
little fingers to play with and to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.300 
little fingers to play with and to
unlock<00:03:29.099> and<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.139> ecto<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:33.130> would

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
protection on the ipad but once a more

protection on the ipad but once a more
mature<00:03:39.849> looking<00:03:40.299> case<00:03:41.340> rather<00:03:42.340> than

mature looking case rather than

mature looking case rather than
something<00:03:42.849> that's<00:03:43.030> going<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.329> scream<00:03:43.919> you

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
something that's going to scream you

something that's going to scream you
know<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.280> for<00:03:45.579> kids<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:46.780> fifty<00:03:47.260> dollars

know this is for kids it's fifty dollars
from<00:03:48.040> trident<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.660> get<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.989> little

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
from trident and you can get it a little

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.780 
from trident and you can get it a little
bit<00:03:50.319> cheaper<00:03:50.650> i<00:03:50.709> think<00:03:50.919> on<00:03:51.040> amazon<00:03:51.519> if<00:03:51.700> you

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
bit cheaper i think on amazon if you

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.220 
bit cheaper i think on amazon if you
look<00:03:52.000> for<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.329> sometimes<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.840> different

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
look for it and sometimes the different

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.970 
look for it and sometimes the different
colors<00:03:53.530> go<00:03:53.769> on<00:03:53.889> different<00:03:54.220> prices<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.530> is

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
colors go on different prices but it is

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.250 
colors go on different prices but it is
it<00:03:57.579> adds<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:57.940> lot<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.299> weight<00:03:58.419> it's<00:03:58.720> probably

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
it adds a lot of weight it's probably

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.990 
it adds a lot of weight it's probably
the<00:04:00.040> heaviest<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.419> cases<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.859> if<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.790> want

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
the heaviest of the cases so if you want

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.659 
the heaviest of the cases so if you want
something<00:04:04.450> that's<00:04:04.630> lightweight<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.680> this

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
something that's lightweight and this

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.349 
something that's lightweight and this
probably<00:04:06.910> isn't<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.269> greatest<00:04:07.419> idea<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:08.200> you
