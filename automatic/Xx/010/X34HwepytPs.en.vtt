00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.570
 What's up with kids here, General Josh? 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.440
 I bring a trick for grand theft auto 5 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.599
 online for the 1.15 update and it's 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.880
 a trick for infinite rpp is worth in this 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.150
 trick you can make wolves but 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.650
 alone without anybody's need and for this 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.329
 trick we're going to need to get up 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.140
 here that I leave the location here in 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.359
 the map 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.449
 it is simply here that I frame 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.760
 look at this military base a little 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.410
 a little more up now I teach it 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.769
 well I put it here to create where is 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.989
 the map and right up here we have 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.370
 now notice that he zoomed in to 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.859
 that you can see where it is 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.390
 it's just under a bridge we have a 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.280
 star you see the right laud and a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.050
 star then you have to come to the bridge 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.550
 this and lower down is worth no 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.219
 climb up the road you have to come by 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.079
 down then we come walking 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.480
 we come right here to this column of 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.339
 just bridge to which I know marked in 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.379
 the map is where exactly I am 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.320
 placed ok we threw ourselves into the water 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.690
 we approach here and we have to locate 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.120
 this piece of wall then we take a 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.210
 Weapon whichever you like most 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.160
 same I in this case took out a submachine gun and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.890
 what you have to do is with the r1 in 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.170
 case of play lean on the column as 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.790
 you are going to see now that I support here a 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.640
 Once supported leaving you have shots towards the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.590
 right and stay submerged in the water 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.650
 more or less that the water arrives by the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.240
 chest is worth not to put on 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.170
 completely to the right and note that 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.270
 what you have to do is point 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.759
 just point once while there 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.039
 you point out was going to appear a 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.170
 I fail to notice that the 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.970
 Weapon of the hand to the player and the player 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.100
 start as to float a bit starts 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.930
 as to go up or it is very easy 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.880
 we support with a gun on the wall and 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.190
 we aim being submerged in the water 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.640
 we tell what will happen will be that point 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.860
 backwards and if it will get up a bit 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.750
 then once that happens we have to already 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.130
 stop being there is worth we have to 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.619
 walk so that to stop being 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.030
 you lean against the wall and see how much 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.429
 more we climb 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.410
 then the player walks in a straight line 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.290
 so the more we go higher 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.659
 we can be walking by him 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.620
 this trick was already hovering over the internet 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.719
 a while ago and this is a new site 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.519
 where it can be done but here it does not end 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.819
 the thing is worth we will take this 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.920
 trick to get rp voucher for 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.170
 get level up very easy 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.450
 then I have left the road this 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 I followed myself to climb the mountain to 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.409
 that you can see exactly the way that I 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 I'm still ok but you can go the other way 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.750
 the case is to climb as high as possible 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.439
 for when we walk when we go to 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.040
 to walk straight you will see that we have floated 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:50.400
 the air fix I put it on camera 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.569
 fast I did not want you to jump and nothing 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.159
 then when he came here to the peak more 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.720
 I start walking towards the base 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.909
 military that I have it right next to 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.950
 then I walk and see how 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.379
 I'm in the air because the trick is 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.960
 in getting right to what is the border 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:09.190
 from the military base 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.590
 just what are the limits of the base 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.390
 military then from the air we 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.310
 we will stay inside and we will leave four 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.400
 stars then what do you have to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.600
 to do is go back out and notice here 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.340
 it's just happening 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.290
 to fix with a meter I jump the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.640
 four stars for I turn around and 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.140
 they start blinking when 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.320
 they begin to blink it is simply 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.330
 stay still then what will happen 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.730
 will be that all four will be removed 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.220
 four stars and they will give us 400 of rpp 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.410
 well, all the time when they give us the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.150
 400 rpp re-enter we jump 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.670
 the four stars come back out and 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.470
 they take them away from us so well infinite 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.520
 until we get tired of doing it 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.070
 the trick 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.300
 nothing else that consists of this then 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.690
 I will leave here to fast camera 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.280
 while I was doing rpp and then at 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.840
 end of the video I leave you how to download 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.420
 here is worth to download this site 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.130
 searched because they are clearly played 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.170
 in the air what we have to do is 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.690
 stop being expelled and choose the 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.120
 suicide option or with a grenade 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.700
 holding it we will also die 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.310
 when dying reappear we have normal 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.870
 being with your feet on the ground 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.459
 then nothing has no more to remember 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.019
 how is the trick is to get to under the 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.780
 bridge you lean on the wall with a gun 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.579
 point and start to climb to the top 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.770
 high that we can get closer to you and see 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.530
 military and it's going in and out from the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.790
 heights and so we'll get erp so 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.110
 nothing I hope you liked it 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.990
 like to subscribe to my channel if I do not 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.120
 You were hoping that you liked it as 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.620
 I said and nothing we see in the next 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.620
 video kids until next time 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 yes
