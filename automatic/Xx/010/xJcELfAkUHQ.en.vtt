00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
across the map and you couldn't tell

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.820 
across the map and you couldn't tell
exactly<00:00:26.269> how<00:00:27.269> many<00:00:27.330> workers<00:00:27.689> he<00:00:27.960> had<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.529> from

his<00:00:29.580> opponents<00:00:30.029> perspective<00:00:30.539> he<00:00:31.230> had<00:00:31.320> one

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
his opponents perspective he had one

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.020 
his opponents perspective he had one
worker<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:32.009> out<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> scouting<00:00:32.610> when<00:00:32.940> in

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
worker going out of scouting when in

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.520 
worker going out of scouting when in
fact<00:00:33.149> he<00:00:33.329> had<00:00:33.420> about<00:00:33.570> ten<00:00:33.870> workers<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.410> eight

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
workers or whatever it was so this is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
workers or whatever it was so this is
how<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.710> hopefully<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.430> don't

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
how you do it and hopefully I don't

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
how you do it and hopefully I don't
screw<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.840> start<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> refinery<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
screw it up so you start a refinery and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
screw it up so you start a refinery and
you<00:00:40.950> could<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.160> with<00:00:41.280> any<00:00:41.399> race<00:00:41.719> then<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> take

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
you could do with any race then you take

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.979 
you could do with any race then you take
your<00:00:43.079> workers<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
your workers like so and you go and you

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
your workers like so and you go and you
rally<00:00:46.230> them<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> mineral<00:00:46.829> patch<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
rally them to mineral patch then you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.420 
rally them to mineral patch then you
rally<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.350> your<00:00:49.350> refinery<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.250> they're

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
rally them to your refinery now they're

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.520 
rally them to your refinery now they're
all<00:00:50.550> stacked<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.960> move<00:00:52.140> them<00:00:52.350> they're

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
all stacked now if I move them they're

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
all stacked now if I move them they're
just<00:00:52.649> gonna<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.949> separate<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> let's<00:00:54.780> start

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
just gonna all separate so let's start

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.580 
just gonna all separate so let's start
that<00:00:55.170> over

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that over

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
that over
you<00:00:56.489> can't<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.239> cannot<00:00:57.660> move<00:00:57.870> them

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
you can't do that you cannot move them

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.900 
you can't do that you cannot move them
so<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.500> week<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.190> we're<00:00:59.280> gonna<00:00:59.370> build<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so this week I do so we're gonna build a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
so this week I do so we're gonna build a
refinery<00:01:00.059> again<00:01:00.629> normally<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.680> game<00:01:01.859> you'll

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
refinery again normally in game you'll

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.410 
refinery again normally in game you'll
actually<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.399> units<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:02.969> against<00:01:03.210> very

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
actually have units but I'm against very

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
actually have units but I'm against very
easy<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> most<00:01:05.610> certainly

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
easy a I and the the most certainly

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.080 
easy a I and the the most certainly
gonna<00:01:06.090> send<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> marine<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.369> think<00:01:08.369> hope

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
gonna send like a marine I think hope

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.289 
gonna send like a marine I think hope
they<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:11.180> really<00:01:12.180> took

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
they don't do you think really took

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
they don't do you think really took
mineral<00:01:12.630> patch<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.229> rallied<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
mineral patch then you rallied to the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.030 
mineral patch then you rallied to the
refinery<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> select<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.890> your

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
refinery and then you select on your

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.359 
refinery and then you select on your
opponent's<00:01:17.460> mineral<00:01:17.729> patch<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:19.369> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
opponent's mineral patch like this and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.710 
opponent's mineral patch like this and
they're<00:01:20.520> gonna<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:20.820> looking<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.299> one

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
they're gonna go out looking like one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.609 
they're gonna go out looking like one
giant<00:01:22.290> SCB<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.630> blew<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:24.960> mind

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
giant SCB you just blew my mind

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.700 
giant SCB you just blew my mind
look<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> isn't<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.150> amazing<00:01:27.470> how<00:01:28.470> many

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
look at that isn't that amazing how many

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.130 
look at that isn't that amazing how many
how<00:01:29.100> many<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.090> SCV

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
how many that's one SCV

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.410 
how many that's one SCV
yeah<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.189> actually<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.790> looking<00:01:33.360> like

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
yeah it's actually and it's looking like

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
yeah it's actually and it's looking like
a<00:01:33.570> time<00:01:33.990> vortex<00:01:34.670> basically<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.970> yeah

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
a time vortex basically what it is yeah

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
a time vortex basically what it is yeah
yeah<00:01:36.840> occupying<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> same<00:01:37.770> space<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.250> see

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
yeah occupying the same space and see

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.160 
yeah occupying the same space and see
the<00:01:38.490> long<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.790> guess<00:01:38.970> he<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.570> following<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the long I guess he is like following it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.679 
the long I guess he is like following it
yeah<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.070> some<00:01:41.250> kind<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.630> of

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
yeah it's some kind of like some kind of

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.620 
yeah it's some kind of like some kind of
like<00:01:42.899> physical<00:01:43.320> super<00:01:44.100> super<00:01:44.970> positioning

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
like physical super super positioning

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.380 
like physical super super positioning
yeah<00:01:46.290> no<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> mean<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.180> close

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
yeah no I mean if you really look close

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
yeah no I mean if you really look close
at<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:49.020> yeah<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.189> really<00:01:50.399> look<00:01:50.549> close

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
at it or yeah if you really look close

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
at it or yeah if you really look close
at<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.439> did<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.950> know

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
at it it's like right I did not know

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.370 
at it it's like right I did not know
Starcraft<00:01:53.820> could<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.149> quantum<00:01:54.600> mechanics<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
Starcraft could do quantum mechanics and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.630 
Starcraft could do quantum mechanics and
then<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.920> move<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> they're<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.520> gonna

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
then now if I move it they're all gonna

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
then now if I move it they're all gonna
separate<00:01:57.030> like<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.079> can't<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
separate like that so you can't do that

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.920 
separate like that so you can't do that
you<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> make<00:01:59.219> sure<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.729> rally<00:02:00.570> them<00:02:00.780> all

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you got to make sure to rally them all

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.490 
you got to make sure to rally them all
to<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> patch<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> refinery<00:02:03.630> that's

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
to a patch and then to a refinery that's

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.990 
to a patch and then to a refinery that's
a<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:04.799> point<00:02:04.950> let's<00:02:05.189> see<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> works<00:02:05.759> on

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
a good point let's see if it works on

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.540 
a good point let's see if it works on
just<00:02:06.240> an<00:02:06.630> empty<00:02:06.869> room

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
just an empty room

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
just an empty room
wonder<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.820> it'll<00:02:09.000> work<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:09.509> empty<00:02:09.780> geyser

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
wonder if it'll work on an empty geyser

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
wonder if it'll work on an empty geyser
yeah<00:02:10.770> that's<00:02:10.920> what<00:02:11.070> I<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.250> empty<00:02:11.730> guys<00:02:11.850> in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
yeah that's what I was empty guys in

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.280 
yeah that's what I was empty guys in
there<00:02:12.210> we<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.390> let's<00:02:12.900> try<00:02:14.390> no<00:02:15.390> but<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.810> under

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
there we go let's try no but and under

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.370 
there we go let's try no but and under
find<00:02:16.560> guys<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.400> doesn't<00:02:17.700> work<00:02:18.260> they<00:02:19.260> all

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
find guys but it doesn't work they all

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.590 
find guys but it doesn't work they all
try<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.310> try<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.580> opposite<00:02:21.060> mineral<00:02:21.420> patch

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
try just try and opposite mineral patch

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.360 
try just try and opposite mineral patch
that<00:02:21.900> should<00:02:22.050> work<00:02:22.230> because<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.070> just<00:02:23.250> need

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
that should work because you just need

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.210 
that should work because you just need
another<00:02:23.640> point<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> point

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
another point of I think it's the point

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.510 
another point of I think it's the point
where<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.460> actually<00:02:26.490> rally<00:02:27.450> together<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.430> if

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
where they actually rally together so if

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.090 
where they actually rally together so if
I<00:02:29.610> start<00:02:29.910> over<00:02:30.000> finding<00:02:30.330> me<00:02:30.420> right<00:02:30.600> here<00:02:30.960> do<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
I start over finding me right here do it

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.600 
I start over finding me right here do it
I<00:02:35.900> don't<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.770> spread<00:02:38.130> let's<00:02:38.400> do

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
I don't like that that spread let's do

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.860 
I don't like that that spread let's do
this<00:02:38.730> one

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
this one

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.930 
this one
you're<00:02:40.200> falling<00:02:40.410> behind<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.980> supply<00:02:41.430> versus

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
you're falling behind on supply versus

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.690 
you're falling behind on supply versus
the<00:02:42.120> AI<00:02:42.330> by<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> way<00:02:43.050> really<00:02:43.590> know<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.550> was

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the AI by the way really know that was

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.600 
the AI by the way really know that was
possible

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
possible

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.430 
possible
there<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.670> go<00:02:48.000> now<00:02:48.420> they<00:02:48.570> look<00:02:48.690> stacked<00:02:49.110> but

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
there you go now they look stacked but

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.350 
there you go now they look stacked but
from<00:02:49.770> most<00:02:50.100> players<00:02:50.370> perspective<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.240> won't

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
from most players perspective you won't

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.050 
from most players perspective you won't
be<00:02:51.540> able<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.780> tell<00:02:51.990> exactly<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.700> don't<00:02:53.970> know

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
be able to tell exactly so I don't know

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.580 
be able to tell exactly so I don't know
if<00:02:54.150> it'll<00:02:54.270> work<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.600> an<00:02:54.750> actual<00:02:55.080> mining

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
if it'll work on an actual mining

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.400 
if it'll work on an actual mining
mineral<00:02:56.580> patch<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.209> might<00:02:58.700> yeah<00:03:00.290> go<00:03:01.290> in

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
mineral patch but it might yeah go in

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.290 
mineral patch but it might yeah go in
there<00:03:01.590> base<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:02.130> go<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.520> try<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:05.300> it's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
there base just go and try it and it's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:13.810 
there base just go and try it and it's
just<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.720> cool<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:08.070> its<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:09.090> fuzzy<00:03:09.570> -<00:03:09.750> it's

there's<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.370> brain<00:03:35.580> it's<00:03:36.269> gonna<00:03:36.390> end<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> all

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
there's a brain it's gonna end it all

position<00:03:42.390> death<00:03:42.840> CV<00:03:43.200> that's<00:03:43.739> how<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:43.920> do<00:03:44.100> it

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
position death CV that's how you do it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.820 
position death CV that's how you do it
remember<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.000> only<00:03:45.060> one<00:03:45.360> SCV<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:48.830> it

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
remember it's only one SCV and it

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.110 
remember it's only one SCV and it
doesn't<00:03:50.100> work<00:03:50.160> against<00:03:50.489> opponents<00:03:50.730> either

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
doesn't work against opponents either

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.300 
doesn't work against opponents either
but<00:03:51.780> that's<00:03:52.140> really<00:03:52.380> cool<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:52.950> let's<00:03:52.980> go<00:03:53.250> ahead

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
but that's really cool so let's go ahead

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.380 
but that's really cool so let's go ahead
and<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.610> one<00:03:53.700> more<00:03:53.760> time<00:03:53.880> we're<00:03:54.330> gonna

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
and do it one more time we're gonna

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.210 
and do it one more time we're gonna
recap<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.350> make<00:03:55.470> sure<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.769> works<00:03:55.950> and

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
recap it just to make sure it works and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.710 
recap it just to make sure it works and
I<00:03:56.820> don't<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.060> we<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.299> go<00:03:57.390> back<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.660> our

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
I don't think we have to go back to our

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.050 
I don't think we have to go back to our
main<00:03:57.900> alright<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:59.010> select<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.549> SUV<00:04:00.000> as

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
main alright as you select the SUV as

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.360 
main alright as you select the SUV as
you<00:04:00.209> want<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.260> have<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.500> do<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.830> on<00:04:02.100> I

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
think you could do it on a completed

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.660 
think you could do it on a completed
refinery<00:04:04.470> too<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:05.010> let's<00:04:05.160> turn<00:04:05.340> off<00:04:05.459> auto

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
refinery too but let's turn off auto

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.199 
refinery too but let's turn off auto
repair<00:04:07.430> let's<00:04:08.430> do<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.730> like<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.030> most

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
repair let's do it like in most

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.150 
repair let's do it like in most
situations<00:04:09.420> you'll<00:04:10.019> have<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.200> partially

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
situations you'll have a partially

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.370 
situations you'll have a partially
completed<00:04:11.340> refinery<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.049> take<00:04:13.200> all<00:04:13.350> your

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
completed refinery so you take all your

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.080 
completed refinery so you take all your
SPS<00:04:13.830> take<00:04:14.010> them<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.280> mineral<00:04:14.519> patch<00:04:14.670> and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
SPS take them to a mineral patch and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.879 
SPS take them to a mineral patch and

lousy it's fuzzy that's a little too
fuzzy<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:30.210> get<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.479> idea<00:04:30.540> yeah<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:32.220> this

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
fuzzy but you get the idea yeah so this

is Starbucks worker stacking special
technique<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.830> worked<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.910> actually<00:04:39.300> beat

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
technique that worked and actually beat

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.080 
technique that worked and actually beat
a<00:04:39.900> high<00:04:40.229> level<00:04:40.470> Protoss<00:04:40.860> player<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:41.400> who

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
a high level Protoss player so who

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.000 
a high level Protoss player so who
forged<00:04:42.449> fast<00:04:42.690> expanded<00:04:43.199> so<00:04:43.350> let<00:04:43.500> me<00:04:43.590> put<00:04:43.979> that

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
forged fast expanded so let me put that

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.890 
forged fast expanded so let me put that
disclaimer<00:04:44.220> out<00:04:44.580> he<00:04:44.790> forged<00:04:45.120> fast<00:04:45.360> expanded

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
disclaimer out he forged fast expanded

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.840 
disclaimer out he forged fast expanded
and<00:04:46.169> he<00:04:46.740> sneakily<00:04:47.400> sent<00:04:47.970> his<00:04:48.150> drones<00:04:49.020> in<00:04:49.350> and

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
and he sneakily sent his drones in and

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.330 
and he sneakily sent his drones in and
was<00:04:50.850> able<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.240> basically<00:04:51.419> dominate<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:53.130> way

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
was able to basically dominate that way

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.280 
was able to basically dominate that way
so<00:04:53.400> there's<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.450> subsequent<00:04:55.050> see<00:04:55.410> oh<00:04:57.290> that

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
so there's a subsequent see oh that

so there's a subsequent see oh that
one's<00:04:58.500> got<00:04:58.710> what<00:04:59.130> if<00:04:59.220> what<00:04:59.970> if<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.180> what<00:05:01.110> if

one's got what if what if you what if
they<00:05:01.290> all<00:05:01.410> have<00:05:01.590> gas<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.250> then<00:05:03.060> they<00:05:03.210> all<00:05:03.330> go

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
they all have gas and then they all go

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.540 
they all have gas and then they all go
back<00:05:03.630> home<00:05:03.800> well<00:05:04.800> no<00:05:04.950> I<00:05:04.979> mean<00:05:05.070> like<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.400> have<00:05:05.490> to
