before afraid of heights that one is
great<00:05:56.820> and<00:05:57.120> there's<00:05:57.390> about<00:05:57.480> three<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:57.990> half

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
great and there's about three and a half

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.659 
great and there's about three and a half
minutes<00:05:58.350> of<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.770> song<00:05:59.010> and<00:05:59.040> it<00:05:59.400> just<00:05:59.550> gets

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
minutes of the song and it just gets

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.850 
minutes of the song and it just gets
into<00:05:59.940> this<00:06:00.060> experimental<00:06:00.690> paltrow<00:06:01.290> thing<00:06:01.620> and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
into this experimental paltrow thing and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.080 
into this experimental paltrow thing and
it<00:06:01.919> sounds<00:06:02.190> really<00:06:02.250> cool<00:06:02.580> it<00:06:02.730> sounds<00:06:02.850> like

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
it sounds really cool it sounds like

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.850 
it sounds really cool it sounds like
something<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:03.660> band<00:06:03.870> hasn't<00:06:04.140> tried<00:06:04.590> before

something the band hasn't tried before

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.980
