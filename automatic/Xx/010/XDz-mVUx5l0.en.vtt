00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.120 
there's a 5-inch sink or a 10-inch power
worm<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> reality<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:22.439> 10<00:00:22.710> inches<00:00:22.949> is

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
worm but the reality is the 10 inches is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.890 
worm but the reality is the 10 inches is
not<00:00:23.310> attendance<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.000> universally<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
not attendance is universally and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.300 
not attendance is universally and
there's<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> little<00:00:25.410> bit<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> leeway<00:00:25.949> there

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
there's a little bit of leeway there

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.279 
there's a little bit of leeway there
actually<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> size<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.359> baits<00:00:27.630> so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
actually in the size of these baits so

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.529 
actually in the size of these baits so
I'm<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> make<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> quick<00:00:28.980> video<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.670> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
hopefully you can get a better sense of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.660 
hopefully you can get a better sense of
how<00:00:33.450> big<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:33.930> baits<00:00:34.110> are<00:00:34.460> I'm<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.579> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
Berkeley power worm now notice how it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.920 
Berkeley power worm now notice how it
says<00:01:27.570> seven<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.619> curly<00:01:29.130> q<00:01:29.369> tail<00:01:29.930> but

inches<00:01:33.659> longer<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.329> comes

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
inches longer but you know as it comes

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
and Cinco but even with this thing kind
of<00:01:40.380> flail<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.189> don't<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.640> really

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
than even the length of some weights is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
than even the length of some weights is
the<00:01:46.619> profile<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> single<00:01:47.939> has<00:01:48.180> a

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.680 
great and next one is one of many dates
this<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> havoc<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.970> allegedly<00:02:11.660> 8-inch<00:02:12.190> okay

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
this is a havoc is allegedly 8-inch okay

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.340 
this is a havoc is allegedly 8-inch okay
so<00:02:14.690> here's<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.170> havoc<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.800> eight<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:18.050> one

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
so here's a havoc and eight and this one

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.470 
so here's a havoc and eight and this one
it<00:02:18.860> only<00:02:18.890> really<00:02:19.310> has<00:02:19.490> body<00:02:19.820> for<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.210> first

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
it only really has body for the first

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.050 
it only really has body for the first
couple<00:02:20.690> inches<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:22.040> then<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.430> goes<00:02:22.580> all<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
couple inches and then it goes all to a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.650 
couple inches and then it goes all to a
very<00:02:23.270> thin<00:02:23.600> tail<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.440> their<00:02:24.950> profile

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
very thin tail it's just their profile

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.150 
very thin tail it's just their profile
so<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.810> wants<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> loop<00:02:27.440> around<00:02:27.560> i'm<00:02:27.980> going<00:02:28.100> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
so it wants to loop around i'm going to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.250 
so it wants to loop around i'm going to
kind<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.370> lay<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.700> over<00:02:28.959> just<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.050> give<00:02:30.230> it

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
kind of lay it over just to give it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.210 
kind of lay it over just to give it
maximum<00:02:30.530> length<00:02:31.209> okay<00:02:32.890> let's<00:02:33.890> make<00:02:34.190> sure

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
maximum length okay let's make sure

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.460 
maximum length okay let's make sure
these<00:02:34.459> things<00:02:34.520> are<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:36.910> alright<00:02:37.910> so<00:02:38.470> that's

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
these things are going alright so that's

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.590 
these things are going alright so that's
an<00:02:39.650> eight<00:02:39.890> inch<00:02:40.070> worm<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:41.060> here's<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.330> classic

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
an eight inch worm now here's a classic

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.380 
an eight inch worm now here's a classic
this<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.200> berkeley<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.680> 10-inch<00:02:43.459> power

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
this is the berkeley the 10-inch power

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.410 
this is the berkeley the 10-inch power
worm<00:02:44.890> okay<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.220> see<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.520> it's<00:02:47.090> getting

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.590 
worm okay so you see that it's getting
longer<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.250> more<00:02:49.250> than<00:02:49.430> its<00:02:49.550> length<00:02:49.880> is<00:02:50.150> the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
longer and more than its length is the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.050 
longer and more than its length is the
profile<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:52.070> body<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.370> getting<00:02:52.520> thicker<00:02:52.820> as

and that tail really wants to come back
different<00:04:46.569> than<00:04:46.870> some<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.169> these<00:04:47.229> other<00:04:47.289> ones

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
different than some of these other ones

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.309 
different than some of these other ones
that<00:04:47.830> really<00:04:48.099> curl<00:04:48.669> up<00:04:48.819> more<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.270> hence<00:04:50.199> the

the<00:06:07.810> water<00:06:08.020> I<00:06:08.580> guess<00:06:09.580> like<00:06:09.759> that<00:06:10.029> a<00:06:10.210> little<00:06:11.169> bit

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
the water I guess like that a little bit

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:27.430 
the water I guess like that a little bit
more<00:06:14.159> line<00:06:15.159> all<00:06:15.340> these<00:06:15.520> guys<00:06:15.729> up

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.980 

okay<00:06:28.440> guys<00:06:28.680> so<00:06:29.090> they<00:06:30.090> look<00:06:30.240> a<00:06:30.330> little<00:06:30.450> off<00:06:30.690> but

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
i think i might just be the camera angle

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.940 
i think i might just be the camera angle
here<00:06:33.230> yeah<00:06:34.230> i<00:06:34.260> guess<00:06:34.470> they<00:06:34.620> are<00:06:34.710> kind<00:06:34.920> of
