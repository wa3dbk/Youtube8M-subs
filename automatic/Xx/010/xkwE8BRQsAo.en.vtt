hi this is Paul salt and I am showing
you<00:00:03.750> artwork<00:00:04.410> evolution<00:00:05.270> this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:07.010> image

you artwork evolution this is a image
creation<00:00:08.400> tool<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.420> uses<00:00:11.269> evolution<00:00:12.269> and

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
creation tool that uses evolution and

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.070 
creation tool that uses evolution and
mathematics<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.679> create<00:00:13.980> art<00:00:14.570> so<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> images

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
mathematics to create art so the images

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.590 
mathematics to create art so the images
you<00:00:16.109> see<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> screen<00:00:16.800> are<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.820> images

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
you see on the screen are all images

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.599 
you see on the screen are all images
that<00:00:18.750> I've<00:00:18.869> created<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.859> system<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
that I've created in this system and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.460 
that I've created in this system and
what<00:00:21.390> i<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.750> i<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:21.990> put<00:00:22.230> them<00:00:22.350> into

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
what i can do is i can put them into

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.740 
what i can do is i can put them into
piles<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.189> i<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.400> sort<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.670> figure<00:00:24.390> out<00:00:24.570> which

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
piles and i can sort of figure out which

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720 
piles and i can sort of figure out which
ones<00:00:24.990> i<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.890> which<00:00:25.980> ones<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.279> don't<00:00:26.340> like

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
ones i like and which ones I don't like

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.160 
ones i like and which ones I don't like
if<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.240> don't<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:28.019> rid

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
if I really don't like it I can get rid

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.080 
if I really don't like it I can get rid
of<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.619> fling<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.490> off<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> screen

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
of it and just fling it off the screen

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.939 
of it and just fling it off the screen
so<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> whole<00:00:30.810> point<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.500> sorting

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
so the whole point is I'm sorting

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.319 
so the whole point is I'm sorting
through<00:00:32.160> content<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.239> I'm

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
through content that I like and I'm

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.810 
through content that I like and I'm
making<00:00:33.630> different<00:00:33.809> piles<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.730> we<00:00:35.730> can

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
making different piles and then we can

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
making different piles and then we can
start<00:00:36.000> doing<00:00:36.180> stuff<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.660> those<00:00:36.780> piles<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
start doing stuff with those piles so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.900 
start doing stuff with those piles so
we're<00:00:38.100> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.399> started<00:00:38.670> with<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
we're going to get started with the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.600 
we're going to get started with the
application<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.660> I'm<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> go<00:00:40.980> into<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
application and I'm going to go into the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.529 
application and I'm going to go into the
top<00:00:41.790> rated<00:00:42.030> category<00:00:43.489> this<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> category<00:00:45.329> of

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
top rated category this is a category of

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
top rated category this is a category of
art<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.230> created<00:00:46.829> by<00:00:47.070> users<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.559> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
art that was created by users and it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.170 
art that was created by users and it's
got<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> wide<00:00:49.980> variety<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.460> different<00:00:50.579> types<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
got a wide variety of different types of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
got a wide variety of different types of
images<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.440> use<00:00:52.590> any<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.949> these

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
images and we can use any of these

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
images and we can use any of these
images<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.579> starting<00:00:54.120> points<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.539> future

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
images as starting points for future

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.029 
images as starting points for future
evolution<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> go<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> top

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
evolution so I'm going to go to the top

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.619 
evolution so I'm going to go to the top
and<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> pick<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.420> couple

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and we're going to pick out a couple

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.819 
and we're going to pick out a couple
these<00:01:00.809> images<00:01:01.170> i<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> show<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.590> them

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
these images i want to show you them

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.640 
these images i want to show you them
before<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.609> select<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.650> use

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
before we actually select them and use

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160 
before we actually select them and use
them<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> create<00:01:05.189> new<00:01:05.430> content<00:01:06.110> here's<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
them to create new content here's the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.609 
them to create new content here's the
first<00:01:07.380> image<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.850> we'll<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.090> back

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
first image and then we'll go back

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.690 
first image and then we'll go back
here's<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> second<00:01:11.159> image<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.520> we're<00:01:11.610> going

here's the second image that we're going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.899 
here's the second image that we're going
to<00:01:11.760> select<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.860> third<00:01:14.070> image<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to select and the third image is this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
to select and the third image is this
one<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.530> have

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
one so as you can see they all have

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
one so as you can see they all have
different<00:01:16.830> colors<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.970> different

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
different colors they all have different

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.300 
different colors they all have different
forms<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> structures<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.100> take

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
forms and structures and we can take

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.640 
forms and structures and we can take
that<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.479> combine<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.320> create<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that and we can combine that to create a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
that and we can combine that to create a
whole<00:01:22.920> new<00:01:22.950> set<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.310> images<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> we're<00:01:24.869> going

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
whole new set of images so we're going

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.539 
whole new set of images so we're going
to<00:01:25.080> go<00:01:25.110> back<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.740> I'm<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> hit<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to go back and I'm going to hit the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.910 
to go back and I'm going to hit the
select<00:01:26.729> button<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> top<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.200> i'm

select button in the top right and i'm

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.480 
select button in the top right and i'm
going<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> select<00:01:29.369> each<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.329> those<00:01:30.450> images<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
going to select each of those images and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.950 
going to select each of those images and
we're<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> create<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.210> new<00:01:33.450> set<00:01:33.750> by

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we're going to create that new set by

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.179 
we're going to create that new set by
touching<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> evolved<00:01:34.740> button<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
touching the evolved button in the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.050 
touching the evolved button in the
bottom<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.670> corner<00:01:37.579> right<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
bottom right corner right now it is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.539 
bottom right corner right now it is
processing<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.229> created<00:01:40.619> 100<00:01:41.430> new

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
processing and it just created 100 new

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.780 
processing and it just created 100 new
images<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.409> wait<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:44.250> render

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
images and as we wait it will render

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.030 
images and as we wait it will render
each<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.270> those<00:01:45.360> images<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.140> give<00:01:46.799> us<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
each of those images and give us a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.639 
each of those images and give us a
little<00:01:47.159> preview<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> looks<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
little preview of what it looks like and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.130 
little preview of what it looks like and
we<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.799> use<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.100> preview<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.140> decision

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we can use that preview as a decision

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.429 
we can use that preview as a decision
mechanism<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.119> allow<00:01:54.420> us<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> decide<00:01:55.110> if

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
mechanism that can allow us to decide if

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.609 
mechanism that can allow us to decide if
we<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> image<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.590> we

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
we like the image or not and if we do we

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.410 
we like the image or not and if we do we
can<00:01:58.920> continue<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.430> evolution<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.149> don't

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
can continue the evolution if we don't

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.130 
can continue the evolution if we don't
we<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.380> throw<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.710> away<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.899> we're<00:02:04.049> going

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
we can just throw it away so we're going

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.260 
we can just throw it away so we're going
to<00:02:04.229> wait<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.979> finishes<00:02:05.340> processing<00:02:05.640> some

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
to wait as it finishes processing some

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.540 
to wait as it finishes processing some
of<00:02:06.390> these<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:07.229> sort<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.280> kind<00:02:08.489> of

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
of these to sort of see what kind of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
of these to sort of see what kind of
options<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.420> work<00:02:09.569> with<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.039> see

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
options we have to work with you can see

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.010 
options we have to work with you can see
all<00:02:11.220> these<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.700> unique<00:02:11.970> images<00:02:12.420> no<00:02:12.690> one<00:02:12.840> has

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
all these are unique images no one has

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.550 
all these are unique images no one has
ever<00:02:13.170> seen

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
ever seen

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.040 
ever seen
is<00:02:13.650> before<00:02:13.980> they're<00:02:14.130> brand<00:02:14.400> new<00:02:14.690> I'm<00:02:15.690> seeing<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
is before they're brand new I'm seeing a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.280 
is before they're brand new I'm seeing a
few<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.760> want<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.090> take<00:02:19.080> them

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
few that I like and I want to take them

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.220 
few that I like and I want to take them
and<00:02:19.440> evolve<00:02:19.709> them<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> step<00:02:20.160> further<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:21.540> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
and evolve them a step further on this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.720 
and evolve them a step further on this
screen<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.680> I'm<00:02:22.800> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.010> show<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.250> large

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
screen so I'm going to show you a large

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.699 
screen so I'm going to show you a large
preview<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.319> image<00:02:25.680> right<00:02:25.830> here<00:02:25.890> and

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
preview I like this image right here and

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.670 
preview I like this image right here and
I<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:30.180> image<00:02:30.510> right<00:02:30.660> here<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.590> we're

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I like this image right here so we're

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.259 
I like this image right here so we're
going<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.860> take<00:02:32.010> these<00:02:32.160> two<00:02:32.430> new<00:02:32.610> images<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
going to take these two new images and

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.630 
going to take these two new images and
we're<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> combine<00:02:33.690> them<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.140> create

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
we're going to combine them to create

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.270 
we're going to combine them to create
100<00:02:35.640> new<00:02:35.760> images<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.720> each<00:02:37.590> time<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.040> select

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
100 new images so each time you select

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.650 
100 new images so each time you select
one<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.489> them<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> shows<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> preview<00:02:39.360> and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
one of them it shows you the preview and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.290 
one of them it shows you the preview and
then<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.870> generates<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.380> large<00:02:40.560> version<00:02:41.300> which

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
then it generates a large version which

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.870 
then it generates a large version which
you<00:02:42.569> can<00:02:42.930> use<00:02:45.140> as<00:02:46.140> an<00:02:46.560> indication<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.400> what<00:02:47.760> it

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
you can use as an indication of what it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390 
you can use as an indication of what it
really<00:02:48.000> looks<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:49.680> we've<00:02:49.799> got<00:02:49.980> those<00:02:50.160> two

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
really looks like so we've got those two

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.640 
really looks like so we've got those two
images<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.470> lot<00:02:52.620> of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
images you can see there's a lot of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.630 
images you can see there's a lot of
other<00:02:52.920> possibilities<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:56.190> process

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
other possibilities and this process

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.449 
other possibilities and this process
will<00:02:56.790> keep<00:02:57.090> continuing<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.980> I'm<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.430> to

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
will keep continuing so I'm going to

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.870 
will keep continuing so I'm going to
select<00:02:59.640> this<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.069> we're

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
select this one and this one and we're

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
select this one and this one and we're
going<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.030> hit<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.180> evolved<00:03:03.540> button<00:03:03.780> again

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.110 

now<00:03:09.900> we<00:03:09.959> have<00:03:10.380> 100<00:03:11.310> new<00:03:11.400> images<00:03:11.849> that<00:03:12.000> are

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
now we have 100 new images that are

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.780 
now we have 100 new images that are
being<00:03:12.330> rendered<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.319> screen<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.580> we<00:03:14.670> get

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
being rendered to the screen so we get

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.190 
being rendered to the screen so we get
the<00:03:14.880> little<00:03:15.030> preview<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.780> we<00:03:15.840> can<00:03:15.989> make<00:03:16.049> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the little preview and we can make the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.560 
the little preview and we can make the
decision<00:03:16.620> again<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.790> keep<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.209> doing

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
decision again and you can keep on doing

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.620 
decision again and you can keep on doing
this<00:03:18.750> as<00:03:19.019> long<00:03:19.079> as<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.739> want<00:03:20.040> as<00:03:20.299> many<00:03:21.299> times

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
this as long as you want as many times

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.390 
this as long as you want as many times
as<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.900> want<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.350> you'll<00:03:22.620> continue<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.100> get

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
as you want and you'll continue to get

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.680 
as you want and you'll continue to get
more<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:24.540> more<00:03:24.600> artwork<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.540> what

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
more and more artwork so this is what

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.300 
more and more artwork so this is what
our<00:03:27.720> work<00:03:27.959> evolution<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.560> all<00:03:28.680> about<00:03:28.950> it's<00:03:29.190> all

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
our work evolution is all about it's all

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.069 
our work evolution is all about it's all
about<00:03:29.579> being<00:03:29.970> able<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.359> create<00:03:30.600> artwork<00:03:30.900> based

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
about being able to create artwork based

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.520 
about being able to create artwork based
on<00:03:31.430> visual<00:03:32.430> properties<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.810> an<00:03:33.930> image<00:03:34.079> it

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
on visual properties in an image it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.050 
on visual properties in an image it
doesn't<00:03:34.829> require<00:03:34.920> any<00:03:35.250> artistic<00:03:35.549> skill<00:03:35.940> you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
doesn't require any artistic skill you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.160 
doesn't require any artistic skill you
don't<00:03:36.239> need<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.569> know<00:03:36.720> how<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.959> use<00:03:37.049> a
