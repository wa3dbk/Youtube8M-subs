00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.559
 bye 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.130
 these paletones the ingredients that 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.860
 we need are some marshmallows 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.220
 giant heart-shaped sticks 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.070
 for skewers decorated 150 grams of 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.350
 white chocolate chocolate granillo and 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.480
 sugar figures to decorate and a 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.300
 little bit of red food coloring 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.090
 the first thing is to put over medium heat a 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.010
 pot with water and on top a container that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.560
 resists heat to melt the 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.520
 chocolate to bain-marie when I was 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.260
 completely melted remove it from the fire 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.600
 then to give him pink color he wanted 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.850
 I put two droplets of dye for 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.920
 food I recommend you to put 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.920
 drop by drop until you get the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.740
 tonality you want I chose this tone 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.750
 of pink because it seems more romantic and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.220
 with skewers for skewers 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.080
 the marshmallows on the bottom 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.080
 to form the paletones 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.229
 and then with the help of a shovel the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.229
 I covered all of chocolate 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.200
 once they were all covered in 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.660
 I started decorating them 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.290
 the first thing sprinkle with sugar 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.290
 Red color 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 with the following bass and the granillo 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.209
 chocolate on a plate and you pass the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.400
 marshmallow on top so they will stick 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.459
 in the chocolate coverage that still 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.010
 I was warm to the third I decorate it with 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.110
 I put these hearts on the side of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.989
 opposite and on the sides I covered it with 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.000
 sugar these are just some ideas for 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.760
 decorate but there are countless 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.379
 possibilities and the last one I did was 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.780
 this one that I covered with colored balls 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.150
 when finished with the decoration what 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.220
 Refrigerate for about 10 minutes so that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.560
 the chocolate will harden and stay 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.629
 ready the final result are these 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.410
 very rich paletones that besides 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:04.400
 pretty are super easy to make 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.400
