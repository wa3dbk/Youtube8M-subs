00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.460
 is the beginning of an unpublished project in 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.800
 the Ecuadorian Amazon these are the 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.559
 classrooms of the leveling module that opens 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.889
 its doors to 150 students who 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.200
 will be 20 weeks in ikea receiving 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.730
 classes of different sciences in order to 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.740
 that reach the same level of 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.800
 knowledge these students 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.279
 they will receive chairs of physical mathematics 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.230
 chemistry biology english communication 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.960
 oral and written and good university 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.360
 live what we see is the equipment of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.700
 one of his laboratories about 20 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.490
 teachers will work on the start of the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.640
 university and they have to see how the 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.580
 science meets nature to 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.490
 produce the next innovation through 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.070
 of creative methods and exploration 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.590
 This leveling module comprises 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.860
 3,500 square meters of classrooms and 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.870
 laboratories the 2015 will begin the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.010
 construction of the university 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.010
 properly said 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.239
 will be in the middle of ikea because ikea in 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.680
 shuar means jungle 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.049
 of 28 thousand square meters 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.540
 approximately we will have the cluster of 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.880
 libraries and cultural center the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.490
 laboratories and classrooms and also that of 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.220
 residences the existence of qian 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.649
 deludes the people of tena something 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.899
 this is a milestone whose impact in this 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.240
 population the capital of the province of 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.280
 napo be verified with no time 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.770
 we think this great work that is going to be 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.409
 here in the tena and especially for 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.060
 our children because they are the ones who 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.100
 suffer 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.490
 and so not so us because 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.409
 you have to go to another city in the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.509
 Amazon had never tried to create 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.350
 a university like today is being 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.659
 creating see very one and only one 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.240
 they carried the oil resources for 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.369
 the other provinces would remain 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.959
 of the study or the young people prepared 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.909
 would be left to serve right here in the 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.429
 amazonÃ­a one of the advantages 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.039
 comparisons of ikea is that it has more than 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.310
 93 thousand hectares of the natural reserve 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.519
 with a boat that meets six 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.370
 ecosystems that go from the high wasteland 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.239
 Andean 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.239
 to the Amazonian jungle
