00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.629
 round of her hunger games arena 5 on 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.919
 gomera de I do not know what kind 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.910
 arenas used it if ever 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.559
 right talk as if that's one 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.890
 homemade on the almost daily 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.230
 small and yes there is still a player 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.310
 and in between something cool that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.869
 really means such a huge long 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 round and have no team mates that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.330
 means I am alone against the rest times 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 watch what's going on so what are these 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.270
 so i will get the tron here on the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.110

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.110
 43 21 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:13.950
 Unfortunately no sword that is a pity 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:17.560
 no no drama behind me 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:23.250
 no, we grab this one, I hope 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 could in time to lala because I 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:52.509
 There is no sword in the armor 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:56.710
 no sword shit okay okay these are 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.820
 this octopus fischer because of this nature 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.340
 I hope that still no opened and 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.979
 iron sword where i have a varnish is 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.619
 Unbelievable luck is happiness 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.920
 with the stupid iron improve it 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.920
 just like that 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.740
 I'm going to put it on so that the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:27.600
 people had a sort of foreplay I had 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:35.700
 today, so does the pension and the pension also gone 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:48.300
 because he saw how he wanted to team 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:03:00.480
 but he wanted to team but I do 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:03:04.830
 no team I do on the small 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.780
 web I just have no bock on team 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.320
 in the small map and I still have 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.540
 give time to run away 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.540
 but I'm just going to kick things off 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.980
 so ice cube is called as you see it 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.690
 personal but are the hunger games 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.220
 and that's about survival so that's 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.690
 it dead then it goes further here 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.150
 directly to the next look where the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.630
 people here so stuck So as you can see 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.340
 you start happy right 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.110
 it's a good training did 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.160
 I have good things then 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.700
 get on the ship there is 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.700
 someone put all my food in here and 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.980
 then we see something that's going on 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.820
 I might have so I know 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.510
 have mine and posts the comments 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.630
 disturbs because currently on full contrast 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:15.210
 and some make only 15 percent 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.210
 less or so and then let's see if 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.480
 the track also in the team the dogs 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.280
 tja some watch out here comes the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.280
 it is not difficult to get there 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.669
 m2 done now it goes on first 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.129
 Something is going on here and there 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.830
 take a wooden sword and then we'll look 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.060
 Something's going on here so back there 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.569
 there are a few more people right now 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.330
 then I would be to go 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.479
 Alone there is too boring that 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.860
 can be too hot but much better 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.120
 is there above is explained by what of 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.840
 do no double damage above 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:17.409
 Oh, for example, down there I have 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:23.169
 not seen how heavy the quiet 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:24.520
 sword he will run away because okay 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.080
 I would not risk it now 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.069
 the mighty attack on the internet 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.810
 I have to have a tactical advantage 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.949
 secure as long as he sees it with has 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:47.490
 also be careful because that's exactly what 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:47.490
 same of course thinks what do you want 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:06:00.550
 later lonely afflecks as fast as that 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.449
 the things are dangerous to me 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.449
 could become 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:13.509
 and there is an order had been played 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.060
 like right now 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.130
 people i have set the way without a team 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:25.870
 bm 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:27.400
 that's how it has to be that was a small one 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.990
 nationwide with the fabric has you 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.130
 like 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.500
 yes, if you liked it then leave it 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.389
 but a rating so unique 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.710
 and write comments what you like that 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.539
 Next time you want to see a map 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.130
 or if yes, sometimes with me 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.000
 and hanna want to play the snap in the team 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.490
 or against each other 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.419
 then she writes comments i am for 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:52.000
 Everything is open and I like to go too 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:55.949
 other servers and so on until 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.949
