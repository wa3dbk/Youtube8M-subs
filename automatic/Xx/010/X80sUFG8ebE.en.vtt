 taking a red wine with the author and it's 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.790
 the lovers of the power of sanjuana 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.200
 martínez this is a book that called me 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.670
 the old attention more than anything because 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.620
 I am establishing a conversation 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.330
 with the author about what she had to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.880
 spend to write this book and all 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.800
 the things that he opined about politics and 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.150
 all this wave is a political book I think 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 that are like several stories that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.530
 contains the book and I would like to read 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.630
 from what story by stories slater the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.090
 Planet of the seal themes of today and has 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.740
 around 260 pages then also 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.930
 finally the editorial planet me 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.610
 they sent the Mongolian plot of Raphael 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.890
 bernal rafael bernal is a great great 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.480
 Mexican author is a classic I suppose 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.100
 American this is a novel book 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.900
 black so I read in the synopsis and 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.090
 so I 've researched and you know that 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.680
 the black novel is my point they know very 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.120
 that take a heart the book already what 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.770
 I started reading Rafael, you're 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.180
 learning because I like how he writes 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.680
 and besides, I had never tried it and I think 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.330
 that I do not know why he did not do it is a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.550
 fairly short book is about 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.650
 200 pages later, as you know, I moved to 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.180
 Monterrey and I in Monterrey did not have 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.190
 no book also did not bring my boxes 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.710
 with my books then I started 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.030
 buy three books that I wanted and that 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.090
 I was going to read 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.510
 The first one I bought was an art mouse 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.430
 ideally this is one I do not know if 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.930
 cartoon or graphic novel the senate 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.610
 of the first public be that you have 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.680
 enough desire to this book and now I 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.510
 I animated the book I take it half 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.890
 is reading so fast and is 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.660
 looking for the truth so much that I decided 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.700
 stop and decide if you're liking 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.370
 the book you have to enjoy , stop it 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.540
 and read it in a way that you enjoy it and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.860
 I think that I will also do it 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.450
 this book I will talk soon in the 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.580
 arm because I tell them I 'm going to the middle and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.380
 it's a very quick book to read I love 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.910
 mind before this book is great I'm 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.800
 almost sure it's going to be one of my 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.239
 favorite books of 2015 then I have 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.519

 of the basil crimes I do not know how 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.550
 pronounced but here I leave a 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.410
 man who calls himself the vigilantes of 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.329
 lighthouse by walking läckberg know and camila 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.430
 läckberg tsumanis police writers 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.710
 favorite and is a Swedish author of more 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.050
 pop the east has almost 500 pages and 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.820
 then I also have alliance tales of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.250
 the full moon the editorial everest and the 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.020
 Authors are apparent travel and selena me 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.850
 Paschal is a book that I saw a lot in 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.620
 youtube españa that to me the truth 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.510
 It calls my attention, I saw this 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.639
 book on the pendulum in the df was going to 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.860
 buy but I saw the price that was 300 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.930
 20 pesos and then I said to see calm 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.669
 do not waste so much on a book and 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.590
 I noticed Gandia is in discount I think 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.270
 that cost me like 200 pesos then 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.310
 I decided to buy it in gandhi is not for 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.960
 nothing what I expected myself from the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.939
 edition is a book of yours 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.610
 principle has a pretty handwriting 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.860
 pretty pretty small the book already what 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.479
 I started reading I loved how it starts 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.949
 the book I have to clarify that from the 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.840
 first paragraph I already put a post-it 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.729
 so I think that means something very 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.529
 very good and the cover is beautiful I do not 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.240
 like and finally I have seven books 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.180
 to show them that they gave me and are 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.180
 these seven wonderful books of harry 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.830
 potter take a load I know I already have all 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.569

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.919
 boxes are already three books but I do not 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.029
 matter has and the dragon are going to 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:35.860

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:38.229
 conformed and are one of the first 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.150
 covers that edited it seems to me and then 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.680
 I like them a lot, I think that 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.569
 many people collect editions of 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.849
 several books 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.259

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.139
