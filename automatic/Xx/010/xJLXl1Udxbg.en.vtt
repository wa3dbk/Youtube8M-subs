00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.640 
they fly in a V in the northwest every
spring<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.830> watch<00:00:14.040> them<00:00:14.429> fly<00:00:15.240> north<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.470> Canada

spring we watch them fly north to Canada

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.920 
spring we watch them fly north to Canada
and<00:00:17.190> every<00:00:17.430> fall<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.850> watch<00:00:18.029> them<00:00:18.240> fly<00:00:18.480> south

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930

and every fall we watch them fly south
to<00:00:19.289> Mexico<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.859> warm<00:00:20.220> work<00:00:20.369> area<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.119> they

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
to Mexico to warm work area and they

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.040 
to Mexico to warm work area and they
stop<00:00:22.380> along<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.769> way<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.810> take

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
stop along the way and so they can take

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.710 
stop along the way and so they can take

I<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:04.469> having<00:02:04.680> wildlife<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> good<00:02:05.850> thing

I think having wildlife is a good thing
because<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.570> means<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.259> try<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
because that means that we can try to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.130 
because that means that we can try to
cohabitate<00:02:08.190> together<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
cohabitate together in that in the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.260 
cohabitate together in that in the
future<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.160> still<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.640> animals<00:02:12.090> and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
