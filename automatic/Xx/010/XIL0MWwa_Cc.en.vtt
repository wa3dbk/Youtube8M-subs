everything in there we got the hydro

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.410 
everything in there we got the hydro
boost<00:00:15.080> unit<00:00:15.530> and<00:00:15.710> one<00:00:16.640> thing<00:00:16.789> I<00:00:16.849> did<00:00:17.029> find<00:00:17.269> out

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
boost unit and one thing I did find out

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.029 
boost unit and one thing I did find out
and<00:00:17.660> if<00:00:17.840> you<00:00:17.990> guys<00:00:18.140> have<00:00:18.289> decided<00:00:18.590> to<00:00:18.859> do<00:00:18.949> this

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
and if you guys have decided to do this

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.259 
and if you guys have decided to do this
conversion<00:00:19.310> you'll<00:00:19.550> want<00:00:19.699> to<00:00:19.759> avoid

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
conversion you'll want to avoid

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.390 
conversion you'll want to avoid
that's<00:00:20.810> a<00:00:20.960> 78<00:00:21.409> gear<00:00:21.679> box<00:00:21.919> and<00:00:22.159> they<00:00:22.220> use<00:00:22.369> a

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
that's a 78 gear box and they use a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.609 
that's a 78 gear box and they use a
flare<00:00:22.759> style<00:00:22.999> fitting<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:23.659> the<00:00:24.169> hydro<00:00:24.499> boost

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
flare style fitting and the hydro boost

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.689 
flare style fitting and the hydro boost
uses<00:00:25.009> the<00:00:25.099> new<00:00:25.220> metric<00:00:25.609> oring<00:00:25.970> style<00:00:26.269> well

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
uses the new metric oring style well

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.089 
uses the new metric oring style well
there's<00:00:28.699> no<00:00:28.909> lines<00:00:29.179> that<00:00:29.419> exist<00:00:29.509> that<00:00:29.960> are

there's no lines that exist that are

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.679 
there's no lines that exist that are

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
having to do I had some hydraboost lines

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.480

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
3/8 brake line and then I ran three it's

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.540 
3/8 brake line and then I ran three it's
brake<00:00:39.440> lines<00:00:39.710> for<00:00:39.980> all<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.220> rest<00:00:40.400> of<00:00:40.490> the

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
summit line lock on here so that should

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.670 
summit line lock on here so that should
be<00:00:44.600> kind<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.840> a<00:00:44.930> fun<00:00:45.080> little<00:00:45.140> toy<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.530> play

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
just to be aware of but on the steering

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
maybe one of you guys can help diagnose

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.879 
maybe one of you guys can help diagnose
the<00:01:43.819> problem<00:01:44.209> I've<00:01:45.109> never<00:01:45.350> seen<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.709> before

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:45.889 
the problem I've never seen this before

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:48.219 
the problem I've never seen this before
and<00:01:46.340> it's<00:01:46.579> really<00:01:46.969> kind<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.509> bothering<00:01:47.869> me<00:01:47.990> and

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
and it's really kind of bothering me and

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.620 
and it's really kind of bothering me and
a<00:01:48.499> couple<00:01:49.039> things<00:01:49.159> maybe<00:01:49.429> we<00:01:50.270> got<00:01:50.420> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
a couple things maybe we got the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.480 
a couple things maybe we got the
steering<00:01:50.869> block<00:01:51.139> on<00:01:51.380> here<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.219> pitman

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
steering block on here so the the pitman

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
steering block on here so the the pitman
arm<00:01:52.549> sets<00:01:52.880> level<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:53.359> I<00:01:53.389> don't<00:01:53.689> expect<00:01:53.810> any

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
arm sets level so I don't expect any

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.379 
arm sets level so I don't expect any
issues<00:01:54.499> from<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.859> and<00:01:55.130> here<00:01:55.819> we<00:01:55.969> got<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.119> drop

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
issues from that and here we got a drop

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:57.760 
issues from that and here we got a drop
pitman<00:01:56.569> arm<00:01:56.779> already<00:01:57.109> it<00:01:57.409> came<00:01:57.560> with<00:01:57.679> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
pitman arm already it came with the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.190 
pitman arm already it came with the
truck<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.909> exact<00:01:59.329> setup<00:01:59.630> was<00:01:59.840> already

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
truck now this exact setup was already

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.319 
truck now this exact setup was already
on<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.469> truck<00:02:00.859> and<00:02:00.889> working<00:02:01.399> just<00:02:01.639> fine<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.299> I

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
on a truck and working just fine so I

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.899 
on a truck and working just fine so I
don't<00:02:02.569> know<00:02:02.630> why<00:02:02.810> I'm<00:02:02.959> having<00:02:03.170> issues<00:02:03.909> but

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
don't know why I'm having issues but

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.819 
don't know why I'm having issues but
what<00:02:05.119> you'll<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.569> happen<00:02:05.929> in<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.529> video

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
what you'll see it happen in the video

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.469 
what you'll see it happen in the video
is<00:02:07.130> at<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.459> spring<00:02:07.789> when<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.090> turn<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
is at this spring when you turn the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.940 
is at this spring when you turn the
wheel<00:02:08.599> is<00:02:08.810> actually<00:02:08.959> pushing<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> spring<00:02:09.800> up

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
wheel is actually pushing the spring up

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.680 
wheel is actually pushing the spring up
and<00:02:10.130> spring<00:02:10.520> down<00:02:10.700> want<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.120> pull<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.360> axle

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
and spring down want to pull the axle

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.000 
and spring down want to pull the axle
forward<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.140> back<00:02:12.260> instead<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.650> actually

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
forward and back instead of actually

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.760 
forward and back instead of actually
turn<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.340> vehicle<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.480> don't<00:02:14.930> know<00:02:15.110> if<00:02:15.500> it's

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
turn the vehicle so I don't know if it's

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.059 
turn the vehicle so I don't know if it's
because

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
because

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.559 
because
I got<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> tires<00:02:16.579> kind<00:02:16.909> of<00:02:16.999> low<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.150> pressure

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
I got the tires kind of low on pressure

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.780 
I got the tires kind of low on pressure
if<00:02:17.780> there's<00:02:17.930> such<00:02:18.109> a<00:02:18.140> big<00:02:18.379> footprint<00:02:18.859> that<00:02:19.129> it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
if there's such a big footprint that it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.009 
if there's such a big footprint that it
just<00:02:19.999> physically<00:02:20.359> can't<00:02:20.389> turn<00:02:20.689> the<00:02:20.810> tires

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
just physically can't turn the tires

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.319 
just physically can't turn the tires
with<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.319> weight<00:02:21.560> or<00:02:21.829> if<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.849> got<00:02:23.030> some<00:02:23.180> other

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
with the weight or if I got some other

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.690 
with the weight or if I got some other
issues<00:02:23.719> one<00:02:24.409> thing<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.650> may<00:02:24.799> have<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.069> do<00:02:25.219> is<00:02:25.459> go

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
issues one thing I may have to do is go

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.580 
issues one thing I may have to do is go
to<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.879> crossover<00:02:26.359> steering<00:02:26.870> which<00:02:27.049> is<00:02:27.230> nice

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
to a crossover steering which is nice

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.830 
to a crossover steering which is nice
but<00:02:28.099> it's<00:02:28.249> a<00:02:28.489> probably<00:02:29.180> an<00:02:29.269> additional<00:02:29.659> four

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
but it's a probably an additional four

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.479 
but it's a probably an additional four
hundred<00:02:30.079> bucks<00:02:30.200> right<00:02:30.499> now<00:02:31.129> that<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.459> just
