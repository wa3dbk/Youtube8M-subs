00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
today we were doing a gtx 970 sli build

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.900 
today we were doing a gtx 970 sli build
the<00:00:07.440> goal<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:07.950> build<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.550> keep<00:00:08.730> the

dollars<00:00:11.730> which<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.120> have<00:00:12.330> met<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.650> make<00:00:13.950> it

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
dollars which we have met and to make it

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.890 
dollars which we have met and to make it
a<00:00:14.219> feasible<00:00:14.730> build<00:00:14.940> for<00:00:15.150> most<00:00:15.330> people<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.690> buy

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
a feasible build for most people to buy

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.320 
a feasible build for most people to buy
to<00:00:16.470> get<00:00:16.619> some<00:00:16.890> top<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> line<00:00:17.880> performance

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
to get some top of the line performance

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.019 
to get some top of the line performance
from<00:00:18.720> these<00:00:18.900> 29<00:00:19.410> 70s<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.520> build<00:00:20.820> is

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
from these 29 70s this build is

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.570 
from these 29 70s this build is
extremely<00:00:21.810> powerful<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.010> an<00:00:23.130> extremely

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
extremely powerful and is an extremely

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.310 
extremely powerful and is an extremely
good<00:00:23.820> value<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.240> I'm<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:24.630> considering

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
good value and I'm actually considering

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.620 
good value and I'm actually considering
building<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.949> myself<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> near<00:00:27.000> future<00:00:27.029> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
building it myself in the near future so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
building it myself in the near future so
let's<00:00:27.779> get<00:00:27.930> into<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.260> build<00:00:28.470> without<00:00:28.680> further

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
let's get into the build without further

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.650 
let's get into the build without further
ado<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> CPU<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.980> going<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
ado so for the CPU we are going with the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.850 
ado so for the CPU we are going with the
2011<00:00:33.660> v3<00:00:34.559> socket<00:00:35.130> haswell-e<00:00:36.200> cpu<00:00:37.200> we're<00:00:37.739> going

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
2011 v3 socket haswell-e cpu we're going

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.380 
2011 v3 socket haswell-e cpu we're going
with<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> cheapest<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.239> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
with the cheapest one they have this is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.310 
with the cheapest one they have this is
still<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> powerful<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.890> 58<00:00:41.579> 20k<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.690> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
still a powerful one the 58 20k and you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.160 
still a powerful one the 58 20k and you
can<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> specs<00:00:43.980> very<00:00:44.370> powerful<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.809> for

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
can see the specs very powerful so for

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830 
can see the specs very powerful so for
that<00:00:46.350> cpu<00:00:46.920> we're<00:00:47.129> gonna<00:00:47.219> put<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.879> x<00:00:48.180> 99

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that cpu we're gonna put it in a x 99

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.069 
that cpu we're gonna put it in a x 99
