fits<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.730> got<00:02:34.320> this<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.470> where<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.709> light

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
fits on it's got this is where the light

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.780 
fits on it's got this is where the light
would<00:02:35.980> be<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.430> where<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> laser

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
would be and this is where the laser

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.240 
would be and this is where the laser
would<00:02:37.030> be<00:02:37.150> these<00:02:37.570> actually<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.680> light

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
would be these actually can the light

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.580 
would be these actually can the light
one<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.610> flip<00:02:39.820> off<00:02:40.019> kind<00:02:41.019> of<00:02:41.049> like<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.230> fake

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
one can flip off kind of like a fake

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.770 
one can flip off kind of like a fake
light<00:02:41.860> there<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.910> laser<00:02:43.120> one<00:02:43.360> can<00:02:43.570> flip

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
light there and the laser one can flip

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.080 
light there and the laser one can flip
off<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> side<00:02:44.489> kind<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.519> like<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.030> you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
off to the side kind of like that so you

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.850 
off to the side kind of like that so you
can<00:02:46.420> kind<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.840> legit<00:02:47.260> sort<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.620> look

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
battery that I was given which is a

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.250 
battery that I was given which is a
flame<00:03:49.950> nine<00:03:50.950> point<00:03:51.220> nine<00:03:51.250> volt<00:03:51.609> lipo<00:03:52.450> did<00:03:53.109> not

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
flame nine point nine volt lipo did not

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.199 
flame nine point nine volt lipo did not
fit<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.739> here<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.159> I<00:03:54.220> tried<00:03:54.459> modifying<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:55.090> by

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
fit in here and I tried modifying it by

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.479 
fit in here and I tried modifying it by
drumming<00:03:55.599> out<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.870> little<00:03:55.989> section<00:03:56.489> didn't

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
drumming out that little section didn't

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.330 
drumming out that little section didn't
work<00:03:57.609> so<00:03:57.879> well<00:03:57.909> so<00:03:58.689> a<00:03:59.019> good<00:03:59.650> battery<00:03:59.889> that<00:04:00.129> fits

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
work so well so a good battery that fits

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.899 
work so well so a good battery that fits
in<00:04:00.489> here<00:04:00.519> is<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:01.060> hot<00:04:01.419> power<00:04:01.739> 11.1<00:04:02.739> volt<00:04:03.040> lipo
