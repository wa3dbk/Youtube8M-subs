I

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:05.830 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.879 

the<00:00:06.830> h2<00:00:07.460> engine<00:00:08.709> is<00:00:09.709> so<00:00:09.889> simple<00:00:10.160> that<00:00:11.889> nobody

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
the h2 engine is so simple that nobody

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.619 
the h2 engine is so simple that nobody
it's<00:00:13.370> been<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:13.669> biggest<00:00:13.969> barrier<00:00:14.329> that<00:00:14.480> we've

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
it's been the biggest barrier that we've

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.470 
it's been the biggest barrier that we've
had<00:00:14.839> of<00:00:15.589> breaking<00:00:16.400> into<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.670> marketplace<00:00:17.000> in

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
had of breaking into the marketplace in

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.090 
had of breaking into the marketplace in
the<00:00:17.600> 12<00:00:17.840> years<00:00:17.900> essentially<00:00:18.770> what<00:00:18.980> we're

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
the 12 years essentially what we're

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.720 
the 12 years essentially what we're
doing<00:00:19.400> is<00:00:19.610> we're<00:00:20.000> disassociating<00:00:21.730> hydrogen

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
doing is we're disassociating hydrogen

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.430 
doing is we're disassociating hydrogen
and<00:00:22.850> oxygen<00:00:22.970> gases<00:00:23.450> from<00:00:23.810> water<00:00:24.110> through

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
and oxygen gases from water through

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.320 
and oxygen gases from water through
electrolysis<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.370> this<00:00:25.490> runs<00:00:25.760> up<00:00:25.970> from<00:00:26.210> the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
electrolysis and this runs up from the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.390 
electrolysis and this runs up from the
vehicle<00:00:26.660> power<00:00:27.140> supply<00:00:27.590> of<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:28.070> alternator

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
vehicle power supply of the alternator

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.630 
vehicle power supply of the alternator
and<00:00:28.730> what<00:00:29.330> happens<00:00:29.660> is<00:00:29.780> these<00:00:29.930> gases<00:00:30.500> get<00:00:31.340> run

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
and what happens is these gases get run

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.459 
and what happens is these gases get run
down<00:00:31.670> a<00:00:31.880> delivery<00:00:32.419> line<00:00:32.599> into<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:32.930> intake<00:00:33.289> of

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.610 
down a delivery line into the intake of
a<00:00:33.559> vehicle<00:00:33.769> where<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.850> mixes<00:00:35.179> with<00:00:35.359> the

a vehicle where it mixes with the
air-fuel<00:00:36.620> mixture<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.219> what<00:00:38.210> happens<00:00:38.600> with

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
air-fuel mixture and what happens with

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.569 
air-fuel mixture and what happens with
