you can do this one having the proper
tool<00:00:18.609> which<00:00:18.970> would<00:00:19.180> we<00:00:19.300> call<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.720> c-clip<00:00:20.260> tool

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
tool which would we call a c-clip tool

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.740 
tool which would we call a c-clip tool
looks<00:00:21.310> something<00:00:21.520> like<00:00:21.670> this

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
looks something like this

so<00:00:36.250> that<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.579> pins<00:00:36.850> line<00:00:37.780> up<00:00:37.809> with<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.500> actual

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
so that the pins line up with the actual

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.849 
so that the pins line up with the actual
c-clip<00:00:39.429> most<00:00:40.390> tools<00:00:40.629> should<00:00:40.809> do<00:00:40.989> you<00:00:41.589> can<00:00:41.710> also

c-clip most tools should do you can also

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.599 
c-clip most tools should do you can also
substitute<00:00:42.309> this<00:00:42.730> with<00:00:43.659> a<00:00:44.159> small<00:00:45.159> common

ways to do it to take it apart and then
we'll<00:01:00.010> go<00:01:00.129> through<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.399> reassembly<00:01:00.969> of<00:01:01.059> it

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
we'll go through the reassembly of it

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.799 
we'll go through the reassembly of it
from<00:01:01.449> there

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809

take<00:01:56.140> some<00:01:56.320> like<00:01:56.499> dish<00:01:56.710> soap<00:01:57.299> take<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.509> a

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
take some like dish soap take it in a

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.179 
take some like dish soap take it in a
little<00:01:58.749> little<00:01:59.079> basket<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.770> could<00:01:59.920> scrub

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
little little basket and you could scrub

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.209 
little little basket and you could scrub
it<00:02:00.340> out<00:02:00.659> great<00:02:01.659> way<00:02:01.749> to<00:02:01.780> go<00:02:01.929> out<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> gunk<00:02:02.409> get

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
it out great way to go out the gunk get

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.069 
it out great way to go out the gunk get
out<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.429> germs<00:02:03.700> you're<00:02:04.600> doing<00:02:04.810> your<00:02:04.899> thorough

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
out the germs you're doing your thorough

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.499 
out the germs you're doing your thorough
cleaning<00:02:05.439> if<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.490> replace<00:02:06.819> any<00:02:06.999> parts<00:02:07.359> I've

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
cleaning if you replace any parts I've

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.910 
cleaning if you replace any parts I've
obviously<00:02:07.689> at<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.140> time<00:02:08.350> would<00:02:08.500> be<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.740> time

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
obviously at this time would be the time

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.670 
obviously at this time would be the time
to<00:02:08.950> change<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.490> spring<00:02:09.700> out<00:02:10.590> reassembly<00:02:11.590> is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
to change the spring out reassembly is

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.370 
to change the spring out reassembly is
quite<00:02:11.950> simple<00:02:12.370> we<00:02:13.180> have<00:02:13.390> two<00:02:13.720> sides<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
quite simple we have two sides to the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.660 
quite simple we have two sides to the
amount<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.590> water<00:02:14.770> key<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.100> one<00:02:15.310> it's<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.490> little

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
amount of water key of one it's a little

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.190 
amount of water key of one it's a little
smaller<00:02:16.000> hole<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:16.960> someone<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.440> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
smaller hole as someone of a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.630 
smaller hole as someone of a
and<00:02:18.410> then<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.709> have<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.950> little<00:02:19.310> bit<00:02:19.459> larger

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
and then you have a little bit larger

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.059 
and then you have a little bit larger
side<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.319> assembly<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.770> going<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.950> be

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
side so the assembly is going to be

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.010 
side so the assembly is going to be
going<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:22.910> start<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.690> piston

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
going to start with the the piston

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.110 
going to start with the the piston
itself<00:02:24.190> that's<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> be<00:02:25.489> inserted<00:02:25.970> in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
itself that's going to be inserted in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.170 
itself that's going to be inserted in
takes<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.110> little<00:02:27.680> wiggle<00:02:27.890> what<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.550> find<00:02:28.880> helps

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
takes a little wiggle what I find helps

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.199 
takes a little wiggle what I find helps
if<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.420> grab<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> little<00:02:29.989> spindle<00:02:30.920> oil<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.489> put

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
if you grab a little spindle oil and put

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.720 
if you grab a little spindle oil and put
it<00:02:32.270> inside<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.599> never<00:02:32.900> hurts<00:02:33.520> helps<00:02:34.520> keep

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
it inside that never hurts helps keep

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.809 
it inside that never hurts helps keep
keep<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.750> dirt<00:02:35.959> flowing<00:02:36.290> out<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.010> as<00:02:37.459> well<00:02:37.670> as

keep the dirt flowing out and as well as
keeps<00:02:38.120> your<00:02:38.330> water<00:02:38.510> key<00:02:38.720> moving<00:02:39.020> smoothly<00:02:39.410> so

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
keeps your water key moving smoothly so

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.820 
keeps your water key moving smoothly so
with<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.360> receiving<00:02:41.959> end<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.500> we're<00:02:42.739> gonna

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
with the receiving end in we're gonna

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.979 
with the receiving end in we're gonna
kind<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.160> wiggle<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:44.269> takes<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.630> little<00:02:44.810> pop

I always take a little screwdriver push

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.580 
I always take a little screwdriver push
it<00:02:48.380> in<00:02:48.530> touch<00:02:48.709> more<00:02:49.840> at<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:50.989> point<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.440> can

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.440 
operation in the world it even helps if
you<00:03:44.720> have<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:45.340> second<00:03:46.340> screwdriver<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:47.090> do<00:03:47.269> this

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
you have a second screwdriver to do this

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.990 
you have a second screwdriver to do this
with<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.170> you're<00:03:48.980> going<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.190> oppose<00:03:49.489> them<00:03:49.820> and

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
with and you're going to oppose them and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.750 
with and you're going to oppose them and
simply<00:03:50.930> squeeze<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.890> two<00:03:52.040> parts<00:03:52.400> together

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
simply squeeze the two parts together

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.729 
simply squeeze the two parts together
just<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:53.600> we<00:03:53.780> did<00:03:53.930> with<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.079> c-clip<00:03:54.500> tool

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
just like we did with the c-clip tool

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.900 
just like we did with the c-clip tool
and<00:03:55.040> then<00:03:55.640> I'll<00:03:55.850> remove<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.180> from<00:03:56.269> there<00:03:56.540> and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
and then I'll remove it from there and

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.540 
and then I'll remove it from there and
that's<00:03:58.910> all<00:03:59.090> it<00:03:59.209> should<00:03:59.269> take
