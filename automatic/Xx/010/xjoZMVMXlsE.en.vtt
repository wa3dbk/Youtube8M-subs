00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.460 
because I was not expecting those
calipers<00:06:10.670> to<00:06:10.820> do<00:06:11.120> that<00:06:11.360> right<00:06:12.940> so<00:06:14.380> when<00:06:15.380> I

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
calipers to do that right so when I

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.580 
calipers to do that right so when I
install<00:06:15.920> it<00:06:15.950> if<00:06:16.310> you<00:06:16.430> have<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.610> Jeep<00:06:18.460> 99<00:06:19.460> to<00:06:19.670> 104

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
install it if you have a Jeep 99 to 104

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.860 
install it if you have a Jeep 99 to 104
Jeep<00:06:21.590> Grand<00:06:21.740> Cherokee<00:06:22.280> then<00:06:22.730> you'll<00:06:23.600> be<00:06:23.750> able

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
Jeep Grand Cherokee then you'll be able

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.480 
Jeep Grand Cherokee then you'll be able
to<00:06:24.050> see<00:06:24.260> if<00:06:25.510> two<00:06:26.510> inch<00:06:26.720> wheel<00:06:27.560> spacer<00:06:28.220> is

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
to see if two inch wheel spacer is

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.050 
to see if two inch wheel spacer is
enough<00:06:28.910> to<00:06:29.500> clear<00:06:30.500> those<00:06:30.740> because<00:06:31.580> that<00:06:31.850> is

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
enough to clear those because that is

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.270 
enough to clear those because that is
massive

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
massive

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:42.130
