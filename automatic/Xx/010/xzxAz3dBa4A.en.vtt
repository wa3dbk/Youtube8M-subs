00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.430

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
so that's basically what the tweet that
is<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.379> fun<00:00:55.590> tweak<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.129> saw<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.640> thought

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is a little fun tweak I saw it I thought

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.200 
is a little fun tweak I saw it I thought
it<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.449> cool<00:00:59.090> slide<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.300> anywhere

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
it was kind of cool slide it anywhere

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.759 
it was kind of cool slide it anywhere
I'll<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> top<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.739> I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
I'll go up to the top right there and I

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670 
I'll go up to the top right there and I
really<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> top<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.519> right<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> clock<00:01:06.680> he

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
really the top all right on the clock he

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
really the top all right on the clock he
could<00:01:07.920> still<00:01:08.189> slide<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> lot<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> that's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
could still slide to a lot so that's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.789 
could still slide to a lot so that's
basically<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.810> does<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> only

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
basically what it does got the only

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.950 
basically what it does got the only
thing<00:01:13.920> i<00:01:14.010> don't<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.700> whenever<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
thing i don't like about it whenever it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.870 
thing i don't like about it whenever it
locks<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.710> goes<00:01:16.890> back<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.400> bottom<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
locks it goes back to the bottom it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.070 
locks it goes back to the bottom it
would<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.090> cool<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> could<00:01:18.600> drag<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
would be cool if you could drag it to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.289 
would be cool if you could drag it to
any<00:01:19.320> brandy<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.040> stay<00:01:20.340> there<00:01:20.580> wherever

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
any brandy we just stay there wherever

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
any brandy we just stay there wherever
you<00:01:21.509> drag<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.290> goes<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you drag it but it goes back to the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
you drag it but it goes back to the
bottle<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.299> drag<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:26.600> slide<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
bottle you drag it back up slide to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
bottle you drag it back up slide to
unlock<00:01:27.840> some<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> fun<00:01:29.130> tweaking<00:01:29.430> doesn't
