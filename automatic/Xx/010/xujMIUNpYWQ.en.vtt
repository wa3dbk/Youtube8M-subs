00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.000 
voicing on guitar was changed the low
string<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.070> now<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:03.380> an<00:02:03.500> E<00:02:03.740> flat

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
string to now be and then an E flat

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.240 
string to now be and then an E flat
triad<00:02:05.080> so<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.170> get<00:02:06.229> this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.350 

and<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:11.340> when<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> five<00:02:11.970> chord

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and then when you go to the five chord

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.590 
and then when you go to the five chord
