00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
shit I mean it's not perfect but it's

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.360 
shit I mean it's not perfect but it's
really<00:02:51.209> solid<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.989> 3d<00:02:52.380> Zelda<00:02:52.739> solid<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that's saying a lot it's not really

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
that's saying a lot it's not really
surprising<00:02:55.440> cuz<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.459> much

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
surprising cuz it's not that much
