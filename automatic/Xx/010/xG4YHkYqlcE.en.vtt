you<00:04:56.710> know<00:04:56.800> these<00:04:56.920> big<00:04:57.070> panels<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.580> doesn't

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
you know these big panels so it doesn't

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.460 
you know these big panels so it doesn't
affect<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.210> gore-tex<00:04:58.390> is<00:04:58.750> breathability<00:04:59.170> but

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
affect the gore-tex is breathability but

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.290 
affect the gore-tex is breathability but
when<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.920> introduce<00:05:00.100> shock<00:05:00.580> it's<00:05:00.850> going<00:05:01.120> to

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
when you introduce shock it's going to

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.600 
when you introduce shock it's going to
allow<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:02.110> armor<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.500> become<00:05:02.890> rigid<00:05:03.370> because

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
allow the armor to become rigid because

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.220 
allow the armor to become rigid because
it<00:05:03.850> disperses<00:05:04.180> that<00:05:04.510> shock<00:05:04.810> throughout<00:05:05.110> and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
it disperses that shock throughout and

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.960 
it disperses that shock throughout and
you<00:05:05.290> can<00:05:05.410> always<00:05:05.650> upgrade<00:05:05.920> anything<00:05:06.400> that

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
you can always upgrade anything that

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.510 
you can always upgrade anything that
goes<00:05:07.210> from<00:05:07.420> if<00:05:07.660> that's<00:05:08.080> our<00:05:08.290> VP<00:05:08.650> over<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.370> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
goes from if that's our VP over to the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.470 
goes from if that's our VP over to the
d3<00:05:09.940> oh<00:05:09.970> if<00:05:10.270> you<00:05:10.840> like<00:05:11.730> moving<00:05:12.730> past<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:13.270> let's

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
d3 oh if you like moving past that let's

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.450 
d3 oh if you like moving past that let's
talk<00:05:13.660> about<00:05:13.840> gore-tex<00:05:14.410> so<00:05:14.740> we<00:05:14.830> know<00:05:14.950> gore-tex

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
talk about gore-tex so we know gore-tex

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.820 
talk about gore-tex so we know gore-tex
is<00:05:15.580> waterproof<00:05:16.060> breathable<00:05:16.540> it's<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.350> membrane

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
is waterproof breathable it's a membrane

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.920 
is waterproof breathable it's a membrane
they<00:05:18.130> do<00:05:18.190> a<00:05:18.310> lot<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.640> pro<00:05:18.880> shell<00:05:19.180> with<00:05:19.330> Ruka<00:05:19.660> so

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
they do a lot of pro shell with Ruka so

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.420 
they do a lot of pro shell with Ruka so
it<00:05:19.990> means<00:05:20.140> the<00:05:20.260> gore-tex<00:05:20.470> is<00:05:20.830> bonded<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.310> the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
it means the gore-tex is bonded to the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.830 
it means the gore-tex is bonded to the
outer<00:05:21.610> shell<00:05:21.730> it's<00:05:22.030> not<00:05:22.180> a<00:05:22.210> liner<00:05:22.540> that<00:05:22.660> you

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
outer shell it's not a liner that you

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.510 
outer shell it's not a liner that you
pull<00:05:23.140> out<00:05:23.170> that<00:05:23.560> means<00:05:24.010> that<00:05:24.160> it's<00:05:24.340> very

the<00:05:30.190> sweat<00:05:30.340> goes<00:05:30.610> out<00:05:30.790> through<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.060> gore-tex

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
the sweat goes out through the gore-tex

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.480 
the sweat goes out through the gore-tex
membrane<00:05:31.680> evaporates<00:05:32.680> out<00:05:32.830> but<00:05:33.130> when<00:05:33.250> mother

the the lockout zippers here and they're

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.060 
the the lockout zippers here and they're
like<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.360> armas<00:05:43.750> uses<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.169> lockout<00:05:44.620> you'll

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
like the armas uses the lockout you'll

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.590 
like the armas uses the lockout you'll
see<00:05:45.280> a<00:05:45.310> non<00:05:45.610> lockout<00:05:46.000> on<00:05:46.120> something<00:05:46.390> like<00:05:46.480> the
