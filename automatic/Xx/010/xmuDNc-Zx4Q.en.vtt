00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
see well you know I have a second mirror

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.640 
see well you know I have a second mirror
his<00:00:03.300> light<00:00:03.570> shining<00:00:04.080> through<00:00:04.110> there<00:00:04.410> like

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
his light shining through there like

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:25.310 
his light shining through there like
that<00:00:04.859> because<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.790> know

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.999 

that's<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.130> intake<00:00:26.550> port<00:00:27.560> see<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.650> mirror

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
that's the intake port see how mirror

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.650 
that's the intake port see how mirror
shiny<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.179> is

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
shiny it is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.490 
shiny it is
I<00:00:31.489> remember<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.640> didn't<00:00:33.030> hog<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.469> just

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
I remember we didn't hog it out we just

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.200 
I remember we didn't hog it out we just
followed<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.370> regular<00:00:37.399> lines<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
followed the regular lines that the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.630 
followed the regular lines that the
engineers<00:00:39.989> design<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.129> new<00:00:42.649> DX<00:00:43.649> two<00:00:44.040> hundred

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
engineers design this new DX two hundred

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.439 
engineers design this new DX two hundred
and<00:00:44.909> a<00:00:45.210> clone<00:00:45.690> head<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.399> we<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.430> polished<00:00:48.269> it

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
and a clone head and we just polished it

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.469 
and a clone head and we just polished it
like<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.720> mirror<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:50.729> gas<00:00:50.970> goes

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
like a mirror so that the gas goes

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.160 
like a mirror so that the gas goes
through<00:00:51.870> there<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:54.360> gets<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.839> called

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
through there and gets with called

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.490 
through there and gets with called
atomized<00:00:57.019> so<00:00:58.019> there<00:00:58.229> you<00:00:58.409> go<00:01:00.080> what<00:01:01.080> a<00:01:01.110> port

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
atomized so there you go what a port

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.369 
atomized so there you go what a port
should<00:01:01.739> look<00:01:02.009> like

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.390 

that's<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.100> Honda<00:01:06.610> jail<00:01:06.850> right

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.580 

in<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.729> did<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.810> take<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:15.080> just<00:01:16.080> blow<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
in there did we take it and just blow in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
in there did we take it and just blow in
there<00:01:16.799> push<00:01:17.190> down<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.940> with<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.240> bitch<00:01:18.510> see

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
there push down on it with a bitch see

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
there push down on it with a bitch see
what<00:01:19.950> would<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.490> exactly

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
what would that be exactly

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
what would that be exactly
I<00:01:22.100> think<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.250> stock<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> 11<00:01:24.720> pounds

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I think it's stock what is it 11 pounds

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.670 
I think it's stock what is it 11 pounds
yeah<00:01:25.590> 11<00:01:26.190> pounds<00:01:28.130> no<00:01:29.130> air<00:01:29.310> goes<00:01:29.580> through<00:01:30.680> then

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
yeah 11 pounds no air goes through then

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.200 
yeah 11 pounds no air goes through then
pounds<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> intake<00:01:34.909> very<00:01:35.909> tight

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
pounds on this on the intake very tight

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.800 
pounds on this on the intake very tight
so<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.350> how<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> test<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.280> check<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.030> know

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so that's how you test it check I know

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.540 
so that's how you test it check I know
you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.590> must<00:01:40.800> be<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> thousand

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
you have there must be a thousand

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.190 
you have there must be a thousand
different<00:01:41.700> ways<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.509> come<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:42.929> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
different ways that you come up with the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.950 
different ways that you come up with the
doing<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.729> just<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:44.910> my<00:01:45.149> way<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
doing this just see my way is the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
doing this just see my way is the
easiest<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.679> everybody<00:01:47.100> those<00:01:47.369> guys<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
easiest for everybody those guys on the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960 
easiest for everybody those guys on the
internet<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.990> show<00:01:49.289> enough<00:01:49.679> man<00:01:50.070> they're
