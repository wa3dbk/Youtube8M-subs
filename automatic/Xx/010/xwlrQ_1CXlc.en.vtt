I'm sorry going on skyhigh cardio heat
shrink<00:00:46.019> so<00:00:47.019> here<00:00:47.199> we<00:00:47.289> got<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:48.070> ground<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:49.570> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
shrink so here we got the ground for the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.500 
shrink so here we got the ground for the
alternator<00:00:50.920> simpler<00:00:51.610> from<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:52.000> opportunity

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
alternator simpler from the opportunity

alternator simpler from the opportunity
to<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.659> battery<00:00:53.129> there's<00:00:54.129> this<00:00:54.219> reason<00:00:54.460> suck

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
to the battery there's this reason suck

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.189
