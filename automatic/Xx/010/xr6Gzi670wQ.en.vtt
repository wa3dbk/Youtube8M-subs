where I want to drill and now I'm using

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.770 
where I want to drill and now I'm using
a<00:02:28.890> little<00:02:29.040> ball<00:02:29.310> burnisher<00:02:29.880> or<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> divot<00:02:30.510> tool

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780

to<00:02:31.620> make<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.340> indentation<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.270> clay<00:02:33.630> it's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
to make an indentation in the clay it's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.070 
to make an indentation in the clay it's
still<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.530> dry<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.520> still<00:02:35.580> soft<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.930> it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
still it's dry but it's still soft so it

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.990 
still it's dry but it's still soft so it
dents<00:02:37.380> easily<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.190> gives<00:02:38.459> me<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.670> place

for this particular one I'm going to be

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.420 
for this particular one I'm going to be
adding<00:03:47.670> accent<00:03:48.540> silver<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.980> medallion

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
adding accent silver to the medallion

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.340

piece<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.390> looks<00:03:51.720> like<00:03:51.810> it's<00:03:52.140> made

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
piece so that it looks like it's made

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.740 
piece so that it looks like it's made
from<00:03:52.380> silver<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.790> doesn't<00:03:54.180> cost<00:03:54.359> near<00:03:54.660> as

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
from silver but doesn't cost near as

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.210 
from silver but doesn't cost near as
much<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.700> first<00:03:56.970> I'm<00:03:57.120> dicing<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.320> then<00:03:58.890> I'm

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
much so first I'm dicing it and then I'm

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.060 
much so first I'm dicing it and then I'm
going<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.730> remove<00:04:00.359> oxidation<00:04:00.989> from<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.739> area

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
going to remove oxidation from the area

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.949 
going to remove oxidation from the area
that<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.280> want<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.700> apply<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.000> accent<00:04:03.540> silver

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
that I want to apply the accent silver

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.759 
that I want to apply the accent silver
to<00:04:04.640> then<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.790> mix<00:04:06.030> up<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.420> apply<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:07.230> accent

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
to then I mix up and apply the accent

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.210 
to then I mix up and apply the accent
silver<00:04:08.569> fire<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.140> then<00:04:10.410> polish<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.400> piece

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
silver fire it and then polish the piece

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.500 
silver fire it and then polish the piece
another<00:04:14.220> way<00:04:14.459> that<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.670> could<00:04:14.940> do<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.299> would

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
another way that I could do this would

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.610 
another way that I could do this would
be<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.930> make<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:17.600> medallion<00:04:18.600> out<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.260> silver

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
be to make the medallion out of silver

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.229 
be to make the medallion out of silver
clay<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.010> then<00:04:20.100> rivet<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.609> on<00:04:20.789> or<00:04:21.030> bronze

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
clay and then rivet that on or bronze

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.900 
clay and then rivet that on or bronze
clay<00:04:21.600> or<00:04:21.840> whatever<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.470> want<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.039> I<00:04:23.729> could

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
clay or whatever I want and I could

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.170 
clay or whatever I want and I could
rivet<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.360> or<00:04:24.539> solder<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.110> place<00:04:25.470> as<00:04:25.710> well

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
rivet it or solder it in place as well

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.550 
rivet it or solder it in place as well
so<00:04:27.180> this<00:04:27.330> copper<00:04:27.750> piece<00:04:27.930> then<00:04:28.169> can<00:04:28.410> be

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
so this copper piece then can be

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.089 
so this copper piece then can be
finished<00:04:28.919> any<00:04:29.130> way<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.789> want<00:04:30.919> now<00:04:31.919> we'll

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
finished any way that you want now we'll

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.920 
finished any way that you want now we'll
go<00:04:32.190> ahead<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.370> make<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.820> silver<00:04:33.390> backplate

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
go ahead and make the silver backplate

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.250 
go ahead and make the silver backplate
for<00:04:34.680> this<00:04:34.830> I'm<00:04:35.039> using<00:04:35.280> art<00:04:35.789> clay<00:04:36.120> silver

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
for this I'm using art clay silver

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.770 
for this I'm using art clay silver
art<00:04:37.500> clay<00:04:37.800> has<00:04:38.040> kind<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.030> more<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.360> rubbery

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
art clay has kind of a more of a rubbery

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.150 
art clay has kind of a more of a rubbery
feel<00:04:40.200> than<00:04:40.790> pmc<00:04:41.790> does<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.500> i<00:04:43.500> have<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:44.040> use

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
feel than pmc does and i have to use

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.130 
feel than pmc does and i have to use
quite<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.430> bit<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:44.670> pressure<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.300> roll<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:45.960> out

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
quite a bit of pressure to roll it out

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.820 
quite a bit of pressure to roll it out
so<00:04:46.760> I'm<00:04:47.760> also<00:04:47.970> going<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.510> roll<00:04:48.720> this<00:04:49.140> piece<00:04:49.500> to

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
so I'm also going to roll this piece to

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.930 
so I'm also going to roll this piece to
four<00:04:50.250> cards<00:04:50.550> thick<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:52.430> then<00:04:53.430> I'm<00:04:53.550> going<00:04:53.850> to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
four cards thick and then I'm going to

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.450 
four cards thick and then I'm going to
put<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.810> brass<00:04:55.260> texture<00:04:55.890> plate<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.340> pick

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
put it on a brass texture plate to pick

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.910 
put it on a brass texture plate to pick
up<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.730> real<00:04:56.970> subtle<00:04:57.440> texture<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.590> looks<00:04:58.800> like

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
up a real subtle texture that looks like

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.490 
up a real subtle texture that looks like
it's<00:04:59.130> been<00:04:59.220> hammered<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.060> then<00:05:00.930> again<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.290> want

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
it's been hammered and then again I want

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.160 
it's been hammered and then again I want
to<00:05:01.530> use<00:05:01.740> pretty<00:05:02.010> firm<00:05:02.280> pressure<00:05:02.870> get<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.900> nice

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
to use pretty firm pressure get a nice

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.820 
to use pretty firm pressure get a nice
impression<00:05:05.540> now<00:05:06.540> put<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.870> textured<00:05:07.350> clay<00:05:07.590> on

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
impression now put the textured clay on

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.100 
impression now put the textured clay on
a<00:05:07.860> tough<00:05:08.220> card<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.820> then<00:05:09.750> I'll<00:05:09.870> put<00:05:10.080> the

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
a tough card and then I'll put the

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.650 
a tough card and then I'll put the
template<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.370> shape<00:05:11.610> template<00:05:12.060> over<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.420> top

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
template the shape template over the top

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.890 
template the shape template over the top
this<00:05:13.260> is<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.620> same<00:05:13.890> sized<00:05:14.850> hole<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.570> used

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
this is the same sized hole that I used

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.950 
this is the same sized hole that I used
for<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.620> copper<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.430> silver<00:05:18.390> clay<00:05:18.750> won't

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
for the copper and the silver clay won't

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.770 
for the copper and the silver clay won't
shrink<00:05:19.290> as<00:05:19.470> much<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:20.130> using<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.060> same<00:05:21.300> size<00:05:21.570> is

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
shrink as much so using the same size is

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.030 
shrink as much so using the same size is
going<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:21.990> give<00:05:22.140> us<00:05:22.260> actually<00:05:22.680> two<00:05:22.890> different

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
going to give us actually two different

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.330 
going to give us actually two different
sizes<00:05:23.520> in<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.060> end<00:05:24.620> now<00:05:25.620> I'll<00:05:25.770> let<00:05:25.890> this<00:05:26.070> piece

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
sizes in the end now I'll let this piece

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.670 
sizes in the end now I'll let this piece
dry<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:27.000> once<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:27.480> dry<00:05:27.660> I<00:05:27.750> need<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.290> refine

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
dry and once it's dry I need to refine

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.160 
dry and once it's dry I need to refine
the<00:05:28.890> edges<00:05:29.040> with<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.670> sanding<00:05:30.180> stick<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.930> remove

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
the edges with a sanding stick to remove

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.890 
the edges with a sanding stick to remove
any<00:05:31.320> burrs<00:05:32.150> then<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.240> want<00:05:33.420> to<00:05:33.480> hold<00:05:33.660> the

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
any burrs then I want to hold the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.520 
any burrs then I want to hold the
sanding<00:05:34.380> stick<00:05:34.650> and<00:05:34.890> an<00:05:35.010> angle<00:05:35.490> so<00:05:35.760> that<00:05:35.790> I<00:05:35.970> can

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
sanding stick and an angle so that I can

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.740 
sanding stick and an angle so that I can
remove<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:38.040> edge<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.880> want<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.150> round<00:05:39.330> this

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
remove the edge I want to round this

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.530 
remove the edge I want to round this
edge<00:05:40.020> slightly<00:05:40.520> but<00:05:41.520> really<00:05:41.940> kind<00:05:42.150> of<00:05:42.270> more<00:05:42.450> of

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
edge slightly but really kind of more of

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.420 
edge slightly but really kind of more of
a<00:05:42.600> bevel<00:05:42.990> so<00:05:43.200> I'm<00:05:43.320> going<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.560> just<00:05:43.800> take<00:05:44.010> it<00:05:44.220> and

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
a bevel so I'm going to just take it and

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.350 
a bevel so I'm going to just take it and
use<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.090> in<00:05:45.300> an<00:05:45.480> angle<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.170> go<00:05:46.410> around<00:05:46.680> and

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
use it in an angle and go around and

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.500 
use it in an angle and go around and
take<00:05:48.360> that<00:05:48.570> edge<00:05:48.810> off<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:50.240> sanding<00:05:51.240> stick

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
take that edge off the sanding stick

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.290 
take that edge off the sanding stick
gets<00:05:51.720> clogged<00:05:52.050> with<00:05:52.380> clay<00:05:52.740> powder<00:05:53.040> as<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.490> use

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
gets clogged with clay powder as I use

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.840 
gets clogged with clay powder as I use
it<00:05:54.540> and<00:05:54.780> occasionally<00:05:55.650> I'll<00:05:56.040> need<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.430> dust

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
it and occasionally I'll need to dust

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.450 
it and occasionally I'll need to dust
that<00:05:57.030> off<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.750> use<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.260> paintbrush<00:05:58.770> that<00:05:58.980> I've

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
that off I use a paintbrush that I've

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.250 
that off I use a paintbrush that I've
shortened<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.180> bristles<00:06:00.690> on<00:06:00.840> I've<00:06:00.990> cut<00:06:01.170> them

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
shortened the bristles on I've cut them

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.920 
shortened the bristles on I've cut them
to<00:06:01.410> about<00:06:01.620> an<00:06:01.800> eighth<00:06:02.040> of<00:06:02.250> an<00:06:02.340> inch<00:06:02.430> in<00:06:02.790> length

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
to about an eighth of an inch in length

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.320 
to about an eighth of an inch in length
so<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.440> makes<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.740> nice<00:06:04.890> scrub<00:06:05.280> brush<00:06:05.610> that

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
so it makes a nice scrub brush that

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.680 
so it makes a nice scrub brush that
cleans<00:06:07.260> off<00:06:07.470> all<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.920> powder<00:06:08.250> and<00:06:08.670> then<00:06:09.570> I

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
cleans off all that powder and then I

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.670 
cleans off all that powder and then I
can<00:06:09.960> use<00:06:10.560> the<00:06:10.800> sanding<00:06:11.190> stick<00:06:11.460> again<00:06:12.680> after

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
can use the sanding stick again after

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.860 
can use the sanding stick again after
firing<00:06:14.160> my<00:06:14.310> silver<00:06:14.730> piece<00:06:15.000> then<00:06:15.390> I'm<00:06:15.690> going<00:06:15.840> to

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
firing my silver piece then I'm going to

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.530 
firing my silver piece then I'm going to
put<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.140> two<00:06:16.350> pieces<00:06:16.590> together<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:18.180> I<00:06:18.390> want

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
put the two pieces together and I want

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.320 
put the two pieces together and I want
to<00:06:18.630> mark<00:06:19.100> through<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.280> holes<00:06:20.490> on<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:20.850> copper

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
to mark through the holes on the copper

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.230 
to mark through the holes on the copper
piece<00:06:21.600> to<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.650> silver<00:06:23.220> so<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:23.970> I<00:06:24.180> know

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
piece to the silver so that I know

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
piece to the silver so that I know
exactly<00:06:24.660> where<00:06:25.170> to<00:06:25.200> drill<00:06:25.890> my<00:06:26.550> holes<00:06:27.140> then<00:06:28.140> I'm

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
exactly where to drill my holes then I'm
