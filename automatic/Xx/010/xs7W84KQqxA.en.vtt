00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:09.450
 hi guys okay just Hadrian's website 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 integrity 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 and today I'll be introducing 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.250
 Are you a mike I come from? 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.180
 I've been using lately, right? 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.519
 It's the lapel microphone, and it's 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.310
 I see so many people in the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.890
 the internet asking about which 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
 is the microphone that people use 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 to pay for the interviews is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.860
 especially when they are so it is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.629
 a distance from the camera, right? 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 I have an option that I bought to make 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.129

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.800
 I'll put it so close for you to see 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.350
 Two little boxes of these here, one for 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.320
 You connect the microphone from ok. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.320
 the other box you plug into the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.460
 camera onu the device in the case I use 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.769
 It's for me, it's doing a lot. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.159

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.159
 is a brand that is not very well known to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.960
 Sometimes I'm beating that I'm 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.369
 letting go of the microphone was a noise there 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.930
 rolling a noise but it's more for 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:34.590
 Take better advantage of you touch and it's not 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 It is very well known that this tag is p and w 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:44.880

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.160
 or adapt as it comes is this circle 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.910
 O here next I go to get closer to one 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.209
 a little 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.209
 OK 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.690

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.230
 one of the boxes that is the box that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.250
 Is the camera connected? Is it ok? 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.110
 and I put this zinho adapter here 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:38.980
 For what to learn my tripod that uses 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:41.620
 a tripod, I use a tripod and post 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.340
 to have the camera do not keep swaying there 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.350
 I adapted from here. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.340
 tripod with the camera or with the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.770
 The phone you use to film here is é 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.850
 the way he comes that you one side 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:05.010
 you connect on the phone or on the camera 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.320
 and that side here who lvv format in l is 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.380
 Do you connect to the device I have a 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.230
 place of earphone and microphone 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.470
 okay you plug in the case is capturing the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.140
 you plug into the microphone 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.160
 the little button volume volume the team 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.170
 do not increase power on / off , then 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.600
 I do not have much secret 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.350
 this is another one that goes to the microphone of 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.870
 lapel 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.940
 're there and just to talk to you so 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.280
 His model so far I told the model 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:45.030
 from loeb yw m5 but his brand is dust and 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.890
 the biota and I've been coming here for you 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.260
 is doing your research 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.120
 You get the name right, avoid websites. 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.870
 out of Brazil that comes from this 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.400
 microphone for a price up is lower 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.950
 I just prefer to find it on the market. 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.500
 free because I never had or did not 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.720
 had to defend and buy in those 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.580
 sites that is outside Brazil do not know 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.640
 How long does it take also to 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.640
 to arrive 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.299
 I bought there is the free market is the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.620
 O seller it delivers correctly 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.199
 the speedy is super fast 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.590
 kind service and accompanied everything there 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:35.919
 the car procedure and out of there that comes 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:38.650
 also does not hit him and reads beaten 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:44.740
 believe the legal blows right 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:47.409
 but here it comes with two phones is one is okay 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.979
 headset and microphone 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:53.469
 and the other is okay headset for you 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.930
 is using if we do not use 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:58.449
 These are why I call the na 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.940
 camera or on the phone is shooting and a 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.580
 lapel microphone is dealing with the 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.550
 distance flexibility to power 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.789
 I am a little more of a quality 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.259
 and so these microphones usually 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.030
 have a rather high price and 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.030
 according to research the research I 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.300
 I did and I was seeing values ​​there 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:26.110
 of 1,500 reais, and so what I 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.930
 I found it cheaper so it is and went outside 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.580
 in an international site was a thousand and 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:36.550
 two hundred reais and this one I found 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.279
 for only 500 reais 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.029
 personnel in the range of 500 r 480 to 500 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.789
 real 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:45.729
 I'll leave the link below this video and 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.590
 No, it's not that I get a commission, I'm not. 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.349
 affiliate of that product is facing 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.340
 only indicating there to the people who 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:57.279
 really interested and better 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.379
 there it would be the own research of each and 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:02.409
 but it is an indication that 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:05.259
 I'm giving it to anyone who wants to start it. 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:07.599
 in a way that is not that investing a 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.909
 A little higher value is a 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.460
 value so cheap the quality of it I 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:15.190
 I think it's a quality that meets the 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.690
 needs depends on what you want 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.539
 depending on this you may be 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.740
 thinking he has up to a higher positions 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:24.440
 for you have one is so wearing 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.900
 the lapel microphone that costs 1500 and 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.900
 1800 or even more that also exists 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.849
 values more than that , but it's a 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.560
 matter of decision and meet 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:39.460
 needs of each 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.419
 I will then reach there another tip and 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.240
 comments just below 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.250
 and even makes it a criticism of 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.889
 respect for something that I left 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.949
 explain well there about the apparatus 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:54.830
 but that's how my channel is also on top 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:56.509
 Well, that's how easy it is and when I 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.639
 you have new videos or you're always 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.039
 presenting any type of doubt is 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.620
 you receive a notification there when 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.419
 You either on the channel or from your email 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.830
 you received the notification then you 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.099
 it is within everything that is 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.330
 rolling the digital eternity 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:15.130
 featuring a novelty launch 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.130
 for you're a hug even more
