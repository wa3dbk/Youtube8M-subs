00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.929
 avocado alley where of voice to

 ear voice has gone and for his and for 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.130

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.899
 terrifying but very interesting 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.329
 the streets of the center of the country are 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.329
 full of scary stories 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.860
 stories that certainly do not bristle the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.860
 skin like this 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.200
 one of the most commented legends in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 this avocado alley is that of the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.340
 girl who was brutally murdered by 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.940
 a motorist who fled 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.900
 left the little girl here dying and a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.550
 be strange came to just give it 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.280
 the opportunity to continue living 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.710
 change your soul from that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.920
 moment in this alley the soul of the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.700
 small round at 12 o'clock in the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.829
 night 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.299
 and if there are many legends in 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:22.450
 this street many but the truth 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.229
 I honestly do not know how many years it's been 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.710
 living 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.630
 I have been more than 30 years and in 30 years 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.850
 has seen absolutely nothing strange or 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.399
 I happened nothing out of the ordinary and 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.060
 not only the living are those that are 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.060
 to be more afraid 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.390
 to get to this place is a bit 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.189
 complicated since the series of alleys 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.530
 that you are to give with 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.270
 this virgin with this image that is said 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.899
 and now at 12 o'clock at night 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.619
 It takes a lot of skill 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.990
 mental this image that we see right now 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.950
 course very closely and we have the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 opportunity to observe then talk 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.119
 who shed some tears of blood 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.970
 at 12 o'clock at night as 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.130
 you say that the virgin cries in some 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.950
 moment because I no longer have good day 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.590
 experience but if you speak it is said of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.830
 that the virgin is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.380
 shed tears of blood 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.630
 although it has never been possible to check 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.420
 this legend the image of the virgin 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.770
 stay with fresh flowers always in 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.230
 a corner where they still circulate 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.390
 pedestrians and cars despite being 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.490
 very narrow dark and very gloomy 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.290
 another one of the most talked about legends 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.170
 found in some books that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.720
 They sold in bookstores nearby 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.030
 coyoacán especially that a man already 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.190
 of age a man of mature age who was 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.900
 military whenever I walked by this 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.970
 alley was a little boy 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.790
 that he wanted to play with him such was his 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.550
 despair of daily find out what 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.850
 that ended up giving him a brutal beating 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.819
 and hanging it on this avocado tree and 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.280
 from that moment the soul of the child 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.350
 Grief at midnight 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.350
 much is said about the 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.050
 stories that happen in some legends 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.840
 creepy and there are some legends that are 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.450
 hear moans and strange things 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.800
 have heard something 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.310
 then sometimes try to process 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.310
 at night 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.910
 in short stories we hear truths not 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.640
 we know that's how you're sure there are 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.130
 many more in your city ​​or possibly 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.290
 only in your mind 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.210
 and that's how we once again discovered 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.760
 the urban stories of this great 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.380
 city will be in truth lie will not 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.150
 we know the only thing that remains is 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.880

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.300
 part of the legend of the alley of 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.560
