00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 today people this is a blog from sunday to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.020
 people are doing here is inversion of 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
 do again minecraft on Sunday and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.920
 blog on Saturday because I did not record a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.019
 minecraft video on time because I do not 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 I paid the monthly fee of my server 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.430
 they blocked the service I had to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.320
 pay and wait for him to unlock me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.359
 I managed to record but what we are going to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.519
 to do this time is to respond 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.260
 twenty-two questions that you 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.750
 they sent for twitter 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.689
 so come on what inspires you to do 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.730
 videos nothing in particular usually I 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.219
 I wait for an idea of ​​my head, yes she 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.059
 seeing nothing and I try to execute in my 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.680
 videos 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.960
 the most difficult of this whole thing of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
 inspiration is not to be normally inspired 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 we have many ideas 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.559
 complicated is to turn those ideas into 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 a real thing execute the ideas that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.309
 people have is the thing that people 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.809
 usually does not make you try to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.640
 at least with my videos here 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.059
 Because I have a channel, what do you think? 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.149
 of curitiba is organized civilized and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.969
 cold as is the best part of seul tuber 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.129
 without a shadow of a doubt the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.260
 best thing is you work from home and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.240
 have your own schedule you can 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.400
 wake up and sleep when you want 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.650
 as long as you meet your goals 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.479
 of production of your videos, this may 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.259
 not the healthiest thing in the world 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.900
 but being able to sleep and wake up when you want 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 It's a good man, I'm not going to deny what you are. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.790
 I used to be the tube I used to be 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.170
 master's degree in European studies in germany 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 if I close a bottle of soda 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.060
 hard and I managed to open means 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 that I 'm stronger or weaker than 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.290
 long answer to this question has the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.720
 see with the friction of your hand in the cap 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.570
 and the cap with the thread on the body of the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.119
 bottle the short answer and I do not know how 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.340
 Did you meet minecraft if I did not? 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.780
 Deception I saw a news channel press 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.210
 radio that they had 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.130
 started selling minecraft alpha 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.649
 How curious, I went there and bought it as I 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.710
 I do the blog is like this or you get a 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.880
 camera understands if you put notes in the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.399
 your computer 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.619
 selig a light on your face and if it starts 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.700
 speak simple as well as how many hours per 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.280
 What day do you usually spend in front of your pc? 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.590
 12 hours and I'm not proud 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.810
 They were the plans for his life. 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.849
 if you had not entered this 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.560
 youtube were very simple I wanted 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.120
 academic career turn 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 university professor and researcher 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.349
 when you first shot your video 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.080
 Did you think I was going to continue recording 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.610
 for a long time certainly not because the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.739
 My first video was to show you 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.269
 My Brazilian family was like mine. 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.730
 life in germany while i was 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.340
 studying there then, no, I did not have 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.410
 no claim if i was ever there no 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.380
 arrived I'm still waiting since March 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.720
 Do you prefer console or pc because I 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.670
 I prefer pc because it is a platform 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.829
 open and more open 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.840
 developers if we had not 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.120
 pc we probably would never have 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.430
 games like minecraft for example to 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.019
 console that has made you super 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.150
 nintendo was what I played for more 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.250
 time in which countries have you traveled 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.780
 come on I've already been to a lot of 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.370
 place at the time when I 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.170
 I studied in germany and also in the year 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.880
 past because a lot of company to me 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.010
 sent a lot of place to make a 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.650
 lots of stuff but we will try to sink 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.420
 now united states portugal germany 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.660
 france spain and scotland uk 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.420
 denmark russia australia and china 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.160
 ready the mário is your favorite to me 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.829
 I'll ask objectively 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.540
 to say that Mario 3631 best Mario more 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.730
 a landmark that I most like bitter today 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.430
 because that's what I played the most benfica 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.959
 or port is a difficult question, I'm going 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.850
 have to say port because I already 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.100
 I put my feet there so I guess 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.040
 I have a greater proximity to 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.040
 region of the team but does not play in 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.269
 benfica fans all you Portuguese 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.370
 are in my heart true what you 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.769
 I wanted to have a job when I grew up 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.769
 Like every self-respecting child I wanted 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.389
 to be a paleontologist astronaut and 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.519
 helicopter because you stopped with the 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.040
 channel it reports if you are not 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.630
 informed is reporter of the blog channel 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.370
 that I had here on youtube exists until 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.650
 today you can go there and watch the videos of 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.880
 past but finally the idea of ending 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.190
 he at the door because I think the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.320
 I-reporter a proposal that I had in 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.659
 when I was in germany with 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.910
 another kind of head with other things 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.920
 what was going on in my mind 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.140
 now it seems that things have changed and I 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.360
 no longer feel free to continue 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.040
 with that it was simple so it 's a thing 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.450
 that was in the past had a moment 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.520
 important in my life in my life. 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.140
 youtube career but I think the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.030
 People have to know how to turn the pages and 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.420
 to continue with the things that come 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.190
 front then the alfredo t-shirts go 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.290
 be sold to subscribers 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.410
 the answer is yes even already has a 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.120
 good part of which the question is ready 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.340
 is that I can not sell on behalf of 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.930
 bureaucracy national thanks brazil 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.610
 mario game that was released 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.160
 Lately you would like to play 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.870

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.300
 nintendo wii but I have not played yet 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.010

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.230

 saltpetre previous game of the series I liked 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.630
 Pretty if this is going to turn out series I do not 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.250
 I know it depends on whether the game is good or not 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.370
 We'll figure out which one is the best. 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.290
