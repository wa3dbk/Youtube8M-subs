ringer<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:35.120> then<00:02:36.120> on<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.630> bottom<00:02:37.670> there<00:02:38.670> is

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
ringer and then on the bottom there is

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.360 
ringer and then on the bottom there is
the<00:02:39.680> port<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.990> charging<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:43.950> such<00:02:44.130> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the port for the charging and such and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.060 
the port for the charging and such and
then<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.940> new<00:02:45.240> addition<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:46.020> think<00:02:46.350> these

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
then the new addition is I think these

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.760 
then the new addition is I think these
speakers<00:02:47.670> were<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.090> their<00:02:48.390> niche<00:02:48.900> on<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
speakers were not their niche on the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.190 
speakers were not their niche on the
previous<00:02:50.160> iPads<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:52.620> there's<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.700> back

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
previous iPads and then there's the back

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.630 
previous iPads and then there's the back
so<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.500> see<00:02:55.740> not<00:02:56.280> much<00:02:56.400> has<00:02:56.580> changed

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
so as you can see not much has changed

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.190 
so as you can see not much has changed
from<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> other<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.360> but<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.780> quite<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.050> bit

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
from the other one but it is quite a bit

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.950 
from the other one but it is quite a bit
lighter<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.130> show<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.480> in<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.810> little

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
lighter as I will show you in a little

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.980 
lighter as I will show you in a little
comparison<00:03:01.380> with<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.710> other<00:03:01.860> iPad<00:03:02.990> alright

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
see right here the bezels thinner on the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.010 
see right here the bezels thinner on the
sides<00:03:46.290> too<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.700> can<00:03:47.850> actually<00:03:48.090> place<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
sides too and you can actually place the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
that it cuts off quite a bit so it's

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.100 
that it cuts off quite a bit so it's
definitely<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.120> bit<00:04:00.300> smaller<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.930> it's

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
definitely a bit smaller and it's

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.729 
definitely a bit smaller and it's
definitely<00:04:01.910> definitely<00:04:02.910> very<00:04:03.390> cool<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:03.959> do<00:04:04.650> i
