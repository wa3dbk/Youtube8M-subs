that's<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.220> huge<00:03:17.610> game<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.120> actually<00:03:18.750> resulted

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
that's a huge game and actually resulted

in tremendous you know real-world gaming
performance<00:03:22.280> benefits<00:03:23.280> there<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.640> if<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.970> are

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
performance benefits there so if you are

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.810 
performance benefits there so if you are
willing<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.630> tweak<00:03:25.110> some<00:03:25.140> software<00:03:25.740> which<00:03:26.700> is

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
willing to tweak some software which is

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.160 
willing to tweak some software which is
actually<00:03:27.090> really<00:03:27.209> easy<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.690> do<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:28.020> just

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
actually really easy to do we just

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.780 
actually really easy to do we just
turned<00:03:28.380> our<00:03:28.500> power<00:03:28.680> target<00:03:29.100> up<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.340> 110

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
turned our power target up to 110

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.150 
turned our power target up to 110
percent<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.360> change<00:03:30.990> what<00:03:31.230> our<00:03:31.260> GPU<00:03:31.709> offset

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
percent and change what our GPU offset

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.280 
percent and change what our GPU offset
was<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.700> all<00:03:32.910> worked<00:03:33.240> pretty<00:03:33.750> easily<00:03:34.170> out

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
was and it all worked pretty easily out
