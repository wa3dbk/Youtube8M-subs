00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 arriving thing for his second run 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 attention it's very important there this 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.919
 are the medals that are in the process of 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.880
 To draw oneself 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.269
 will she be able to get out 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.759
 Big game 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.460
 the Czech we see that it is played very 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.910
 little things first to copper mountain 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.289
 this season she loves skateboarding so 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.820
 on the rails it should produce some 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.850
 good job 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.400
 little mistakes but I 'm fine 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.270
 grew up with the Caribbean in 180 it's 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.270
 clean and determined 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.670
 here and there he will not do that he will have to 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.540
 get out of the road technique she 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:45.080
 back to France is normal with the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.870
 to hit one on the head is not good 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.910
 not good at all oyo worried rise 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.750
 because the ape between chauvat and is 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 left and tapped on the head 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.860
 yeah big mistake square we saw at the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.019
 head who left that went strong in 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.740
 back it's okay okay 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:12.320
 thankfully what a pity to stop 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.670
 on a fall like this one then 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.490
 that she had made a first 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.479
 really perfect performance 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.250
 yeah but then I think they had 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.930
 they had at heart of I think that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.210
 on the last her last job she 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.350
 wanted to do 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.790
 she wanted to do a little bit better and 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.409
 maybe she had that she has a 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.150
 little bit forgotten the res 200 watts 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.580
 that she's focused that's a 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.170
 little too much to project on the end 2 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.540
 on the last jump and she has a little 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.920
 forgot the rest level of speed and 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.440
 she is concerned about a lot of amplitude in 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.420
 what a purpose to 540 young people have reassured the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.370
 end anyway I'm sure she 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.290
 was coming 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.780
 smile we do not like to have that kind of 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.230
 poll because it can be really 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.230
 dangerous 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:06.710
 go the cheers of the public in 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:09.270
 part slide and register 180 here city 80 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.400
 that was what we have I do not think they 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.020
 meet the fall but it will come if 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.780
 I think that one south 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.510
 here here and here see it is steep 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.160
 she and she is very high very far 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.140
 that's the mistake of kara it happens to you 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.670
 beautiful start that can happen to you you're 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.470
 your second day of his board 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.150
 I think she may have lost 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.190
 knowledge a little bit but we see 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.720
 sahraoui a dislocated puppet 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.490
 there we see as soon as they see the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.700
 oulala reception i'm too far so 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.670
 she and she does a rotation between 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.230
 paula the helmet moves it's during 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.730
 frankly when we see when we see 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.220
 the falls like that in slow motion we get 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.200
 ask how the body 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.600
 human can withstand these falls 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.150
 because she's coming she's she's 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.470
 almost month the highest point the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.470
 not all the disappointment is almost to 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.720
 on snow 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.060
 a little more and a little softer but 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.090
 but she went under the ovations of the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.090
 public 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.660
 check who made a first run 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.030
 at 86 points 25 and who had long wall 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.080
 result of reference are found in 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.180
 down and then I'm really very severe and 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.770
 luckily she was probably embarrassed 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.200
 by the brightness because it sells there 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.660
 I swear to you the moment he was 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.770
 launched the sun pierced and there we are 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.680
 really in the configuration in 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.960
 lapierre a white day is very very 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.390
 great humanity 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.950
 huawei we see her headphones so she 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.780
 sent to the broken puzzle that's 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.470
 incredible to the importance of the headphones 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.470
 maybe a little bit 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.590
 the important capital better harvest 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.590
 caste lost in two
