one-eighth inch for areas where I need
the<00:00:25.880> curve<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.869> I'll<00:00:29.990> use<00:00:30.199> three<00:00:30.679> sixteenth

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310

what Maya scenery profile will be then

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.780 
what Maya scenery profile will be then
I'll<00:00:47.600> use<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.869> jigsaw<00:00:48.619> and<00:00:49.390> cut<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.540> top<00:00:50.780> as<00:00:51.790> you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.350 
the fascia is basically mounted on one
by<00:01:15.030> twos<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:16.260> I<00:01:16.290> attached<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.520> joist<00:01:17.910> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.050

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.830 

when<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.990> lay<00:02:55.500> out<00:02:55.530> your<00:02:55.920> control<00:02:56.610> panel<00:02:56.940> make

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
when you lay out your control panel make

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.380 
when you lay out your control panel make
sure<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:59.340> you're<00:02:59.520> not<00:02:59.610> going<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.060> any

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
sure that you're not going to have any

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.240 
sure that you're not going to have any
obstructions<00:03:02.780> behind<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.990> where<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.010> mount

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
obstructions behind it where you mount

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.199 
obstructions behind it where you mount
your<00:03:05.340> switches<00:03:06.050> as<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.200> have<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> joist<00:03:08.190> here<00:03:08.610> or

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
your switches as I have a joist here or

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.820 
your switches as I have a joist here or
a<00:03:09.270> fascia<00:03:10.260> support<00:03:11.270> so<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:12.330> measured<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.200> I

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
a fascia support so I measured out and I

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.199 
a fascia support so I measured out and I
made<00:03:14.070> sure<00:03:14.100> there<00:03:14.459> was<00:03:14.490> plenty<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.910> clearance

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
made sure there was plenty of clearance

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.160 
made sure there was plenty of clearance
away<00:03:16.140> from<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.500> for<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:17.340> switches<00:03:17.820> here<00:03:18.170> and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
away from it for the switches here and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.540 
away from it for the switches here and
you<00:03:19.260> also<00:03:19.380> want<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.920> make<00:03:19.980> sure<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.370> don't

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
you also want to make sure you don't

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.420 
you also want to make sure you don't
crowd<00:03:20.820> themself<00:03:21.300> too<00:03:21.510> much<00:03:21.770> where<00:03:22.770> switches

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
crowd themself too much where switches

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.340 
crowd themself too much where switches
will<00:03:23.910> not<00:03:24.090> fit<00:03:25.310> if<00:03:26.310> they're<00:03:26.750> adjacent<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:28.140> one

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
will not fit if they're adjacent to one

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
will not fit if they're adjacent to one
another<00:03:29.450> once<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.080> completed<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
another once the this is completed the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.990 
another once the this is completed the
next<00:03:32.670> step<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.530> paint<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.650> with<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.340> latex

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
next step is to paint it with the latex

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.259 
next step is to paint it with the latex
paint<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:38.340> use<00:03:38.870> Behr<00:03:39.870> premium<00:03:41.090> enamel<00:03:42.090> or

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269

basically for the paint in a small

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.100 
basically for the paint in a small
plastic<00:03:58.099> paint<00:03:59.099> tray<00:03:59.430> and<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.299> use<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> foam

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
plastic paint tray and I use a foam

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:27.589 
plastic paint tray and I use a foam
roller<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:02.610> roll<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:03.030> out

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
just roll it out give it a first coat

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:38.760 
just roll it out give it a first coat
make<00:04:32.979> sure<00:04:33.009> it's<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.370> too<00:04:33.639> excessive<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:38.410> let

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
make sure it's not too excessive and let

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.240 
make sure it's not too excessive and let
it<00:04:38.800> dry<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.970> then<00:04:40.410> come<00:04:41.410> back<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.830> give<00:04:42.039> it<00:04:42.069> a

this is what these paddles look like

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:17.850 
this is what these paddles look like
once<00:06:11.050> they're<00:06:11.200> done<00:06:12.840> got<00:06:13.840> one<00:06:14.080> there<00:06:16.860> there's

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
once they're done got one there there's

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.000 
once they're done got one there there's
an<00:06:17.980> older<00:06:18.220> one<00:06:18.340> this<00:06:18.760> pertains<00:06:19.240> to<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:20.650> North
