00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 therefore the following Argentine team is 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.700
 Good, we are not good carnival but not 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.919
 will stop said bonuses won 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 it's not because you're going to have pressure, it's because 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.360
 we have the best players are the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.030
 better there is exaggeration he is a good player 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 who left the milan with him the excellent 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 player on the spectacular trail that begins 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.199
 with omen 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 I see you're recovering now 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.230
 do not move if 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 now their defense is the goalie uefa 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.690
 It's weak, it's cold when you play. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.350
 will play is laziness is with the brake 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.540
 hand in pocket 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
 now this and you come and the selection 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.010
 Brazilian game against a different game that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.289
 has a whole mobilization changes some 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 thing at the time of we know of the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.950
 players who will play 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.370
 obviously we prepare the game right 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.469
 We know it's the player's fault. 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.039
 qualities of the player then it ends 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.620
 not making it easy and I in my case 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.080
 when I see a quarterback is that I know 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.540
 more or less a way he has to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.549
 play and the difficulty he has 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.500
 then it helps me a lot to me then 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.350
 I'm already going to the field already thinking about that. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.060
 what can i do with what i can is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.220
 make it difficult for those who do not 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 accompanied here in the company from near 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.900
 Flemish is very state not to 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.250
 flamengo lost more than the team's 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.590
 was for example state champion you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.000
 immediately picks up five players with 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.579
 passage by Brazilian team not 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.960
 y yo are more snapper was fábio 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.950
 although the fable for the club is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.990
 injured 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.119
 the Moorish léo and street are not playing 15 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.020
 half time and selection player 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.240
 Brazilian 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 Now at that point then is to not 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.340
 want 5 only two will not come back 12 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.680
 turns the Hadrian IASPN rejoined the team 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.020
 in the league kleberson also does not vote 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.090
 more in Rome also from the street also a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.009
 knee surgery léo moura maybe already 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.479
 come back at the weekend against the saint 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.189
 André was the news today but already 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.409
 completed three games that he was 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.030
 suspended 323 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.090
 I do not know if he had done any more 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.020
 old was born in relation to 2002 can not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.850
 to play against santo andré 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.369
 so now you have both sides is 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 ronaldo moura and curiously the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.190
 Flemish does not have a professional 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.069
 player to the side position 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.590
 Left has played is very well. 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.269
 the sign has author also living garden 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.659
 is also considered a serious problem 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:24.950
 have drizzled yesterday played airton what else 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.499
 Emerson people last night 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.629
 holders and an immediate reservation 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.760
 it weighs very reminiscent of that right with 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.139
 sure there the pet also hurt elton 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.790
 is going back Wednesday 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:37.159
 this is transparent with a 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.299
 very great difficulty is that when the 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.489
 people are not used to playing with the 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.530
 concert players we end up picking up 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.349
 affinity is a way of playing 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.169
 different right and when it comes to 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.340
 Base players is from June 2 is very 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.280
 more complicated 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.319
 it is clear that all players coming from 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.980
 because there is only one football but it is not 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.900
 just like this 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.719
 we all know we have to have a 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.750
 players to acquire that 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:08.180
 that experience is for power is she 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.680
 Is it really your soccer? 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.590
 So today we are going through a 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.569
 very difficult today, I do not think 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.389
 everybody can see that this is it 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.879
 normal is and who is suffering more 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.040
 we are just us the oldest players is 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.209
 Why do not my mother tell you about it? 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.609
 younger players 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.889
 it is difficult for them to understand and understand 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.769
 to the way we're going to talk to 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.509
 he has to be too is to communicate is the 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.120
 very calmly with great affection because 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:36.859
 the new players that I can 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.439
 Understand well I can also interpret 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.239
 Too bad, so we have to know. 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:46.370
 means that today is Flemish today. 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.500
 living this way no time is bad for 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.290
 this side is not the fault of the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.599
 players did not upload it, there's nothing 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.699
 When you went up you will be very questioned. 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.180
 we have games in belo horizonte and it was 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.500
 negotiated and 2000/2001 2001/2002 thousand 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.509
 just before the Olympiad has a game in 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.939
 Belo Horizonte when he entered made a 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.310
 Good game until tomorrow game 2 to 1 a 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.560
 italy although many people speak adriano 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.669
 player are saying people to a 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.019
 jewelry then how hard is a guy 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.650
 then a ready team that won the 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.849
 athletic 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.109
 imagine so let's try 167 boys and 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.590
 roger who enters more when 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.590
 I was
