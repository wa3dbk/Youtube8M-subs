00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.889 
and maybe I never will again have fun
that's<00:01:15.759> one<00:01:15.970> of<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> things<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.570> know<00:01:16.630> you're

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
that's one of the things I know you're

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.820 
that's one of the things I know you're
told<00:01:17.080> that<00:01:17.200> but<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.869> sport<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.229> hockey<00:01:20.380> in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
told that but if the sport of hockey in

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.969 
told that but if the sport of hockey in
my<00:01:21.369> opinion<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.970> was<00:01:22.899> one<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.770> funnest

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
my opinion is was one of the funnest

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.800 
my opinion is was one of the funnest
sports<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.670> there<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.240> planet<00:01:25.690> and

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
sports that there is on the planet and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.050 
sports that there is on the planet and
that's<00:01:26.800> what<00:01:26.979> drew<00:01:27.190> me<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.729> that's<00:01:27.910> why

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
that's what drew me to it and that's why

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.840 
that's what drew me to it and that's why
I<00:01:28.090> played<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:30.039> if<00:01:30.340> you're<00:01:30.490> not<00:01:30.610> having

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
I played it and so if you're not having

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.190 
I played it and so if you're not having
fun<00:01:31.800> then<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.880> maybe<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.990> in<00:01:35.110> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
fun then then maybe that it is in the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.469 
fun then then maybe that it is in the
sport<00:01:35.470> for<00:01:35.679> you<00:01:35.830> but<00:01:36.310> having<00:01:36.759> said<00:01:36.940> that<00:01:37.000> if
