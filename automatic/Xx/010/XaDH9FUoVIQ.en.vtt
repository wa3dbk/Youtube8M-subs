a wrestler but uh I made a mistake on
buying<00:00:54.300> these<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:55.140> they're

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
buying these because they're

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.410 
buying these because they're
indeterminate<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:56.670> means<00:00:57.149> they're<00:00:57.300> gonna

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
indeterminate which means they're gonna

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
indeterminate which means they're gonna
grow<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> pretty<00:00:57.930> big<00:00:58.430> but<00:00:59.430> I'll<00:00:59.699> deal<00:00:59.910> with

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
grow a pretty big but I'll deal with

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.139 
grow a pretty big but I'll deal with
that<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.680> prop<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> gets<00:01:02.730> too<00:01:02.910> big

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
that and prop it up if it gets too big

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.090 
that and prop it up if it gets too big
and<00:01:03.949> over<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.930> have<00:01:06.930> orange<00:01:07.710> cherry
