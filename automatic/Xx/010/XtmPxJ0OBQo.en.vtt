00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
at top dead center

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
at top dead center
now<00:01:14.220> although<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.090> variations<00:01:15.780> change

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
now although a lot of variations change

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.030 
now although a lot of variations change
that<00:01:16.560> piston<00:01:17.460> eval<00:01:17.700> clearance<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:19.049> actuation

that piston eval clearance the actuation

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920 
that piston eval clearance the actuation
of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> intake<00:01:20.759> valve<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> always<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> same

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
of the intake valve is always the same

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.330 
of the intake valve is always the same
the<00:01:22.229> only<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.439> would<00:01:22.680> change<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.189> would

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the only thing would change that would

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.789 
the only thing would change that would
be<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.759> valve<00:01:24.090> lash<00:01:24.390> and/or<00:01:25.170> rocker<00:01:25.500> arm

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
be the valve lash and/or rocker arm

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
be the valve lash and/or rocker arm
ratio<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.970> all<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.210> gonna<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.570> we're

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
ratio so all we're gonna do is we're

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.300 
ratio so all we're gonna do is we're
just<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> show<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> intake<00:01:28.860> valve<00:01:29.070> drop

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
just going to show the intake valve drop

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859 
just going to show the intake valve drop
how<00:01:29.520> much<00:01:29.670> clearance<00:01:29.909> er<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.150> between<00:01:30.540> the

how much clearance er is between the
