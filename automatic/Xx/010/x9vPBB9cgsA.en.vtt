00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.529
 guard tower in the description of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.650
 this video then you need a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 sign and an ax 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.770
 others it's really as simple as 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.250
 that when I put myself creative time for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.940
 farting these blocks the sail then after 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.239

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.520

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.980
 here you are doing slash slash expand 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.010
 then if you want people 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.960

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.660
