00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hallok people and welcome 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.529
 to a new video to which the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 really update is coffee makers and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.760
 has some very interesting stuff too 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.679
 the trails of roses but also to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.090
 railroaders at the swiss funds 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.130
 were among others heat maps 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 rausgebracht the show where it all 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.880
 players have stopped and where the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 most popular snipers botswana is so 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.930
 have this sniper put it around 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.550
 then across the map of course 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.199
 to cover areas but we catch 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.010
 on with the statistics 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.380
 In total, three million were 798 1561 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.620
 matches played were 118 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.590
 Million 627,000 killed 3 and 1 hÃ¼ther 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.980
 or at least died 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 188 1442 people visited the merkur 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.260
 So then just hold the 90th 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 managed and are there but 290,000 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.480
 and 1 perfect scorecard were scored 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.100
 Here you see it the first one 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 Of course you can see heatmap there very clearly 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 where the whole thing took place and there 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.930
 I also have to agree indeed 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.520
 the also with us most of the time 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.410
 played there 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 if you do not recognize where what is me 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.890
 will show that right now and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 although you can see it now down here on the left 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.189
 is the spur of the first team and 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.729
 right up there is the board of one 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.040
 another team 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 you have the two points the individual 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 right and left in the middle 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 there is the place where the heavy ammunition 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.939
 sports that means we have here on the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 left half of this small center aisle 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.780
 where, of course, a lot has happened 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.759
 and next to the checkered flag around there 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.610
 Of course, there was also room in the anteroom 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.140
 there are many fighting in the middle 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.820
 if it did not recognize that is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.860
 this wide strip of exactly in the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 middle is then this b flag and there 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.079
 above where a lot of red is there is natural 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.450
 very small encased room where 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.040
 then special ammunition of course 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.250
 it will be dropped in the sign 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.750
 as special ammunition at flag c and we 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.820
 have now here the map with the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 points the sharp shooters put down 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.619
 Of course, in the small means 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.030
 gladly 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.920
 they tried to get down once 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.040
 look at the b flag over direction 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.909
 the special ammunition at c 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.990
 on the other side exactly the same 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.070
 they have tried in the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.290
 in the middle section 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.450
 or just then at the checkered flag of 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.790
 the aisle from long into the spot of 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.750
 teams that is outside the board 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.039
 Of course , this brings one 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.379
 information now nothing more 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.610
 because the crm software is on burning 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.650
 screaming is over now 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.990
 if the map turn again then 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.340
 of course you have the information but now 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.810
 at the weekend will be another map 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.760
 come and the city â€‹â€‹once at the good 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.380
 directly asked and he said well 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.790
 I will not tell you that, we know 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.440
 not what will come of that the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.250
 We start trails of science now 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.930
 again this friday on 29.5 at 19 o'clock 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.120
 German time and then goes the whole 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.500
 So, go ahead of time 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.900
 good luck to you, hÃ¼ther sees it too 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.580
 reached a nice 90 again and then 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.310
 the super great blood on the merkur 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.980
 get where we are right now 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.900
 band like said okay we have that way 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.850
 some many registered among others 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.190
 it is also about the emblems of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.600
 Mercur you then where then not in the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.830
 Inventory have turned up and they 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.870
 just examine the error and 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.340
 Look what that is, I am too 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.500
 I had mine 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.420
 Emblems full did not get that then 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.770
 and that's really pretty 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.360
 mist, though I knew I did 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.160
 forget to check with the holidays whether 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.720
 because I really had all the emblems 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.820
 because at the hunter and the titan I have 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.860
 I've made it free but with them 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.290
 Unfortunately, not the 90 did it 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.850
 I only got to the walking and na 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.980
 yes , unfortunately I have bad luck gabler 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.480
 As I said, they are also about it 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.370
 To take care of 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.730
 then there were also such error codes 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.590
 how, for example , was this morning like it 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.600
 looks eliminated and then there were too 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.820
 other things in the prison of 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.250
 old any mistakes with the whole 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.230
 may achieve again or 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.580
 with these critical goals, such as 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.950
 for example , defuse him wien broken 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.690
 make and there were some mistakes there 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.209
 They are currently working on it, too 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.650
 in things like the special ammunition the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.080
 pile up when you are straight 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.209
 drive city key or so will 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.650
 Do not let go and then try them 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.150
 a way to create that one 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.620
 which somehow get rid of again 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.209
 currently there is only I believe that 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.790
 foray abuse which would have to be the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.560
 where you get rid of the ammunition and there 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.140
 search just says for others 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.340
 possibilities as you just stop 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.780
 can create his inventory 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.299
 also it should be synonymous still problems 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.130
 Give with the ships and the shader 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.470
 from the old prison on level 35 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.420
 or even with the exotic quest that 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.359
 you do not get it and there too 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.829
 you want to take care of that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.840
 also the one possibility created 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.520
 if something is full that one 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.900
 that still gets it then 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.409
 But if she does, she will have it again 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.300
 a few words about it lost 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:29.249
 to the people who chatted at 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.629
 the treasuries and yes they have 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.969
 to be able to determine that there even 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:34.139
 some gave that and did 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.710
 then also aware and have 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.210
 said yes 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.879
 many have noticed with certainty that 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.400
 a temporary or permanent one 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.659
 have been excluded from the game and 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.759
 then they said yes we have to 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.719
 watch out for the trails we will open 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.279
 take care of every case that that too 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:51.389
 everything runs smoothly and that too 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.979
 Do not shoot people and if they do 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.319
 but then they will do just that 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.699
 punished but it comes naturally in the 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.159
 circle on the side is another one 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.229
 event and that ironman and that 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.580
 will be on the second june so next 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.889
 Tuesday come here again 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.110
 However, I do not think so whether it 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.669
 will start again poor or not 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.090
 but there will be some changes in it 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.159
 his 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.479
 and there is a small typo in the 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.610
 mean the update if yes yourself 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.219
 read here is update 1.1.0 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.490
 point 1 but we already have 120 here 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.139
 Of course, update means 1.2.0 point 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.050
 One is here a typo as I said 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.939
 And changes will definitely be made 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.159
 for example, it will be like that 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.629
 if you are already high with a character 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.310
 played on rank five and you catch 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.810
 you with your other characters one man 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.189
 I'll get your minibus for more 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.469
 catch up faster with it too 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:39.270
 really with all your character 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.949
 can get great load because it will be the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.649
 at level three and five now here too 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.060
 give the ironman et a final light 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.589
 In addition, the costs for the 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.379
 all items significantly reduced her 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.819
 So then you do not have to between 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.409
 9,500 1000 lambs for weapons and 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.909
 output equipment 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.349
 and also for all the shaders and 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:57.389
 class items everything becomes clear 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.610
 reduces the trials of service 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.680
 It costs about 100 to 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.509
 500 mica and that 's really nothing 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.580
 in comparison with the railroader and there 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.529
 you would say that would reduce 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.020
 in addition to that will also be 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.849
 new cards are coming or already 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.669
 included cards pantheon of the kettle 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.949
 come to the ironworker rotation 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.469
 as well as on the playstation now 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.149
 synonymous for the first time exodus blue is yes 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.250
 Playstation exclusive web and that will 

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:25.560
 on the psp and ps3 also in the 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.120
 mail protection 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.939
 it will be that too 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.529
 also the arms dealer now the 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.180
 opportunity to forge this one again 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.769
 ironman weapons and that's what you do 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.599
 then with him then apparently not anymore 

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.100
 at lord saladin to then 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:40.560
 the following and indeed 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.590
 a bit the level advantages like 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.990
 that reinforces that means if now the 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.550
 Difference in the beer level too high 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.470
 is between two players then will 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.360
 the more noticeable than the old ones 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.100
 Iron workers are going to be in such a tournament 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.700
 pay will be because they have nothing 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.620
 but said it would be noticeably stronger 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.980
 as with other railroaders tournament 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.530
 before there is equipment as standard a well 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.440
 give a fusion rifle and also a scout 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.390
 gun and then gloves and 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.040
 boots from eisenbahner if you so 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.650
 you do not have then you can now 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.240
 buy here from tuesday so that should 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.780
 but it had been so far from my side 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.190
 his 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.530
 Thank you in any case for 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.910
 listen and watch if you still 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.690
 have somehow ask writes including 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.560
 in the comments 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.330
 That's why I say at this point 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.330
 Goodbye until next time
