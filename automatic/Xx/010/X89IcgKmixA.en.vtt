00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.859 
style amounts with the orange m700 now
not<00:02:06.450> everybody's<00:02:06.900> getting<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
not everybody's getting this but and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.560 
not everybody's getting this but and
here's<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.190> holder<00:02:11.190> now<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:11.850> actually

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
here's the holder now it's actually

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.230 
here's the holder now it's actually
adjustable<00:02:13.670> bending<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.850> size<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> your

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
adjustable bending on the size of your

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.910 
adjustable bending on the size of your
device<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.080> fairly<00:02:16.350> generic<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:19.410> one

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
device so it's fairly generic that one

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.040 
device so it's fairly generic that one
that<00:02:20.070> drops<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.490> there<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.150> close<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:24.050> so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
that drops in there and close it up so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.110 
that drops in there and close it up so
that's<00:02:25.200> quite<00:02:25.350> nice<00:02:26.600> finally<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.530> get<00:02:29.120> in

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that's quite nice finally you you get in

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.030 
that's quite nice finally you you get in
