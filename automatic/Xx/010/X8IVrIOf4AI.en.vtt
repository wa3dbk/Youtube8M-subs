00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello friends welcome 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.910
 you have not had any news from the country for a long time 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.429
 and for the jail 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.120
 and here I thought it would be time for you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.509
 to show 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.860
 and I decided to do a review on pets 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.580
 which I have in stock 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.850
 so watch and enjoy 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.199
 the first thing that there is this carrot 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.710
 little carrot that will 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.769
 follow me on the heels of this rabbit 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.380
 little rabbit 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 here is such a he dog fluffy such 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.649
 sweet 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.540
 still he flies when I'm high summer or 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.230
 you but tweet for some reason from his priests 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.579
 also some kind of rainbow and he is catching up with me 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.230
 here it was a rabbit next in line 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.030
 will be Jesse pinkman and this is such an eye 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 on the spring he knocked out of the eye 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 from my mother's eye from my mother's eye like this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.470
 Here, too, jumps and jumps and flies like 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.170
 some kind of worm in general i don't know 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 I love him very much therefore I cry purely 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.580
 to make fun if I feel like over 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.450
 someone i call him i call jessie 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 pinkman save cooking meth 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.640
 further on the turn bone leg up to or 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.009
 what is the little world eater 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.619
 Little Worlds Eater 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.810
 he drops out of the world eaters just 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.880
 brilliantly true that's so small to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.240
 war ki look what his surface and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.250
 what a little fluffy cat he is 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.250
 almost you can say but no it's not a cat 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.380
 this is a baby devourer of worlds 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.710
 That's how it looks like I still have 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:53.520
 I still have a calf 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.659
 the skull that falls out of the guard 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.509
 dungeon which is also, I would say to 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.630
 look like a kitten no he just look like 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.890
 al bald her some and he toothy 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.380
 scary in my opinion the worst of all 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.620
 pets that are in ferrari 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.570
 the rest are all nice and he's scary all 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.280
 back off but the most useful 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:25.140
 animal pet, I think it's small 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:29.890
 black tree that falls during 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.280
 pumpkin moons its benefit is that it 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.670
 black kawaina i'm not racist 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.350
 because it flies and opens 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.620
 very good map you just look 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.140
 on this being here you see how she 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.720
 flies and here on the map on the right you can see what 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.320
 on the lanes and leaves beneath on which 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.140
 distance it is very useful very 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.180
 it may be useful to my shame and maybe not 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.290
 but these are all pets that I have 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:04.810
 There are now 5 of them yes yes there is still 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.880
 Bunny deer out of content but that's another 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.280
 story friends is another story but 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.200
 riding bunny is pet though 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.660
 of course is in some sense he 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.380
 the dog is so slow 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:21.100
 jump higher no i trade you for deer 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 the deer drives the coolest pet the most 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.710
 cool pet fast 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:31.690
 built into it has bells and he 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:36.720
 won the euro 2000 40 million because 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.720
 that he has a red nose and beard 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.430
 In general, I find black as the most useful 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.760
 the tree is the fastest 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.739
 deer and that's all i can say about 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.319
 pets at the moment if I have 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.590
 new pets will appear you about them 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.760
 find out first thanks for watching 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.760
