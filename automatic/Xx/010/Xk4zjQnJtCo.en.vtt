00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
you get into the goo itself and I'll say

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.640 
you get into the goo itself and I'll say
it<00:04:53.699> has<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:53.910> bit<00:04:54.210> of<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.419> not<00:04:55.080> in<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.229> bad<00:04:55.410> way<00:04:55.440> but

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
it has a bit of a not in a bad way but

right up right in here you can kind of

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.750 
right up right in here you can kind of
see<00:04:59.310> it<00:05:00.060> has<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.510> like<00:05:01.010> granular<00:05:02.010> quality<00:05:02.610> to

mean<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.229> is<00:05:55.400> let's<00:05:56.400> be<00:05:56.460> clear<00:05:56.669> here<00:05:56.849> this<00:05:56.970> is

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
mean this is let's be clear here this is

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.980 
mean this is let's be clear here this is
very<00:05:57.720> very<00:05:58.380> sweet<00:05:58.560> sugar<00:05:58.979> I<00:05:59.820> actually<00:06:00.539> think

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
very very sweet sugar I actually think

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.170 
very very sweet sugar I actually think
that<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.440> cream<00:06:01.710> egg<00:06:01.889> might<00:06:02.160> be<00:06:02.340> a<00:06:02.370> little<00:06:02.700> too

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
that the cream egg might be a little too

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.170 
that the cream egg might be a little too
sweet<00:06:03.450> for<00:06:03.479> some<00:06:03.840> tastes<00:06:04.260> for<00:06:05.070> me<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.490> kind<00:06:06.090> of

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
sweet for some tastes for me it kind of

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.089 
sweet for some tastes for me it kind of
rides<00:06:06.389> that<00:06:06.630> rides<00:06:07.229> that<00:06:07.380> line<00:06:07.710> pretty<00:06:08.039> well

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
rides that rides that line pretty well

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.190 
rides that rides that line pretty well
right<00:06:11.099> on<00:06:11.220> the<00:06:11.340> line<00:06:11.550> of<00:06:11.580> being<00:06:12.030> overly<00:06:12.900> sweet

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
right on the line of being overly sweet

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.830 
right on the line of being overly sweet
but<00:06:14.099> doesn't<00:06:14.370> quite<00:06:14.550> cross<00:06:14.729> it<00:06:14.940> so<00:06:15.180> so<00:06:15.720> it's

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
but doesn't quite cross it so so it's

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.879 
but doesn't quite cross it so so it's
