00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.719
 in the South Atlantic Ocean 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.160
 the tropical storms that can probably be converted 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.800
 in hurricane in the next 24 to 48 hours 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.800
 the details when returning from the draw 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.339
 this continues with us to reduce the weather conditions 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.969
 we will have 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.900
 here in our state is ready 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.849
 in this it is equal to jael today is expected rain maximum temperature of 28 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.239
 degrees tomorrow we will be dawning on the 17 degrees 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.869
 in the northern zone and in the jumps 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.699
 the conditions of partly cloudy sky are expected rain so 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.160
 scattered will be dawning about 16 degrees 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.150
 tomorrow and in the southern area will reach a maximum temperature 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.640
 of the 29 degrees in puerto vallarta and manzanillo colima the maximum temperature 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.270
 will be 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.530
 between 33 and 34 degrees and tomorrow will be dawning among the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.870
 24 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.230
 26 degrees 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.540
 both with the following graph that good 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.600
 I believe and we have 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.500
 tropical estates that can probably become one 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.570
 is the tropical storm channel to tropical storm there 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.240
 and the tropical storm 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.580
 yosef inc meanwhile tropical depression 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.440
 102 wall 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.570
 by disappearing and nothing else are the remnants in new orleans 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.730
 has the maximum movements of 13 kilometers per 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 and the maximum speed of 40 years 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.620
 in the next graphic that is our image 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.130
 no longer good the rains continue in most of our country this 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.920
 It is due to several low pressure channels 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.470
 the moisture input from the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.840
 the gulf of mexico and the pacific ocean of txiki we have a channel of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.460
 low pressure 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 in strong winds and can probably be converted 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.960
 tropical 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.210
 we know until tijuana where tomorrow 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.200
 it is expected to reach the maximum temperature 27 degrees 38 for hermosillo 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 peace for chihuahua is expected rain maximum temperature of 32 in zacatecas 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.860
 the temperature drops 13 degrees reaching the maximum of 19 and in 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.570
 monterrey 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 it is expected cloudy sky conditions are also expected 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.860
 Wear the maximum temperature will be 33 days 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.060
 why this thesis where the rains also continue temperature 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.469
 maximum of 28 25 for aguascalientes for colima is expected 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.349
 the conditions of partly cloudy skies and rains are expected 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.349
 with maximum temperature at 31 28 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.709
 in Morelia they are staying that the temperature 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.799
 of 16 degrees reaching the maximum of those of iz and other works 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.179
 in the district 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.859
 the maximum temperature will be 23 degrees rain is also expected 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.930
 for puebla 22 30 for oaxaca and in melilla sky conditions are expected 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.250
 partially cloudy maximum at 24 degrees and reach temperature 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.849
 maximum of 38 degrees I say goodbye and I keep it 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.599
