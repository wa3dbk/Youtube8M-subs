he a changed too much of them from the
OVA<00:01:02.520> Zoar<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.500> wherever<00:01:04.500> he<00:01:04.739> looks<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.820> like

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
OVA Zoar the wherever he looks just like

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.440 
OVA Zoar the wherever he looks just like
the<00:01:06.450> manga<00:01:07.170> version<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.880> because<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the manga version but because I it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.770 
the manga version but because I it's
been<00:01:09.600> washed<00:01:09.720> himself<00:01:09.930> read<00:01:10.560> part<00:01:11.040> three<00:01:11.780> but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
been washed himself read part three but

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
been washed himself read part three but
he<00:01:12.869> does<00:01:13.049> look<00:01:14.000> pretty<00:01:15.000> decent<00:01:15.320> like<00:01:16.490> it's<00:01:17.490> why

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
he does look pretty decent like it's why

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.719 
he does look pretty decent like it's why
I<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.150> remember<00:01:18.540> he<00:01:19.259> looks<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.799> what

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I can remember he looks about like what

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.020 
I can remember he looks about like what
he<00:01:20.880> should<00:01:21.290> all<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:23.659> sound<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.790> still

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
he should all right sound it was still

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
he should all right sound it was still
pretty<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.360> huh<00:01:27.659> there<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.320> an<00:01:28.439> opening<00:01:28.770> for

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
pretty good huh there was an opening for

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.440 
pretty good huh there was an opening for
this<00:01:29.009> one<00:01:29.390> but<00:01:30.390> instead<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.110> opening<00:01:31.500> they

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
this one but instead of opening they

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.649 
this one but instead of opening they
replace<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.409> ending<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> opening

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
replace the the ending with the opening

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.140 
replace the the ending with the opening
which<00:01:36.659> happened<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.200> cubed<00:01:37.740> by<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
which happened to be cubed by the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
which happened to be cubed by the
Walkman<00:01:39.150> which<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:39.750> pretty<00:01:40.020> nice<00:01:40.229> because

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Walkman which was pretty nice because

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.580 
Walkman which was pretty nice because
that<00:01:40.799> there's<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> nice<00:01:41.640> touch<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.590> don't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that there's a nice touch that I don't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.609 
that there's a nice touch that I don't
know<00:01:43.649> why<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.780> that's<00:01:46.140> pretty

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
know why I was like that's that's pretty

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
know why I was like that's that's pretty
cool<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:48.680> think<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> original<00:01:50.939> manga<00:01:51.180> they

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
cool I think in the original manga they

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.850 
cool I think in the original manga they
I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> Beatles<00:01:52.500> or

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I think I so if you like the Beatles or

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.330 
I think I so if you like the Beatles or
something<00:01:53.420> forgot<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.600> was<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.340> here's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
something forgot it was but here's

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.690 
something forgot it was but here's
something<00:01:56.520> else<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.750> fast<00:01:57.990> opening<00:01:58.700> but

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
something else that was fast opening but

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.389 
something else that was fast opening but
yeah<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.329> guess<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.170> Beatles<00:02:01.469> come<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> hard<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
yeah I guess the Beatles come a hard to

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.020 
yeah I guess the Beatles come a hard to
license<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.240> anime

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.249 

all<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:07.580> yeah<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.240> talk<00:02:10.050> about

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
all right yeah it's good and talk about

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.699 
all right yeah it's good and talk about
the<00:02:10.470> plot<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:11.780> wear<00:02:12.780> something<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.530> this

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
the plot I wear something I think this

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.390 
the plot I wear something I think this
have<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.569> sound<00:02:15.680> they<00:02:16.680> did<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:16.950> overuse

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
have what the sound they did not overuse

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.110 
have what the sound they did not overuse
a<00:02:17.730> better<00:02:18.510> music<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.530> episode<00:02:20.130> there<00:02:20.400> was<00:02:20.430> no

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
a better music this episode there was no

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.210 
a better music this episode there was no
large<00:02:21.990> amounts<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.410> depth<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:22.950> fact<00:02:23.100> I

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
large amounts of depth of it in fact I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.650 
large amounts of depth of it in fact I
don't<00:02:23.280> think<00:02:23.400> there<00:02:23.580> was<00:02:23.670> any<00:02:23.880> dubstep<00:02:24.510> in

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
don't think there was any dubstep in

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.070 
don't think there was any dubstep in
this<00:02:24.780> one<00:02:24.980> at<00:02:25.980> two<00:02:26.280> songs<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.480> played

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
this one at two songs I think was played

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.699 
this one at two songs I think was played
during<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.470> whole<00:02:29.090> background<00:02:30.090> by<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.709> pure

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
during the whole background by the pure

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.059 
during the whole background by the pure
