00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.749 
today I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:05.540> planet<00:00:06.540> galaxy<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.710> son<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.280> GIMP<00:00:08.910> and

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
a planet galaxy and a son on GIMP and

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.110 
a planet galaxy and a son on GIMP and
when<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.910> make<00:00:12.179> your<00:00:12.210> new<00:00:12.750> layer<00:00:14.089> make<00:00:15.089> sure

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
when you make your new layer make sure

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.650 
when you make your new layer make sure
that<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:15.990> transparency<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> first

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that it's on transparency so first

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.390 
that it's on transparency so first
you're<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.140> go<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> file<00:00:22.650> new<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:26.340> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you're going to go to file new and go to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.390 
you're going to go to file new and go to
your<00:00:26.460> template<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.240> make<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> size<00:00:28.039> 1024<00:00:29.039> x

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
your template and make the size 1024 x

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.920 
your template and make the size 1024 x
768<00:00:30.859> let's<00:00:31.859> hook<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.540> then<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> your

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
768 let's hook it and then go to your

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.950 
768 let's hook it and then go to your
bucket<00:00:34.410> tool<00:00:34.940> make<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> color<00:00:36.300> black<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
bucket tool make the color black and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.690 
bucket tool make the color black and
fill<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:38.480> then<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.660> go<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> filters<00:00:40.700> noise

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
fill it in then you go to filters noise

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.639 
fill it in then you go to filters noise
and<00:00:42.500> hurl<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.910> would<00:00:45.870> recommend<00:00:46.110> putting

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and hurl and I would recommend putting

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.450 
and hurl and I would recommend putting
the<00:00:46.890> randomization<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.480> way<00:00:48.570> down

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
the randomization all the way down

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.920 
the randomization all the way down
that's<00:00:50.460> okay<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> colors<00:00:53.930> desaturate

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that's okay then go to colors desaturate

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.319 
that's okay then go to colors desaturate
and<00:00:55.370> it<00:00:56.370> doesn't<00:00:56.730> matter<00:00:56.879> which<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and it doesn't matter which one you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.830 
and it doesn't matter which one you
choose<00:00:57.480> by<00:00:58.020> i'll<00:00:58.469> choose<00:00:59.309> average<00:00:59.879> press<00:01:00.660> ok

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
choose by i'll choose average press ok

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.149 
choose by i'll choose average press ok
so<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.469> makes<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> stars<00:01:02.100> white<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:03.090> colorful

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
so it makes the stars white not colorful

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.550 
so it makes the stars white not colorful
next<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> make<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> new<00:01:06.450> layer<00:01:06.659> make

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
next you want to make a new layer make

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.679 
next you want to make a new layer make
sure<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.920> layer<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.760> same<00:01:09.000> size<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
sure the layer is the same size as the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.060 
sure the layer is the same size as the
one<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> started<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.950> 1024<00:01:11.909> x<00:01:12.060> 768

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
one that you started with so 1024 x 768

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.109 
one that you started with so 1024 x 768
then<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.310> filters<00:01:15.320> render<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.119> spear

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
then go filters render and spear

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.410 
then go filters render and spear
designer<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.770> your<00:01:19.950> planet<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
designer this is your planet so you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.960 
designer this is your planet so you
click<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> color<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.610> make<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.820> whatever

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
click on the color and make it whatever

color you want I'm gonna make mine

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:35.870 
color you want I'm gonna make mine
orange<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:32.150> then<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.070> texture<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.340> choose

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
orange and then go to texture and choose

choose marble and then mess around with

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
choose marble and then mess around with
the<00:01:40.619> turbulence<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.579> move<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.970> back<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the turbulence like move it back and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
the turbulence like move it back and
