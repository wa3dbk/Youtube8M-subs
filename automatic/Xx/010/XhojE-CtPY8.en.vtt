like<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:27.240> different<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.500> look

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
like it's different because if you look

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.910 
like it's different because if you look
over<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.279> usually<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:29.939> slant<00:00:30.359> it's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
indented in the letters and it's all

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.780 
indented in the letters and it's all
straight<00:00:34.020> lines<00:00:34.380> which<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.280> don't<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.610> like

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
straight lines which I don't like like

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.979 
straight up and down which I don't like
particularly<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.450> okay<00:00:39.750> phone

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
particularly it so it's an okay phone

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.400
