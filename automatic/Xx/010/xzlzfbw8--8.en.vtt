my elbow is always on to my shoulder and

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.450 
my elbow is always on to my shoulder and
I'm<00:01:16.229> hitting<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.950> hip<00:01:17.130> flexor<00:01:18.200> area<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
I'm hitting this hip flexor area and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.450 
I'm hitting this hip flexor area and
then<00:01:21.090> I'm<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> other<00:01:21.659> one

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
then I'm going to do the other one

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.499 
then I'm going to do the other one
switch<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.610> arms

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.260 

you<00:01:28.509> may<00:01:28.750> feel<00:01:29.080> that<00:01:29.560> one<00:01:30.549> side<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.000> going<00:01:31.180> to

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
you may feel that one side is going to

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.690 
you may feel that one side is going to
be<00:01:31.390> tighter<00:01:31.659> than<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.500> other<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:32.950> that's

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
be tighter than the other and that's

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.350 
be tighter than the other and that's
perfectly<00:01:34.180> normal<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.780> okay<00:01:35.549> after<00:01:36.549> time<00:01:37.090> and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
perfectly normal and okay after time and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.929 
perfectly normal and okay after time and
with<00:01:37.600> consistency<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.530> foam<00:01:39.040> rolling<00:01:39.310> it's<00:01:39.640> it

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
with consistency a foam rolling it's it

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.779 
with consistency a foam rolling it's it
will<00:01:40.119> even<00:01:40.360> out<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.590> that's<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:42.070> quads<00:01:42.369> I

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
will even out so that's the quads I

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.550 
will even out so that's the quads I
would<00:01:43.390> also<00:01:43.570> recommend<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:44.289> do<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:45.850> IT<00:01:46.060> band

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
would also recommend you do your IT band

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.679 
would also recommend you do your IT band
so<00:01:47.560> you're<00:01:47.710> going<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:47.860> start<00:01:48.159> out<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:49.299> bottom

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
so you're going to start out the bottom

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.080 
so you're going to start out the bottom
of<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.960> name<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.430> very<00:01:51.580> top<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.970> knee

focusing here for about two minutes or

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.169 
focusing here for about two minutes or
about<00:02:04.479> ten<00:02:04.899> rolls<00:02:05.140> each<00:02:05.409> muscle<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:07.000> could

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
about ten rolls each muscle you could

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.949 
about ten rolls each muscle you could
break<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.360> up<00:02:07.690> go<00:02:08.019> Midway<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.799> is<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.009> very

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
break it up go Midway this is a very

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.390 
break it up go Midway this is a very
intense<00:02:10.959> muscle<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.620> foam<00:02:11.830> roll<00:02:12.010> for<00:02:12.220> most

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
intense muscle to foam roll for most

glutes since you're sitting a lot this

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.680 
glutes since you're sitting a lot this
is<00:03:16.430> going<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.610> be<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.730> very<00:03:16.940> tight<00:03:17.120> area<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.540> well

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
is going to be a very tight area as well

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.020 
is going to be a very tight area as well
so<00:03:18.470> you're<00:03:18.860> going<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.040> literally<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:19.640> sit<00:03:20.000> on

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
so you're going to literally just sit on

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.530 
so you're going to literally just sit on
the<00:03:20.209> foam<00:03:20.360> roller<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:21.230> explore<00:03:21.680> your<00:03:21.950> glute

middle<00:03:27.860> focus<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.910> left<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.360> then<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
middle focus on the left and then the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.199 
middle focus on the left and then the
right<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.860> right<00:03:31.100> now<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.280> got<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.760> left<00:03:31.940> side

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
right so right now I got the left side

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.260 
right so right now I got the left side
on<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.989> right<00:03:33.230> sides<00:03:33.470> up<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.820> most<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.180> my

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
on it the right sides up so most of my

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.870 
on it the right sides up so most of my
weight<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.320> left<00:03:36.530> side<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.980> then

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
weight is on the left side and then

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.130 
weight is on the left side and then
you're<00:03:38.030> going<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.180> switch<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:40.400> right<00:03:40.550> side

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
you're going to switch to the right side

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.470 
you're going to switch to the right side
focus<00:03:42.140> on<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.440> glute<00:03:42.590> Meade<00:03:45.880> now<00:03:46.880> if<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.239> want

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
focus on the glute Meade now if you want

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.990 
focus on the glute Meade now if you want
more<00:03:47.780> pressure<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.980> can<00:03:49.130> totally<00:03:49.519> go<00:03:49.640> down<00:03:49.820> to

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
more pressure you can totally go down to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.860 
more pressure you can totally go down to
your<00:03:50.150> forearm<00:03:50.510> just<00:03:50.989> like<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:52.660> then<00:03:53.660> go

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
your forearm just like that and then go

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.759 
your forearm just like that and then go
toward<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.290> middle<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.940> get<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> glute<00:03:56.269> max

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.530 

and<00:04:00.769> that's<00:04:00.950> how<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.160> foam<00:04:01.459> roll<00:04:01.670> if<00:04:01.910> you're<00:04:02.510> a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
and that's how you foam roll if you're a

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.810 
and that's how you foam roll if you're a
cyclist
