00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.440
 We are here today to talk about the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.389
 our machine the poop here that went 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.870
 developed to make work of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.039
 Portel feather forró 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.930
 up to that time, we only spoke here in the role of 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.170
 bullet the poop or even the rococo 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 for effect it happens thick we go 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.669
 demonstrate that with the machine we can 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:36.210
 do a series of works concerning 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 the table foreman to the table effect 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 for retention for the mass of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.239
 birthday party for me was 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.750
 now approaching the end of the year 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.879
 we will then provide those 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.820
 people doing this kind of work 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.390
 a number of conditions to speak this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 creativity of each is a limit 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:03.300
 first we will see the rococo with 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:07.170
 the gray paper with approximately 3 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:14.490
 centimeters and mail by 30 centimeters 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:20.240
 about two runs a little more 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.680
 thick a little more to 100 4 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 our rokot machine positioning 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.979
 correctly the paper input is very 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.500
 important for its manufacture and the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:43.140
 rococo, you have attention in your 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.560
 work and there're ready your glass one 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.899
 little more pronouncing a little more joy 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.790
 pay a little more plaything one 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:58.680
 The thinner you go the thinner you go 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.549
 use on children's birthday table 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.189
 Like 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.850
 you will have a role of two 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.209
 centimeters and a half for also 30 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.069
 approximate cm width 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.930
 length 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.870
 or two and a half centimeters 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.010
 width by 30 centimeters 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.670
 length by correctly positioning the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.349
 paper 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.840
 We are going to work now with a role 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.879
 much thinner 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.049
 so we need to have attention 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:34.280
 refined in working with this robot to be 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.950
 Well done 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.209
 note that it is the opposite of the other nodes 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.349
 we have to have a little more of 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.060
 attention 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:55.810
 And then you will have ready forró 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:58.069
 the steward table is the increased demand 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:06.980
 people who work with a 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:09.980
 machine to make the default is 10 Dec 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.790
 centimeters wide by 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.290
 approximately 30 centimeters 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:25.189
 length said strips of two 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:30.620
 centimeters and mail always starting at 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:38.659
 Outside side outside side positions 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:43.280
 the paper correctly and then the job 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:45.919
 take poop properly until the end 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.439
 at the end of the paper will not do 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:53.419
 absolutely apart from turning the 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:56.169
 crank it at will pull it off 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.699
 Care to put with a little paper 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.949
 in the center of the will 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.620
 note that I have put this type wrong 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:06.739
 error can not happen and I put 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.430
 wrong paper is not good at making a 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:14.120
 good forró even never blamed the machine 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.979
 always the mistake will never be machine 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.640
 Perfect machine does it work. 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:24.760
 perfectly making yours 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.480
 turning backwards I withdraw forró and 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.180
 so I can not do it in my job 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.000
 bullet paper with focus note that no 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.580
 it takes a long time for you to play a role 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.590
 bullet and finally I make the fourth 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.180
 fair line I can play the role of 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.090
 bullet with two lines with three pebbles 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.330
 with 4 legs with 57 line 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.560
 this is the same as deep 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.590
 creativity is the limit 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:02.940
 done this your bullet site is here 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:06.550
 a kit to be packed with coconut bullet 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:11.260
 we have here another type of 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.350
 forró and it's a bit long the people 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:21.160
 native flame problem be it 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:27.430
 approximately two centimeters and 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:29.440
 half width and I either do with 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.160
 my long purpose 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.919
 note that I'm going to make a rock forró 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:42.850
 I'm going to work there with a strip of 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:46.000
 paper thin and long with this evil 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:51.280
 It happens, I have to do a lot of 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.240
 attention and loves the role properly and 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:01.150
 way it does not matter and then I go 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:06.570
 making my rococo until the end and then I 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:11.020
 I'm going to have a long rococo 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:13.420
 very beautiful work and we that is not 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:19.150
 an act and we also raise a new type 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:22.680
 of clothing or by pair with two 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:25.120
 overlapping silk papers 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.410
 now is the cup time we're going to do 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.650
 a big yellow 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:36.190
 are two strips one thick one fluffy and 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:39.300
 here I will simply put a 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:44.400
 role as if you were only counting 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:48.430
 the role of the thick rococo 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:53.920
 much attention is needed so that the two 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:59.590
 be symmetrical top and then I would go 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:10.330
 doing so in such a way that the two 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:16.020
 national yellow-green leaves 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:25.660
 brazilianism there for the entrance of 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:27.700
 water and the machine working the 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.910
 more so that you have the 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:35.320
 possibility of having a small machine 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.770
 one more great business has very well in 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.770
 Cup
