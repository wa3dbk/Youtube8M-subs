element of glossiness on the sides over

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.229 
element of glossiness on the sides over
here<00:00:55.989> that's<00:00:56.989> there<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:57.609> as<00:00:58.609> only<00:00:58.820> gaussian

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
here that's there so as only gaussian

really move a lot the buttons are very

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.340 
really move a lot the buttons are very
responsive<00:02:20.300> thing<00:02:21.300> about<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.930> also<00:02:22.080> comes

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
responsive thing about it it also comes

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.610 
responsive thing about it it also comes

with a dedicated Windows Media Player
remote<00:02:26.160> control<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:29.160> use<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> as

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
remote control so you can use this as

remote control so you can use this as
your<00:02:30.210> media<00:02:30.360> center<00:02:31.490> speed<00:02:32.490> as<00:02:32.700> well<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.830> has

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
your media center speed as well it has

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.250 
your media center speed as well it has
these<00:02:35.190> buttons<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.390> lower<00:02:36.720> right<00:02:37.230> hand

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
these buttons on the lower right hand

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.860 
these buttons on the lower right hand
corner

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
corner

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.330 
corner
to<00:02:39.870> access<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> OSD<00:02:40.680> now<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> diversity<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
to access the OSD now the diversity is

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.910 
to access the OSD now the diversity is
not<00:02:41.550> touch<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:43.110> does<00:02:43.230> not<00:02:43.380> respond<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.710> touch

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
not touch it does not respond to touch

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.030 
not touch it does not respond to touch
so<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.550> adjust<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
so you have to adjust that with the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.860 
so you have to adjust that with the
button<00:02:47.040> soil<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.240> feel<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.720> very

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
button soil but we feel this is a very

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.600 
button soil but we feel this is a very
good<00:02:49.320> implementation<00:02:49.950> rather<00:02:50.070> than<00:02:50.220> having<00:02:50.400> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
good implementation rather than having a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.590 
good implementation rather than having a
dedicated<00:02:51.150> touch<00:02:51.420> screen<00:02:51.660> for<00:02:51.960> diversity<00:02:53.600> now

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
dedicated touch screen for diversity now

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.660 
dedicated touch screen for diversity now

know<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> may<00:03:19.230> seem<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.680> bit<00:03:19.770> out<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.280> place<00:03:20.900> at

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
know it may seem a bit out of place at

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.260 
know it may seem a bit out of place at
first<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:22.830> when<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.160> add<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> USB<00:03:23.910> Drive

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
first but then when you add a USB Drive

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.970 
first but then when you add a USB Drive
oh<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:25.020> know<00:03:25.140> pen<00:03:25.350> drive<00:03:25.560> over<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.890> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
oh you know pen drive over you it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.640 
oh you know pen drive over you it
doesn't<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.970> know<00:03:27.000> go<00:03:27.300> out<00:03:27.660> much<00:03:27.930> from<00:03:28.410> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
doesn't you know go out much from the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.270 
doesn't you know go out much from the
edge<00:03:29.780> now<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.900> also<00:03:31.050> has<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.290> stand<00:03:31.770> on<00:03:32.040> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
edge now it also has a stand on the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.010 
edge now it also has a stand on the
other<00:03:32.810> side<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:34.709> adjustable

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
other side and it's adjustable

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.490 
other side and it's adjustable
you<00:03:37.020> know<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:38.850> orientation<00:03:39.660> according<00:03:40.380> to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
you know the orientation according to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.300 
you know the orientation according to
your<00:03:40.709> needs

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.979 

so<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:47.519> basically<00:03:47.790> align<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.600> monitor

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
so you can basically align the monitor

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.750 
so you can basically align the monitor
at<00:03:49.200> various<00:03:49.500> angles<00:03:49.650> based<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.640> your

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
at various angles based on your

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.239 
at various angles based on your
preference
