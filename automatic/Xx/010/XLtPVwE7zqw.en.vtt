00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 hello that such friends come back to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.849
 another good tutorial then in this video 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.180
 I'm going to show you a program that serves 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.710
 to clean and optimize ram memory 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.640
 to download the program will go to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.480
 link that I will leave in the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.480
 video description 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.010
 is going to send us this page of the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.940
 boots' we forget everything that is 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.950
 in the middle 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.240
 we expect the counter to reach 0 and 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.240
 click on skid and sat 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.470
 will redirect us to the page of 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.260
 mega to download the program very 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.810
 easy check the box and click on 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.670
 download then approximately 500 6 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.220
 kilobytes as you see is very light does not weigh 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.270
 a lot and this is the file of 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.280
 installation that will leave you 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.980
 important for those who have windows 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.960
 Vista windows 7 and windows 8 run it 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.090
 as an administrator for those who have 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.490
 windows xp execute it normally giving 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.050
 double click on it and ready when in my 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.870
 I'm going to execute it as 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.440
 administrator right click execute as 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.210
 administrator 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.440
 we will get a window where we 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.580
 ask if we want to allow this 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.430
 program make changes to the team 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.500
 we give that if later it appears this 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.720
 another window where he asks us if 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.010
 we want to install in clean we give that 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.740
 yes 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.340
 this other window appears click on 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.960
 to accept 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.390
 and will automatically start the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.950
 installation asks us if we want 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.219
 create a disk on the desktop we give 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219
 yes 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.160
 and he asks us if we want to check 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.160
 updates we are going to click on no 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.369
 it's going to happen 5 seconds before it 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.369
 start the program 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.220
 good 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.400
 I want to give you a suggestion that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.780
 this installation route that is 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.550
 giving 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.150
 copy it 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.070
 and paste it in a notebook because 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.700
 because there are unlike others 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.850
 programs this is not installed in files 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.850
 of the program but as you can see, not us 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.220
 gives another installation route and that's why it's 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.020
 that does not appear 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.510
 in those in the programs and 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.220
 characteristics and in this way not 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.100
 we can uninstall the program from 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.260
 here 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.850
 if they realize in the route that is 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.770
 giving here comes the file for 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.900
 uninstall the program that's why it's 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.200
 important that they copy this route of 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.020
 installation that is leaving them or that 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.930
 move this file elsewhere in 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.040
 where you can have access to it 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.660
 immediately if they want to get to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.160
 uninstall the good program friends a 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.120
 Once knowing this, now we are going to 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.120
 see how the program is used 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.260
 note that it has three memory tabs 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.230
 options and about we are going to go to the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.700
 second tab option and you guys 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.330
 are going to come unmarked these two 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.130
 I recommend that you mark them 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.560
 because in this way we are going to clean the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.800
 memory whenever it exceeds 80% of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.350
 use the other two boxes are for 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.230
 clean every five minutes and this one 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.330
 here is to start the program every 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.819
 Once windows starts I just 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.530
 I recommend marking these 2 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.079
 once done this we go to the 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.920
 first tab memory note that here 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:48.770
 it tells us memory used in my case 548 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.820
 megas of 2036 that I have almost 26% 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.870
 and to lower this percentage of use 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.080
 notice that in the bottom part they come 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.000
 two options the first is to finish 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.860
 with the processes that we are not using 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.410
 more however they are consuming 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.410
 memory let's click from there 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.730
 and good in my case has dropped a little 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.739
 the percentage 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.109
 the second option is to clean the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.109
 system cache I'm going to click there 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.060
 well in my case I do not release much 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.699
 memory because I had already done this 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.439
 procedure but you are going to notice 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:36.260
 a more drastic change in what is the 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:39.280
 optimizing your ram memory 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.240
 now I'm going to close this window 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.460
 I also want to show you that 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.830
 we necessarily have to do this 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.500
 method by opening the main window of the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.540
 program if we go here to show 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.700
 hidden icons 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.950
 we see that here is the memory icon 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.100
 clean air we will give right click on 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.010
 he and here come the two options 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.530
 to optimize the memory of finishing 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.620
 with the processes that we are not using and 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.919
 the clean the cache system 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.940
 so from here we can also 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.550
 optimize ram memory 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.990
 Well friends this has been all 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.780
 videotutorial I hope you liked it 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.919

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.919
 in the next tutorial
