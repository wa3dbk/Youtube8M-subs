00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.990
 the king 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.160
 well here we have the car 150 ago that 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.380
 it is a basic equipment 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.060
 and for people who start in the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.190
 young 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.190
 can be basic does not mean it is not 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.279
 It is very sensitive 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.279
 to start you in the young is a team 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.320
 ideal because you learn a lot and when 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.169
 have experience over time 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.750
 so that up to something else 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.800
 Sophisticated if we pass here we have 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.800
 leave the gti 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.710
 2500 this is the version followed 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.620
 and the one that we see here next is the the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:55.210
 recipe and 2002 series 1 the difference 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.210
 between one and another that that god has 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.719
 have 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:11.430
 a chip that tomorrow is going 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:16.290
 to reveal or obtain the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.550
 GPS coordinates in the digital part 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 1 the series 1 of all the information 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.630
 spoken and graphic on the screen and the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:32.130
 server nothing more geographical 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:35.790
 any two are very good and what 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.640
 better you have and barrett this and if 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.240
 you see the coil down here 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.960
 they are the coil of being and two of our 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 measurements is 0 2 is new line of 10 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.850
 inches and the other one is called the spyder 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.850
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.270
 12 inches 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.360
 and here we go to a thousand model freezer 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.850
 280 x which is an aquatic model up 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.350
 approximately 80 meters deep 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.860
 very very very sensitive very easy to operate 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.530
 It has three buttons are volume 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.420
 discrimination 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.710
 and sensitivity the aquatic equipment 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.680
 that reacts very well 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.209
 in the sand 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.780
 do not forget that the sand is this a 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.910
 mineralized bolt 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.670
 It can be used both on land and in 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.740
