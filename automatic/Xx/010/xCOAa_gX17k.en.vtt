00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
look at the base of the blade and work

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.480 
look at the base of the blade and work
our<00:00:15.330> way<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.500> here<00:00:16.830> they've<00:00:17.040> used<00:00:17.280> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
our way up so here they've used a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.950 
our way up so here they've used a
stainless<00:00:17.970> steel<00:00:18.000> runner

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960

the blade forget nice and close which is
this<00:00:24.090> designer<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.780> can<00:00:24.870> see<00:00:25.020> at<00:00:25.110> the<00:00:25.170> top<00:00:25.290> bit

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
this designer you can see at the top bit

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.530 
this designer you can see at the top bit
that<00:00:26.220> saves<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.760> weight<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.030> your<00:00:27.210> overall

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
that saves on the weight of your overall

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.060 
that saves on the weight of your overall
skate<00:00:27.870> by<00:00:28.110> reducing<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.650> weight<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.950> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
skate by reducing the weight of the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.560 
skate by reducing the weight of the
plane<00:00:29.280> at<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.460> skate<00:00:29.730> which<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.030> nice<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.390> see

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
plane at the skate which is nice to see

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.740 
plane at the skate which is nice to see
and<00:00:31.489> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> funny<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> features

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and this is a funny one of the features

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.510 
and this is a funny one of the features
that<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.379> of<00:00:34.530> their<00:00:34.710> models<00:00:35.129> from

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that we use on all of their models from

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.050 
that we use on all of their models from
the<00:00:35.990> CCM<00:00:36.990> new<00:00:37.260> plus<00:00:37.530> zero<00:00:38.220> eight<00:00:38.490> upwards

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
the CCM new plus zero eight upwards

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.460 
the CCM new plus zero eight upwards
you're<00:00:39.570> gonna<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.990> certain<00:00:40.230> design

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
you're gonna see the certain design

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.840 
you're gonna see the certain design
carried<00:00:40.830> out<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.130> all<00:00:41.220> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.400> other<00:00:41.430> skates

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
carried out on all of the other skates

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.910 
carried out on all of the other skates
so<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.050> take<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.380> at<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> holder<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
so if we take a look at the holder that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.800 
so if we take a look at the holder that
CCM<00:00:44.430> you're<00:00:44.520> using<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:44.880> it's<00:00:45.090> their<00:00:45.300> II<00:00:45.480> pro

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
CCM you're using here it's their II pro

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.410 
CCM you're using here it's their II pro
holder<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:47.880> traditional<00:00:48.000> one

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
holder this is a very traditional one

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.390 
holder this is a very traditional one
holder<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.810> CCM<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.290> use<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.650> a<00:00:49.680> large

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
holder the CCM you use on a large

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.560 
holder the CCM you use on a large
variety<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.940> their<00:00:51.150> skates

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
variety of their skates

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000 
variety of their skates
this<00:00:51.810> puts<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.230> optimal<00:00:52.680> height<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
this puts you at the optimal height to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.319 
this puts you at the optimal height to
take<00:00:53.160> full<00:00:53.460> advantage<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.060> agility

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
take full advantage of your agility

take full advantage of your agility
while<00:00:54.750> you're<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> ice<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.860> nice<00:00:56.130> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
while you're on the ice which is nice to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.780 
while you're on the ice which is nice to
see<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.480> turn<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:57.750> skate<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.140> base<00:00:58.790> CCM

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
see if I turn the skate on this base CCM

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.700 
see if I turn the skate on this base CCM
have<00:00:59.940> used<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.390> composite<00:01:01.140> over<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
have used a composite over here which is

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.460 
have used a composite over here which is
called<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.040> M<00:01:02.190> composite<00:01:02.700> exhaust<00:01:03.079> now<00:01:04.079> it's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
called the M composite exhaust now it's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
called the M composite exhaust now it's
really<00:01:04.710> nice<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.399> as<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.759> is<00:01:05.820> one

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really nice to see that as this is one

really nice to see that as this is one
of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> skates<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> CCM<00:01:07.110> line<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.679> has

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
of the skates in the CCM line that has

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.859 
of the skates in the CCM line that has
been<00:01:08.100> able<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> lot<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.939> Veeam<00:01:09.240> advanced

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
been able to use a lot of Veeam advanced

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.120 
been able to use a lot of Veeam advanced
features<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.289> you<00:01:10.409> find<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:10.859> higher-end

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
features that you find on the higher-end

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
features that you find on the higher-end
skates<00:01:11.929> unescape<00:01:12.929> that<00:01:13.109> doesn't<00:01:13.409> carry<00:01:13.859> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
skates unescape that doesn't carry a

skates unescape that doesn't carry a
massive<00:01:14.219> price<00:01:14.579> tag<00:01:14.819> which<00:01:14.969> is<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.329> we<00:01:15.450> like

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:15.569 
massive price tag which is what we like

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:16.700 
massive price tag which is what we like
to<00:01:15.719> see<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.469> lot<00:01:16.679> of

to see there so you get a lot of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410 
to see there so you get a lot of
features<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.189> you'd<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.460> won<00:01:17.609> the<00:01:18.149> match

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
features that you'd have won the match

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.389 
features that you'd have won the match
of<00:01:18.630> higher<00:01:19.139> up<00:01:19.319> skates<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.889> a<00:01:19.950> skate<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
of higher up skates on a skate that

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:21.590 
of higher up skates on a skate that
doesn't<00:01:20.609> have<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> big<00:01:20.939> price<00:01:21.179> tag<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.569> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
doesn't have a big price tag which is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.809 
doesn't have a big price tag which is
great<00:01:21.929> so<00:01:22.889> here<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.219> we<00:01:23.340> said<00:01:23.490> they're<00:01:23.609> using

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
great so here as we said they're using

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.910 
great so here as we said they're using
the<00:01:23.909> composite<00:01:24.299> exhaust<00:01:24.810> system<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.770> outer

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the composite exhaust system the outer

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
the composite exhaust system the outer
sole<00:01:26.249> what<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.030> does<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.359> it<00:01:27.569> gives<00:01:27.749> you<00:01:27.929> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
sole what that does is it gives you a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.169 
sole what that does is it gives you a
very<00:01:28.289> lightweight<00:01:28.619> outer<00:01:29.100> sole<00:01:29.459> a<00:01:29.670> very<00:01:29.909> rigid

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
very lightweight outer sole a very rigid

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.300 
very lightweight outer sole a very rigid
outer<00:01:30.420> sole<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.859> you<00:01:31.950> said<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.249> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
outer sole and as you said it's a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.379 
outer sole and as you said it's a
feature<00:01:32.459> that's<00:01:32.700> found<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:32.999> higher-end

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:33.389 
feature that's found on the higher-end

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.510 
feature that's found on the higher-end
skates<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.289> it<00:01:34.619> being<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.889> nice<00:01:35.039> rigid<00:01:35.369> outer

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
skates so it being a nice rigid outer

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.069 
skates so it being a nice rigid outer
sole<00:01:35.819> it<00:01:35.999> means<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.299> any<00:01:36.450> movement<00:01:36.899> from<00:01:36.929> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
sole it means that any movement from the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
sole it means that any movement from the
inside<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.499> skate<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:38.279> we<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:38.549> translate<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
inside the skate or we then translate it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.639 
inside the skate or we then translate it
directly<00:01:39.450> through<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.929> outer<00:01:40.049> side<00:01:40.289> and<00:01:40.439> onto

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
directly through the outer side and onto

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.019 
directly through the outer side and onto
your<00:01:40.770> blade<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.249> is<00:01:41.399> what<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.639> like<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> see

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029 
your blade which is what we like to see

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:43.249 
your blade which is what we like to see
there<00:01:42.209> so<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.509> nice<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.959> responsive

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
there so it's a nice and responsive

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.379 
there so it's a nice and responsive
outsole<00:01:43.859> which<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> great<00:01:44.999> feature<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> have

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:45.389 
outsole which is a great feature to have

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:49.699 
outsole which is a great feature to have
on<00:01:45.450> these<00:01:45.659> skates<00:01:47.929> so<00:01:48.929> from<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.319> also<00:01:49.529> going

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
on these skates so from there also going

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.440 
on these skates so from there also going
to<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.099> look<00:01:50.279> at<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> M<00:01:50.670> core<00:01:50.880> package<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to take a look at the M core package and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.699 
to take a look at the M core package and
their<00:01:51.539> overall<00:01:51.659> structure<00:01:52.170> at<00:01:52.289> this<00:01:52.409> skate

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
their overall structure at this skate

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.889 
their overall structure at this skate
forget<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.729> gonna<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> nicer<00:01:54.299> closer<00:01:54.719> for

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
forget it gonna get a nicer closer for

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.749 
forget it gonna get a nicer closer for
you<00:01:54.929> if<00:01:55.859> you<00:01:55.920> take<00:01:56.099> a<00:01:56.130> closer<00:01:56.399> look<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.639> can

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you if you take a closer look you can

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.949 
you if you take a closer look you can
see<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.029> CCM<00:01:57.389> have<00:01:57.509> gone<00:01:57.630> ahead<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.840> used

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
see the CCM have gone ahead and used

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.749 
see the CCM have gone ahead and used
some<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:58.799> materials<00:01:59.429> that<00:01:59.490> you'll

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
some of the same materials that you'll

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.489 
some of the same materials that you'll
see<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.329> higher-end<00:02:00.719> skates<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.169> we<00:02:01.289> said

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
see on the higher-end skates as we said

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:02.980 
see on the higher-end skates as we said
so<00:02:01.679> with<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.279> one<00:02:02.399> over<00:02:02.490> here

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
use that almond material the cesium mama

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.460 
use that almond material the cesium mama
that<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.150> might<00:02:05.360> find<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.840> cesium<00:02:06.140> tens

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
that you might find on the cesium tens

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.590 
that you might find on the cesium tens
and<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.950> models<00:02:07.400> above<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.850> which<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.450> nice

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
and the models above that which is nice

feel to it the some of the other

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.880 
feel to it the some of the other
higher-end<00:02:17.870> skates<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.500> doesn't<00:02:18.770> think

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
higher-end skates have it doesn't think

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.440 
higher-end skates have it doesn't think
you<00:02:18.980> used<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.310> certain<00:02:19.880> material<00:02:20.030> that

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
there as well and they're talking about

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.660 
there as well and they're talking about
the<00:02:30.110> main<00:02:30.800> structure<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.280> skate<00:02:31.550> in<00:02:31.640> the

core package for tennis get over some of
the<00:02:34.640> phones<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:34.970> they've<00:02:35.150> used<00:02:35.180> inside<00:02:35.630> here

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the phones that they've used inside here

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.229 
the phones that they've used inside here
are<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.050> traditional<00:02:36.500> U+<00:02:36.980> foams<00:02:37.340> which<00:02:38.060> we

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
are the traditional U+ foams which we

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.790 
are the traditional U+ foams which we
like<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.450> see<00:02:38.720> them<00:02:38.870> also<00:02:39.019> added<00:02:39.350> additional

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
like to see them also added additional

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.229 
like to see them also added additional
foams<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.220> support<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.640> there<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:40.940> improve

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
foams and support in there to improve

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.360 
foams and support in there to improve
the<00:02:41.300> overall<00:02:41.480> structure<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.350> protection<00:02:43.310> of

the overall structure and protection of
this<00:02:43.519> gate<00:02:43.730> which<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:43.940> good<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.300> see<00:02:44.330> there<00:02:44.600> as

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
this gate which is good to see there as

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.660 
this gate which is good to see there as
well<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.380> CCM<00:02:45.769> foams<00:02:46.070> are<00:02:46.310> some<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.550> the

well but the CCM foams are some of the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.759 
well but the CCM foams are some of the
signatures<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.180> CCM<00:02:47.720> used<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.290> kind<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.590> put

what<00:03:51.440> they<00:03:51.530> use<00:03:51.650> remember<00:03:51.829> here<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.100> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
what they use remember here is the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.670 
what they use remember here is the
microphone<00:03:52.519> recliner<00:03:52.970> for<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.510> CCM<00:03:53.930> burn<00:03:54.170> you

microphone recliner for the CCM burn you
plus<00:03:54.920> eight<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.640> what<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:55.940> does<00:03:56.150> give<00:03:56.359> you

plus eight and what that does give you
is<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.660> great<00:03:56.900> moisture<00:03:57.290> management<00:03:57.470> system<00:03:58.010> so

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
is a great moisture management system so

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.890 
is a great moisture management system so
as<00:03:58.670> we<00:03:58.760> said<00:03:58.940> in<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.150> exhaust<00:03:59.420> system<00:03:59.540> that

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
as we said in the exhaust system that

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.000 
as we said in the exhaust system that
will<00:03:59.989> filter<00:04:00.200> out<00:04:00.380> any<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.739> moisture

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
will filter out any of the moisture

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.849 
will filter out any of the moisture
through<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:02.260> outer<00:04:03.260> sole<00:04:03.530> over<00:04:03.680> there<00:04:03.799> you

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
through the outer sole over there you

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.380 
through the outer sole over there you
can<00:04:04.010> see<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.220> outer<00:04:04.370> sole<00:04:04.640> with<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.850> exhaust

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
can see the outer sole with the exhaust

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.759 
can see the outer sole with the exhaust
composit<00:04:05.810> outside<00:04:06.140> over<00:04:06.320> there<00:04:06.440> features

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
composit outside over there features

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.620 
composit outside over there features
those<00:04:06.890> perforations<00:04:07.370> or<00:04:07.609> holes<00:04:07.820> at<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.510> base

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
those perforations or holes at the base

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.180 
those perforations or holes at the base
of<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.840> skate<00:04:09.049> so<00:04:09.170> any<00:04:09.320> moisture<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:09.829> do<00:04:09.950> get

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
of the skate so any moisture you do get

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.920 
of the skate so any moisture you do get
inside<00:04:10.519> there<00:04:10.760> will<00:04:11.209> be<00:04:11.329> filtered<00:04:11.690> out<00:04:11.780> with

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
inside there will be filtered out with

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.590 
inside there will be filtered out with
that<00:04:12.049> exhaust
