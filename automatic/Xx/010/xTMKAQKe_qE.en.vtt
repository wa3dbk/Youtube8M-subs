we're<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.409> going<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.620> create<00:03:52.739> a

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
we're just going to create a

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.729 
we're just going to create a
counterbalance<00:03:53.879> with<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.659> pack<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.290> every

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
counterbalance with this pack so every

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.380 
counterbalance with this pack so every
machine<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.250> different<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:56.849> I<00:03:56.909> can't<00:03:57.150> give<00:03:57.359> you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
machine is different so I can't give you

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.599 
machine is different so I can't give you
really<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:57.930> ratio<00:03:58.469> so<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.069> have<00:03:59.219> to<00:03:59.370> figure

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
really in ratio so you have to figure

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.539 
really in ratio so you have to figure
out<00:03:59.670> that's<00:04:00.420> ratio<00:04:00.900> first<00:04:01.819> up<00:04:04.220> on<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.370> both

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
out that's ratio first up on the both

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.210 
out that's ratio first up on the both
handles<00:04:06.379> one<00:04:07.379> at<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.220> time<00:04:08.579> good<00:04:09.299> posture<00:04:10.220> and

when they gets harder a lot of us will

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.930 
when they gets harder a lot of us will

your<00:04:42.640> legs<00:04:42.970> straight<00:04:43.300> report<00:04:43.930> I'd<00:04:45.660> come<00:04:46.660> down

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
your legs straight report I'd come down

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.130 
your legs straight report I'd come down
to<00:04:47.230> your<00:04:47.350> elbows<00:04:47.710> get<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.430> nightmare<00:04:48.610> and

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
to your elbows get to the nightmare and

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.510 
to your elbows get to the nightmare and
getting<00:04:50.140> off<00:04:50.290> these<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.710> be<00:04:50.830> tricky<00:04:51.190> as<00:04:51.280> well

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
getting off these to be tricky as well

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.100 
getting off these to be tricky as well
so<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.120> recommend<00:04:52.750> taking<00:04:53.470> off<00:04:54.360> step<00:04:55.360> down<00:04:55.630> and

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
so I recommend taking off step down and

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.230 
so I recommend taking off step down and
then<00:04:56.410> with<00:04:56.620> your<00:04:56.770> second<00:04:57.190> leg<00:04:57.370> bring<00:04:58.000> it<00:04:58.120> all

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
then with your second leg bring it all

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.890 
then with your second leg bring it all
the<00:04:58.270> way<00:04:58.450> up<00:04:58.570> until<00:04:59.290> the<00:05:00.100> plate<00:05:01.090> hits<00:05:01.690> the

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
the way up until the plate hits the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.500 
the way up until the plate hits the
bottom<00:05:02.230> otherwise<00:05:03.000> releasing<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.270> plate

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
bottom otherwise releasing to the plate

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.920 
bottom otherwise releasing to the plate
to<00:05:04.690> them

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
to them

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.600 
to them
wide<00:05:05.200> out<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.650> bottom<00:05:05.980> is<00:05:06.100> to<00:05:06.190> make<00:05:06.340> a<00:05:06.370> big

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
wide out the bottom is to make a big

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.190 
wide out the bottom is to make a big
bang<00:05:06.880> towards<00:05:07.180> everything<00:05:07.420> seriously

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
bang towards everything seriously

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.250 
bang towards everything seriously
so<00:05:08.470> go<00:05:09.070> ahead<00:05:09.130> step<00:05:09.460> on<00:05:09.670> down<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.690> is<00:05:10.930> the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
so go ahead step on down that is the

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.420 
so go ahead step on down that is the
assisted<00:05:11.770> dip

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
assisted dip

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.960 
assisted dip
big<00:05:13.120> leg<00:05:13.390> press<00:05:13.690> has<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.020> lower<00:05:14.320> body<00:05:14.590> exercise

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
big leg press has a lower body exercise

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.300 
big leg press has a lower body exercise
using<00:05:15.970> machine<00:05:16.360> so<00:05:16.990> I'm<00:05:17.650> gonna<00:05:17.770> go<00:05:17.950> ahead<00:05:17.980> and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
using machine so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.610 
using machine so I'm gonna go ahead and
climb<00:05:18.460> into<00:05:18.730> my<00:05:18.790> leg<00:05:19.090> press<00:05:19.360> here<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.840> every

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
climb into my leg press here and every

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.350 
climb into my leg press here and every
single<00:05:20.710> machine<00:05:21.100> is<00:05:21.430> a<00:05:21.460> little<00:05:21.580> bit<00:05:21.880> different

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
single machine is a little bit different

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.820 
single machine is a little bit different
so<00:05:22.540> everyone's<00:05:22.870> going<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.080> have<00:05:23.200> different

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
so everyone's going to have different

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.610 
so everyone's going to have different
safety<00:05:24.100> handles<00:05:24.640> on<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.970> sides<00:05:25.440> but<00:05:26.440> these

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
safety handles on the sides but these

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.410 
safety handles on the sides but these
are<00:05:26.770> going<00:05:26.860> to<00:05:26.950> lock<00:05:27.130> for<00:05:27.730> weight<00:05:27.880> into<00:05:28.180> place

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
are going to lock for weight into place

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.820 
are going to lock for weight into place
so<00:05:28.930> we're<00:05:29.050> going<00:05:29.140> to<00:05:29.200> have<00:05:29.350> our<00:05:29.500> feet<00:05:29.770> shoulder

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
so we're going to have our feet shoulder

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.670 
so we're going to have our feet shoulder
width<00:05:30.370> apart<00:05:30.450> let's<00:05:31.450> press<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:32.080> weight<00:05:32.290> up<00:05:32.470> to

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
width apart let's press the weight up to

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.320 
width apart let's press the weight up to
start<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:34.210> then<00:05:35.020> power<00:05:35.980> machine<00:05:36.580> is<00:05:36.760> built
