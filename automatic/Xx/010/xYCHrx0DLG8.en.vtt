00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.909
 used to be 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:11.319
 prohibit the price of the shares 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.999
 pretty a big compliment I think the boys are 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.279
 hard for fighting in very hectic competition 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.130
 because it was an idiotic game especially on the last team 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.539
 Jane instead and fills a little about yourself to 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.730
 You know she's nine years old when it comes to the optimistic 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.420
 if you then conquered in the back to the ball and you are and then immediately lost again yes 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.310
 then the pressure increases 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.010
 and then just the decision of the referee but also did not always dive 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.400
 very happy 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:46.540
 making him 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.080
 and no luckily here he later had more come from recognizable the box however 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 and I hit the ball and the man 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.570
 and the fact that the largest 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 what did you think then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.980
 well i think there was the man that i heard there was the ball hard behind 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.660
 I have nothing to do about it 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.670
 as long as you did that worked out well 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.920
 what do you think of yes there goes the final 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.040
 a possible buyer easier relationship with the training can just do that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.810
 a good idea of ​​what 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740
 but I had a bit exciting but difficult but still a few months 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.940
 many children last minute temporarily 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.060
 and then comes into existence 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.580
 and then it will come 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.800
 well indeed competition in the away match of children also in the too 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.050
 it seemed so 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.560
 so i knew that so you can just have a volley and he hit me with my 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800
 finger indicating the retail premises 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.970
 score 2 0 and shoot FC Utrecht to the final of the cup 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.160
 you can buy a festive touch there 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 weird it wasn't a brief statement 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.600
 if you look at it now, people look at it in the first and the first start of the first half 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.490
 with which definition the best ten 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.500
 got it and therefore the final held that we 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.740
 just want to be hit hard 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.090
 story 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.550
 Verbeek has the right to use weapons 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.629
 then of course it is 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.969
 last year did not come further than the semi-final 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:16.139
 yes, now again here the semi-final tie is not nice to perform 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.220
 that made 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.449
 the decisive one 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.099
 Yes, that's true 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.450
 Fortunately it has gotten the judge it goes on and on to 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.329
 the finale 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.479
 yes, because that is only on 4 June 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.329
 opponent's roof 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.849
 the others 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.549
 difficult team there 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.839
 so they could put better 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.179
 sprout became difficult shortly before time 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.489
 mo of the weather 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.320
 That is what I think Utrecht expects you to play after the cup 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.090
 yes, sportsmen themselves also like to change for 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.019
 I played you like a cup final 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.619
 partly due to a first time 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.479
 must be in the semi-final 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.919
 yes final filipiak 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.499
 yes that's the theater 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.239
 or say to set a little the same position as the 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.949
 you know what to expect 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.949
 also at the games of chance 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.309
 if you want more video a summary responses should be brief and to the point 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.479
 site 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.809
 vvv has 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:21.139
 So
