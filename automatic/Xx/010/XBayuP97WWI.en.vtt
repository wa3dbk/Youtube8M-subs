like<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.910> got<00:03:42.910> some<00:03:43.090> samples<00:03:43.299> in<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
like that got some samples in the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.210 
like that got some samples in the
world's<00:03:45.070> above<00:03:45.549> what<00:03:46.090> we've<00:03:46.989> had<00:03:47.170> our<00:03:47.440> product

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
world's above what we've had our product

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.759 
world's above what we've had our product
before<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.239> think<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.660> that's<00:03:50.049> an<00:03:50.350> area

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
before so I think that that's an area

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.740 
before so I think that that's an area
that<00:03:50.920> you'll<00:03:51.130> see<00:03:51.310> improvement<00:03:51.820> on<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.660> know
