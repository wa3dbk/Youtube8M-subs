 Hughes God game this season well 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.950
 After winning 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.590
 Its teeth 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.580
 I have had three seasons

 Win 2 out of 3 9 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.860
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.430
 Well, I aimed at this well though 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.770
 I did not think that the results would come out so far 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.770
 Ios, bowler and chicks in last match 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.060
 If still To me example after all as a team 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.290
 Won twice in the nation 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.540
 Nde I think the part that is conceited I'm I say it was in the team 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.430
 Oh dear 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.320
 It did not become a firmly team united to eliminate the kind of parts for the last playoff 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.710
 Were you 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.710

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.409
 It we are doing because I think I did not eat until now 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 I want to give a shock to Tokyo for a moment 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.450
 But the team that is experiencing dr is 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 I felt sorry 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.780
 After all 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.380
 I feel strongly that I really want to win, so the difference 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.800
 The 0 Tabasco highest bowlers 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.300
 In suddenly I say I can do this on the web 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.450
 It has a very big meaning to me 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.930
 Both of us ahead of us 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.020
 Because it is a team that went up to a regular team 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.550
 I really want to break down 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.860
 dl De 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.600
 3 years is about three and a half years 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.600
 Let me experience it for the longest time 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.950
 After all I can not win 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.290
 It's a shame everyone 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.440
 All the way thought that if the win if 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.700
 I gathered weekly to had to practice depending on that go up to the Miura team 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.289
 Everyone's feelings are even more 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.289

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.030
 Work hard and go up 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.030
 I was able to do more and more up and down. 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.170
 after 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.800
 After all there is no center in zero until now 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.569
 I always played in center play and I always lost in rebound 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.300
 In that part 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.420
 Well so 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.910
 By the fact of 2m over entering 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.910
 It has decreased messed up also our burden 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.250
 What Te say now very easy to do 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.240

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.240
 1 won 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.739
 It is the basis of the team 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.739
 And do it together from the break in the Doggie 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.010

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.880
 Cheering 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.410
 I think not 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.590
 I think I can not win 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.610

 Voice Attari After that I already 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.140
 If you are operating a Magu error team 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.150
 If this is a good play then the princess will rise 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.960
 If there was such a thing 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.230

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.230
