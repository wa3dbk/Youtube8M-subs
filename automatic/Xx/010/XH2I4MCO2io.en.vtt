modular<00:00:22.830> police<00:00:23.580> station<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.240> completed<00:00:24.840> in

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
modular police station was completed in

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.929 
modular police station was completed in
September<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.740> 2013

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
September of 2013

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
September of 2013
and<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.410> designed<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> fire

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and it was designed with the fire

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.590 
and it was designed with the fire
station<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.449> mind<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.960> 101-97<00:00:32.120> but<00:00:33.120> basically

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
station in mind the 101-97 but basically

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.709 
station in mind the 101-97 but basically
we<00:00:33.930> decided<00:00:34.620> we've<00:00:35.340> had<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.820> fans<00:00:36.120> emailing

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
we decided we've had some fans emailing

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.080 
we decided we've had some fans emailing
us<00:00:37.079> through<00:00:37.500> our<00:00:37.590> website<00:00:37.890> they're<00:00:38.460> asking

us through our website they're asking

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.049 
us through our website they're asking
for<00:00:39.390> different<00:00:39.540> models<00:00:40.129> we<00:00:41.129> built<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> dunkin

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
for different models we built the dunkin

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.779 
for different models we built the dunkin
donut<00:00:42.480> shop<00:00:42.809> last<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.829> decided<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.579> one

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
donut shop last and we decided this one

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
donut shop last and we decided this one
we're<00:00:44.969> gonna<00:00:45.030> build<00:00:45.360> another<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.289> we've

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we're gonna build another one that we've

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.930 
we're gonna build another one that we've
been<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:46.980> wanting<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> build<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
been actually wanting to build for a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.260 
been actually wanting to build for a
long<00:00:48.120> time<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> custom<00:00:49.500> modular

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
long time which is the custom modular

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.209 
long time which is the custom modular
and<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.440> built<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and as you can see it is built on the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.819 
and as you can see it is built on the
same<00:00:53.489> scale<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:54.870> modular<00:00:55.440> sets

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
same scale as all of our modular sets

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.439 
same scale as all of our modular sets
whether<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> ones<00:00:56.879> from<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> Lego

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
whether it's the ones from the Lego

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
whether it's the ones from the Lego
company<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> fire<00:00:58.739> station<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> fire

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the other custom modulars that we have

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
the other custom modulars that we have
like<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> Starbucks<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.350> all<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.520> our

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
like the Starbucks here all of our

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
like the Starbucks here all of our
modular<00:01:09.390> sets<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.530> again<00:01:10.950> what

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
modular sets and this is again what

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.969 
modular sets and this is again what
separates<00:01:11.790> us<00:01:12.060> from<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.930> many<00:01:13.140> other<00:01:13.470> Lego

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
separates us from so many other Lego

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.200 
separates us from so many other Lego
websites<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.259> Lego<00:01:16.259> instructions<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
websites and Lego instructions all of

our sets are always fully furnished we

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.620 
our sets are always fully furnished we
don't<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.159> give<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.970> set<00:01:24.509> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
don't like just to give you a set of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
don't like just to give you a set of
instructions<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.619> our<00:01:25.770> videos<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.430> then

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
instructions with our videos and then

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.140 
instructions with our videos and then
basically<00:01:27.119> let<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.869> figure<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.619> rest

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
basically let you figure out the rest

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
basically let you figure out the rest
everything<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> our

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
everything that we do with all of our

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.330 
everything that we do with all of our
sets<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.750> idea<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.159> only

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
sets the idea is that we will not only

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
sets the idea is that we will not only
show<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.729> how<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> build<00:01:36.299> them<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.079> we'll

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
show you how to build them but we'll

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
show you how to build them but we'll
also<00:01:37.409> show<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.950> how<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> furnish<00:01:38.610> them<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
also show you how to furnish them so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.719 
also show you how to furnish them so
like<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.020> example<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> forensics

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
like for example we have the forensics

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.600 
like for example we have the forensics
lab<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.659> police<00:01:43.079> officers<00:01:43.740> lunch<00:01:44.220> room

lab and the police officers lunch room
the<00:01:44.790> staff<00:01:44.850> room<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> locker<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the staff room with a locker or in the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.719 
the staff room with a locker or in the
second<00:01:48.090> floor<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.689> actually<00:01:49.170> build<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.680> jail<00:01:50.130> we

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
second floor we actually build a jail we

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.490 
second floor we actually build a jail we
got<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> jail<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.840> an<00:01:51.960> interrogation

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
got the jail we got an interrogation

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.340 
got the jail we got an interrogation
room<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.549> again<00:01:53.939> an<00:01:54.119> office<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
room we have again an office for the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.310 
room we have again an office for the
police<00:01:55.950> officers<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> main<00:01:58.020> lobby

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
police officers and on the main lobby

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.999 
police officers and on the main lobby
here<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.880> actual<00:02:00.450> garage<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.829> was

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
here we have an actual garage that was

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
sets you will get access to them as well

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.770 
sets you will get access to them as well
in<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.069> case<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.700> police<00:02:57.939> department

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
here we have four videos that are about

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.699 
here we have four videos that are about
an<00:03:02.409> hour<00:03:02.590> long<00:03:03.159> the<00:03:04.120> first<00:03:04.450> video<00:03:04.750> talks<00:03:05.319> about

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
an hour long the first video talks about

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.589 
an hour long the first video talks about
the<00:03:05.950> overall<00:03:06.819> layout<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:09.400> second<00:03:09.939> video<00:03:10.299> then

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
the overall layout the second video then

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.990 
the overall layout the second video then
and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.889> third<00:03:12.159> and<00:03:12.189> the<00:03:12.400> fourth<00:03:12.639> they

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
and then the third and the fourth they

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.440 
and then the third and the fourth they
talk<00:03:13.299> each<00:03:13.599> about<00:03:14.109> a<00:03:14.169> floor<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.069> what<00:03:15.909> we<00:03:16.150> do

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
talk each about a floor and what we do

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.869 
talk each about a floor and what we do
what<00:03:16.689> separates<00:03:17.379> us<00:03:17.650> from<00:03:17.680> all<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.729> other

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
what separates us from all the other

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.990 
what separates us from all the other
Lego<00:03:19.239> websites<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.620> we<00:03:20.829> actually<00:03:21.129> do<00:03:21.699> not

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
Lego websites is that we actually do not

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.740 
Lego websites is that we actually do not
believe<00:03:22.599> in<00:03:22.870> written<00:03:23.470> instructions<00:03:24.510> what<00:03:25.510> we

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
believe in written instructions what we

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.390 
believe in written instructions what we
do<00:03:26.079> is<00:03:26.379> we<00:03:26.709> give<00:03:27.129> you<00:03:28.439> everything<00:03:29.439> in<00:03:29.919> detail

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
sizes everything and instead of you

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.390 
sizes everything and instead of you
going<00:03:37.269> out<00:03:37.569> and<00:03:37.870> spending<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.709> lot<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.069> money

you can then simply either use the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.659 
you can then simply either use the
pieces<00:03:43.689> if<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.139> have<00:03:44.470> them<00:03:44.769> or<00:03:44.979> better<00:03:45.310> yet

use your own pieces and come up with
your<00:03:49.329> own<00:03:49.780> ideas<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:51.459> example<00:03:51.609> if<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:52.659> go<00:03:52.930> to

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
your own ideas for example if you go to

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.890 
your own ideas for example if you go to
the<00:03:53.319> Lego<00:03:53.590> website<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.729> I'm<00:03:55.599> just<00:03:55.689> going<00:03:55.840> to

the Lego website and I'm just going to

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.009 
the Lego website and I'm just going to
use<00:03:56.109> this<00:03:56.290> as<00:03:56.500> an<00:03:56.650> example<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:57.459> big<00:03:58.329> plate<00:03:58.720> like

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.409 
use this as an example a big plate like
this<00:03:59.049> can<00:03:59.560> cost<00:03:59.799> you<00:04:00.009> up<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.189> two<00:04:00.699> dollars<00:04:01.000> a

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
this can cost you up to two dollars a

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.349 
this can cost you up to two dollars a
piece<00:04:02.430> instead<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.549> giving<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:04.000> written

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
piece instead of giving you written

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.300 
piece instead of giving you written
instructions<00:04:05.079> that<00:04:05.319> tell<00:04:05.379> you<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:06.009> need

instructions that tell you that you need

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.890 
instructions that tell you that you need
20<00:04:06.759> of<00:04:06.909> them<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.299> you're<00:04:07.449> gonna<00:04:07.569> end<00:04:07.780> up

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
20 of them and you're gonna end up

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.069 
20 of them and you're gonna end up
spending<00:04:08.169> $40<00:04:09.129> just<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:10.180> build<00:04:10.449> the<00:04:10.540> pool<00:04:10.840> just

spending $40 just to build the pool just
for<00:04:11.169> the<00:04:11.349> place<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:13.060> tell<00:04:13.689> you<00:04:13.959> instead<00:04:14.349> the

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
how we use different

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.929 
how we use different
plates<00:04:27.389> this<00:04:28.389> is<00:04:28.629> our<00:04:28.870> idea<00:04:29.430> instead<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.610> you

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:30.939 
plates this is our idea instead of you

plates this is our idea instead of you
having<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.569> go<00:04:31.599> out<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.319> spend<00:04:32.800> a<00:04:32.889> lot<00:04:33.099> of

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
having to go out and spend a lot of

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.689 
having to go out and spend a lot of
money<00:04:33.430> on<00:04:33.729> LEGO<00:04:33.999> pieces<00:04:34.740> we<00:04:35.740> show<00:04:36.099> you<00:04:36.159> how<00:04:36.639> we

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
money on LEGO pieces we show you how we

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.499 
money on LEGO pieces we show you how we
use<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.330> same<00:04:37.719> pieces<00:04:38.439> again<00:04:39.069> and<00:04:39.310> again<00:04:39.669> so

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
use the same pieces again and again so

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.950 
use the same pieces again and again so
for<00:04:40.779> example<00:04:41.289> this<00:04:41.499> is<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.770> dark<00:04:42.449> gray<00:04:43.449> stone

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
for example this is the dark gray stone

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.469 
for example this is the dark gray stone
pieces<00:04:44.650> if<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:45.310> don't<00:04:45.669> have<00:04:45.969> them<00:04:46.150> if<00:04:46.330> you

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
pieces if you don't have them if you

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.719 
pieces if you don't have them if you
have<00:04:46.629> a<00:04:46.659> bunch<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:47.080> red<00:04:47.289> and<00:04:47.439> blue<00:04:47.620> pieces<00:04:47.949> use

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
have a bunch of red and blue pieces use

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.450 
have a bunch of red and blue pieces use
them<00:04:49.060> for<00:04:50.050> example<00:04:50.409> we<00:04:50.740> tell<00:04:51.069> you<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.370> our

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
them for example we tell you in our

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.730 
them for example we tell you in our
video<00:04:51.879> that<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:52.810> wall<00:04:53.229> is<00:04:53.699> 24<00:04:54.699> studs<00:04:55.240> wide

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
video that this wall is 24 studs wide

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.550 
video that this wall is 24 studs wide
now<00:04:56.740> if<00:04:57.009> you<00:04:57.340> have<00:04:57.639> three<00:04:58.509> pieces<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.229> are

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
now if you have three pieces that are

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.059 
now if you have three pieces that are
the<00:05:00.129> one<00:05:00.460> by<00:05:00.699> eights<00:05:00.969> you<00:05:01.330> can<00:05:01.750> use<00:05:02.020> them<00:05:02.259> maybe

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
the one by eights you can use them maybe

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.409 
the one by eights you can use them maybe
you<00:05:03.370> have<00:05:03.639> a<00:05:03.669> 1<00:05:04.060> by<00:05:04.270> 16<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.560> point<00:05:05.919> is<00:05:06.219> we<00:05:07.120> can

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
you have a 1 by 16 the point is we can

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.709 
you have a 1 by 16 the point is we can
save<00:05:07.810> you<00:05:08.139> time<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.860> money<00:05:09.069> by<00:05:10.000> telling<00:05:10.569> you

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:10.719 
save you time and money by telling you

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.260 
save you time and money by telling you
the<00:05:10.900> size<00:05:11.199> and<00:05:11.650> then<00:05:11.919> you<00:05:12.189> can<00:05:12.490> use<00:05:12.759> the<00:05:12.969> pieces

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
the size and then you can use the pieces

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.649 
the size and then you can use the pieces
yourself<00:05:14.020> whatever<00:05:14.319> you<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:16.060> is<00:05:16.360> why
