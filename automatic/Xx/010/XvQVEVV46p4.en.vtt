00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.020
 most popular operating system in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.680
 present is microsoft 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.330
 windows 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.490
 it is installed on most 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 computers all over the world don't think that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.080
 open a big secret if I say that on 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.820
 post-soviet space overwhelming 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.649
 most windows installed 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.050
 are pirated i mean not 

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.849
 licensed I will not go deep into 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.130
 the moral side of the question I will say only about 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.050
 more prosaic operating system 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 is the main program on 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 computer depends on its reliability as 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 trouble-free operation of the computer and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.410
 integrity and security of your personal 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.540
 information all our life quietly 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.880
 is reflected on the internet and already for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.130
 many have become the norm to pay for purchases 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.930
 goods via the Internet to have electronic 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.760
 money and store personal data on 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 computer so happened that because 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.110
 its popularity windows became the goal 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 for cheaters imperfections and and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.010
 the device made the system not quite 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.930
 safe virus and trojans 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.970
 spyware and other malware 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.460
 software that is targeted 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.320
 appears on windows every day and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 multiply exponentially 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.840
 besides this set of popular 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.040
 programs under windows are paid and 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.200
 users not wanting to spend money 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.540
 again resorts to various activators 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.180
 and pirated versions of these programs that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.620
 already inherently unsafe 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.750
 because the person who hacked the program 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.909
 may well sew a Trojan virus into it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.229
 or spy program I do not want to argue 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.049
 that all pirated software 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.820
 the malicious software is wrong but 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.799
 yet the chance to pick up the infection on 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.810
 so-called in different sites that is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.670
 on sites that are laid out 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.210
 all sorts of activators and hacked 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.400
 programs 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.140
 probability of catching an infection on such 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.840
 sites close to a hundred percent 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.460
 besides this new trend company 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.460
 microsoft not all users 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.810
 accepted with open arms 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.250
 many extremely disappointed new 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 windows 8 interface 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.049
 this course that the company took 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.880
 microsoft but windows at least for now 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.830
 occupies a leading position in the market 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.659
 operating systems however is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.000
 far from the only operating 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.799
 systems many users have heard of 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.170
 linux how about free that is how 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.000
 free operating system but to 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.580
 sorry sensible and structured 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 no linux information 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.300
 at least the information that was 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.310
 would be geared towards beginners 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.950
 There are certainly sites that are dedicated 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.020
 Linux and such sites a lot but I 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.700
 not yet found a single resource which 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.860
 could safely recommend how 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.110
 Beginner's Step-by-Step Guide 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.360
 that's why I decided to create such 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.640
 manual alone I don't want 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.310
 record scraps of video from which 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.170
 there will be little use 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.480
 the whole series that is a video course which 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.460
 will be geared towards newbies i'm not 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.800
 I set a goal and you give 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.230
 comprehensive operating information 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.180
 linux system since this topic 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.160
 immense soon you will understand it myself 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.470
 I am not a guru in this area 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.820
 an ordinary user who has 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.560
 some experience in this 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.900
 operating system and wants to share 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.810
 this experience with all interested 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.730
 This course will only lift the curtain into the world. 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.250
 linux well, then you yourself 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.350
 be able to develop in this topic and so 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.110
 let's see what attracts so 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.180
 linux and what advantages it has in 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.070
 the first is free of charge 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.080
 most operating systems which 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.840
 created on linux is free 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.790
 secondly, it's reliability and safety 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.220
 the principle itself is embedded in the operating room 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.530
 the system makes it reliable and free 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.840
 from viruses there is of course malicious 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.489
 programs and under linux but probability 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.709
 hitting such programs on the computer 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.510
 it is highly unlikely that you only need to comply 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.060
 simple rules that I will tell 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.590
 later and installing linux accordingly 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.930
 on your computer, you can forget forever 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.480
 about antivirus means you can save 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.640
 because many people use paid money 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.320
 Antivirus windows also by 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.850
 imagine antivirus constant visit to 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.370
 computer ram and 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.290
 use his resources and that means 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.519
 that you refused an antivirus 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.720
 get some boost 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.120
 performance 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.280
 Well, in the third you can pick up linux 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.989
 which will work fine on the weak 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.730
 powerful computer that no longer pulls 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.250
 windows 7 or windows 8 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.769
 and we all remember that windows xp 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.760
 the company is no longer supported 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.519
 microsoft 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.769
 so summarize linux this freedom in everything 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.049
 freedom from licenses and excess cash 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.359
 spending free from viruses and malware 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.320
 software seemingly 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.510
 so many benefits 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.550
 but not all unfortunately so rosy and about 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.990
 this should also be known firstly 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.300
 understand that the vast majority 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.820
 programs that you are used to simply not 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.919
 run on linux you have to search 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.490
 analogues and not always possible 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.010
 pick up 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.510
 but you always need some 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.460
 time to get used to the new program 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.800
 analogue which certainly causes 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.240
 inconvenience have the ability to run 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.490
 many programs that were 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.860
 oriented under windows and on linux 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.360
 but this opportunity is far from perfect 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.820
 and not all programs will work 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.039
 correctly about this I will tell 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.710
 in the course of the course well, I hasten to disappoint 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.330
 computer game lovers you are not exactly 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.039
 It is worth switching to linux so 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.229
 almost all popular toys 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.630
 written under windows and run them under 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.400
 linux will not always in 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.090
 second and linux is not yet very 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.350
 is popular 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.330
 which means get 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.370
 comprehensive answer to your question in 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.620
 more experienced users will not 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.240
 always less sure 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.000
 more windows users 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.099
 than linux users if before you 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.050
 could ask a question to your friends or 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.210
 colleagues now rather 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.889
 all have to look for answers to the question in 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.130
 Internet on various thematic 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.949
 forums in the third even in linux and were 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.580
 serious steps have been taken in terms of convenience 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.780
 user interaction with 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.940
 operating system 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.550
 but still a lot in linux is done 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.440
 via command line for users 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.039
 who don't really like 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.650
 experiment with new programs 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.660
 and that is unlikely to cause any problem 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.789
 lovers of experiments will have to 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.710
 deal with the teams and the so-called 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.419
 terminal through which it is necessary 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.699
 communicate with the operating system 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.139
 Well, in the fourth linux is not alone 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.630
 operating system such as 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.360
 windows 7 and all windows 7 versions 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.060
 home and primary professional 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.740
 maximum they all look the same 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.930
 linux is just the core ie base 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.880
 operating system and on this game 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.039
 created hundreds of operating systems 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.680
 which differ in appearance and sometimes quite 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.930
 This can be considered as a plus. 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.909
 so and minus plus since every 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.979
 can find linux in itself and 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.529
 minus since complexity arises 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.839
 of choice 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.729
 how to make this choice what linux 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.629
 set how to figure it out 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.999
 diversity 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:27.809
 I will try to answer all these questions 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.969
 during the course 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:31.829
 Well, in conclusion I will say that despite 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.719
 some significant cons 

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:35.549
 linux operating system is quite 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.439
 interesting not from my point of view 

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:40.669
 it is perfect for use 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.669
 on a home computer
