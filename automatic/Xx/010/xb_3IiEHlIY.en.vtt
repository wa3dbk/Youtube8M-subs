this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.350> quick<00:00:01.620> video<00:00:01.800> on<00:00:01.979> how<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:02.340> fixed<00:00:02.909> my

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
this is a quick video on how I fixed my

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.840 
this is a quick video on how I fixed my
reverse<00:00:03.480> osmosis<00:00:04.020> water<00:00:04.290> filter<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.250> have

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
reverse osmosis water filter I have

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.640 
reverse osmosis water filter I have
recently<00:00:06.089> changed<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.990> filters<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:09.620> after<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
recently changed the filters and after a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.600 
recently changed the filters and after a
couple<00:00:11.010> days<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.550> noticed<00:00:12.230> that<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.530> was

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
couple days I noticed that it was

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.890 
couple days I noticed that it was
continually<00:00:14.610> running<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.360> could<00:00:15.540> hear<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
continually running you could hear the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.890 
continually running you could hear the
water<00:00:16.139> filtering<00:00:16.770> non-stop<00:00:17.520> even<00:00:18.510> after<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
water filtering non-stop even after the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.620 
water filtering non-stop even after the
tank<00:00:19.170> had<00:00:19.380> gotten<00:00:19.590> full<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> researched<00:00:21.449> it

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
tank had gotten full so I researched it

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.500 
tank had gotten full so I researched it
on<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> internet<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.590> found<00:00:23.300> that<00:00:24.300> it

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
on the internet and I found that it

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.589 
on the internet and I found that it
could<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.140> auto<00:00:25.380> shutoff<00:00:25.890> valve<00:00:26.539> or<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
could be the auto shutoff valve or the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.970 
could be the auto shutoff valve or the
check<00:00:28.109> valve<00:00:28.730> here<00:00:29.730> I've<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.150> my<00:00:30.590> towel<00:00:31.590> laid

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
check valve here I've got my towel laid

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
check valve here I've got my towel laid
out<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.460> got<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:32.940> plastic<00:00:33.300> tub

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
out and I got this little plastic tub

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.490 
out and I got this little plastic tub
which<00:00:34.110> works<00:00:34.410> real<00:00:34.649> good<00:00:36.350> pull<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:39.500> now

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
which works real good pull this out now

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410 
which works real good pull this out now
this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> auto<00:00:41.219> shutoff<00:00:41.640> valve<00:00:42.030> here

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this is the auto shutoff valve here

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.569 
this is the auto shutoff valve here
before<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> apart<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.399> suggest

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
before you take it apart I would suggest

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.180 
before you take it apart I would suggest
that<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.030> mark<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.629> lines<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that you mark the lines so you know you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
that you mark the lines so you know you
put<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> back<00:00:47.730> together<00:00:47.910> correctly<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.680> here's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
put it back together correctly so here's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
put it back together correctly so here's
the<00:00:50.039> auto<00:00:50.219> shutoff<00:00:50.640> valve<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the auto shutoff valve and I'm going to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.319 
the auto shutoff valve and I'm going to
sit<00:00:52.379> has<00:00:52.500> screws<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.120> take

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
sit has screws on it I'm going to take

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.150 
sit has screws on it I'm going to take
it<00:00:54.420> apart<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.989> see<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.469> there's<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> piece<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
it apart and see if there's a piece of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.790 
it apart and see if there's a piece of
dirt<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.850> something<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.469> here's<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
dirt in there or something so here's the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.639 
dirt in there or something so here's the
inside<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> auto<00:00:59.730> shutoff<00:01:00.059> valve

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
inside of the auto shutoff valve

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.569 
inside of the auto shutoff valve
basically<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.800> happens<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> water

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
basically what happens is the water

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.080 
basically what happens is the water
comes<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:04.530> pushes<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:06.360> rubber<00:01:06.810> seal

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
comes in it pushes on this rubber seal

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.740 
comes in it pushes on this rubber seal
it<00:01:09.090> pushes<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.320> plastic<00:01:10.560> piston

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
it pushes on this little plastic piston

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
it pushes on this little plastic piston
which<00:01:12.750> pushes<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.920> rubber<00:01:14.369> seal<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
which pushes on this rubber seal and it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.679 
which pushes on this rubber seal and it
closes<00:01:16.460> this<00:01:17.460> part<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.420> shuts

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
closes this part right here and it shuts

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
closes this part right here and it shuts
the<00:01:18.780> water<00:01:19.049> off<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.950> table<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> only<00:01:20.400> thing

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the water off the table the only thing

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.480 
the water off the table the only thing
that<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.180> wrong<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.200> rubber<00:01:23.100> seals

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that can go wrong is the rubber seals

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.969 
that can go wrong is the rubber seals
will<00:01:23.850> tear<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.400> looks<00:01:26.640> fine<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
will tear and this one looks fine and

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.310 
will tear and this one looks fine and
this<00:01:28.979> looks<00:01:29.250> fine<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.000> close<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:31.049> end

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
this looks fine and if you close one end

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
this looks fine and if you close one end
and<00:01:31.729> blow<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.780> side<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.619> there's<00:01:35.159> no

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and blow in on this side if there's no

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.999 
and blow in on this side if there's no
leak<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.210> know<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.650> part

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
leak then you know it's good this part

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.149 
leak then you know it's good this part
right<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> check<00:01:39.000> valve<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.159> it's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
right here is the check valve and it's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.789 
right here is the check valve and it's
only<00:01:41.909> supposed<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> let<00:01:42.630> water<00:01:42.869> go<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.530> way

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
only supposed to let water go one way

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.910 
only supposed to let water go one way
and<00:01:44.570> that's<00:01:45.570> why<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.020> mine<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.350> broke<00:01:46.740> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and that's why I think mine is broke is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
and that's why I think mine is broke is
because<00:01:47.310> once<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.119> water<00:01:48.659> pressure<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> shut

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
because once the water pressure is shut

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
because once the water pressure is shut
off<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.799> tank<00:01:50.220> continues<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.509> backflow<00:01:53.000> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
off the tank continues to backflow to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060 
off the tank continues to backflow to
the<00:01:54.149> waste<00:01:54.360> water<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.470> here's<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> check

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the waste water so here's the check

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.429 
the waste water so here's the check
valve<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> broken

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
valve and I think this is the broken

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.520 
valve and I think this is the broken
part<00:01:58.860> because<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.729> was<00:02:00.479> able<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.810> blow<00:02:01.290> in

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
part because I was able to blow in

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.649 
part because I was able to blow in
through<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.009> side<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.640> air<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.420> come<00:02:03.630> out

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
through this side and air would come out

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.800 
through this side and air would come out
that<00:02:03.960> side<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.430> was<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.909> would<00:02:06.270> blow<00:02:06.600> in

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
that side and I was it I would blow in

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.510 
that side and I was it I would blow in
this<00:02:06.990> side<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.649> air<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:08.009> come<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.220> that

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
this side and air would come out that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.979 
this side and air would come out that
side<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.360> supposed<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.810> that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
side and it's not supposed to do that

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.380 
side and it's not supposed to do that
it's<00:02:10.979> only<00:02:11.129> supposed<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.550> let<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.819> flow<00:02:12.090> one

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
it's only supposed to let it flow one

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.000 
it's only supposed to let it flow one
way

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
way

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.509 
way
okay<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.580> new<00:02:13.790> part<00:02:14.120> just<00:02:14.390> came<00:02:14.659> in<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.489> was

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
okay the new part just came in and I was

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.100 
okay the new part just came in and I was
unable<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:18.129> blow<00:02:19.129> through<00:02:19.730> either<00:02:20.150> direction

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
unable to blow through either direction

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.360 
unable to blow through either direction
I<00:02:21.760> guess<00:02:22.760> my<00:02:22.909> lungs<00:02:23.209> aren't<00:02:23.540> strong<00:02:23.870> enough<00:02:23.930> to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
I guess my lungs aren't strong enough to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.130 
I guess my lungs aren't strong enough to
raise<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.610> kind<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:25.940> pressure<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.959> that's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
raise that kind of pressure so that's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.720 
raise that kind of pressure so that's
another<00:02:27.409> reason<00:02:27.799> why<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.950> think<00:02:28.129> this<00:02:28.400> valve

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
another reason why I think this valve

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.289 
another reason why I think this valve
has<00:02:29.120> gone<00:02:29.510> bad<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.069> was<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.489> easy<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:32.000> blow

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
has gone bad that it was so easy to blow

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.949 
has gone bad that it was so easy to blow
through<00:02:32.629> it<00:02:32.750> each<00:02:33.110> way<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.430> other<00:02:34.580> thing

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
through it each way and one other thing

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.160 
through it each way and one other thing
the<00:02:35.959> original<00:02:36.470> part<00:02:36.769> had<00:02:37.099> some<00:02:37.459> kind<00:02:37.730> of

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
the original part had some kind of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.940 
the original part had some kind of
sealant<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.560> this<00:02:39.980> side<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.819> threads<00:02:41.209> so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
sealant on this side of the threads so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.110 
sealant on this side of the threads so
what<00:02:42.950> I'm<00:02:43.040> going<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.220> do<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.579> take<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.849> little

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
what I'm going to do is take a little

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.430 
what I'm going to do is take a little
piece<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.569> teflon<00:02:45.140> tape<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:47.230> wrap<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.379> around

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
piece of teflon tape and wrap it around

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.470 
piece of teflon tape and wrap it around
these<00:02:48.829> threads<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.670> gets<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.940> nice<00:02:50.120> seal

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.680 

okay<00:02:56.480> well<00:02:56.629> so<00:02:56.840> far<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:57.140> good<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:59.450> been

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
okay well so far so good it's been

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.170 
okay well so far so good it's been
running<00:02:59.959> about<00:03:00.290> 10<00:03:00.680> minutes<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.849> can<00:03:02.030> hear

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
running about 10 minutes and I can hear

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.180 
running about 10 minutes and I can hear
the<00:03:02.329> water<00:03:02.510> pressure<00:03:03.170> going<00:03:03.590> through<00:03:03.739> there

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
the water pressure going through there

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.819 
the water pressure going through there
there's<00:03:04.819> no<00:03:05.030> leaks<00:03:08.049> so<00:03:09.049> it's<00:03:09.170> about<00:03:09.319> five<00:03:09.620> days

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
there's no leaks so it's about five days

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.030 
there's no leaks so it's about five days
later<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.870> filter<00:03:12.349> has<00:03:12.530> successfully

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
later and the filter has successfully

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.089 
later and the filter has successfully
been<00:03:13.280> fixed<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.959> problem<00:03:15.379> was<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.799> check

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
been fixed the problem was the check

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.960 
been fixed the problem was the check
valve<00:03:17.290> there's<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.380> $5<00:03:18.919> part<00:03:19.340> plus<00:03:19.639> seven

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
valve there's a $5 part plus seven

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.759 
valve there's a $5 part plus seven
dollars<00:03:20.269> shipping<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:21.049> twelve<00:03:21.349> dollars

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
dollars shipping so it's twelve dollars

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.809 
dollars shipping so it's twelve dollars
total<00:03:22.099> cost<00:03:22.900> now<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.169> works<00:03:24.769> properly<00:03:25.220> it'll

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
total cost now it works properly it'll

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.800 
total cost now it works properly it'll
fill<00:03:26.120> up<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.569> tank<00:03:27.040> it'll<00:03:28.040> shut<00:03:28.280> off<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.630> then

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
fill up the tank it'll shut off and then

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.020 
fill up the tank it'll shut off and then
once<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.169> use<00:03:30.859> some<00:03:31.069> water<00:03:31.310> out<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.700> spicket

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
once I use some water out of the spicket

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.740 
once I use some water out of the spicket
it'll<00:03:32.569> turn<00:03:32.840> back<00:03:33.079> on<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.680> run<00:03:34.130> for<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.790> don't

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
it'll turn back on and run for I don't

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.690 
it'll turn back on and run for I don't
know<00:03:35.810> half<00:03:36.079> an<00:03:36.200> hour<00:03:36.349> until<00:03:36.739> it's<00:03:37.190> filled<00:03:37.430> back

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
know half an hour until it's filled back

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.379 
know half an hour until it's filled back
up<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.209> shuts<00:03:38.450> off<00:03:38.889> properly<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.239> hope

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
up and shuts off properly and I hope

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.589 
up and shuts off properly and I hope
