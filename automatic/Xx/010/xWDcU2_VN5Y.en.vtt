00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
let's say for example a Belgian beer

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.339 
let's say for example a Belgian beer
Belgian<00:02:04.979> beer<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.220> lot<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.459> times<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:06.030> there

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
Belgian beer is a lot of times are there

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.960 
Belgian beer is a lot of times are there
keg<00:02:07.349> conditioned<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.399> still<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
keg conditioned and so they still have a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.730 
keg conditioned and so they still have a
lot<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.479> carbonation<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.110> exists

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
lot of the carbonation that exists

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.770 
lot of the carbonation that exists
within<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.130> keg<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.970> when<00:02:12.090> you're<00:02:12.209> tapping<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
within the keg so when you're tapping it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.260 
within the keg so when you're tapping it
and<00:02:13.770> you're<00:02:14.280> not<00:02:14.400> using<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.730> bar<00:02:14.880> system<00:02:15.060> you're

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and you're not using a bar system you're

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.630 
and you're not using a bar system you're
just<00:02:15.420> using<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> hand<00:02:16.050> pump<00:02:16.459> you're<00:02:17.459> going<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
just using a hand pump you're going to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.309 
just using a hand pump you're going to
get<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> lot<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.000> fun<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> lot<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.660> resistance<00:02:18.930> in

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
get a lot of fun a lot of resistance in

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.290 
get a lot of fun a lot of resistance in
the<00:02:19.440> beer<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.700> something<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.150> don't

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.479 
even if you're doing all the proper
cleaning<00:02:31.900> it's<00:02:32.379> still<00:02:32.620> things<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:33.099> they<00:02:33.340> wear

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
cleaning it's still things do they wear

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.309 
cleaning it's still things do they wear
down<00:02:33.640> over<00:02:33.910> time<00:02:34.120> you'll<00:02:34.750> get<00:02:34.930> kind<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.140> like<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
down over time you'll get kind of like a

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.259 
down over time you'll get kind of like a
cardboard<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:36.099> dusty<00:02:36.610> flavor<00:02:36.879> in<00:02:37.120> your<00:02:37.150> beer

cardboard a dusty flavor in your beer
that's<00:02:37.599> how<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.840> know<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.099> beer<00:02:39.250> is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
that's how you know that the beer is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.009 
that's how you know that the beer is
either<00:02:39.580> old<00:02:39.879> or<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.450> liens<00:02:40.750> haven't

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
either old or that the liens haven't

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
device it's called a slider so it just

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.699 
device it's called a slider so it just
connects<00:02:46.629> a<00:02:46.780> little<00:02:46.959> bit<00:02:47.049> differently<00:02:47.410> than
