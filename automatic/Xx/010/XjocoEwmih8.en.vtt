00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.630
 test against eagle 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.300
 leno 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.850
 new 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.130
 Weidenfeller the heroes between the 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.290
 Post of the Bundesliga gates know what 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.890
 it means the attackers fear that 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.140
 to teach 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.630
 if the rest of the team is failed 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.050
 The goalkeeper of the series completely on himself 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.050
 alone 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.200
 and it has always been like that 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.760
 The goalkeeper was an outcast 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.080
 scapegoat always around the place 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.180
 blame to take on for the team 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.960
 once the gate was only the last 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.700
 was chosen 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.130
 he was often unpopular with me or one 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.390
 Grossbmotoriker actually wanted with the 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.960
 Playing together on the field 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.460
 But there they did not want the Briton John 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.830
 owen wilson has been with history 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.379
 the number one busy in his 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.540
 he offers insights like book haider 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.160
 into the world of the goalkeeper he is 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.050
 really the eternal outsider all the way 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.670
 beginning with the precaution part of the team 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.610
 He even wore the same jersey as the one 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.050
 others in the first rules of 1863 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.390
 There is no goalkeeper 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.619
 every player could touch the ball 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.030
 catch and knock off 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.460
 that changed only to 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.869
 turn of the century and 1908 known 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.030
 keeper then his own shirt 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.920
 So it turned out almost 50 years before he got out 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.410
 team solved the out was the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.180
 goalkeeper got his own identity and 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.170
 goalkeepers became stars 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.210
 gordon banks 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.850
 ricardo zamora 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.390
 lew yashin 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.390
 Toni Turek 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.910
 and who trusted 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.590
 I think trautmann's story for one 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.130
 the most extraordinary of the twentieth 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.229
 century 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.060
 but during the war in england in 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.380
 captivity and then got used 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.420
 quickly to English life 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.920
 he was probably the first German after 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.229
 really popular in the second world war 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.850
 was that says a lot about his charisma 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.210
 his person and can be as 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.210
 goalkeeper 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.860
 but not only the one of the train 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.590
 most defining moments of the fa-cup 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.709
 He broke up shortly before closing 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.350
 the endgame in 1956 the neck and stayed 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.640
 Nevertheless, until the end in the game 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.650
 it was visible heroism 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.550
 Part of the team is the goalkeeper 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.440
 never become 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.989
 has bought enough in recent years 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.720
 Keeper concerned about Casey Keller 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:45.200
 number 1 in gladbach until 2007 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.770
 let's talk about goalkeeper had from the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.370
 stupidity to be goalkeeper 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.870
 it's not a nice job sometimes you are 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.820
 part of the team and sometimes again 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.690
 Do not train like goalkeepers mostly 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:04.640
 even separated from the rest when a goalkeeper 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.410
 that often ends in a mistake 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.870
 disaster as a counter 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.520
 if you have a mistake as a defender 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.440
 the opponent can still do 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.850
 as a striker, you get lost 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.490
 a chance given a new one soon 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.260
 but if I'm a goalkeeper a ball through 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.980
 The rag store will be on everyone's mind 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.690
 Remember because it was a gate 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.490
 even the toughest goalkeeper knows 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.140
 this feeling already a short 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.910
 unfocused moment at the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.680
 decisively change the game outcome 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.420
 the question of guilt is and quickly clarified 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.970
 and who else is still the rock in the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.970
 surf was suddenly there alone 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.010
 yes and then of course you have one too 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.810
 have good psyche because he actually the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.459
 iron out all the mistakes of others 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.459
 and then of your own mistakes 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.840
 not allowed to be confused and then there 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.930
 there are always situations when a gate 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.549
 So that's quite a coincidence 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.260
 normal thing that all of one 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.390
 to turn away because they leave for the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.890
 must go off and that's the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.379
 situations then perhaps one 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.000
 including creating unconsciously he had 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.480
 Goalkeeper is actually one 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.209
 terminator almost does not equate doctor 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.220
 and surgeon who makes heavy op is 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.180
 even after a 3 4 hours is okay 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.560
 also fix and all 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.769
 without him running much now 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.400
 probably just head work pretty much 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.169
 by virtue of his and then it happens 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.520
 a shrill whistle and the petrified 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.770
 make the referee look 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.240
 any discussion be superfluous 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.940
 straight arm shows unmistakable 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.580
 on the round point in 16 and everyone 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.919
 knows what comes now the ultimate 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.810
 showdown of the football I think that the 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.180
 punish football for the essentials 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.580
 reduces a man shooting a goal 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.419
 want once and a man to score 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.919
 wants to prevent 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.919
 the essence of football 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.650
 There you will enjoy goalkeepers in the Kalifa 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.389
 but no one expected that 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.550
 they are holding the circumstances 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.169
 Inverted he goes in is normal 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.830
 Do you hold him and you become a hero? 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.599
 a reversal of the scapegoat role 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.370
 a modern goalkeeper is nowadays in 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.289
 the game involved and special 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.659
 defenders see him as one of the 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.889
 their 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.379
 I believe that then with the 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.840
 reverse pass regulation of 192 even more extreme 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.189
 has since become the shoulder 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.870
 be good with both feet 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.759
 You have to start with back-up 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.469
 We can slowly understand how 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.629
 very man from a playing goalkeeper 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:42.520
 benefits from one of the ball with 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.520
 cast them wide and fit well distributed 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.169
 I believe in the last century has 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.780
 no country so many good goalkeepers 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.400
 originated as Germany manuel 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.289
 newer just became world goalkeeper and 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.289
 less deny that he is too 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.129
 newer is a paradigm for the 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.020
 so-called libero goalkeeper one of the 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.800
 behind the defense the space 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.810
 can secure 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.879
 I still remember the game 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.319
 the last em against italy in 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.120
 Germany was very high and has 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.340
 desperately trying to balance 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.699
 and then new ones come out to the 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.289
 Axis and head off the ball he was 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.599
 so far away from his goal and in the process 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:25.639
 absolutely confident and so has the 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:27.889
 defend against the rising allows the 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.060
 tragic also this hero can such 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.310
 mistakes happen 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.020
 and from one second to another 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.270
 also the hero for all 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:40.760
 the deb sees the gate is experiencing 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.860
 Unsure good keeper lose their reputation 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.169
 with an error of other back by 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.389
 a parade into the light the coincidence 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.169
 is disturbing good men happen 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.850
 bad things 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:52.210
 we do not necessarily get what we do 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.210
 to earn
