00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
you know it really used to piss me off a

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.460 
you know it really used to piss me off a
lot<00:00:02.159> there's<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.669> bush<00:00:03.030> on<00:00:03.300> my<00:00:03.480> head<00:00:03.750> besides

the<00:00:04.620> obvious<00:00:04.740> though<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.460> used<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.879> really<00:00:06.270> hate

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the obvious though I used to really hate

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.960 
the obvious though I used to really hate
getting<00:00:07.170> an<00:00:07.319> awkward<00:00:07.680> oll<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.280> then

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
getting an awkward oll and then

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.910 
getting an awkward oll and then
following<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.570> up<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:09.900> an<00:00:09.990> EEPROM<00:00:10.410> such<00:00:10.889> a

following that up with an EEPROM such a
terrible<00:00:11.490> combination<00:00:15.500> damn<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.940> I'm<00:00:17.940> sure

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
terrible combination damn it I'm sure

most<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.480> encounter<00:00:18.930> situations<00:00:19.140> like

most of you encounter situations like

that fairly frequently and I remember

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.269 
that fairly frequently and I remember

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
each have a mirror in this video I'll go

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.340 
each have a mirror in this video I'll go
over<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.850> each<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.329> I'll<00:01:03.840> list<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
over one of each and I'll list all the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
over one of each and I'll list all the
algorithms<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.979> description<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
algorithms in the description and you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.170 
algorithms in the description and you
can<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.510> learn<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.320> mirrors<00:01:07.619> from<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:08.180> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
can just learn the mirrors from there so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.020 
can just learn the mirrors from there so
I<00:01:09.210> won't<00:01:09.450> kill<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.780> much<00:01:09.930> time<00:01:10.729> right<00:01:11.729> away<00:01:11.880> I'm

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
I won't kill as much time right away I'm

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.280 
I won't kill as much time right away I'm
sure<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.420> notice<00:01:12.570> these<00:01:12.869> are<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> same

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
sure you can notice these are the same

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.039 
sure you can notice these are the same
ol<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.650> cases<00:01:14.010> however<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.390> permutation<00:01:15.990> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
ol of cases however the permutation is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.160 
ol of cases however the permutation is
different<00:01:16.580> typically<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.270> LCP<00:01:18.810> you'll

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
different typically with all LCP you'll

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
different typically with all LCP you'll
have<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.470> look<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.130> stickers<00:01:20.460> to

determine<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.540> permutation<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.259> then

determine the permutation and then

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.060 
determine the permutation and then
decide<00:01:23.009> which<00:01:23.340> algorithm<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.939> should<00:01:24.240> use

you use this algorithm that i'm going to
show<00:01:59.939> you<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.979> if<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.240> neither<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
show you and if if it's neither then you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.830 
show you and if if it's neither then you

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
to you but you're going to see if either

to you but you're going to see if either
of<00:02:48.000> them<00:02:48.150> match<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.609> or<00:02:50.930> are<00:02:51.930> opposite

colors<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.519> or<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.569> can<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.959> it

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
colors like this or you can think of it

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.720 
colors like this or you can think of it
as<00:02:55.170> matching<00:02:55.440> on<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.739> left<00:02:55.950> or<00:02:56.129> right<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:56.639> up

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
as matching on the left or right it's up

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.970 
as matching on the left or right it's up
to<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.000> they<00:02:57.329> both<00:02:57.510> work<00:02:57.739> if<00:02:58.739> you<00:02:58.829> get<00:02:58.950> a

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
to you they both work if you get a

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.649 
to you they both work if you get a
situation<00:02:59.579> where<00:02:59.879> they<00:03:00.750> match<00:03:02.510> you're<00:03:03.510> going

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
situation where they match you're going

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.740 
situation where they match you're going
to<00:03:03.750> use<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.590> certain<00:03:05.280> algorithm<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.879> if

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
to use this certain algorithm and if

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.170 
to use this certain algorithm and if
they're<00:03:06.900> opposites<00:03:07.470> or<00:03:08.099> like<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.909> said

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
they're opposites or like I said

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.080 
they're opposites or like I said
matching<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> sides<00:03:10.310> then<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.639> use<00:03:11.819> this

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
matching on the sides then you use this

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.270 
matching on the sides then you use this
one<00:03:12.329> so<00:03:13.019> we've<00:03:13.200> third<00:03:13.590> algorithm<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
one so we've third algorithm in the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.990 
one so we've third algorithm in the
description<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:16.159> quite<00:03:17.159> nice<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:20.000> this

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
description and it's quite nice and this

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.289 
description and it's quite nice and this
will<00:03:21.180> be<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.510> fourth<00:03:25.430> by<00:03:26.430> simply<00:03:26.790> repeating

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
will be the fourth by simply repeating

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.330 
will be the fourth by simply repeating
the<00:03:27.480> algorithm<00:03:27.930> listed<00:03:28.319> over<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.709> over<00:03:28.829> you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
the algorithm listed over and over you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.780 
the algorithm listed over and over you
will<00:03:29.780> definitely<00:03:30.780> get<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.190> situation<00:03:32.699> it

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
will definitely get to the situation it

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.500 
will definitely get to the situation it
solves<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:34.549> you'll<00:03:35.549> see<00:03:35.819> which<00:03:36.000> angle<00:03:36.419> you

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
solves and you'll see which angle you

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.599 
solves and you'll see which angle you
need<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.750> hold<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.079> from<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.560> what<00:03:37.889> not<00:03:38.069> it's

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
need to hold it from and what not it's

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.250 
need to hold it from and what not it's
much<00:03:38.760> easier<00:03:38.790> for<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.389> do<00:03:39.599> that<00:03:39.780> than<00:03:40.019> for
