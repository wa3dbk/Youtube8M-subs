00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.030
 you tell you this is a real monster yes 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.670
 I saw him with my own eyes 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.080
 drove on the roof of the car and crushed and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
 like egg shells 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.970
 yes yes yes I heard the show 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.970
 suv monster mania 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.930
 imagine the tricks that do 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.960
 SUVs are such tasty names 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.440
 for example donuts and donuts and pancakes 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.070
 there is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.580
 And in pancakes cars are turning 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.580
 cars 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.180
 generation need to prepare 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.170
 car performance as i was told 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.409
 patrick chan work pilot be 2 this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.299
 a swedish pilot if he is from and to with 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.310
 lunch breaks involved in the construction 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 Monster of his truck in did not go around 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.170
 half a year the most important thing is uniqueness 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.740
 the fact that these cars do not seem to 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.590
 the world is part of the water is unique because everyone 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.270
 that he is going to manually do these engines 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.270
 need a long distance to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.250
 accelerate a hundred kilometers an hour because 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.670
 their power reaches more than one and a half 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 thousand horsepower and the oldest 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.220
 over there with green fangs for 20 years 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.679
 but the old man feels rather well 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.679
 run jump and makes kulby so 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.060
 we want to be more racers like you 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.690
 what we need to do 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.550
 faces and I started to drive another child 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.110
 just crazy for all these cars 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:15.730
 the summer was a long way from the little 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:19.450
 typewriter to such a monster I fell only 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.520
 once hit his head seems to me 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.410
 it's boring to drive a regular car 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.940
 after such a monster and is associated 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.130
 would be an ordinary car pretty boring 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.840
 after this spending the leaders on this thing on 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.280
 that doesn't seem like you're chasing 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.600
 roller coaster faster and faster 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.600
 faster and then jump 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.000
 even when these cars cost and 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.090
 do not do anything else, he still produces 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.790
 impression after the show monster mania 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.409
 the real monster mon ami became Snezhana 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.409
