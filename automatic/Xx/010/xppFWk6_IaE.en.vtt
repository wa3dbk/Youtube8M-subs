00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.980 

see<00:00:06.279> I<00:00:06.310> put<00:00:06.670> in<00:00:06.759> three<00:00:07.029> millimeters<00:00:07.569> right

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 
see I put in three millimeters right

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.920 
see I put in three millimeters right
there<00:00:08.290> and<00:00:08.820> then<00:00:09.820> I'm<00:00:10.000> going<00:00:10.150> to<00:00:10.209> go<00:00:10.420> and<00:00:10.780> I

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:10.930 
there and then I'm going to go and I

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.600 
there and then I'm going to go and I
highlight<00:00:11.379> it<00:00:11.559> let's<00:00:12.160> make<00:00:12.340> sure<00:00:12.400> I

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
highlight it let's make sure I

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.650 
highlight it let's make sure I
highlighted<00:00:13.120> that<00:00:13.360> on<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:13.900> other<00:00:14.019> page<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
highlighted that on the other page the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.850 
highlighted that on the other page the
scrollwork<00:00:16.660> is<00:00:16.840> highlighted<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.590> then<00:00:17.740> I'm

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
scrollwork is highlighted and then I'm

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.320 
scrollwork is highlighted and then I'm
going<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.160> raise<00:00:18.369> that<00:00:18.400> so<00:00:18.939> I'm<00:00:19.029> going<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.240> add

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
going to raise that so I'm going to add

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.210 
going to raise that so I'm going to add
add<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:20.380> three<00:00:20.650> millimeters<00:00:21.250> to<00:00:21.430> that<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:24.130> you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
add the three millimeters to that if you

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.609 
add the three millimeters to that if you
look<00:00:24.430> see<00:00:24.670> how<00:00:24.820> that<00:00:25.000> jumped<00:00:25.330> up<00:00:25.480> so<00:00:26.439> that's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
look see how that jumped up so that's

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.050 
look see how that jumped up so that's
how<00:00:26.680> you<00:00:26.800> build<00:00:26.980> things<00:00:27.250> you<00:00:27.460> can<00:00:27.640> do<00:00:27.880> them

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
how you build things you can do them

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.130 
how you build things you can do them
them<00:00:28.359> and<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:30.539> these<00:00:31.539> all<00:00:31.750> sorts<00:00:32.080> of

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
them and and these all sorts of

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.320 
them and and these all sorts of
functions<00:00:32.379> on<00:00:32.769> this<00:00:32.980> this<00:00:33.340> software<00:00:33.970> which<00:00:34.210> is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
functions on this this software which is

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.719 
functions on this this software which is
quite<00:00:34.480> unique<00:00:34.720> and<00:00:35.050> then<00:00:35.799> from<00:00:36.070> this<00:00:36.220> i<00:00:36.460> can

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:36.729 
quite unique and then from this i can

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:40.829 
quite unique and then from this i can
i'm<00:00:37.449> going<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.710> subtract<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:38.949> and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:40.390> i'm

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
i'm going to subtract that and then i'm

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.799 
i'm going to subtract that and then i'm
going<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.049> close<00:00:41.229> that<00:00:41.290> and<00:00:42.449> then<00:00:43.449> i'm<00:00:43.600> going

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
going to close that and then i'm going

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.250 
going to close that and then i'm going
to<00:00:44.580> put<00:00:45.580> the<00:00:45.699> outside<00:00:46.210> vector<00:00:46.690> here<00:00:46.900> because

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
to put the outside vector here because

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.289 
to put the outside vector here because
i'm<00:00:47.379> going<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.589> show<00:00:47.799> you<00:00:47.830> another<00:00:48.729> function

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
i'm going to show you another function

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:55.259 
i'm going to show you another function

edit it you can edit the parameters we

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
edit it you can edit the parameters we
can<00:01:11.830> edit<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.160> feed<00:01:12.910> rate<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.360> plunge<00:01:13.630> rate

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
can edit the feed rate to plunge rate

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140 
can edit the feed rate to plunge rate
you<00:01:16.600> know<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> half<00:01:17.020> radius<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:18.790> can<00:01:18.940> so<00:01:19.060> we

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
you know the half radius we can so we

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.730 
you know the half radius we can so we
can<00:01:19.180> actually<00:01:19.420> get<00:01:20.200> bit<00:01:20.410> some<00:01:20.590> other

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
can actually get bit some other

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.860 
can actually get bit some other
suppliers<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.580> just<00:01:21.790> edit<00:01:22.420> them<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.690> put

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
suppliers and just edit them and put

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.990 
suppliers and just edit them and put
them<00:01:22.900> into<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.350> software<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:23.920> then<00:01:24.040> you<00:01:24.910> know

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
them into the software and then you know

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.850 
them into the software and then you know
does<00:01:25.210> all<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.480> math<00:01:25.660> for<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.020> right<00:01:26.350> so<00:01:26.770> we're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
does all the math for you right so we're

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.740 
does all the math for you right so we're
going<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.040> accept<00:01:27.370> that<00:01:27.580> bit<00:01:27.850> select<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.720> then

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
going to accept that bit select and then

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.630 
going to accept that bit select and then
we're<00:01:29.410> going<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.560> drag<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:29.800> down<00:01:30.040> and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
we're going to drag this down and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.020 
we're going to drag this down and
material<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:32.830> kind<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.159> tells<00:01:33.370> me<00:01:33.610> where<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
material it kind of tells me where the

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.300 
material it kind of tells me where the
material<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.690> on<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:34.990> deck<00:01:35.200> or<00:01:35.409> where<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.770> tip

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
material is on the deck or where the tip

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.810 
material is on the deck or where the tip
of<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.520> bit<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.960> material<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.670> like

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
of the bit is to the material and I like

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.460 
of the bit is to the material and I like
to<00:01:39.940> work<00:01:40.030> off<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.390> top<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.900> know<00:01:41.170> where<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
to work off the top I know where the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.810 
to work off the top I know where the
bottom<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.890> deck<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.400> know<00:01:42.520> how<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.700> do

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
bottom of the deck is I know how to do

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.780 
bottom of the deck is I know how to do
the<00:01:42.940> math<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.480> then<00:01:44.470> because<00:01:45.340> it's<00:01:45.460> important

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
the math and then because it's important

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.310 
the math and then because it's important
for<00:01:45.880> setting<00:01:46.210> up<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.390> mill<00:01:46.570> later<00:01:46.840> which<00:01:47.200> i'm

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
for setting up the mill later which i'm

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.050 
for setting up the mill later which i'm
going<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.500> show<00:01:47.620> you<00:01:47.650> in<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.830> minute<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.790> and

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
going to show you in a minute so and

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.600 
going to show you in a minute so and
then<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:50.470> actually<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.979> generating<00:01:51.520> the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
then it actually is generating the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.010 
then it actually is generating the
toolpath

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020
