we've<00:03:08.500> got<00:03:08.710> a<00:03:08.740> less<00:03:09.280> 1d<00:03:09.640> day<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.819> can<00:03:10.150> get<00:03:10.360> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
knife edge going but at this airfoil I

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.400 
knife edge going but at this airfoil I
thought<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.670> would<00:03:15.819> be<00:03:15.850> possible<00:03:19.410> she's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
thought that would be possible she's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.390

still<00:03:20.500> great
