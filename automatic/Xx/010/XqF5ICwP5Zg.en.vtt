00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 thing in it was the cherry on the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.460

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.120
 a lot inspired by this very story 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.120
 big if you're a character than ever 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 in our time we have a deficit despite 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.160
 everything about our stories 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.710
 the stories of our parents it's about 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.149
 this incredible journey they did 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.250
 our identities badly told or can in 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.050
 anyway it's my father she had to 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.729
 to go to France and then for me a 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.140
 opportunity to have to visit their 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.850
 history never had the opportunity to 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:18.830
 to speak truly with this modesty 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.340
 which makes hong kong start little 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.750
 finally 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.490
 that's what this son says 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.920

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.080
 tempers he abandon Algeria since 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.390
 long as in the famous manita a 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.130

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.300
 hours with a near zero like a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.100
 holiday if this love for the wheat is 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.920
 besides for our roots in particular 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.600
 for our culture that our parents who 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.950
 have made us interested 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.480
