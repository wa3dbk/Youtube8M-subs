all these cards in your hand this is
just<00:00:19.140> prime<00:00:19.439> example<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> well<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
just prime example of well one of the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300 
just prime example of well one of the
best<00:00:21.930> hands<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.260> could<00:00:22.410> possibly<00:00:22.800> draw<00:00:23.010> into

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
best hands you could possibly draw into

to<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.580> fair<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.080> gives<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.380> an

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to be fair but this just gives you an

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.050 
to be fair but this just gives you an

idea how to play the deck so the setup

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.700 
idea how to play the deck so the setup
is<00:00:27.240> pretty<00:00:27.390> simple<00:00:27.689> mathematician<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.560> allows

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is pretty simple mathematician it allows

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
is pretty simple mathematician it allows
you<00:00:28.859> send<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.220> it'll<00:00:29.910> let<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.179> get<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> red

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you send that it'll let you get a red

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.060 
you send that it'll let you get a red

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this you want to dragon shrine this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.620 
this you want to dragon shrine this
first<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> protective<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> shrine
