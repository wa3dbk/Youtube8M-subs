probably<00:02:23.849> with<00:02:24.030> your<00:02:24.420> thumbs<00:02:24.840> with<00:02:25.260> away<00:02:25.620> from

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
probably with your thumbs with away from

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.000 
probably with your thumbs with away from
the<00:02:25.980> wall<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.200> door<00:02:28.349> can<00:02:28.440> slide<00:02:28.860> it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the wall so that the door can slide it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.390 
the wall so that the door can slide it
but<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.209> put<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.930> bit<00:02:31.079> forward<00:02:31.470> about<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
but I put it a bit forward about the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.440 
but I put it a bit forward about the
same<00:02:33.170> area<00:02:34.170> where<00:02:34.950> boats<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.519> ends<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.209> maybe

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
same area where boats this ends or maybe

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.500 
same area where boats this ends or maybe
just<00:02:36.569> time<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.200> forward<00:02:37.790> when<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.209> come

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
just time it forward when you I come

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.050 
just time it forward when you I come
back<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.140> both<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.349> gluten<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.790> they're<00:02:41.940> both

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
back the both the gluten so they're both

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.580 
back the both the gluten so they're both
going<00:02:42.359> on<00:02:42.540> now<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:45.150> can<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.260> really

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
going on now and you can if you really

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.379 
going on now and you can if you really
wanted<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> leave<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.489> like<00:02:47.639> that<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:50.389> get

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
wanted to leave it like that and get

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.559 
wanted to leave it like that and get
your<00:02:51.420> door<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.139> there<00:02:53.030> which<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.269> should<00:02:54.450> have

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
your door in there which I should have

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.819 
your door in there which I should have
done<00:02:54.750> before<00:02:55.099> out<00:02:56.099> there<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.489> go<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:58.590> will

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
done before out there we go it will

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.199 
done before out there we go it will
slide<00:02:59.280> step<00:03:00.060> ones<00:03:00.299> having<00:03:00.630> issues<00:03:00.989> or<00:03:01.169> no<00:03:02.209> it's

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
slide step ones having issues or no it's

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.890 
slide step ones having issues or no it's
six<00:03:03.569> apart<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.569> will<00:03:06.720> slide<00:03:07.609> but<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:09.690> can

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
six apart so it will slide but it can

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.300 
six apart so it will slide but it can
move<00:03:10.109> like<00:03:10.139> this<00:03:11.120> now<00:03:12.120> you're<00:03:12.359> going<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.569> do<00:03:13.310> is
