very<00:00:11.849> starting<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.330> kill<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.900> what<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.019> thought

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
very starting to kill so what I thought

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.629 
very starting to kill so what I thought
I<00:00:13.200> would<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:13.710> kind<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.099> show<00:00:14.370> off<00:00:14.400> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I would do is just kind of show off a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.369 
I would do is just kind of show off a
kill<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.750> managed<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> get<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
kill I have not managed to get a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.930 
kill I have not managed to get a
complete<00:00:16.800> kill<00:00:17.010> yet<00:00:17.190> yet<00:00:17.430> I've<00:00:17.550> managed<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
complete kill yet yet I've managed to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.970 
complete kill yet yet I've managed to
get<00:00:18.180> pretty<00:00:18.480> close<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.080> think<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.590> far<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:19.830> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
get pretty close I think the far as I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.460 
get pretty close I think the far as I
ever<00:00:20.100> got<00:00:20.279> used<00:00:20.550> about<00:00:20.820> 40k<00:00:21.449> HP<00:00:21.930> away<00:00:22.230> from

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
ever got used about 40k HP away from

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.950 
ever got used about 40k HP away from
dead<00:00:22.710> before<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.369> died<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:24.570> gonna<00:00:24.720> show

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
dead before I died so I was gonna show

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.290 
dead before I died so I was gonna show
you<00:00:24.990> guys<00:00:25.109> how<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> fourth<00:00:27.029> phase

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you guys how you get to the fourth phase

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
you guys how you get to the fourth phase
because<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:28.140> least<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:28.500> you're<00:00:28.680> soloing<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
because at least when you're soloing the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.830 
because at least when you're soloing the
first<00:00:29.460> three<00:00:29.670> phases<00:00:29.880> aren't<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
first three phases aren't really that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.200 
first three phases aren't really that
bad<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.590> only<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.430> hard<00:00:32.700> part<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
bad the only really really hard part for

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
bad the only really really hard part for
me<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:33.870> least<00:00:33.930> has<00:00:34.290> been<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.710> fourth<00:00:34.950> phase

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
me at least has been the fourth phase

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.190 
me at least has been the fourth phase
where<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> pray<00:00:36.090> switch<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.960> pretty

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
where you have to pray switch so pretty

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 
where you have to pray switch so pretty
much<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.620> phase<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.370> want<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> go

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
much the first phase you just want to go

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910 
much the first phase you just want to go
in<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.120> burn<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> web<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.870> he<00:00:40.469> only<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
in and burn the web and he only the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
in and burn the web and he only the
first<00:00:41.129> phase<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.280> extremely<00:00:41.910> easy<00:00:41.940> there's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
first phase is extremely easy there's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.700 
first phase is extremely easy there's
not<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> whole<00:00:43.020> bunch<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> worry<00:00:43.559> about

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
not really a whole bunch to worry about

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
not really a whole bunch to worry about
you<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.190> want<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> drink<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:44.850> dose<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.329> on

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
you just want to drink up dose up on

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
you just want to drink up dose up on
your<00:00:45.539> Serra<00:00:45.840> bruise<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> found<00:00:46.590> range<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.100> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
your Serra bruise I found range to be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340 
your Serra bruise I found range to be
the<00:00:47.309> most<00:00:47.460> effective<00:00:47.969> combat<00:00:48.390> style<00:00:48.690> although

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the most effective combat style although

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
the most effective combat style although
I<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.710> seismic<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.879> if

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
I don't have seismic so I don't know if

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.569 
I don't have seismic so I don't know if
level<00:00:51.809> 90<00:00:52.079> mage<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.649> better<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.399> found

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
level 90 mage is better but I found

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.369 
level 90 mage is better but I found
range<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> much<00:00:54.420> better<00:00:54.600> than<00:00:54.750> melee<00:00:55.199> at

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
range to be much better than melee at

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.810 
range to be much better than melee at
least<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.039> much<00:00:56.219> easier<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> kill

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
least because it's much easier to kill

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.369 
least because it's much easier to kill
the<00:00:56.940> minions<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.480> much<00:00:57.660> easier<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.109> stay

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the minions and it's much easier to stay

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
the minions and it's much easier to stay
away<00:00:58.530> from<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> exploding<00:00:59.370> minions<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
away from the exploding minions on the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.810 
away from the exploding minions on the
third<00:01:00.809> phase<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> fourth<00:01:01.739> phase<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.520> on

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
third phase and the fourth phase so on

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
third phase and the fourth phase so on
the<00:01:02.969> second<00:01:03.329> phase<00:01:03.480> after<00:01:03.750> you've<00:01:04.110> burned

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the second phase after you've burned

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.690 
the second phase after you've burned
down<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.769> web<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.610> him

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
down the web you just want to get him

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
down the web you just want to get him
into<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> tunnel<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> he'll<00:01:06.630> spawn<00:01:06.930> these

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
into the tunnel and he'll spawn these

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.590 
into the tunnel and he'll spawn these
eggs<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> once<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> eggs<00:01:09.210> spawn<00:01:09.510> in

eggs and once you see the eggs spawn in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.880 
eggs and once you see the eggs spawn in
the<00:01:09.659> ground<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> stand<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.650> top

deal all of the damage to you so you

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.770 
deal all of the damage to you so you
want<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> make<00:01:33.180> sure<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.479> you're<00:01:33.630> really

looking out for those mirror back

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.560 
looking out for those mirror back
spiders<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.670> kill<00:01:35.909> them<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.180> fast<00:01:36.360> as

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
spiders and kill them as fast as

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
spiders and kill them as fast as
possible<00:01:37.110> other<00:01:37.530> than<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.189> Phase<00:01:38.430> two

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
possible other than that on Phase two

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.740 
possible other than that on Phase two
you<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> concentrate<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
you just want to concentrate on the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.910 
you just want to concentrate on the
minions<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.560> sure<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
minions you want to make sure that you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
minions you want to make sure that you
kill<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.640> minion<00:01:42.000> spawns<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.659> Phase<00:01:42.960> two

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
kill all the minion spawns on Phase two

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
kill all the minion spawns on Phase two
because<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.549> deal<00:01:44.700> with

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
because then you don't have to deal with

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
because then you don't have to deal with
them<00:01:44.970> later<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.710> especially<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:47.070> you're

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
them later on especially if you're

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.469 
them later on especially if you're
having<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.490> deal<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:47.670> minion<00:01:48.060> spawns<00:01:48.299> in

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
having to deal with minion spawns in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.120 
having to deal with minion spawns in
Phase<00:01:48.689> three<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> four<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.829> really

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
Phase three and four it's really really

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.539 
Phase three and four it's really really
annoying

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
annoying

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.389 
annoying
so<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.060> would<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.479> recommend<00:01:51.860> keeping<00:01:52.860> minions

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
so I would not recommend keeping minions

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.649 
so I would not recommend keeping minions
alive<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.149> definitely<00:01:54.570> recommend

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
alive I would definitely recommend

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.959 
alive I would definitely recommend
killing<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.290> many<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.680> them<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:55.860> possible<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
killing as many of them as possible and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.459 
killing as many of them as possible and
making<00:01:57.149> sure<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> spawns<00:01:58.140> dead

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
making sure you get all the spawns dead

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
making sure you get all the spawns dead
other<00:01:58.619> than<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.040> Phase<00:01:59.280> two<00:01:59.610> all<00:02:00.000> Virago

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
other than that on Phase two all Virago

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
other than that on Phase two all Virago
or<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:01.170> iraq's<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.250> heal<00:02:02.820> web<00:02:03.119> you

if your ranging that'll keep them

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.590 
if your ranging that'll keep them
healing<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.580> won't<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.910> very<00:02:14.940> much<00:02:15.270> damage

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
healing that won't do very much damage

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.440 
healing that won't do very much damage
against<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.170> Iraq's<00:02:16.920> or<00:02:17.130> also<00:02:17.550> uses<00:02:18.210> five

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
against you Iraq's or also uses five

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.600 
against you Iraq's or also uses five
auto<00:02:18.780> attacks<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.410> between<00:02:19.830> each<00:02:20.100> special

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
auto attacks in between each special

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.070 
auto attacks in between each special
attack<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.000> after<00:02:21.240> uses<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> special<00:02:21.900> attack

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
attack so after uses a special attack

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.320 
attack so after uses a special attack
for<00:02:22.260> example<00:02:22.290> after<00:02:23.010> he<00:02:23.370> webs<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.850> his<00:02:24.120> net

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
for example after he webs you his net

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.790 
for example after he webs you his net
special<00:02:24.810> isn't<00:02:25.050> gonna<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> web<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.710> you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
special isn't gonna be a web so you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.770 
special isn't gonna be a web so you
don't<00:02:25.980> need<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.460> but<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.600> for

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
don't need to do this but then for

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
don't need to do this but then for
example<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.530> kill<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.980> next<00:02:29.370> special<00:02:29.820> is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
example on this kill is next special is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.480 
example on this kill is next special is
the<00:02:30.540> egg<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.930> bomb<00:02:31.230> spawn<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.130> then<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.340> want

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
the egg in bomb spawn so then you want

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.980 
the egg in bomb spawn so then you want
to<00:02:32.520> wait<00:02:32.670> five<00:02:32.880> auto<00:02:33.120> text<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.660> then<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> want

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
to wait five auto text and then you want

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.050 
to wait five auto text and then you want
to<00:02:34.020> use<00:02:34.080> anticipation<00:02:34.860> or<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.790> use

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
to use anticipation or I use

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.520 
to use anticipation or I use
anticipation<00:02:36.600> after<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> fourth<00:02:37.230> Auto

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
anticipation after the fourth Auto

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.350 
anticipation after the fourth Auto
attack<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.160> that's<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.790> going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.090> ensure

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
attack and that's just going to ensure

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.420 
attack and that's just going to ensure
that<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.630> anticipation<00:02:40.620> active<00:02:41.010> if<00:02:41.220> he

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
that I have anticipation active if he

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.360 
that I have anticipation active if he
uses<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.210> cocoon<00:02:42.840> ability<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.860> uses<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
uses the cocoon ability and if uses the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.040 
uses the cocoon ability and if uses the
wettability<00:02:44.670> that's<00:02:45.150> fine<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.600> just<00:02:45.900> use

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
wettability that's fine I can just use

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.470 
wettability that's fine I can just use
anticipation<00:02:46.680> next<00:02:47.130> time<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.090> way<00:02:48.240> can

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
anticipation next time but that way can

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.000 
anticipation next time but that way can
save<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> lot<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.260> food<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:49.710> if<00:02:49.890> you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
save you a lot of food because if you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610 
save you a lot of food because if you
use<00:02:50.220> anticipation<00:02:50.850> against<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:52.170> webs<00:02:52.350> you'll

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
use anticipation against the webs you'll

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.380 
use anticipation against the webs you'll
you're<00:02:53.220> gonna<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.520> able<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.760> break<00:02:54.030> out<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.240> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
you're gonna be able to break out of the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.660 
you're gonna be able to break out of the
cocoon<00:02:54.510> much<00:02:54.930> faster<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.710> then<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.400> Phase

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
cocoon much faster and then on Phase

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.420 
cocoon much faster and then on Phase
three<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:57.540> pretty<00:02:58.080> easy<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.740> kill<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> rax<00:02:59.250> or

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
three it's pretty easy to kill a rax or

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.350 
three it's pretty easy to kill a rax or
there's<00:02:59.610> only<00:02:59.670> one<00:02:59.970> thing<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.330> really

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
there's only one thing that you really

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.790 
there's only one thing that you really
have<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.780> watch<00:03:00.930> out<00:03:01.140> for<00:03:01.170> there's<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.740> to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
have to watch out for there's going to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.590 
have to watch out for there's going to
be<00:03:01.890> these<00:03:02.070> green<00:03:02.400> spiders<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.150> drop<00:03:03.390> down

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
be these green spiders that drop down

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.270 
be these green spiders that drop down
and<00:03:03.870> they<00:03:04.110> kind<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.410> have<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.950> little

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
and they kind of have like a little

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.790 
and they kind of have like a little
timer<00:03:05.610> bar<00:03:06.030> above<00:03:06.480> their<00:03:06.720> heads<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.620> want

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
timer bar above their heads and you want

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.230 
timer bar above their heads and you want
to<00:03:07.890> make<00:03:08.010> sure<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.430> run<00:03:08.670> away<00:03:08.880> from<00:03:08.940> them

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
to make sure you just run away from them

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.640 
to make sure you just run away from them
because<00:03:09.390> they'll<00:03:09.600> explode<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.260> cause<00:03:10.380> you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
because they'll explode and cause you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.280 
because they'll explode and cause you
massive<00:03:11.100> damage<00:03:11.430> one<00:03:11.670> hit<00:03:11.850> me<00:03:11.970> for<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.210> 5k<00:03:12.540> I've

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
massive damage one hit me for a 5k I've

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
heard they can hit up to 8.3 K was the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.630 
heard they can hit up to 8.3 K was the
highest<00:03:16.260> I've<00:03:16.380> ever<00:03:16.560> heard<00:03:16.740> one<00:03:16.800> hitting<00:03:17.160> so

you just want to make sure that you keep

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.270 
you just want to make sure that you keep
your<00:03:18.900> distance<00:03:19.110> from<00:03:19.500> those<00:03:19.680> ones<00:03:20.010> because

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
your distance from those ones because

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.980 
your distance from those ones because
they're<00:03:20.430> pretty<00:03:20.670> dangerous<00:03:21.150> other<00:03:21.630> than<00:03:21.840> that

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
they're pretty dangerous other than that

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.630 
they're pretty dangerous other than that
he's<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.350> gonna<00:03:22.470> use<00:03:22.680> more<00:03:22.920> cocoons<00:03:23.310> or<00:03:23.490> web

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
he's just gonna use more cocoons or web

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.670 
he's just gonna use more cocoons or web
attacks<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.209> not<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.630> bad<00:03:24.870> also<00:03:25.500> there's

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
attacks it's not that bad also there's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.990 
attacks it's not that bad also there's
going<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.950> be<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.100> whole<00:03:26.340> lot<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.670> highly

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
going to be a whole lot of highly

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.490 
going to be a whole lot of highly
poisonous<00:03:27.180> spiders<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.170> want<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.380> make

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
poisonous spiders and you want to make

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.840 
poisonous spiders and you want to make
sure<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:28.920> lure<00:03:29.220> those<00:03:29.459> spiders

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
sure that you lure those spiders

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.699 
sure that you lure those spiders
underneath<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.510> racks<00:03:30.690> or<00:03:30.900> near<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.350> end<00:03:31.380> of

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
underneath the racks or near the end of

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.740 
underneath the racks or near the end of
the<00:03:31.920> kill<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:33.030> will<00:03:33.240> be<00:03:33.360> killing<00:03:33.630> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
the kill so you will be killing the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.240 
the kill so you will be killing the
racks<00:03:33.959> or<00:03:34.110> all<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.440> way<00:03:34.530> down<00:03:34.740> on<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.040> phase

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
racks or all the way down on this phase

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.860 
racks or all the way down on this phase
you<00:03:35.280> will<00:03:35.640> not<00:03:35.880> be<00:03:36.060> getting<00:03:36.240> off<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.720> moving

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
you will not be getting off and moving

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.710 
you will not be getting off and moving
on<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.260> next<00:03:37.590> area<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:38.490> before<00:03:39.180> he's

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
on to the next area so just before he's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.940 
on to the next area so just before he's
red<00:03:40.050> bar<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.380> want<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> make<00:03:40.680> sure<00:03:40.830> you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
red bar do you want to make sure you

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.220 
red bar do you want to make sure you
lure<00:03:41.160> all<00:03:41.459> those<00:03:41.670> green<00:03:42.360> radioactive<00:03:42.900> spiders

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
lure all those green radioactive spiders

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.810 
lure all those green radioactive spiders
and<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.530> make<00:03:43.680> sure<00:03:43.830> they're<00:03:44.040> underneath

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
and just make sure they're underneath

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.010 
and just make sure they're underneath
the<00:03:44.970> rack<00:03:45.120> sort<00:03:45.360> because<00:03:45.450> that's<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
the rack sort because that's going to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.360 
the rack sort because that's going to
make<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.260> final<00:03:46.410> phase<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> little<00:03:46.980> bit<00:03:47.070> easier

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
make the final phase a little bit easier

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.640 
make the final phase a little bit easier
and<00:03:47.489> then<00:03:47.580> again<00:03:48.390> he<00:03:48.570> also<00:03:48.720> does<00:03:49.080> his<00:03:49.320> bomb

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
and then again he also does his bomb

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.530 
and then again he also does his bomb
attack<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.190> this<00:03:50.370> face<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:50.580> mostly<00:03:51.150> just<00:03:51.360> want

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
attack on this face you mostly just want

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.020 
attack on this face you mostly just want
a<00:03:51.600> DPS<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.739> here<00:03:52.920> comes<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.310> fourth<00:03:53.550> phase<00:03:53.760> and

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
a DPS so here comes the fourth phase and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.490 
a DPS so here comes the fourth phase and
this<00:03:54.120> was<00:03:54.239> my<00:03:54.390> first<00:03:54.600> attempt<00:03:55.050> to<00:03:55.170> getting<00:03:55.410> to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
this was my first attempt to getting to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.260 
this was my first attempt to getting to
the<00:03:55.590> fourth<00:03:55.830> phase<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.310> kill<00:03:56.550> I<00:03:56.760> decided

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
the fourth phase on this kill I decided

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.490 
the fourth phase on this kill I decided
to<00:03:57.390> show<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.630> kill<00:03:57.810> cuz<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.050> ate<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.200> lot<00:03:58.320> less

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
to show this kill cuz I ate a lot less

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.470 
to show this kill cuz I ate a lot less
food<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.890> killed<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.400> my<00:03:59.550> other<00:03:59.970> attempts

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
food this killed and my other attempts

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.580 
food this killed and my other attempts
get<00:04:00.600> in<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> fourth<00:04:00.959> phase<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.350> thought<00:04:01.530> it

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
get in the fourth phase so I thought it

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.540 
get in the fourth phase so I thought it
was<00:04:01.650> little<00:04:01.830> bit<00:04:01.920> embarrassing

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
was little bit embarrassing

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.030 
was little bit embarrassing
so<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.030> fourth<00:04:03.270> phase<00:04:03.450> what<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.350> can<00:04:04.590> do<00:04:04.830> is

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
so the fourth phase what you can do is

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.370 
so the fourth phase what you can do is
you<00:04:05.550> can<00:04:05.700> prayer<00:04:06.030> switch<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.510> myself<00:04:06.810> tried<00:04:07.230> to

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
you can prayer switch I myself tried to

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.410 
you can prayer switch I myself tried to
prayer<00:04:07.560> switch<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:08.010> don't<00:04:08.190> know<00:04:08.459> if<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:09.060> just

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
prayer switch I don't know if it just

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.760 
prayer switch I don't know if it just
didn't<00:04:09.720> work<00:04:09.810> for<00:04:09.870> me<00:04:10.050> if<00:04:10.200> I'm<00:04:10.380> not<00:04:10.530> fast

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
didn't work for me if I'm not fast

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.650 
didn't work for me if I'm not fast
enough<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.550> I<00:04:11.610> was<00:04:11.730> constantly<00:04:12.120> getting<00:04:12.480> hit

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
enough but I was constantly getting hit

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.050 
enough but I was constantly getting hit
so<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.950> first<00:04:14.160> kill<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.370> didn't<00:04:14.700> know<00:04:14.850> what<00:04:15.030> I

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
so the first kill I didn't know what I

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.430 
so the first kill I didn't know what I
was<00:04:15.239> doing<00:04:15.540> so<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.690> was<00:04:15.780> just<00:04:15.930> kind<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.140> running

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
was doing so I was just kind of running

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.990 
was doing so I was just kind of running
around<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.799> area<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.220> do<00:04:17.400> want<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.669> press

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
