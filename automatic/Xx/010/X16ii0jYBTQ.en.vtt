that<00:00:47.670> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> stuff<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.260> optic<00:00:49.649> guys

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
that kind of stuff like the optic guys

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.479 
that kind of stuff like the optic guys
do<00:00:50.629> that's<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.840> something<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.920> really

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
do that's not something that is really

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.670 
do that's not something that is really
optimal<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.539> modern<00:00:54.870> warfare<00:00:55.020> 2<00:00:55.320> just

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
optimal to do on modern warfare 2 just

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
optimal to do on modern warfare 2 just
because<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.160> such<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> defensive<00:00:57.090> game<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
because it is such a defensive game and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.670 
because it is such a defensive game and
it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.440> such<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.219> many<00:00:59.399> people<00:00:59.820> camping<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.680> if

it is such so many people camping and if

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.329 
it is such so many people camping and if
I<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.100> using<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:03.470> assault<00:01:04.470> rifle<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:04.920> something

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
me I'm a little bit ago that you need to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910

prestige to actually get that emblem so
there's<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.160> huge<00:01:47.429> disappointment<00:01:48.229> because<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
there's a huge disappointment because I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.199 
there's a huge disappointment because I
probably<00:01:49.679> got<00:01:49.979> around<00:01:50.459> a<00:01:50.610> thousand<00:01:51.000> kills

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
probably got around a thousand kills

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.050 
probably got around a thousand kills
that<00:01:51.479> I've<00:01:51.599> been<00:01:51.720> used<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.440> much<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.060> my

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that I've been used it so much and my

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.580 
that I've been used it so much and my
scores<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.840> suffered<00:01:55.080> because<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
scores have really suffered because of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
scores have really suffered because of
it<00:01:55.830> not<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.580> suffer<00:01:56.819> but<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.119> mean<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.539> I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it not really suffer but I mean like I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.479 
it not really suffer but I mean like I
could<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.319> been<00:01:58.410> so<00:01:58.800> much<00:01:58.860> better<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
could have been so much better with the

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.889 
could have been so much better with the
chopper<00:01:59.789> gunner<00:01:59.970> or<00:02:00.300> a<00:02:00.330> pavelow<00:02:02.420> halo<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.569> like

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
chopper gunner or a pavelow halo is like

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.440 
chopper gunner or a pavelow halo is like
blah<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.789> might<00:02:05.940> be<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.270> favorite

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
