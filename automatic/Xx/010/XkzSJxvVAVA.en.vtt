00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's like I said use this glued so you
can't<00:01:33.540> glue<00:01:33.930> something<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:34.619> cover<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.070> up

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
can't glue something and not cover it up

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.280 
can't glue something and not cover it up
with<00:01:35.220> some<00:01:35.369> lining<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.299> that's<00:01:36.600> why<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.869> always

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
with some lining so that's why it always

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.399 
with some lining so that's why it always
if<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:38.310> unlined<00:01:39.000> garment<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.110> means

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
if you see an unlined garment it means

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
if you see an unlined garment it means
that<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> higher<00:01:40.920> quality<00:01:41.490> garment<00:01:41.909> that

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that it's a higher quality garment that

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
that it's a higher quality garment that
it<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> half<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.380> full<00:01:43.560> canvas<00:01:44.070> or

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it has to be a half of full canvas or

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
it has to be a half of full canvas or
unstructured<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.479> porter<00:01:45.930> lining

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
unstructured then we have porter lining

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.960 
unstructured then we have porter lining
quarter<00:01:46.619> lining<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.070> basically<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
quarter lining is basically that you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.609 
quarter lining is basically that you
basically<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.350> bit<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
basically just get a little bit of

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.550 
basically just get a little bit of
lining<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.340> shoulders<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.840> sleeves

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
lining in the shoulders and the sleeves

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
lining in the shoulders and the sleeves
are<00:01:52.710> lined<00:01:52.950> everything<00:01:53.280> else<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.000> line

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
are lined everything else is on line

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
are lined everything else is on line
this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.509> another<00:01:54.869> favorite<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.320> mine<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
this is another favorite of mine that I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.560 
this is another favorite of mine that I
use<00:01:55.799> quite<00:01:56.189> often<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> little

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
use quite often so you just get a little

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.240 
use quite often so you just get a little
bit<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> lining<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:58.560> insulate<00:01:59.070> maybe

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
bit of lining you know insulate maybe

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.130 
bit of lining you know insulate maybe
the<00:01:59.399> sleeves<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.990> have

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the sleeves but that's it then you have

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
the sleeves but that's it then you have
full<00:02:01.380> lining<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.950> again<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.390> like

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
full lining and again this is just like

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
full lining and again this is just like
it<00:02:03.600> says<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:03.960> fully<00:02:04.439> lined<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.159> your<00:02:05.310> whole

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
it says it's fully lined so your whole

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
it says it's fully lined so your whole
suit<00:02:05.790> jacket<00:02:06.180> has<00:02:06.390> lining<00:02:06.899> inside<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.469> this

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
suit jacket has lining inside and this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.410 
suit jacket has lining inside and this
is<00:02:08.009> probably<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.459> most<00:02:08.520> popular<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> one

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
is probably the most popular the one

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.910 
is probably the most popular the one

I usually tend to shy away from that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.170 
I usually tend to shy away from that
because<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:15.800> said<00:02:16.010> um<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.520> live<00:02:16.940> in<00:02:17.060> Florida
