00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.480
*Rumbling*

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.340
Double rainbow, what is that?!

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.140
It's some kind of crack. The atmosphere must be breaking apart!

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.380
Repent! Repent! The end is here!

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.340
Well, I'll be in my bunk. Gonna catch some Z's. See ya, guys.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.240
You're choosing to die while taking a nap?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.640
It's how I lived, Simmons. It's how I lived.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.300
You know. In some weird way, I actually respect that.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.020
Adios, dirt bag.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.040
I guess this is it.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
Hey, Tex. There's something I need to tell you.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.060
I think it's important that I say this.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.680
Wait a second.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.180
Look, I can take the whole "at peace with the world" thing and I can even stomach all the "accept your fate" stuff.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.920
But, just do me a favor, okay?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.260
Don't say goodbye. I hate goodbyes.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.180
I mean, we are space warriors, right? We should try and maintain some level of credibility.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.480
No, no, no, Tex. No.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.200
I think I just figured out what the Director couldn't. And Alpha, either.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.860
It was you, Tex.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.000
All along.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740
You see, I thought...I thought we made you.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.120
The Director, the fragments.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.100
But, that's not the case.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.860
You made us.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.660
When the Alpha was created, you just kinda came along for the ride.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.240
You gave the Director the idea that he could make something more.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480
That he could split the Alpha up.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.320
Don't you get it; you were the memory.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.680
You were the key.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900
You were so strong, you made a whole other person.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.760
God...

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.180
He always wanted to find you.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.280
You know, to get you right.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.900
To just see you one last time.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.860
And he wanted me to be able to do the same.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.760
To find you in here, or...

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.120
To find you in here, or just go down another iteration.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660
Figure out this little Tex problem.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.440
Figure out how to do it right.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.300
But, now I know.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.080
I know how to fix all of this.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.200
How to end it once and for all.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.020
It was so simple, all along.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.400
I just had to tell you three words.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.120
Three words I wasn't capable of telling you before.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.520
Oh, okay, wait a minute!

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.260
Are you gonna say I love you?

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.960
No, Tex.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.940
No.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.500
I'm not gonna say I love you.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.400
I'm gonna say I forget you.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.460
*Rumbling begins*

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.520
I forget you.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.440
*Rumbling stops*

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.360
I'm letting you go.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.040
Okay, world.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.640
Do your fuckin' worst.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.880
Cause I sure as hell just did mine.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.740
It's opening! It's working!

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.280
What the fuck was that?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.420
I see him! I see him! He's in there! He's okay!

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.060
Is that Caboose?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.840
Is Caboose...God?

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.780
I mean, I can kinda see it, now that I think about it.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.460
Sure would explain the fuck out of the platypus.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.180
Well, that's just great! Caboose is God!

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.760
I guess that makes me the first person in the history of the universe that doesn't want to go to heaven!

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.220
*Sigh* Great job, Blue Team. You find a way to make everything suck.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.740
What? Let me see, you moron. It's just a bunch of circuits!

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.020
Yeah, but they're glowing! He's alive!

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.780
Um..Sarge? What're you doing up there?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.580
What? Is that me?! And, more importantly, why am I talking with a Blue?

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.760
Attention enormous version of myself! I order you to attack!

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.260
No.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.220
No!

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.280
The memory unit isn't dying!

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.160
This isn't the end of the world!

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.680
It's a fuckin' rescue mission!

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.800
NO!

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.800
Well, get 'em out of there!

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.300
No, no, stop!

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.460
Stop it! Leave me here!

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.060
Our next phase is ready to begin, Carolina.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.940
We will be asking you to do a great many things.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.740
I'm ready, Sir.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.160
Some of these things might be...

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.260
...questionable.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.800
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.960
You've given me everything. I would do anything for you.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.140
No, no, damn it!

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.780
Why? Why did you do it?

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.180
Church! You're alive! Yeah, I knew it! Yeah, I told them. Yeah, she was right! We could get you out!

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.060
Alright then, we're square, Blue.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.900
We helped you get your shiny Blue buddy out, so that makes us...

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.280
What are you doing here?!

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.540
Uh, saving you!

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.900
Yeah, we found you in the place where they were keeping you and we traveled a really, really long way to come to this place and fought a bunch of people...

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.000
...and then fought a bunch of more people, and then we got you and took you and saved you, the end.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.120
But why would you do that?! Why?!

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.420
Well, clearly it wasn't to hear thank you.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.360
Hey, we're taking fire out here!

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.360
Thank you?!

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.780
You fucked everything up!

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.020
I was at peace! I had it figured out! It was over!

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.960
Put me back!

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.020
Put you back?

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.760
Buddy, we just fought through an entire military base to reach you.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.200
And now you wanna go back?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.780
Yes!

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.300
She said we need you. She was the one who knew how to get you out.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.060
She?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.300
Who-Who're you talking about?

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.000
Tex?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.160
The real Tex?

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.940
Tex?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.620
No, no. Not Tex.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.920
The new lady.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.080
New lady?

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.680
Hey there, Alpha.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.160
Been looking for you for a long time.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.540
Oh no!

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.580
Now that I've found you, you're gonna help me do what I should have done years ago.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.940
You're gonna help me kill the Director.
