leaning decrease and it is a mirror to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.600 
leaning decrease and it is a mirror to
the<00:01:18.240> knit<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.350> together<00:01:19.530> decrease<00:01:20.189> which<00:01:20.430> is

the knit two together decrease which is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.109 
the knit two together decrease which is
a<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.450> leaning<00:01:21.900> decrease<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
a right leaning decrease now the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.640 
a right leaning decrease now the
alternative<00:01:24.420> slip<00:01:25.350> slip<00:01:25.530> knit<00:01:26.689> is<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:28.080> slight

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
alternative slip slip knit is a slight

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.060 
alternative slip slip knit is a slight
variation<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.900> changed<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.619> step

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
variation and so we are changed one step

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
variation and so we are changed one step
and<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.939> step<00:01:33.000> sort<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> creates<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.439> little

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and this step sort of creates a little

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.690 
and this step sort of creates a little
bit<00:01:35.060> flatter<00:01:36.060> laying<00:01:37.070> decrease<00:01:38.070> some<00:01:38.400> people

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
bit flatter laying decrease some people

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.230 
bit flatter laying decrease some people
say<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.329> better<00:01:39.540> match<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:41.250> knit

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
say that it's a better match to the knit

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840 
say that it's a better match to the knit
two<00:01:42.420> together<00:01:42.619> then<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> regular<00:01:44.280> slip<00:01:44.610> slip

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
two together then the regular slip slip

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.539 
two together then the regular slip slip
knit<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.040> decide

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
we do this

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.370 
we do this
okay<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.000> I've<00:01:54.329> knit<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> point<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.290> our

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
okay so I've knit to the point in our

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
okay so I've knit to the point in our
fabric<00:01:55.829> where<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.149> our

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
fabric where we are going to do our

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.370 
fabric where we are going to do our
decrease<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.180> step<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:01.229> are

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
decrease and so for step one we are

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.280 
decrease and so for step one we are
going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.860> slip<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> first<00:02:02.520> stitch<00:02:03.290> knitwise

purlwise this is step two and this is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.760 
purlwise this is step two and this is
the<00:02:16.170> big<00:02:16.349> difference<00:02:16.530> between<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.340> two

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
the big difference between the two

knitwise and then the second stitch
purlwise<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:26.550> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.450> make<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.840> stitches

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
purlwise is going to make the stitches

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.910 
purlwise is going to make the stitches
lie<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.709> little<00:02:28.890> bit<00:02:29.160> differently<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.380> what

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
lie a little bit differently so now what

we're going to do for step three is

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.330 
we're going to do for step three is

stitches<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.769> then<00:02:38.459> we're<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.670> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
stitches like so and then we're going to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.110 
stitches like so and then we're going to
knit<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.209> two<00:02:39.480> together<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.230> step<00:02:40.440> four<00:02:41.120> okay

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
knit the two together for step four okay

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.370 
knit the two together for step four okay
and<00:02:42.360> then<00:02:42.510> we'll<00:02:42.630> transfer<00:02:43.050> those<00:02:43.200> over<00:02:45.380> now

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
and then we'll transfer those over now

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.110 
and then we'll transfer those over now
the<00:02:46.440> reason<00:02:46.769> why<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:46.920> slip<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.489> first<00:02:47.850> stitch

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the reason why we slip that first stitch

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.590 
the reason why we slip that first stitch
knitwise<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:49.280> because<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.700> allows<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.360> stitch

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
knitwise is because it allows the stitch

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.229 
knitwise is because it allows the stitch
to<00:02:51.900> lay<00:02:52.110> like<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:52.830> normally<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
to lay like it would normally in the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.100 
to lay like it would normally in the
fabric<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.959> keeps<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.590> front<00:02:56.340> loop<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:57.110> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
fabric it keeps the front loop on the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.800 
fabric it keeps the front loop on the
right<00:02:58.620> side<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.790> stitch<00:03:00.030> or<00:03:00.420> if<00:03:00.690> you're

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
right side of the stitch or if you're

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.030 
right side of the stitch or if you're
left-handed<00:03:01.080> then<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.560> will<00:03:01.650> be<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> left

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
left-handed then it will be the left

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.210 
left-handed then it will be the left
left<00:03:02.549> side<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.319> keeps<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.769> all<00:03:04.950> in

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
left side and it keeps it all in

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.259 
left side and it keeps it all in
alignment<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.750> stitches<00:03:07.170> below<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:08.269> so

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
alignment with the stitches below it so

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.089 
alignment with the stitches below it so

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
real quick so we're going to slip the

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.380 
real quick so we're going to slip the
first<00:03:15.330> stitch<00:03:15.660> knitwise<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:17.640> second<00:03:18.120> stitch

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
first stitch knitwise the second stitch

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.660 
first stitch knitwise the second stitch
purlwise

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
purlwise

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.430 
purlwise
we'll<00:03:20.670> insert<00:03:21.000> our<00:03:21.180> main<00:03:21.450> needle<00:03:21.780> back<00:03:22.079> into

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
we'll insert our main needle back into

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.259 
we'll insert our main needle back into
both<00:03:22.650> stitches<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.430> then<00:03:23.760> we'll<00:03:23.910> knit<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
both stitches and then we'll knit the

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.380 
both stitches and then we'll knit the
two<00:03:24.510> stitches<00:03:24.720> together<00:03:25.440> like<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.519> that's

two stitches together like so and that's

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.620 
two stitches together like so and that's
how<00:03:27.540> we<00:03:27.600> do<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.069> alternative<00:03:29.329> slip<00:03:30.329> slip<00:03:30.569> knit
