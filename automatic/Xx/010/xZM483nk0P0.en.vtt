00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everyone, kinder surprise channel 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.910
 and before your eyes 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:15.179
 another unique super series 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 Porsche cool car very cool I 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.240
 somehow they even tried from no i don't 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.939
 I tried to just happen 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:29.460
 arrange them in descending order the cut 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.930
 it seems to me to blindly flow up 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.170
 definition for sure descending 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.379
 what can i say this series myself with 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.230
 I didn't collect these with these hands 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.149
 bought it from a collector 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.539
 because well at that time I have not yet 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.260
 collected exactly the year I do not remember but in the description 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.530
 naturally i will put in both the year and when this 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 machine when these cars could 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.240
 buy here a series in my opinion very 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.020
 cool and just super bomb at all 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.030
 our porsche porsche always means 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.450
 the bomb honestly tell you the most 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.640
 like port number one because 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.930
 what does this kind of know reminds of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.509
 Now the car rides so porsche cayenne 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.390
 pretty solid jeep machine 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.490
 Well, like a jeep jeep and we are about it completion 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.829
 you a little ground clearance 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.729
 but let's say it looks like it is enough 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.530
 solid and then further reduce that that 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.369
 they take from everyone else it's all 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.460
 just the usual porsche cayenne that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.240
 you want them to do it is just far 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.280
 more say they say nothing yes 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.350
 naturally naturally on all machines 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.840
 the wheels are moving and spinning 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.289
 they can safely play 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.629
 and little kids will be very very 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:16.530
 very interesting to play them and 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:20.670
 announce do here but we are people 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.450
 adults we are their collectors so we 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.040
 collect such cars 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:33.090
 if of course i was now years old 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.160
 probably 567 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.250
 oh well it seems to me not even a gap 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.069
 if you are allowed in the fourth dash fourth 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.380
 baby class something okay like that 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.090
 somewhere to fourth grade I would be with them 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.130
 I could calmly play now 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.030
 put like this and admire them 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.700
 look at them and cry because 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.160
 So far, I certainly can not even imagine 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.760
 to give a damn such a car 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.120
