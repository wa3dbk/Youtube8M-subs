here some basic things looks like we're

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.560 
here some basic things looks like we're
going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> leave<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:41.879> behind<00:00:42.090> you've<00:00:42.450> got

that's<00:02:22.630> probably<00:02:23.080> why<00:02:23.290> they<00:02:23.500> called<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.920> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
that's probably why they called it the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.120 
that's probably why they called it the
ez<00:02:24.700> series<00:02:25.269> because<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.930> easy<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.890> simply

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
ez series because it's easy you simply

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.670 
ez series because it's easy you simply
attach<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:28.090> valve<00:02:28.599> head<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.260> side<00:02:29.500> of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680

you've got clean filtered water now the

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.089 
you've got clean filtered water now the
nice<00:02:43.480> thing<00:02:43.510> about<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.170> u.s.<00:02:44.410> ez<00:02:44.650> series

nice thing about the u.s. ez series

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.250 
nice thing about the u.s. ez series
there<00:02:45.370> are<00:02:45.549> three<00:02:46.299> cartridges<00:02:47.080> available

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
level three is going to look a lot like

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.640 
level three is going to look a lot like
the<00:02:57.970> level<00:02:58.299> one<00:02:58.480> cartridge<00:02:58.930> as<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.260> can<00:02:59.440> see

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the level one cartridge as you can see

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.110 
the level one cartridge as you can see
but<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.549> rated<00:03:01.180> for<00:03:01.870> more<00:03:02.470> contaminants<00:03:03.310> to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
but it is rated for more contaminants to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.750 
but it is rated for more contaminants to
be<00:03:04.239> removed<00:03:04.660> from<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.170> water<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:06.190> depending

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
be removed from the water so depending

course but then there's lead

which are pesticides and herbicides and
that's<00:03:34.959> not<00:03:35.350> going<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> be<00:03:35.889> something<00:03:36.130> you'll

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
that's not going to be something you'll

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.330 
that's not going to be something you'll
remove<00:03:36.760> with<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.510> level<00:03:37.870> one<00:03:38.079> cartridge<00:03:38.560> then

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
remove with the level one cartridge then

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.629 
remove with the level one cartridge then
taking<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.480> step<00:03:40.510> further<00:03:41.220> they<00:03:42.220> have<00:03:42.430> the

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
taking it a step further they have the

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.180 
taking it a step further they have the
level<00:03:42.940> four<00:03:43.180> cartridge<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.290> obviously<00:03:44.950> this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
level four cartridge and obviously this

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.349 
level four cartridge and obviously this
is<00:03:45.549> much<00:03:45.910> beefier<00:03:46.630> but<00:03:47.200> amazingly<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.489> system

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
is much beefier but amazingly the system

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.420 
is much beefier but amazingly the system
up<00:03:49.510> here<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:49.930> designed<00:03:50.139> to<00:03:50.530> still<00:03:50.829> fit<00:03:51.190> into

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
up here is designed to still fit into

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.030 
up here is designed to still fit into
the<00:03:51.639> same<00:03:51.910> valve<00:03:52.329> head<00:03:52.630> so<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.440> can<00:03:53.769> upgrade

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
the same valve head so you can upgrade

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.949 
the same valve head so you can upgrade
you<00:03:55.030> could<00:03:55.420> buy<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.690> level<00:03:56.290> one<00:03:56.530> setup<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.959> if

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
you could buy the level one setup and if

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.229 
you could buy the level one setup and if
something<00:03:59.560> changed<00:04:00.370> with<00:04:00.579> your<00:04:00.730> water<00:04:01.030> and

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
something changed with your water and

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.840 
something changed with your water and
you<00:04:01.569> needed<00:04:02.079> higher<00:04:02.440> contaminant<00:04:03.280> removal<00:04:03.370> or

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
you needed higher contaminant removal or

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.300 
you needed higher contaminant removal or
if<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.900> just<00:04:05.049> bought<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.530> level<00:04:05.829> one<00:04:06.010> just<00:04:06.220> so

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
if you just bought the level one just so

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.800 
if you just bought the level one just so
you<00:04:06.370> could<00:04:06.489> get

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
you could get

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.380 
you could get
into<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.080> system<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.800> then<00:04:08.580> decided<00:04:09.150> later

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
into the system and then decided later

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.020 
into the system and then decided later
you<00:04:09.630> know<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> really<00:04:10.319> want<00:04:10.590> more<00:04:11.069> contaminant

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
you know I really want more contaminant

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.449 
you know I really want more contaminant
removal<00:04:12.150> from<00:04:12.630> my<00:04:12.840> system<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.190> upgrade

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
removal from my system you can upgrade

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.659 
removal from my system you can upgrade
to<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.330> level<00:04:15.660> for<00:04:15.930> cartridge<00:04:16.500> now<00:04:17.070> obviously

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
to the level for cartridge now obviously

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.729 
to the level for cartridge now obviously
there's<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.940> great<00:04:18.000> deal<00:04:18.540> more<00:04:18.660> media<00:04:19.230> in<00:04:19.470> here

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
there's a great deal more media in here

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.879 
there's a great deal more media in here
so<00:04:20.310> you're<00:04:20.459> getting<00:04:20.760> more<00:04:21.299> contact<00:04:22.169> time<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
so you're getting more contact time the

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.710 
so you're getting more contact time the
water<00:04:23.160> is<00:04:23.340> having<00:04:23.490> more<00:04:23.880> contact<00:04:24.180> time<00:04:24.690> with

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
water is having more contact time with

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.690 
water is having more contact time with
the<00:04:25.110> media<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.680> you're<00:04:26.220> getting<00:04:26.460> better

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
the media and you're getting better
