like if he has a really really fast

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.140 
like if he has a really really fast
reactor<00:02:18.330> on<00:02:18.510> some<00:02:18.840> map<00:02:19.080> with<00:02:19.440> big<00:02:20.130> wide<00:02:20.760> open

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
reactor on some map with big wide open

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.090 
reactor on some map with big wide open
net<00:02:21.300> worth<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.290> make<00:02:22.440> coaches<00:02:22.890> but

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
net worth and I have to make coaches but

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.040 
net worth and I have to make coaches but
if<00:02:23.910> not<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.540> prefer<00:02:25.170> link<00:02:26.330> okay<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.390> what<00:02:27.900> night

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
would that be because salinar Kevin's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.700 
would that be because salinar Kevin's
hasn't<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.660> wide-open<00:02:31.080> natural

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710

energy you didn't even consider oh

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.550 
energy you didn't even consider oh
yeah<00:02:35.730> because<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.690> thing<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.380> like

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
yeah because the thing is I like

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.880 
yeah because the thing is I like
circling<00:02:38.340> on<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.700> map<00:02:39.140> yeah<00:02:40.140> where<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.740> saw

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
circling on that map yeah where we saw

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that you try to sneak into the base and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.030 
that you try to sneak into the base and
you<00:02:42.600> put<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.780> lot<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.959> pressure<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> Spanish

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
play tour I was really impressed by that

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.000 
play tour I was really impressed by that
play<00:02:59.660> he<00:03:00.660> didn't<00:03:00.959> have<00:03:01.080> any<00:03:01.320> chance<00:03:01.739> at<00:03:01.860> all

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
play he didn't have any chance at all

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.790 
play he didn't have any chance at all
and<00:03:02.250> he<00:03:02.970> didn't<00:03:03.720> expect<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.110> do<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> think

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
and he didn't expect that do you think

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.650 
and he didn't expect that do you think
that's<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:05.070> mistake<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.670> lot<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:06.120> time<00:03:06.269> players

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
that's a mistake a lot of time players

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.120 
that's a mistake a lot of time players
make<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.170> they<00:03:07.290> don't<00:03:07.500> expect<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.950> Zerg

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
make that they don't expect the Zerg

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.900 
make that they don't expect the Zerg
player<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.790> expressive<00:03:09.830> um<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:11.250> don't

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.360 
player to be that expressive um I don't
know<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.239> guess<00:03:12.480> he<00:03:13.260> didn't<00:03:13.620> think<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:14.010> make<00:03:14.190> it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370
