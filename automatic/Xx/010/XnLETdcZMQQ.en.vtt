00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
information but a few basics here how to

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.420 
information but a few basics here how to
enter<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:42.320> get<00:00:42.500> out<00:00:42.680> of<00:00:42.710> programming<00:00:43.520> mode

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
enter and get out of programming mode

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.549 
enter and get out of programming mode
entering<00:00:46.430> programming<00:00:46.940> mode<00:00:47.149> is<00:00:47.870> essentially

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
entering programming mode is essentially

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.490 
entering programming mode is essentially
a<00:00:49.360> two-handed<00:00:50.360> operation<00:00:50.930> here<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.230> have<00:00:51.379> to

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
a two-handed operation here you have to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.950 
a two-handed operation here you have to
hold<00:00:51.739> down<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.129> power<00:00:52.160> button<00:00:52.600> at<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.719> same

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
hold down the power button at the same

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.920 
hold down the power button at the same
time<00:00:54.260> that<00:00:54.500> you're<00:00:54.680> connecting<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.250> battery

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
time that you're connecting the battery

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.319 
time that you're connecting the battery
all<00:00:56.930> right<00:00:57.110> so<00:00:57.410> hold<00:00:57.649> down<00:00:57.829> power<00:00:58.149> while<00:00:59.149> you

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
all right so hold down power while you

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.439 
all right so hold down power while you
connect<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.719> battery<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:02.120> light<00:01:02.300> will

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
connect the battery and the light will

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.590 
connect the battery and the light will
flash<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:03.079> couple<00:01:03.500> times<00:01:03.770> and<00:01:04.100> go<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.149> dimly

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
flash a couple times and go to a dimly

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.350 
flash a couple times and go to a dimly
lit<00:01:05.630> mode<00:01:06.280> indicating<00:01:07.280> I'm<00:01:07.700> now<00:01:08.030> in

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
lit mode indicating I'm now in

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.039 
lit mode indicating I'm now in
programming<00:01:08.960> mode<00:01:09.369> so<00:01:10.840> once<00:01:11.840> you're<00:01:11.990> in

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
programming mode so once you're in

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.940 
programming mode so once you're in
programming<00:01:12.710> mode<00:01:13.119> you<00:01:14.119> now<00:01:14.270> have<00:01:14.510> access<00:01:14.950> to

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
programming mode you now have access to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.899 
programming mode you now have access to
a<00:01:15.979> menu<00:01:16.610> driven<00:01:17.570> programming<00:01:18.409> system<00:01:18.909> there

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
a menu driven programming system there

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.530 
a menu driven programming system there
are<00:01:20.080> 13<00:01:21.080> menu<00:01:21.470> items<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.220> can<00:01:22.540> have

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
are 13 menu items that you can have

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.710 
are 13 menu items that you can have
access<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.619> really<00:01:24.920> only<00:01:25.479> might<00:01:26.479> need<00:01:26.689> a

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
access to you really only might need a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.039 
access to you really only might need a
couple<00:01:27.400> most<00:01:28.400> of<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.700> options<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.689> won't

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
couple most of the options you won't

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.370 
couple most of the options you won't
need<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.710> access<00:01:30.979> or<00:01:31.610> have<00:01:32.030> any<00:01:32.930> interest<00:01:33.290> in

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
need to access or have any interest in

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.990 
need to access or have any interest in
looking<00:01:33.500> at<00:01:33.829> but<00:01:34.070> there<00:01:34.490> are<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.610> few<00:01:34.670> that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
looking at but there are a few that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.510 
looking at but there are a few that
might<00:01:35.180> interest<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:36.710> I'm<00:01:37.310> going<00:01:37.430> to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
might interest you so I'm going to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.030 
might interest you so I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:37.759> one<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.329> those<00:01:38.450> here<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.040> that

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
demonstrate one of those here and that

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.120 
demonstrate one of those here and that
is<00:01:40.280> called<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.790> super<00:01:41.150> lock<00:01:41.329> mode<00:01:42.100> when<00:01:43.100> I

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
is called the super lock mode when I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.600 
is called the super lock mode when I
ship<00:01:43.430> these<00:01:43.610> lights<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.740> enable<00:01:45.740> super<00:01:46.189> lock<00:01:46.369> by

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
ship these lights I enable super lock by

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.420 
ship these lights I enable super lock by
default<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.270> as<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> safety<00:01:47.810> feature

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
default just as a safety feature

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.319 
default just as a safety feature
basically<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.549> prevents<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> light<00:01:50.149> from

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
basically it prevents the light from

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.830 
basically it prevents the light from
being<00:01:50.600> turned<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.960> with<00:01:51.229> a<00:01:51.259> single<00:01:51.530> click<00:01:52.840> it's

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
being turned on with a single click it's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.350 
being turned on with a single click it's
great<00:01:54.229> if<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.409> had<00:01:54.500> kids<00:01:54.829> or<00:01:55.340> if<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.329> just

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
great if you had kids or if you just

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.569 
great if you had kids or if you just
want<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.840> prevent<00:01:57.200> any<00:01:57.770> accidental<00:01:58.130> turn<00:01:58.430> on

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
want to prevent any accidental turn on

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.940 
want to prevent any accidental turn on
but<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:59.869> know<00:01:59.960> some<00:02:00.259> people<00:02:00.500> may<00:02:00.619> not<00:02:00.740> like<00:02:00.799> it

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
but you know some people may not like it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.679 
but you know some people may not like it
so<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.340> can<00:02:01.549> turn<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.850> on<00:02:01.939> or<00:02:02.000> off<00:02:02.180> very<00:02:02.540> easily

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
so you can turn it on or off very easily

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.249 
so you can turn it on or off very easily
through<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.140> programming<00:02:03.590> menu<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:05.140> let<00:02:06.140> me

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
through the programming menu and let me

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.600 
through the programming menu and let me
show<00:02:06.439> you<00:02:06.759> how<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.850> get<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.360> option<00:02:09.610> super

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
show you how to get to that option super

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.280 
show you how to get to that option super
lock<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.030> menu<00:02:11.690> item<00:02:11.959> 4<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:13.040> I'm<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.580> to
