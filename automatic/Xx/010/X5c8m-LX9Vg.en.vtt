we put another blue mark on the internal

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.100 
we put another blue mark on the internal
stud<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.939> limit<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.450> solenoid<00:01:18.930> wire

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
stud the limit for your solenoid wire

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.100 
stud the limit for your solenoid wire
what<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> heavy<00:01:21.780> stud

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
what you do on this on the heavy stud

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.170 
what you do on this on the heavy stud
who<00:01:22.290> put<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.680> positive<00:01:23.220> battery<00:01:23.460> cable<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
who put your positive battery cable and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 
who put your positive battery cable and
then<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.080> another<00:01:25.350> wire<00:01:25.950> that's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
then there will be another wire that's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
then there will be another wire that's
already<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.780> another<00:01:28.140> heavy<00:01:28.500> wire

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
already there that is another heavy wire

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
already there that is another heavy wire
you<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> red<00:01:29.700> hitting<00:01:30.090> wire<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.840> goes

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you see a red hitting wire that goes

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.969 
you see a red hitting wire that goes
inside<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.159> hooks<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.640> onto<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.530> fuse<00:01:34.530> panel

inside<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.310> vehicle<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.479> you're<00:01:39.659> going

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
inside of the vehicle then you're going

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.929 
inside of the vehicle then you're going
to<00:01:39.869> find<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.259> you've<00:01:40.409> got<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.700> purple<00:01:41.700> wire

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939

onto the inside term I want you to have

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.410 
onto the inside term I want you to have
those<00:01:48.320> hooked<00:01:48.680> up<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.520> engine<00:01:49.939> should<00:01:50.119> turn

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
those hooked up the engine should turn

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.289 
those hooked up the engine should turn
over<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.900> crank<00:01:51.200> nicely<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:53.060> basically

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
over and crank nicely so that basically

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.999 
over and crank nicely so that basically
takes<00:01:53.840> care<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.380> just<00:01:54.409> keep<00:01:54.710> everything
