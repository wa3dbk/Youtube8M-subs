that<00:01:47.140> were<00:01:47.320> really<00:01:47.530> necessary<00:01:47.920> for<00:01:47.979> gameplay

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
that were really necessary for gameplay

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.910 
that were really necessary for gameplay
intend<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:49.630> oftentimes<00:01:49.869> said<00:01:50.290> that<00:01:50.560> they<00:01:50.830> were

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
intend to oftentimes said that they were

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.800 
intend to oftentimes said that they were
very<00:01:51.100> much<00:01:51.340> inspired<00:01:51.670> by<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.420> alien<00:01:52.689> movies

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
very much inspired by the alien movies

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.450 
very much inspired by the alien movies
and<00:01:53.049> they<00:01:53.110> did<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.320> first<00:01:53.350> Metroid<00:01:53.890> so<00:01:54.340> there

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
and they did the first Metroid so there

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.490 
and they did the first Metroid so there
anything<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:55.210> can<00:01:55.479> be<00:01:55.570> acquired<00:01:55.810> by<00:01:55.960> Metroid

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
anything you can be acquired by Metroid

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.620 
anything you can be acquired by Metroid
when<00:01:56.710> you're<00:01:56.890> doing<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.310> new<00:01:58.150> ending<00:01:58.420> game

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
when you're doing the new ending game

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.870 
when you're doing the new ending game
well<00:01:59.409> there's<00:01:59.590> lots<00:01:59.650> of<00:01:59.979> things<00:02:00.040> that<00:02:00.549> metroid

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
well there's lots of things that metroid

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.429 
well there's lots of things that metroid
would<00:02:01.060> bring<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.509> table<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.840> but<00:02:02.229> they

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
would bring to the table that but they

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.499 
would bring to the table that but they
don't<00:02:02.619> entirely<00:02:03.159> apply<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:04.090> game<00:02:04.330> you

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
don't entirely apply to this game you

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.120 
don't entirely apply to this game you
know<00:02:04.600> but<00:02:04.810> as<00:02:04.900> far<00:02:05.020> as<00:02:05.080> like<00:02:05.320> sure<00:02:05.799> puzzle

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
know but as far as like sure puzzle

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
know but as far as like sure puzzle
solving<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.549> things<00:02:06.670> like<00:02:06.759> that<00:02:06.820> would<00:02:07.090> be

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
solving and things like that would be

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.089 
solving and things like that would be
awesome<00:02:07.270> investigation<00:02:08.169> but<00:02:08.349> no<00:02:08.889> I<00:02:08.919> don't

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
awesome investigation but no I don't

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.289 
awesome investigation but no I don't
think<00:02:09.129> it's<00:02:09.340> really<00:02:09.519> a<00:02:09.549> backwards<00:02:09.999> kind<00:02:10.209> of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
think it's really a backwards kind of

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.940 
think it's really a backwards kind of
thing<00:02:10.479> for<00:02:10.659> that<00:02:10.810> we're<00:02:11.169> more<00:02:11.499> inspired<00:02:11.829> by

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
thing for that we're more inspired by

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
thing for that we're more inspired by
the<00:02:12.010> movies<00:02:12.310> really

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
the movies really

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.970 
the movies really

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
any is also coming out to wii u next

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.310 
any is also coming out to wii u next
year<00:02:15.720> anything<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.810> can<00:02:16.900> tell<00:02:17.020> us<00:02:17.080> how<00:02:17.260> you

brainstorming a lot about those kind of
ideas<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.320> lot<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.500> people<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.860> given<00:02:26.980> us

haven't<00:02:56.560> talked<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.980> team<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:57.430> been

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
haven't talked to that team that's been

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.850 
haven't talked to that team that's been
working<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.970> those<00:02:58.060> kind<00:02:58.300> of<00:02:58.330> things<00:02:58.830> before<00:02:59.830> I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
working on those kind of things before I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.170 
working on those kind of things before I
left<00:03:00.130> but<00:03:00.280> hopefully<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.880> should<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.060> getting

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
left but hopefully we should be getting

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.360 
left but hopefully we should be getting
at<00:03:01.360> some<00:03:01.540> soon<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.740> think<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.100> we<00:03:03.220> use

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
at some soon do you think that we use

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.970 
at some soon do you think that we use
more<00:03:03.780> transitional<00:03:04.780> platform<00:03:05.200> until<00:03:05.440> next

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
more transitional platform until next

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.610 
more transitional platform until next
Xbox<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:06.760> Playstation<00:03:07.270> comes<00:03:07.450> out<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.870> why

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
Xbox and Playstation comes out and why

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.900 
Xbox and Playstation comes out and why
do<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.830> think<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.100> many<00:03:09.340> people<00:03:09.400> still

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
do you think that many people still

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.330 
do you think that many people still
define<00:03:10.240> it<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.540> next<00:03:11.020> generation<00:03:11.260> just<00:03:12.250> by

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
define it and next generation just by

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.190 
define it and next generation just by
looking<00:03:12.580> at<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> graphics<00:03:12.970> not<00:03:13.360> by<00:03:13.540> how<00:03:14.170> you

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
looking at the graphics not by how you

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.230 
looking at the graphics not by how you
play<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.560> game<00:03:14.709> yeah<00:03:15.610> it's<00:03:15.790> kind<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.000> weird

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
play the game yeah it's kind of weird

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.000 
play the game yeah it's kind of weird
right<00:03:16.540> how<00:03:16.780> about<00:03:16.810> how<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:17.200> really<00:03:17.440> works<00:03:17.680> I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
right how about how that really works I

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.920 
right how about how that really works I
think<00:03:18.580> for<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> lot<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.090> people<00:03:19.239> because<00:03:19.750> it's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
think for a lot of people because it's

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.650 
think for a lot of people because it's
the<00:03:20.080> Wii<00:03:20.260> because<00:03:20.950> it's<00:03:21.160> not<00:03:21.400> what<00:03:22.330> has<00:03:22.480> been

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
the Wii because it's not what has been

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.680 
the Wii because it's not what has been
part<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.230> hardcore<00:03:23.830> sort<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.250> gaming

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
part of the hardcore sort of gaming

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.090 
part of the hardcore sort of gaming
platforms<00:03:25.690> traditional<00:03:26.110> platforms<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.709> think

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
platforms traditional platforms I think

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.080 
platforms traditional platforms I think
that's<00:03:27.220> why<00:03:27.430> people<00:03:27.459> have<00:03:27.820> been<00:03:27.940> may<00:03:28.060> be

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that's why people have been may be

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.190 
that's why people have been may be
referring<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.780> is<00:03:28.930> sort<00:03:29.080> of<00:03:29.110> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
referring to this is sort of the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.080 
referring to this is sort of the
translational<00:03:29.560> platform<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:30.670> we<00:03:30.760> can<00:03:30.910> see

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
translational platform but we can see

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.670 
translational platform but we can see
that<00:03:31.239> obviously<00:03:31.660> they're<00:03:31.900> very<00:03:32.080> influenced

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
that obviously they're very influenced

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.590 
that obviously they're very influenced
by<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.830> idea<00:03:33.070> of<00:03:33.250> using<00:03:33.550> dual<00:03:34.000> sticks<00:03:34.300> and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
by the idea of using dual sticks and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.000 
by the idea of using dual sticks and
having<00:03:35.140> triggers<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.590> all<00:03:35.650> those<00:03:35.739> kind<00:03:35.980> of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
having triggers and all those kind of

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.860 
having triggers and all those kind of
things<00:03:36.070> they<00:03:36.190> want<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:36.519> gather<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.120> new<00:03:37.360> type<00:03:37.840> of

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
things they want to gather a new type of

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.840 
things they want to gather a new type of
audience<00:03:38.290> obviously<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.130> i<00:03:39.430> think<00:03:39.700> that

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
audience obviously and i think that

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.550 
audience obviously and i think that
frankly<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.450> lot<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:40.989> memory<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.410> their

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
frankly a lot of the memory on their

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.140 
frankly a lot of the memory on their
allows<00:03:41.799> us<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.160> have<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> fidelity<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:43.030> we

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
allows us to have a fidelity that we

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.180 
allows us to have a fidelity that we
haven't<00:03:43.450> seen<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:44.080> this<00:03:44.920> particular

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
haven't seen in this particular

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.670 
haven't seen in this particular
generation<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.780> then<00:03:46.900> i<00:03:46.930> think<00:03:47.200> what<00:03:47.380> we<00:03:47.470> get

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
generation and then i think what we get

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.740 
generation and then i think what we get
out<00:03:47.890> of<00:03:47.920> having<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.640> elements<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.480> are<00:03:49.570> on

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
out of having the elements that are on

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.210 
out of having the elements that are on
the<00:03:49.870> screen<00:03:50.140> really<00:03:50.680> create<00:03:50.920> something<00:03:51.070> new

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
the screen really create something new

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.640 
the screen really create something new
the<00:03:52.060> thing<00:03:52.390> is<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.959> reason<00:03:53.170> why<00:03:53.290> people<00:03:53.470> are

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
the thing is the reason why people are

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.990 
the thing is the reason why people are
calling<00:03:53.799> transitionals<00:03:54.459> because<00:03:54.640> we<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:54.790> no

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
calling transitionals because we have no

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.860 
calling transitionals because we have no
idea<00:03:55.180> what<00:03:55.630> what<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:58.180> know<00:03:58.299> what<00:03:58.570> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
idea what what the you know what the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.740 
idea what what the you know what the
next<00:03:59.080> 720<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.220> know<00:04:00.340> box<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.239> going<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.420> be<00:04:01.570> or

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
next 720 you know box is going to be or

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.660 
next 720 you know box is going to be or
whatever<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.200> ps4<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:02.769> going<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.980> be<00:04:03.100> with<00:04:03.519> no

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
whatever the ps4 is going to be with no

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.970 
whatever the ps4 is going to be with no
idea<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.360> it's<00:04:04.540> hard<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.110> gauge<00:04:05.410> well<00:04:05.799> is<00:04:05.950> that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
idea so it's hard to gauge well is that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.380 
idea so it's hard to gauge well is that
going<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.310> be<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.430> Moore's<00:04:06.700> Law<00:04:06.910> type<00:04:07.239> of

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
going to be a Moore's Law type of

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.550 
going to be a Moore's Law type of
problem<00:04:07.840> where<00:04:07.989> there's<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.320> be<00:04:08.350> lots

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
problem where there's going to be lots

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.949 
problem where there's going to be lots
and<00:04:08.769> lots<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:08.950> graphics<00:04:09.600> obviously<00:04:10.600> that<00:04:10.720> they

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
and lots of graphics obviously that they

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.380 
and lots of graphics obviously that they
have<00:04:11.080> their<00:04:11.230> own<00:04:11.260> interaction<00:04:12.250> which<00:04:13.090> we<00:04:13.239> can

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
have their own interaction which we can

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.300 
have their own interaction which we can
just<00:04:13.510> all<00:04:13.890> interactive<00:04:14.890> kind<00:04:15.070> of<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.280> know

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
just all interactive kind of you know

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.490 
just all interactive kind of you know
ways<00:04:15.580> of<00:04:15.790> dealing<00:04:15.910> with<00:04:16.090> it

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
ways of dealing with it

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.930 
ways of dealing with it
we<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.650> all<00:04:16.829> assume<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.640> they're<00:04:17.760> going<00:04:17.880> to

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
we can all assume that they're going to

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.460 
we can all assume that they're going to
be<00:04:18.000> doing<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.269> same<00:04:18.299> kind<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.630> things<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.380> at

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
be doing the same kind of things so at

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.930 
be doing the same kind of things so at
this<00:04:19.530> point<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.130> reason<00:04:20.400> why<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.519> call<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:20.820> a

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
this point the reason why you call it a

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.350 
this point the reason why you call it a
you<00:04:21.750> know<00:04:21.870> transitional<00:04:22.850> system<00:04:23.850> is<00:04:24.060> because

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
you know transitional system is because

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.450
