alright we have our last figure of this
first<00:03:03.840> way<00:03:04.080> if<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.400> last<00:03:05.610> one<00:03:05.820> then

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
first way if it is the last one then

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.140 
first way if it is the last one then
released<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.770> actually<00:03:08.090> for<00:03:09.090> an

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
released and it is actually for an

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.050 
released and it is actually for an
entirely<00:03:09.510> different<00:03:09.690> TV<00:03:10.350> show<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
entirely different TV show it is the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.790 
entirely different TV show it is the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
Grant Gustin version of the flash and I

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.230 
Grant Gustin version of the flash and I
think<00:03:17.010> they<00:03:17.100> did<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.280> really<00:03:17.580> good<00:03:17.820> job<00:03:17.880> of

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
think they did a really good job of

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.340 
think they did a really good job of
capturing<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:20.070> costume<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.240> capturing<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
capturing the costume and capturing a

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.210 
capturing the costume and capturing a
look<00:03:22.610> he<00:03:23.610> does<00:03:23.880> come<00:03:24.270> with<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:25.380> few<00:03:25.680> different

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
look he does come with a few different

about<00:03:33.440> good<00:03:34.440> enough<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.800> me<00:03:35.010> if<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.030> look<00:03:36.240> in

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
about good enough for me if you look in

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.730 
about good enough for me if you look in
someone<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> promo<00:03:37.260> shots<00:03:37.530> and

everything they have them manipulated

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.140 
everything they have them manipulated
and<00:03:39.959> poses<00:03:40.500> like<00:03:40.650> he's<00:03:40.890> running<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.550> can't

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and poses like he's running I can't

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.910 
and poses like he's running I can't
imagine<00:03:42.239> any<00:03:42.750> possible<00:03:43.350> way<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.709> can

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
imagine any possible way that you can

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.850 
imagine any possible way that you can
actually<00:03:44.340> do<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.330> with<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.720> figure<00:03:45.959> it's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
actually do that with this figure it's

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.130 
actually do that with this figure it's
very<00:03:47.070> stiff<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.459> as<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> matter<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.209> fact<00:03:48.480> as

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
very stiff and as a matter of fact as

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.050 
very stiff and as a matter of fact as
you<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.410> see<00:03:49.590> by<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.770> way<00:03:49.890> his<00:03:50.010> leg<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.430> you

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
you can see by the way his leg is you

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.449 
you can see by the way his leg is you
have<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.330> arch<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.600> kind<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.170> weird<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:53.370> to

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
have to arch it kind of weird just to

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.970 
have to arch it kind of weird just to
get<00:03:53.580> him<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.760> stand<00:03:53.970> upright<00:03:54.330> as<00:03:54.900> far<00:03:55.590> as<00:03:55.770> all

get him to stand upright as far as all
the<00:03:56.130> figures<00:03:56.430> are<00:03:56.640> concerned<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.989> see

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
the figures are concerned that you see

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.160 
the figures are concerned that you see
here<00:03:59.120> probably<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.500> quote-unquote<00:04:01.700> worst<00:04:03.170> in

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
here probably the quote-unquote worst in

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.780 
here probably the quote-unquote worst in
terms<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:05.330> just<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.420> quality<00:04:07.459> that's<00:04:08.459> mostly

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
terms of just the quality that's mostly

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.970 
terms of just the quality that's mostly
because<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.239> way<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.510> he<00:04:09.570> stands<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.410> I

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
because of the way that he stands and I

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.330 
because of the way that he stands and I
say<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.209> it's<00:04:12.570> like<00:04:12.750> saying<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:15.049> don't<00:04:16.049> know

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
good job I don't mind that these figures

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.980 
good job I don't mind that these figures
are<00:04:43.370> stiff<00:04:43.669> I<00:04:43.940> know<00:04:44.360> that<00:04:44.569> there<00:04:44.690> are<00:04:44.780> probably

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
are stiff I know that there are probably

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.409 
are stiff I know that there are probably
some<00:04:45.289> collectors<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:45.979> do<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.970> wish<00:04:47.210> they

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
some collectors that do that wish they

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.879 
some collectors that do that wish they
were<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.750> little<00:04:47.960> bit<00:04:48.080> easier<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.500> manipulate

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
were a little bit easier to manipulate

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.850 
were a little bit easier to manipulate
but<00:04:49.750> I'm<00:04:50.750> ok<00:04:51.050> with<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.259> because<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.530> just<00:04:51.560> stand

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
but I'm ok with it because I just stand

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.879 
but I'm ok with it because I just stand
them<00:04:52.039> up<00:04:52.160> in<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.370> case<00:04:52.639> and<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:54.440> stiffer<00:04:54.770> they

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
them up in a case and the stiffer they

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.640 
them up in a case and the stiffer they
are<00:04:55.039> sometimes<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.759> better<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.650> and

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
are sometimes the better it is and and

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.890 
are sometimes the better it is and and
that<00:04:57.919> is<00:04:58.069> all<00:04:58.280> incumbent<00:04:58.970> on<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.330> feet<00:04:59.599> and

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
that is all incumbent on the feet and
