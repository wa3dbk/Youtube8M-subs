one lubricant to another it works on
five<00:00:22.429> amps<00:00:22.820> I<00:00:23.000> place<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:23.689> grease<00:00:23.869> right<00:00:24.199> here

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
five amps I place the grease right here

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.529 
five amps I place the grease right here
on<00:00:24.529> this<00:00:24.710> race<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.220> then<00:00:25.699> I<00:00:25.730> apply<00:00:26.090> extreme

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
on this race and then I apply extreme

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.259 
on this race and then I apply extreme
pressure<00:00:26.840> with<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.410> scale<00:00:27.710> for<00:00:28.670> every<00:00:29.029> pound

thousand psi right on the point of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.340 
thousand psi right on the point of
contact<00:00:33.830> so<00:00:34.130> we're<00:00:34.940> gonna<00:00:35.060> go<00:00:35.240> ahead<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:35.750> test

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
contact so we're gonna go ahead and test

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.710 
contact so we're gonna go ahead and test
the<00:00:36.620> first<00:00:36.890> grease<00:00:37.190> which<00:00:37.910> is<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.120> very<00:00:38.390> common

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
the first grease which is a very common

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
the first grease which is a very common
grease<00:00:39.110> it's<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.190> competitors<00:00:40.760> grease<00:00:41.740> put

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
grease it's the competitors grease put

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:52.300 
grease it's the competitors grease put
it<00:00:42.890> right<00:00:43.040> here

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.990 

two<00:00:53.310> and<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.490> half<00:00:58.280> at<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.550> two<00:00:59.790> and<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.970> half

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
two and a half at about two and a half

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
two and a half at about two and a half
to<00:01:00.420> two<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.720> three-quarter<00:01:01.350> pounds<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.920> just

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
to two and three-quarter pounds it just

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
to two and three-quarter pounds it just
breaks<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:03.360> we'll<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:03.810> is<00:01:03.840> clean

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
breaks down what we'll do now is clean

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
breaks down what we'll do now is clean
off<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> race<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.190> test<00:01:05.670> our<00:01:05.850> extreme

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
off the race and test our extreme

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:38.070 
off the race and test our extreme
pressure<00:01:06.630> grease

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.630 

so<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.800> first<00:01:39.070> grease<00:01:39.400> broke<00:01:39.850> down<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:41.170> about

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
so the first grease broke down at about

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.100 
so the first grease broke down at about
right<00:01:42.640> here<00:01:42.910> two<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.150> a<00:01:43.300> half<00:01:43.480> pounds

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
right here two and a half pounds

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.440 
right here two and a half pounds
the<00:01:44.950> ant<00:01:45.130> meter<00:01:45.460> had<00:01:45.760> gone<00:01:45.970> all<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.270> way<00:01:46.300> to

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
the ant meter had gone all the way to

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.810 
the ant meter had gone all the way to
the<00:01:46.690> end<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.410> just<00:01:47.590> broke<00:01:47.770> down<00:01:47.830> here<00:01:48.670> we

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
the end and it just broke down here we

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.360 
the end and it just broke down here we
could<00:01:48.940> go<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.180> three<00:01:49.510> pounds<00:01:50.220> three<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.340> a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
could go to three pounds three and a

00:01:51.370 --> 00:02:00.570 
could go to three pounds three and a
half<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:53.910> four<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.060> half<00:01:55.260> five<00:01:57.450> six<00:01:59.580> seven

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
half for four and a half five six seven

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.350 
half for four and a half five six seven
it<00:02:00.790> could<00:02:01.060> take<00:02:01.240> some<00:02:01.450> shock<00:02:01.750> loads<00:02:02.050> to<00:02:03.360> seven

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
it could take some shock loads to seven

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.730 
it could take some shock loads to seven
eight<00:02:04.920> nine

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.170 

what<00:02:09.740> we're<00:02:09.890> going<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.070> do<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:10.400> is<00:02:10.730> called<00:02:11.060> a

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
what we're going to do now is called a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.750 
what we're going to do now is called a
water<00:02:11.420> wash<00:02:11.690> test<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.650> see<00:02:12.860> how<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.190> does<00:02:13.400> under

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
water wash test to see how it does under

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.450 
water wash test to see how it does under
contaminants<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.710> water<00:02:15.920> wash<00:02:16.160> test

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
contaminants for the water wash test

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.530 
contaminants for the water wash test
we're<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.820> going<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.000> add<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> bit<00:02:17.510> more

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
we're just going to add a bit more

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.890 
we're just going to add a bit more
grease

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.780 

and<00:02:23.379> we've<00:02:23.709> got<00:02:23.920> water<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.459> cup<00:02:24.760> right

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and we've got water in the cup right

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.250 
and we've got water in the cup right
here<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.700> totally<00:02:27.970> submerged<00:02:28.540> degrees<00:02:28.930> under

water as you can see even under water
the<00:02:33.549> grease<00:02:33.760> could<00:02:33.970> take<00:02:34.150> extreme<00:02:34.659> pressure

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.319 

we<00:02:46.590> will<00:02:46.769> now<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:47.069> doing<00:02:47.219> the<00:02:47.400> exact<00:02:47.790> same<00:02:48.030> test

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
we will now be doing the exact same test

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.589 
we will now be doing the exact same test
but<00:02:48.810> with<00:02:48.930> spray<00:02:49.230> lubricants<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:51.390> may

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
but with spray lubricants you may

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.420 
but with spray lubricants you may
recognize<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.230> one<00:02:52.439> it's<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.890> very<00:02:53.099> common

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
recognize this one it's a very common

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:13.710 
recognize this one it's a very common
spray<00:02:53.790> lubricant

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
breaks down at about two pounds what

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.460 
breaks down at about two pounds what
we're<00:03:16.970> gonna<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.330> now<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.510> use<00:03:17.930> our<00:03:18.170> spray

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
we're gonna do now is use our spray

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:29.040 
we're gonna do now is use our spray

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.430 
lubricant went to two and a half three
pounds

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.200 

we're<00:03:38.980> doing<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.340> hundred<00:03:39.550> percent<00:03:40.030> better

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
we're doing a hundred percent better

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.570 
we're doing a hundred percent better
right<00:03:40.510> now<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.530> not<00:03:41.860> only<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.100> we<00:03:42.430> can

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
right now and not only that we can
