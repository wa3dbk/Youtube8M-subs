00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.640
 two bishops two principles 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.859
 there is no crate strategy for an art with both floors 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.219
 instead 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.929
 two principles apply 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.109
 bishops work best when they are centralized and working side by side 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.100
 the player with the two bishops must use their king with more this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.649
 regressivity 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.140
 in the diagram 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.110
 the initial position is the most unfavorable for the upper side 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.679
 the white ones will have to drive and black to beat Rome 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:42.800
 and finally 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.230
 for four ballerina rounds 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.130
 before anything else the white precision activate your king 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.030
 Reid is 2 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.940
 reid is four 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.600
 the black king moves to stand the opposition and tries to keep up with more 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.560
 centralized 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.250
 a more practical option would be 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.110
 reiss and 3 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.090
 2 rey tech 3 what the black king would be driven faster to the 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.500
 right-side the bed 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.130
 2 bishops and 3 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.130
 here to the recurring pattern in this final 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.130
 the representative forced to retreat 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.520

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.430
 bishop of 4 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 as before the black king forced to retreat 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.750

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.420
 16 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.799
 the black bush with a different approach instead of trying to put the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.660
 kings and opposition 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.350
 6 bishop c4 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.320
 as shown in the diagram 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.940
 in half a dozen white lancies will reach their goal 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.180
 the two animals are centralized working side by side with the reactive 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.069
 companies need to evolve more pushed the black king into the 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.259
 right-back volleyball 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.949
 reiss and 6 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.049
 the black ones trying to make the game of whites the most difficult 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.689
 and refuse to back off 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.189
 7 king is 5 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.979
 king besset 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.949
 the clues are doing what they can to avoid singing to 8 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.019
 8 bishop of 5 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.069
 Cristina left 6 unavailable for employment 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.090
 king cct 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.639
 nine bishops c5 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.319
 networks 7 10 bishop of 6 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:53.489
 the essential novel since the king and black finally the force of the paraiba 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.169
 to the bottom such goalkeeper 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.819
 King is the 8 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.169
 once again 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.289
 the black women try hard to avoid the field 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.039
 if they play reiser 8 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.900
 So 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.760
 11 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.399
 bishop c6 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:13.589
 will transpose to the main line 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.149
 11 king and 6 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.709
 I met Lanci 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.869
 The black king stays glued to the bottom row 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.730
 riedel 8 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.629
 12 dc you 6 now the last black king to be reinforced towards the field to 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.289
 8 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.179
 reiser 8 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.840
 the diagram shows the current position 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.840
 and is usually reinforced by two floors 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.799
 notice as forced rep morrissey at 38 on his 8 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.159
 the white precision reposition the king 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.269
 to cover accepted and indecent 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.770
 the obvious choice 16 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.339
 so in Paraiba 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.039
 13 network 5 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:05.779
 as usual white need to be careful to avoid 13 mst 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:10.759
 which would result in drowned mars and consequently tie 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.219
 riedel 8 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.430
 fourteen kings said 5 kings his 8 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.559
 Network 6 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:21.900
 gave eight 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.900
 just a few more years that separate white from mat 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.799
 they must allow the black king to have the opportunity to die for the field 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.999
 16 bishop 6 5 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.629
 reid seoul 8 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:36.960
 17 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.629
 bishop st 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.759
 but a decisive move 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.050
 the black ones are forced far from the center and towards the field 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.439
 King gave eight 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.569
 18 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.110
 bishop of 7 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.139
 the white ones start from the same principle that motivated their previous bid 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.779
 rich 1 8 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.979
 finally the pieces were forced to the field as a show of grievance 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.309
 now I hope that check is simple white needs to make a wait 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:09.900
 and wait for the king 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.529
 vote for bel air 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:13.860
 19 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.790
 bishop gave eight whites has many years of waiting 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.979
 the bids bishop c5 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.520
 bishop f8 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.180
 this is six 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.229
 would be as effective as this 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:31.599
 riedel 8 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.839
