00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
this pump pumps up to zero point six
meters<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.840> sufficient<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.040> most

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
meters what is sufficient for most

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.380 
meters what is sufficient for most
smaller<00:01:08.909> computer<00:01:09.689> cases<00:01:10.909> second<00:01:11.909> let's<00:01:12.180> take

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
smaller computer cases second let's take

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.830 
smaller computer cases second let's take
a<00:01:12.420> look<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> 3600<00:01:13.740> rpm<00:01:14.400> version<00:01:14.790> well<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
a look at the 3600 rpm version well it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.570 
a look at the 3600 rpm version well it
pretty<00:01:16.110> much<00:01:16.259> looks<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> same<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.460> has<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
pretty much looks the same but it has a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
pretty much looks the same but it has a
different<00:01:17.850> electronic<00:01:18.570> inside<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> high

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
different electronic inside and a high

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.609 
different electronic inside and a high
rotation<00:01:20.460> speed<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> consequence<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.380> this

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
rotation speed as a consequence of this

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.580 
rotation speed as a consequence of this
it<00:01:22.979> has<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> higher<00:01:23.520> water<00:01:24.180> flow<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.320> higher

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it has a higher water flow and a higher

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.940 
it has a higher water flow and a higher
water<00:01:25.890> pressure<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.790> goes<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.530> 2.0<00:01:28.530> meters

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
water pressure it goes up to 2.0 meters

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
water pressure it goes up to 2.0 meters
this<00:01:29.490> means<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> support<00:01:30.479> also<00:01:30.689> bigger

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this means you can support also bigger

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.819 
this means you can support also bigger
computer<00:01:31.530> systems<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.729> small<00:01:33.030> pump<00:01:33.420> of

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
computer systems with this small pump of

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
computer systems with this small pump of
course<00:01:34.829> with<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> high<00:01:35.369> rotation<00:01:35.880> speed<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
course with the high rotation speed is a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
course with the high rotation speed is a
little<00:01:36.689> more<00:01:36.869> noisy<00:01:37.259> than<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> silent

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
little more noisy than the silent

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
little more noisy than the silent
version<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.479> an<00:01:39.990> another<00:01:40.320> advantage<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
version but as an another advantage you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.929 
version but as an another advantage you
can<00:01:41.040> reduce<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.299> voltage<00:01:43.079> down<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.890> 5<00:01:44.250> volt<00:01:44.729> up

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
can reduce the voltage down to 5 volt up

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.170 
can reduce the voltage down to 5 volt up
to<00:01:45.240> thirty<00:01:45.540> point<00:01:45.899> five<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.310> pump<00:01:47.700> covers

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to thirty point five so this pump covers

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.200 
to thirty point five so this pump covers
a<00:01:48.210> wider<00:01:48.540> range<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.170> usability<00:01:50.070> even<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> low

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
a wider range of usability even as a low

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.859 
a wider range of usability even as a low
noise<00:01:51.420> bottles<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.770> high<00:01:53.009> power<00:01:53.369> pump
