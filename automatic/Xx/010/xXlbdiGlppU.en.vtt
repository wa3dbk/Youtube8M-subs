00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
there in this plastic bag so I'm not

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.359 
there in this plastic bag so I'm not
really<00:01:04.409> sure<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
really sure what I'm going to do with it

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.230 
really sure what I'm going to do with it
I<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.030> wanted<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.430> know<00:01:08.430> something

I just wanted to have you know something

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
I just wanted to have you know something
and<00:01:12.710> he's<00:01:13.710> getting<00:01:13.890> cremated<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:16.189> I<00:01:19.250> guess

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and he's getting cremated and I guess

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
and he's getting cremated and I guess
we'll<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> ashes<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.380> never<00:01:22.380> really

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
we'll get the ashes back never really

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
we'll get the ashes back never really
kept<00:01:23.040> ashes<00:01:23.670> before<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:25.970> cremation<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
kept ashes before and cremation kind of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.020 
kept ashes before and cremation kind of
creeps<00:01:27.450> me<00:01:27.570> out<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:29.030> didn't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
creeps me out a little bit but I didn't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.980 
creeps me out a little bit but I didn't
want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> bury<00:01:30.540> him<00:01:31.850> someplace<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.390> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.359 
it's so final and you know all these
strange<00:01:44.009> thoughts<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.729> through<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:45.000> head<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
strange thoughts go through my head and

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.649 
strange thoughts go through my head and
you<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:48.060> absolutely

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you know because there's an absolutely

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.440 
you know because there's an absolutely
nothing<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.530> about<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.220> mean<00:01:50.549> it's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
nothing you can do about it I mean it's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
nothing you can do about it I mean it's
just<00:01:51.509> over<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> just<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:56.790> know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
just over and you know I just you know

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.200 
just over and you know I just you know
we're<00:01:57.659> not<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.960> sure<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.350> happened<00:01:59.210> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
we're not really sure what happened you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.179 
we're not really sure what happened you
know<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> vet<00:02:00.960> thought<00:02:01.320> initially<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
know the vet thought initially that it

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.730 
know the vet thought initially that it
was<00:02:02.280> poisoning<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> could

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
was poisoning but it you know it could

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.040 
was poisoning but it you know it could
have<00:02:07.860> been<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> neurological<00:02:08.789> problem<00:02:09.050> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
have been a neurological problem and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.750 
have been a neurological problem and
we're<00:02:10.470> thinking<00:02:10.800> maybe<00:02:10.979> that's<00:02:11.280> what<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.610> was

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
we're thinking maybe that's what it was

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.470 
we're thinking maybe that's what it was
you<00:02:12.180> know

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you know

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.009 
you know
because<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.879> even<00:02:15.330> know<00:02:15.629> where<00:02:15.780> he<00:02:15.959> would

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019
