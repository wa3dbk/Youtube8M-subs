00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
other hair as well and that is probably

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530 
other hair as well and that is probably
the<00:01:53.130> last<00:01:53.399> thing<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.850> should<00:01:54.090> play<00:01:54.270> now

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
but I don't want to see it's just a tiny

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730 
but I don't want to see it's just a tiny
little<00:01:56.909> bit<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.390> realism<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.020> does<00:01:58.439> make<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
little bit of realism that does make a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.310 
little bit of realism that does make a
big<00:01:59.070> difference<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.969> we've<00:02:00.540> untalented<00:02:01.049> for

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
big difference and we've untalented for

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
big difference and we've untalented for
in<00:02:01.439> terms<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> story<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.149> huge

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
in terms of the story there is a huge

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.480 
in terms of the story there is a huge
twist<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.320> makes<00:02:04.530> fish<00:02:04.799> twist<00:02:05.100> really

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
twist and what makes fish twist really

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.219 
twist and what makes fish twist really
good<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.210> no<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.509> saw<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.020> coming

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
