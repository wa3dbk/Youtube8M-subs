 He advanced that inside 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.959
 overtaking is one of the most dangerous maneuvers that can 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.979
 take place in the circulation 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.980
 for that reason it is regulated with great meticulousness 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.529
 the overtaking is the maneuver that consists in overtaking another vehicle 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.890
 in slower moving motion that circulates in front of the one driving 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.569
 consequently, it is an indispensable condition for this maneuver to be 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.569
 realize that both vehicles are in motion 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.350
 As a general rule, overtaking should be carried out on the left of the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.260
 vehicle that is intended to overtake 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.390
 as an exception the overtaking on the right the following cases are allowed 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.170
 If there is enough space for this, the overtaking will be carried out by the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.060
 right taking the utmost precautions when the driver of the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.400
 vehicle that is intended to advance this clearly indicating its purpose 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.000
 to change direction to the left or stop on that side 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.360
 as well as on the tracks with traffic in both directions to the trams that 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 march through the central zone 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.320
 within the villages on the roads that have at least two lanes 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.130
 reserved for circulation 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.850
 in the same direction of travel delimited by longitudinal marks 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.729
 overtaking is allowed on the right to conditions that the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.049
 driver of the vehicle that carries it out I know that you have previously that you can 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.049
 do it safely for other users 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.619
 in all cases in which overtaking involves a 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.409
 Lateral displacement must be warned sufficiently in advance of 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.060
 initiation of the maneuver 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 using the corresponding direction indicator light on the side towards 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.950
 which is going to perform the same 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.060
 or the arm in a horizontal position with the palm of the hand extended toward 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.130
 down if the displacement is going to be towards the side that the hand indicates 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.570
 or bent up 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.140
 if it's going to be on the opposite side
