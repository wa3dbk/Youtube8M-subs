00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 yes from the first days of life of ayo s8 e 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.740
 marco s 10.10 some users have 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 encountered a number of problems 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.530
 related to wifi problems that indeed 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.900
 they slowed down the connection to the network 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 both as regards the transfer 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.699
 of files inside the home network 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 yes regarding the connection to 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.720
 internet is a problem that 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.369
 not everyone has found but has 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.359
 immediately made to turn up their noses at several 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.340
 users 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 apparently it was discovered by 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 what depends depends on a wdl ie a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.370
 protocol that is used i 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.940
 services like air drop and so 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.739
 used both in marco s again ios ea 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 to find out Mario status will break one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 developer who apparently has 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.190
 also found the method to succeed at 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.719
 to solve the problem unfortunately for 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.649
 regarding ios 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.800
 the problem can be solved 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.420
 exclusively doing the jailbreak 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.829
 downloading a tweak from cydia that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 allows you to activate or deactivate 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.090
 this protocol is therefore a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.290
 procedure that for now we are not going to do 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.020
 because not all users obviously 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.240
 the marco s jailbreak 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.100
 the situation much easier for 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.170
 deactivate or reactivate this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.330
 protocol you must use a single one 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.049
 command line to type in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.759
 terminal 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 and this is exactly what I will do to you 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.560
 see in this video how to solve i 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 wifi connectivity issues with marco 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.890
 s 10.10 by activating or deactivating the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.509
 buddi l the protocol used with 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.360
 pedro and clear that after having 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 disabled vdl airdrop itself not 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 it will work more so you won't be able to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.079
 more send or receive files via the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.240
 wifi however it will be possible to reactivate it 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.549
 always using a dam in the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 marco s terminal i am going 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.610
 caliendo avoids welcoming the new one 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.049
 tech fanpage guide as clearly 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.479
 visible from this video 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.909
 from the same mario will be swept in some 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.350
 cases disable the protocol leads to 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.570
 really very much results 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.340
 fortunately not interesting 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.680
 phenomenon that is common to all 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.440
 ios and marco s users but we are convinced 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.030
 that with this method surely some 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 people will solve problems 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.739
 connectivity deactivate the protocol a 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.870
 vdl is very simple the only thing that 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.200
 it will be necessary is to start the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.970
 marco s terminal and type this 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.580
 command string that you will find in the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.290
 description of the video once typed 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.080
 the string will need to be entered 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.599
 system password and protocol 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.920
 will be completely disabled to be 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.360
 sure that the protocol was 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.950
 disabled need to do one 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.750
 very simple verification that is that of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.280
 create air drop and see that anyway 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.099
 in the list of available devices 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.099
 there is no active device 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.650
 finally if you want to go back to the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.780
 normality is to activate the protocol 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.150
 to use and drop will be 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.520
 simply need to restart the 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 terminal s mark and digital this 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.270
 command string that obviously 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.400
 you will also find a description of the crossroads 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.770
 in a few moments the vdl protocol 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.740
 will work again and with it will come back 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.390
 active also airdrop well guys this 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.190
 it is all I hope I have been possible 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.080
 useful at least to the users who 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.730
 have wifi connectivity problems in 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.040
 marco s and in ios 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.190
 I am giving caliendo and I send you a 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.190
 hug
