having zero meaning at all was so we had
to<00:01:22.710> make<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> co-op<00:01:23.220> game<00:01:23.460> inside<00:01:23.939> our<00:01:24.090> co-op

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390

game<00:01:26.250> brilliant<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.600> those

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

tweets<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.170> again<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:29.100> have

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
tweets that again I think have

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.310 
tweets that again I think have
absolutely<00:01:29.970> no<00:01:30.119> meaning<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.290> are

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
absolutely no meaning but then there are

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.649 
absolutely no meaning but then there are
things<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.220> hashtag<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.479> we

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
things like hashtag that is if we

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.630 
things like hashtag that is if we
haven't<00:01:33.990> started<00:01:34.380> already<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.250> how

months<00:01:50.159> ago<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.520> actually<00:01:50.670> blew<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
months ago and it actually blew up that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.090 
months ago and it actually blew up that
video<00:01:51.899> where<00:01:52.380> Vaughn<00:01:52.590> talked<00:01:52.920> about

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
video where Vaughn talked about

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.370 
video where Vaughn talked about
playtesting<00:01:53.759> domination<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.630> could<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.290> be

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
playtesting domination but could it be

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
playtesting domination but could it be
possible<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.250> already<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.640> zombies

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
possible that we already have zombies

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
possible that we already have zombies
and<00:01:57.390> development<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:57.960> well<00:01:58.020> that's<00:01:58.890> something

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and development as well that's something

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.410 
and development as well that's something
that<00:01:59.219> would<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.180> first

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that would be a little bit of a first

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
that would be a little bit of a first
because<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> last<00:02:01.469> things<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
because it is one of the last things to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
because it is one of the last things to
be<00:02:02.009> made<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.759> development<00:02:03.210> process<00:02:03.240> but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
be made in the development process but

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260 
be made in the development process but
it<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.500> quite<00:02:04.829> possible<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.610> three<00:02:05.880> years<00:02:06.149> of

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it is quite possible with three years of

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.760 
it is quite possible with three years of
being<00:02:06.570> able<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.899> develop<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.409> perhaps

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
being able to develop now perhaps

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.480 
being able to develop now perhaps
they're<00:02:08.039> starting<00:02:08.369> points<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.789> moved

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
they're starting points are moved

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.940 
they're starting points are moved
ahead<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.030> time<00:02:10.330> in<00:02:10.510> which<00:02:10.930> hashtag<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.830> is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
ahead of time in which hashtag that is

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.440 
ahead of time in which hashtag that is
if<00:02:12.100> we<00:02:12.220> haven't<00:02:12.520> started<00:02:12.640> already<00:02:13.180> is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
if we haven't started already is

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.140 
if we haven't started already is
actually<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.200> hint<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.830> zombies<00:02:15.550> already<00:02:15.940> being

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
actually a hint to zombies already being

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.640 
actually a hint to zombies already being
in<00:02:16.300> development<00:02:16.840> now<00:02:16.900> there<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> ton<00:02:17.620> of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
in development now there is a ton of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.470 
in development now there is a ton of
speculation<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.460> could<00:02:18.730> go<00:02:18.910> into<00:02:19.180> this

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
speculation that could go into this

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.540 
speculation that could go into this
looking<00:02:20.170> further<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.800> maybe<00:02:21.250> even

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
looking further and maybe even

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.340 
looking further and maybe even
overlooking<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.390> actual<00:02:22.840> points<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
overlooking the actual points of the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.960 
overlooking the actual points of the
tweets<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:23.830> we're<00:02:24.220> not<00:02:24.340> going<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.520> focus<00:02:24.670> on

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
tweets but we're not going to focus on

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.000 
tweets but we're not going to focus on
that<00:02:25.240> too<00:02:25.570> much<00:02:25.750> what<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.140> do<00:02:26.230> want<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.590> bring<00:02:26.830> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
that too much what I do want to bring to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.010 
that too much what I do want to bring to
you<00:02:27.160> guys<00:02:27.340> though<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.820> this<00:02:28.210> image<00:02:28.570> on<00:02:28.750> screen

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
you guys though is this image on screen

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.990 
you guys though is this image on screen
right<00:02:29.350> now<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.890> was<00:02:30.040> part<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.580> actual

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
right now this was part of the actual

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.820 
right now this was part of the actual
live<00:02:31.270> stream<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.320> graphics

accompanying<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.460> stream<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.090> give<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.510> more

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
accompanying the stream to give a more

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.260 
accompanying the stream to give a more

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
visual effect of everything that was

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.030 
visual effect of everything that was
being<00:02:37.510> expressed<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.350> terms<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.770> timeline

chronological<00:02:39.940> order<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.210> all<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.540> kind<00:02:40.720> of

zombies<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.540> image<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.140> don't<00:02:44.740> recognize

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
zombies this image I don't recognize

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.670 
zombies this image I don't recognize
this<00:02:45.430> at<00:02:45.640> all<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.120> terms<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.540> maps<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.260> don't

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
this at all in terms of maps and I don't

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.010 
this at all in terms of maps and I don't
know<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.340> actual<00:02:48.490> weapon<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.360> does<00:02:49.660> look

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
know the actual weapon it does look

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.200 
know the actual weapon it does look
vaguely<00:02:50.320> familiar<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.220> famas<00:02:51.580> but<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.150> you

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
vaguely familiar to the famas but if you

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.030 
vaguely familiar to the famas but if you
actually<00:02:52.360> want<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.750> go<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.290> look<00:02:53.350> at<00:02:53.830> the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
actually want to go up and look at the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.850 
actually want to go up and look at the
gun<00:02:54.220> render<00:02:54.550> of<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:55.030> famas<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.720> doesn't<00:02:56.380> have<00:02:56.590> as

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
gun render of a famas it doesn't have as

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.220 
gun render of a famas it doesn't have as
many<00:02:57.070> protruding<00:02:57.670> pieces<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.210> it<00:02:58.480> does<00:02:58.750> near

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
many protruding pieces as it does near

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.530 
many protruding pieces as it does near
the<00:02:59.380> trigger<00:02:59.620> now<00:02:59.950> again<00:03:00.130> as<00:03:00.580> always<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:01.180> could

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
the trigger now again as always I could

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.150 
the trigger now again as always I could
be<00:03:01.690> one<00:03:01.810> hundred<00:03:01.960> percent<00:03:02.170> wrong<00:03:02.620> maybe<00:03:02.950> this

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
be one hundred percent wrong maybe this

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.400 
be one hundred percent wrong maybe this
is<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.340> weapon<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:03.970> everybody<00:03:04.660> else<00:03:04.720> besides

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
is a weapon that everybody else besides

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.500 
is a weapon that everybody else besides
me<00:03:05.620> knows<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:06.130> if<00:03:06.490> that's<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.790> case<00:03:06.940> let<00:03:07.420> me

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
me knows of if that's the case let me

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.610 
me knows of if that's the case let me
know<00:03:07.600> down<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.870> comments<00:03:08.110> section<00:03:08.320> down

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
know down in the comments section down

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.920 
know down in the comments section down
below<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.310> right<00:03:09.610> now<00:03:09.850> especially<00:03:10.210> with<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
below but right now especially with the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.170 
below but right now especially with the
?<00:03:11.500> underneath<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.010> photograph<00:03:12.550> frame<00:03:12.850> here

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
? underneath the photograph frame here

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.870 
? underneath the photograph frame here
it<00:03:13.510> does<00:03:14.020> seem<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.500> me<00:03:14.650> like<00:03:14.800> maybe<00:03:14.980> we<00:03:15.490> did<00:03:15.760> in

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
it does seem to me like maybe we did in

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.300 
it does seem to me like maybe we did in
fact<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.390> hint<00:03:16.780> out<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.800> terms<00:03:18.160> of

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
fact get a hint out of this in terms of

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.400 
fact get a hint out of this in terms of
zombies<00:03:18.760> any<00:03:18.910> 2015<00:03:19.570> call<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.930> duty<00:03:20.200> now
