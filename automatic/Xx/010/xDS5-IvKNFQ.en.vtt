00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.869 

huh<00:00:00.599> another<00:00:01.199> video<00:00:01.560> what<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.070> hell<00:00:02.250> this<00:00:02.700> is

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
huh another video what the hell this is

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.730 
huh another video what the hell this is
not<00:00:03.060> there's<00:00:03.419> an<00:00:04.460> why<00:00:05.460> am<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.730> doing<00:00:05.790> this

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
not there's an why am I doing this

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.190 
not there's an why am I doing this
joking<00:00:07.740> aside<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:09.300> something<00:00:09.540> fancy<00:00:10.080> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
joking aside I have something fancy to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.330 
joking aside I have something fancy to
show<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.420> it<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.130> 8-bit

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
show you and it is this it is a 8-bit

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.490 
show you and it is this it is a 8-bit
multiplier<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.660> multiplies<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> bit

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
multiplier and it multiplies to a bit

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.060 
multiplier and it multiplies to a bit
numbers<00:00:16.830> hence<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> title<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.119> bit<00:00:18.510> multiplier

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
numbers hence the title a bit multiplier

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.800 
numbers hence the title a bit multiplier
so<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.490> over<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:20.939> poke<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> reset

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
so if we go over here and poke the reset

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.689 
so if we go over here and poke the reset
button<00:00:21.840> from<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.350> last<00:00:22.619> take<00:00:22.920> because<00:00:23.430> i<00:00:23.640> suck

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
button from the last take because i suck

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.929 
button from the last take because i suck
at<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.119> recording<00:00:24.510> videos<00:00:26.060> we<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
at it recording videos we can see a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.730 
at it recording videos we can see a
previous<00:00:29.939> values<00:00:30.330> gone<00:00:31.109> out<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.560> but

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
previous values gone out of there but

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.340 
previous values gone out of there but
anyways<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.610> beside<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:32.969> point<00:00:33.059> um<00:00:33.420> let's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
anyways that's beside the point um let's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.670 
anyways that's beside the point um let's
multiply<00:00:35.250> some<00:00:35.700> numbers<00:00:36.000> together<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> let's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
multiply some numbers together so let's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.440 
multiply some numbers together so let's
multiply<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.250> iconic<00:00:38.969> number<00:00:39.620> 42<00:00:43.399> yeah<00:00:44.399> 42<00:00:45.260> x

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
multiply the iconic number 42 yeah 42 x

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:57.200 
multiply the iconic number 42 yeah 42 x
65<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.579> yeah<00:00:54.500> we<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.699> poke<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
65 so yeah we go up here and we poke the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.689 
65 so yeah we go up here and we poke the
magical<00:00:57.660> button<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.399> calculates<00:00:59.399> over<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
magical button that calculates over to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.910 
magical button that calculates over to
everything<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.300> us<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.719> I'm<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> dumb

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
everything for us because I'm a dumb

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.759 
everything for us because I'm a dumb
American<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.719> we<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:03.989> our<00:01:04.229> fancy

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
American and we will get our fancy

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.070 
American and we will get our fancy
output<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:06.630> output<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:08.270> big<00:01:09.270> 11

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
output and that output is this big 11

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.010 
output and that output is this big 11
bit<00:01:10.320> fat<00:01:10.860> number<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:13.040> 2730<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.310> binary

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
bit fat number which is 2730 in binary

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.310 
bit fat number which is 2730 in binary
so<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.979> add<00:01:19.009> 2048<00:01:20.299> 512<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.290> 28<00:01:22.740> 30<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
so if we add 2048 512 one or 28 30 to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
so if we add 2048 512 one or 28 30 to
eight<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.530> two<00:01:26.159> together<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.799> 2730<00:01:29.600> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
eight and two together we got 2730 so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.130 
eight and two together we got 2730 so
yeah<00:01:32.000> if<00:01:33.000> you're<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.270> familiar<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.869> binary

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
yeah if you're not familiar with binary

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.039 
yeah if you're not familiar with binary
Google<00:01:34.560> Google<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.130> your<00:01:35.220> friend<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:36.380> yeah<00:01:37.380> so

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
Google Google is your friend and yeah so

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.069 
Google Google is your friend and yeah so
we<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.229> also<00:01:40.470> multiply<00:01:41.159> other<00:01:42.119> numbers<00:01:42.630> by

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
we can also multiply other numbers by

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
we can also multiply other numbers by
poking<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.799> fun<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.909> getting<00:01:45.149> random

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
poking this fun and I'm getting random

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.090 
poking this fun and I'm getting random
blacks<00:01:45.750> whites<00:01:45.960> winners<00:01:46.380> no<00:01:46.860> reason

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
blacks whites winners no reason

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.790 
blacks whites winners no reason
whatsoever<00:01:48.380> so

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
whatsoever so

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.190 
whatsoever so
let's<00:01:51.800> uh<00:01:52.040> let's<00:01:52.280> do<00:01:52.580> five<00:01:54.190> times<00:01:56.020> okay<00:01:57.020> I'd

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
let's uh let's do five times okay I'd

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.870 
let's uh let's do five times okay I'd
like<00:01:58.330> five<00:01:59.330> times<00:01:59.570> two<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:01.610> will<00:02:01.760> be

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
like five times two this will be

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.000 
like five times two this will be
insanely<00:02:02.390> hard<00:02:02.780> for<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.200> calculate<00:02:03.770> I

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
insanely hard for it to calculate I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.520 
insanely hard for it to calculate I
wonder<00:02:04.460> what<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.670> will<00:02:04.729> be<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:07.450> here<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.660> 10

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
wonder what it will be and here it is 10

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.010 
wonder what it will be and here it is 10
10<00:02:10.100> and<00:02:10.280> binary<00:02:10.780> 2<00:02:11.780> plus<00:02:12.080> 8<00:02:12.350> that's<00:02:12.680> 10<00:02:13.070> and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
10 and binary 2 plus 8 that's 10 and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.410 
10 and binary 2 plus 8 that's 10 and
yeah<00:02:15.020> it's<00:02:15.500> fancy<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:19.209> there's<00:02:20.209> not

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
yeah it's fancy like that so there's not

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.470 
yeah it's fancy like that so there's not
much<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.810> say<00:02:20.990> other<00:02:21.020> than<00:02:21.290> other<00:02:21.920> than<00:02:22.480> fancy

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
much to say other than other than fancy

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.050 
much to say other than other than fancy
multiplier<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:26.590> fancy<00:02:27.590> multiplier<00:02:27.980> now<00:02:28.640> I'll

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
multiplier so fancy multiplier now I'll

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.590 
multiplier so fancy multiplier now I'll
see<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.330> guys<00:02:29.390> next<00:02:29.480> time<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.200> goodbye<00:02:31.600> yeah
