00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
extension the trek clip into my head I'm

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.280 
extension the trek clip into my head I'm
going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> turn<00:01:46.229> around<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> see

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
going to turn around so you can see

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.469 
going to turn around so you can see
that's<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.649> looks<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.860> from<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> back

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
that's what it looks like from the back

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.550 
that's what it looks like from the back
next<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.079> I'm<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> make

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
next I'm going to do I'm going to make

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:05.170 
next I'm going to do I'm going to make
another<00:01:52.890> part<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:55.860> cover<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.460> trick

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.139 

so<00:02:05.690> now<00:02:05.840> our<00:02:05.870> real<00:02:06.260> hair<00:02:06.560> is<00:02:06.590> covering<00:02:07.370> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
so now our real hair is covering the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.639 
so now our real hair is covering the
trapline<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.960> going<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.170> turn<00:02:09.320> around<00:02:09.410> one

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
trapline is going to turn around one

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.900 
trapline is going to turn around one
more<00:02:09.710> time<00:02:09.830> hope<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.399> doesn't<00:02:10.520> look<00:02:10.700> too<00:02:10.880> bad

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
more time hope it doesn't look too bad

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.150
