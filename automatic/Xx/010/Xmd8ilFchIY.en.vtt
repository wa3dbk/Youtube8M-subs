and<00:01:05.370> that's<00:01:05.519> been<00:01:05.820> running<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.360> long<00:01:06.540> time<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.969 
choke run like that all day wire fell
off<00:01:42.720> put<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.880> caused<00:01:45.119> that

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
off put that back on what caused that

00:01:45.979 --> 00:02:32.440 
off put that back on what caused that
it's<00:01:46.979> only<00:01:47.130> been<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.880> year

quite<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> benefit<00:02:33.959> let's<00:02:34.200> see<00:02:34.469> it<00:02:34.620> seed<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.159> my

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
quite a benefit let's see it seed in my
