for that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.749 
for that
now<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> box<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.199> very<00:00:31.500> LG<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.309> basically

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
now the box is very LG it basically

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.479 
now the box is very LG it basically
screams<00:00:33.300> LG<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.410> similar<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> LG<00:00:35.280> g3

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
screams LG this is similar to the LG g3

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
screams LG this is similar to the LG g3
s<00:00:35.760> box<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.239> terms<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.690> dimensions<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> style

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
s box in terms of dimensions and style

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.819 
s box in terms of dimensions and style
so<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.000> IPS<00:00:39.480> quantum<00:00:39.930> display<00:00:40.230> here

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
so we have a IPS quantum display here

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
so we have a IPS quantum display here
and<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.340> slightly<00:00:41.730> curved<00:00:42.059> which

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and it's actually slightly curved which

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000 
and it's actually slightly curved which
is<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.050> quite<00:00:43.230> interesting<00:00:43.350> actually

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
is really quite interesting actually

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.709 
is really quite interesting actually
claims<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> best<00:00:45.149> displays<00:00:45.510> on

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
claims to be one the best displays on

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.319 
claims to be one the best displays on
the<00:00:45.840> market<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> Snapdragon<00:00:47.700> 808

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the market we have the Snapdragon 808

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
the market we have the Snapdragon 808
processor<00:00:48.629> which<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.890> interesting<00:00:50.129> choice

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
processor which is an interesting choice

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
processor which is an interesting choice
given<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> 810<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.750> already<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
given that the 810 is already out and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
given that the 810 is already out and
that<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> more<00:00:52.860> powerful<00:00:53.039> chip<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that is a more powerful chip but is to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.299 
that is a more powerful chip but is to
do<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.360> overheating<00:00:54.780> issues<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:56.250> do

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
do with overheating issues and they do

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.010 
do with overheating issues and they do
claim<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.910> extremely<00:00:57.420> well<00:00:57.570> optimized

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
claim to have extremely well optimized

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.200 
claim to have extremely well optimized
the<00:00:58.199> 808<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> run<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.850> smooth<00:01:00.059> as

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the 808 to make it run just as smooth as

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
the 808 to make it run just as smooth as
its<00:01:00.359> competitors<00:01:00.629> we'll<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:01.559> about<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
its competitors we'll see about that and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
its competitors we'll see about that and
then<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.940> LG's<00:01:03.329> camera<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
then we have LG's camera now this is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.859 
then we have LG's camera now this is
actually<00:01:04.519> claimed<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.880> basically<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
actually claimed to be basically a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
actually claimed to be basically a
professional<00:01:07.560> camera<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.909> big

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
professional camera and that's a big

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
professional camera and that's a big
claim<00:01:09.270> by<00:01:09.570> LG<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.860> they've<00:01:11.010> got

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
claim by LG but you know they've got

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.530 
claim by LG but you know they've got
plenty<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.520> support<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.119> they've<00:01:12.390> got

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
plenty of support for that they've got

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.170 
plenty of support for that they've got
an<00:01:12.630> F<00:01:12.780> 1.8<00:01:13.350> aperture<00:01:13.710> lens<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.790> really

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
an F 1.8 aperture lens so that's really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.340 
an F 1.8 aperture lens so that's really
really<00:01:15.360> great<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.780> terms<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> actual

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
really great in terms of actual

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
really great in terms of actual
specifications<00:01:17.040> let's<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
specifications let's see what it can

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630 
specifications let's see what it can
actually<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.560> also<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> 3000

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
actually do so we also have a 3000

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.210 
actually do so we also have a 3000
milliamp<00:01:20.850> hour<00:01:21.119> battery<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
milliamp hour battery here which is

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.530 
milliamp hour battery here which is
better<00:01:23.220> than<00:01:23.430> its<00:01:23.580> competitors<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.420> not

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
better than its competitors but not

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.140 
better than its competitors but not
exactly<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.350> Galaxy<00:01:25.860> Note<00:01:26.009> 4<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
exactly you know Galaxy Note 4 here so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
exactly you know Galaxy Note 4 here so
I've<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.360> booted<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> device<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> had<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I've just booted on the device and had a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.740 
I've just booted on the device and had a
little<00:01:29.400> play<00:01:29.549> with<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.390> really

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
little play with it it's really really

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
little play with it it's really really
quite<00:01:30.990> fast<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.590> does<00:01:31.770> feel<00:01:31.979> significantly

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
quite fast it does feel significantly

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
quite fast it does feel significantly
faster<00:01:32.820> than<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.299> LG<00:01:33.600> g3<00:01:33.810> which<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> probably

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
faster than the LG g3 which is probably

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.010 
faster than the LG g3 which is probably
due<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:36.150> RAM<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.600> faster

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
due to the more RAM that faster

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.050 
due to the more RAM that faster
processor<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.680> more<00:01:38.340> updated<00:01:38.640> operating

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
processor and more updated operating

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
processor and more updated operating
system<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.869> Android<00:01:40.140> 5.0<00:01:40.829> point<00:01:41.130> 1
