be<00:00:05.640> reviewing<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.330> network<00:00:06.690> chest<00:00:07.170> bod<00:00:07.470> this

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
be reviewing the network chest bod this

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.850 
be reviewing the network chest bod this
is<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> really<00:00:08.610> basic<00:00:08.849> mod<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.990> allows<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.710> to

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
is a really basic mod that allows you to

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.160 
is a really basic mod that allows you to
have<00:00:10.920> networked<00:00:11.460> chests<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.690> i<00:00:12.750> find<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.139> very

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
have networked chests and i find it very

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.950 
have networked chests and i find it very
interesting<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.429> let's<00:00:14.730> just<00:00:15.030> make<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.750> quick

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
interesting so let's just make a quick

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.040 
interesting so let's just make a quick
video<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:17.390> starting<00:00:18.390> on<00:00:18.480> our<00:00:18.630> volume<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
video on it starting on our volume a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.630 
video on it starting on our volume a
little<00:00:19.109> bit

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
little bit

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210 
little bit
so<00:00:21.640> basically<00:00:22.290> here's<00:00:23.290> your<00:00:23.440> network<00:00:23.830> chest

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
so basically here's your network chest

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.589 
so basically here's your network chest
you<00:00:24.790> have<00:00:24.820> this<00:00:25.330> here<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:27.119> when<00:00:28.119> he<00:00:28.180> plays<00:00:28.390> it

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
you have this here and when he plays it

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.570 
you have this here and when he plays it
you<00:00:28.840> could<00:00:28.990> see<00:00:29.020> entered<00:00:29.710> network<00:00:30.099> name<00:00:30.369> so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
you could see entered network name so

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.930 
you could see entered network name so
let's<00:00:30.730> name<00:00:31.090> this<00:00:31.210> network<00:00:31.599> Josh<00:00:32.380> and<00:00:32.940> then

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
let's name this network Josh and then

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.610 
let's name this network Josh and then
let's<00:00:34.239> head<00:00:34.480> all<00:00:34.630> the<00:00:34.660> way<00:00:34.840> over<00:00:35.200> here<00:00:35.230> unless

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
let's head all the way over here unless

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.830 
let's head all the way over here unless
place<00:00:35.950> this<00:00:36.070> again<00:00:36.370> and<00:00:36.580> let's<00:00:37.300> enter<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
place this again and let's enter the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.200 
place this again and let's enter the
network<00:00:37.989> Josh<00:00:38.500> now<00:00:39.309> if<00:00:39.370> we<00:00:39.430> place<00:00:39.640> an<00:00:39.790> item<00:00:39.970> in

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
network Josh now if we place an item in

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.080 
network Josh now if we place an item in
this<00:00:40.449> network<00:00:40.780> as<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:42.370> can<00:00:42.520> see<00:00:42.699> now<00:00:42.879> we<00:00:42.940> can

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
this network as you can see now we can

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.850 
this network as you can see now we can
head<00:00:43.210> over<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.510> here<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.170> they'll<00:00:44.710> be<00:00:44.830> a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
head over to here and they'll be a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.880 
head over to here and they'll be a
redstone<00:00:45.250> there<00:00:45.640> it's<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.180> very<00:00:46.510> basic<00:00:46.830> now<00:00:47.830> if

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
redstone there it's a very basic now if

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.979 
redstone there it's a very basic now if
we<00:00:48.040> go<00:00:48.070> into<00:00:48.370> here<00:00:48.879> to<00:00:49.059> craft<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.629> just<00:00:49.809> take

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
we go into here to craft you just take

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.229 
we go into here to craft you just take
that<00:00:50.019> place<00:00:50.949> you<00:00:51.070> like<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:51.400> you<00:00:51.970> see<00:00:52.120> there

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
that place you like that you see there

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.020 
that place you like that you see there
you<00:00:52.390> get<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.540> network<00:00:52.930> chest<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:54.730> how

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
you get a network chest and that's how

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.360 
you get a network chest and that's how
it<00:00:55.120> works<00:00:55.329> so<00:00:56.140> you<00:00:56.230> can<00:00:56.559> make<00:00:56.739> another<00:00:56.980> network

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
it works so you can make another network

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:06.440 
it works so you can make another network
j<00:00:57.579> cap<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:59.430> then<00:01:00.430> we<00:01:00.610> can<00:01:00.760> head<00:01:00.850> up<00:01:01.000> here<00:01:01.860> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.330 

again<00:01:07.450> network<00:01:07.869> here<00:01:08.340> j<00:01:09.340> cap<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:11.710> network<00:01:12.070> we

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
again network here j cap same network we

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.609 
again network here j cap same network we
can<00:01:12.490> place<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:12.970> their<00:01:13.180> head<00:01:14.140> back<00:01:14.410> all

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
can place that in their head back all

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
can place that in their head back all
the<00:01:14.979> way<00:01:15.100> over<00:01:15.369> here<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:19.440> there<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.590> your<00:01:20.740> stop

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the way over here and there is your stop

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.430 
the way over here and there is your stop
this<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.210> really<00:01:22.390> useful<00:01:22.660> if<00:01:22.960> you're<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.320> the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
this is really useful if you're in the

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.570 
this is really useful if you're in the
mine<00:01:23.649> shaft<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.130> have<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.250> whole<00:01:24.399> lot<00:01:24.549> of

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
mine shaft you have a whole lot of

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.120 
mine shaft you have a whole lot of
diamonds<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:25.840> need<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.140> get<00:01:26.290> back<00:01:26.500> home

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
diamonds and you need to get back home

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.399 
diamonds and you need to get back home
safely<00:01:27.670> just<00:01:28.540> place<00:01:28.750> your<00:01:28.900> stuff<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:29.350> a

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
safely just place your stuff in a

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.679 
safely just place your stuff in a
network<00:01:29.710> chess<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.430> wish<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.299> back<00:01:31.450> up

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
network chess and you wish it back up

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.570 
network chess and you wish it back up
you<00:01:32.350> can<00:01:32.500> see<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.770> does<00:01:32.920> not<00:01:33.070> have<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.400> new

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
you can see it does not have the new

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.600 
you can see it does not have the new
texture<00:01:34.210> new<00:01:35.140> terrain<00:01:35.409> like<00:01:35.680> it's<00:01:35.860> shorter

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
texture new terrain like it's shorter

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.410 
texture new terrain like it's shorter
the<00:01:36.880> chest<00:01:37.119> doesn't<00:01:37.299> open<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.650> it<00:01:38.890> has<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.159> old

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the chest doesn't open so it has the old

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.910 
the chest doesn't open so it has the old
texture<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.570> stuff<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:40.930> chess<00:01:41.170> that's

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
texture and stuff for chess that's

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.450 
texture and stuff for chess that's
pretty<00:01:42.130> much<00:01:42.250> all<00:01:42.520> this<00:01:42.790> mod<00:01:43.030> has<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.540> it<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
pretty much all this mod has in it and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.190 
pretty much all this mod has in it and
we<00:01:45.580> guys<00:01:45.729> I've<00:01:46.060> been<00:01:46.360> meaning<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.840> review<00:01:47.170> a

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
we guys I've been meaning to review a

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.260 
we guys I've been meaning to review a
larger<00:01:47.619> mod<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.130> just<00:01:48.700> haven't<00:01:48.909> been<00:01:49.000> feeling

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
larger mod I just haven't been feeling

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.410 
larger mod I just haven't been feeling
well<00:01:49.420> for<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.780> last<00:01:49.869> couple<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.200> days<00:01:50.439> so<00:01:50.860> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
well for the last couple of days so I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.490 
well for the last couple of days so I
needed<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.540> do<00:01:52.689> a<00:01:52.720> little<00:01:52.900> smaller<00:01:53.170> mods

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
needed to do a little smaller mods

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.200 
needed to do a little smaller mods
because<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:54.100> need<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.549> get<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.700> video<00:01:54.909> out<00:01:55.060> there

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
because I need to get a video out there

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.109 
because I need to get a video out there
but<00:01:55.750> also<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:59.130> obviously<00:02:00.130> don't<00:02:00.460> feel<00:02:00.700> well<00:02:00.880> and

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
but also I obviously don't feel well and

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.789 
but also I obviously don't feel well and
putting<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.869> video<00:02:02.079> out<00:02:02.110> there<00:02:02.229> what<00:02:02.530> up<00:02:02.619> and

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
putting a video out there what up and
