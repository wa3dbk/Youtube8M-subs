about the connection between diet and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.560 
about the connection between diet and
mental<00:00:32.040> health<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.060> there<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
mental health so is there really a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.760 
mental health so is there really a
connection<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.260> people<00:00:34.530> wouldn't

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
connection you know people wouldn't

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.290 
connection you know people wouldn't
think<00:00:34.830> so<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:35.940> very<00:00:36.150> often

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
think so I know it's not very often

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.850 
think so I know it's not very often
discussed<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.960> mean<00:00:37.080> they<00:00:37.170> would<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.680> about

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
discussed I mean they would think about

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.310 
discussed I mean they would think about
things<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.190> maybe<00:00:39.090> caffeine<00:00:39.630> all<00:00:39.930> right<00:00:40.080> Lex

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
things like maybe caffeine all right Lex

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
things like maybe caffeine all right Lex
their<00:00:40.590> mind<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.220> of<00:00:41.280> course<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:41.610> why

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
their mind and of course that's why

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.970 
their mind and of course that's why
people<00:00:41.970> consume<00:00:42.420> caffeine<00:00:42.630> is<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.770> it's

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
people consume caffeine is because it's

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.270 
people consume caffeine is because it's
one<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.130> the<00:00:44.280> last<00:00:44.460> legal<00:00:44.790> drugs<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:49.680> also<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
one of the last legal drugs and also the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.240 
one of the last legal drugs and also the
connection<00:00:50.790> with<00:00:50.880> alcohol<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.260> food<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
connection with alcohol but the food is

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.540 
connection with alcohol but the food is
I<00:00:53.400> mean<00:00:53.660> in<00:00:54.740> the<00:00:55.740> number<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.070> people's<00:00:56.340> lives

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
I mean in the number of people's lives

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.120 
I mean in the number of people's lives
in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.810> sheer<00:00:58.050> bulk<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
in the just the sheer bulk of what you

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.950 
in the just the sheer bulk of what you
eat<00:00:59.280> compared<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.790> say<00:00:59.910> caffeine<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.630> alcohol

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
eat compared to say caffeine or alcohol

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.980 
eat compared to say caffeine or alcohol
the<00:01:01.710> food<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.040> huge<00:01:02.490> and<00:01:03.060> so<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.630> did<00:01:03.810> have

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
the food is huge and so if it did have

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.840 
the food is huge and so if it did have
an<00:01:04.080> effect<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.890> tremendous<00:01:05.460> right

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
an effect it could be tremendous right

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910 
an effect it could be tremendous right
and<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.300> I<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> tremendous

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and actually I know it is a tremendous

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.040 
and actually I know it is a tremendous
effect<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:08.970> worldwide<00:01:09.570> when<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.900> look

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
effect we we see worldwide when we look

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.480 
effect we we see worldwide when we look
at<00:01:10.140> various<00:01:10.440> populations<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.130> people<00:01:11.370> we<00:01:11.460> see

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
at various populations of people we see

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000 
at various populations of people we see
a<00:01:11.640> direct<00:01:11.910> correlation<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.570> depression<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a direct correlation with depression and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.400 
a direct correlation with depression and
schizophrenia<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> eating<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> Western

have<00:01:24.450> been<00:01:24.510> you<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.930> there's<00:01:25.409> been<00:01:25.500> research

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
have been you know there's been research

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.399 
have been you know there's been research
done<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.370> over<00:01:26.610> 50<00:01:27.030> years<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.960> connection

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
done for over 50 years on the connection

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.469 
done for over 50 years on the connection
between<00:01:28.440> what<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.520> eat<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.970> depression<00:01:30.450> for

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
between what we eat and depression for

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
between what we eat and depression for
example<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.080> mean<00:01:31.320> let<00:01:31.500> me<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.620> give<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
example I mean let me just give you a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.350 
example I mean let me just give you a
little<00:01:32.070> background<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.790> how<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.000> works

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
little background on how that works

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.350 
little background on how that works
there<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.890> call<00:01:35.360> neurotransmitters

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
there are what we call neurotransmitters

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.260 
there are what we call neurotransmitters
chemicals<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> brain<00:01:37.470> right<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.580> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
chemicals in the brain right and the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
chemicals in the brain right and the
proportions<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.560> amount<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:40.950> these

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
proportions the amount of these

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.040 
proportions the amount of these
neurotransmitters<00:01:41.750> transmitters<00:01:42.750> depends

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
neurotransmitters transmitters depends

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.070 
neurotransmitters transmitters depends
upon<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.950> eat<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:45.210> people<00:01:45.990> have

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
upon what you eat and people have

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.840 
upon what you eat and people have
probably<00:01:46.229> heard<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.159> amino<00:01:47.460> acid

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
probably heard about the amino acid

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
probably heard about the amino acid
tryptophan<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:49.229> okay.thank<00:01:49.799> they're<00:01:49.920> used

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
tryptophan right okay.thank they're used

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
tryptophan right okay.thank they're used
to<00:01:50.159> sell<00:01:50.340> triple<00:01:50.670> things<00:01:50.880> yeah<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:51.840> are

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to sell triple things yeah these are

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
to sell triple things yeah these are
talking<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.260> in<00:01:52.409> terms<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.650> Turkey<00:01:52.890> but

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
talking about in terms of Turkey but

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.530 
talking about in terms of Turkey but
that's<00:01:53.190> that's<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> incorrect<00:01:54.030> message<00:01:54.360> but

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that's that's the incorrect message but

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.010 
that's that's the incorrect message but
they<00:01:54.600> used<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> sell<00:01:55.049> them<00:01:56.360> well<00:01:57.360> I'll<00:01:57.840> tell

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
they used to sell them well I'll tell

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420 
they used to sell them well I'll tell
you<00:01:58.110> what<00:01:58.260> they<00:01:58.500> used<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.710> sell<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.159> pills

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
you what they used to sell it as pills

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.430 
you what they used to sell it as pills
so<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.640> trip<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.360> tryptophan<00:02:00.900> gets<00:02:01.170> into<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
so you trip the tryptophan gets into the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.500 
so you trip the tryptophan gets into the
body<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.830> gets<00:02:01.979> into<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> nervous<00:02:02.850> system<00:02:03.330> and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
body it gets into the nervous system and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.960 
body it gets into the nervous system and
it<00:02:03.810> makes<00:02:03.990> serotonin<00:02:04.619> serotonin<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
it makes serotonin serotonin kind of

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.760 
it makes serotonin serotonin kind of
quiets<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.750> whole<00:02:06.900> world<00:02:07.170> around<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.650> so

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
quiets the whole world around you so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.800 
quiets the whole world around you so
everything's<00:02:08.069> not<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.399> exciting<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.450> relieves

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
everything's not so exciting it relieves

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.110 
everything's not so exciting it relieves
depression<00:02:09.899> well<00:02:10.529> in<00:02:10.679> each<00:02:10.799> hunger<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.939> very

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
depression well in each hunger it's very

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.250 
depression well in each hunger it's very

well<00:02:13.769> here's<00:02:14.010> where<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.489> connection<00:02:14.879> comes

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
well here's where the connection comes

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.170 
well here's where the connection comes
to<00:02:15.959> get<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.440> tryptophane<00:02:17.430> pass<00:02:17.819> what<00:02:18.090> we

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
to get that tryptophane pass what we

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.899 
to get that tryptophane pass what we
call<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.510> blood-brain<00:02:19.019> barrier<00:02:19.049> blood<00:02:19.920> brain

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
call the blood-brain barrier blood brain

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.240 
call the blood-brain barrier blood brain
and<00:02:21.269> get<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.599> past<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.049> this<00:02:22.379> membrane<00:02:22.830> but

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and get it past this this membrane but

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
and get it past this this membrane but
it<00:02:23.340> has<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.580> go<00:02:23.700> through<00:02:23.849> little<00:02:24.000> gates<00:02:24.360> with

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
it has to go through little gates with

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.240 
it has to go through little gates with
them<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.230> those<00:02:25.379> little<00:02:25.530> gates<00:02:25.950> they're

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
them and those little gates they're

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.180 
them and those little gates they're
occupied<00:02:26.790> by<00:02:27.120> other<00:02:27.330> heavy<00:02:28.230> neutral<00:02:28.980> amino

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
occupied by other heavy neutral amino

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.940 
occupied by other heavy neutral amino
acids<00:02:29.819> okay<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:30.959> tryptophan<00:02:31.440> has<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.860> in

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
acids okay so tryptophan has to get in

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.500 
acids okay so tryptophan has to get in
the<00:02:32.040> gate<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.519> through<00:02:32.790> into<00:02:33.090> into<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the gate to get through into into the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.170 
the gate to get through into into the
nervous<00:02:34.379> system<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.280> if<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.519> eat<00:02:35.700> animal

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
nervous system well if you eat animal

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.789 
nervous system well if you eat animal
foods<00:02:36.360> I'm<00:02:36.720> talking<00:02:37.049> about<00:02:37.170> beef<00:02:37.410> chicken

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
foods I'm talking about beef chicken

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.759 
foods I'm talking about beef chicken
fish<00:02:38.250> dairy<00:02:39.150> products<00:02:39.599> they<00:02:40.019> occupy<00:02:40.530> all<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
fish dairy products they occupy all the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.470 
fish dairy products they occupy all the
little<00:02:40.950> gates<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.489> now<00:02:41.879> your<00:02:42.030> tryptophan

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
little gates and now your tryptophan

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.089 
little gates and now your tryptophan
can't<00:02:42.720> get<00:02:42.870> through<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.379> now<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.650> can't<00:02:43.980> make

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
can't get through and now you can't make

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.530 
can't get through and now you can't make
the<00:02:44.250> serotonin<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:44.909> result<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.420> get

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
the serotonin as a result you get

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
the serotonin as a result you get
depressed<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.129> components<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.819> food

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
depressed so the components of the food

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.089 
depressed so the components of the food
make<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> huge<00:02:48.540> difference<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:49.920> that

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
make a huge difference in and just that

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.650 
make a huge difference in and just that
you<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> basics<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.180> there's<00:02:51.359> another

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you know the basics but there's another

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.270 
you know the basics but there's another
mechanism<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.410> too

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
mechanism here too

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.039 
mechanism here too
it<00:02:53.579> has<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.030> schizophrenia<00:02:54.420> and

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
it has to do with schizophrenia and

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.619 
it has to do with schizophrenia and
autism<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.910> kind<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.269> an<00:02:57.390> allergic

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
autism and it's a kind of an allergic

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.099 
autism and it's a kind of an allergic
phenomena<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.650> people<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.099> described<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.790> as

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
phenomena or people have described it as

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.809 
phenomena or people have described it as
almost<00:03:01.109> a<00:03:01.410> psychedelic<00:03:01.829> type<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.430> react<00:03:02.700> you

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
almost a psychedelic type of react you

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.759 
almost a psychedelic type of react you
know<00:03:02.910> when<00:03:03.420> people<00:03:03.540> take<00:03:03.810> magic<00:03:04.290> mushrooms

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
know when people take magic mushrooms

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.490 
know when people take magic mushrooms
and<00:03:05.040> now<00:03:05.540> they<00:03:06.540> know<00:03:06.660> these<00:03:06.840> chemicals<00:03:07.319> get

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and now they know these chemicals get

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.930 
and now they know these chemicals get
into<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.769> brain<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.250> they<00:03:08.340> they<00:03:08.700> could<00:03:08.879> they

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
into the brain and they they could they

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.460 
into the brain and they they could they
stimulate<00:03:09.420> things<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.900> they<00:03:09.959> cause<00:03:10.140> people

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
stimulate things and they cause people

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.300 
stimulate things and they cause people
have<00:03:10.650> really<00:03:12.290> changed<00:03:13.290> perceptions<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
have really changed perceptions so a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.059 
have really changed perceptions so a
really<00:03:14.549> bizarre<00:03:14.790> bizarre<00:03:15.660> thinking<00:03:16.079> well<00:03:16.650> the

really bizarre bizarre thinking well the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.000 
really bizarre bizarre thinking well the
food<00:03:17.459> proteins<00:03:18.329> do<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.840> too<00:03:19.139> okay

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
food proteins do that too okay

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.339 
food proteins do that too okay
particularly<00:03:20.940> food<00:03:21.450> proteins<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.109> ones<00:03:22.260> that

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
particularly food proteins the ones that

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.949 
particularly food proteins the ones that
have<00:03:22.440> been<00:03:22.560> identified<00:03:22.709> are<00:03:23.220> those<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.959> milk

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
have been identified are those in milk

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.190 
have been identified are those in milk
returnable<00:03:25.680> cheese<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.579> also<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.359> a<00:03:27.599> group<00:03:28.049> of

returnable cheese and also in a group of
plant<00:03:28.410> foods<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.250> identify<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.150> gluten

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
plant foods that we identify as gluten

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.539 
plant foods that we identify as gluten
as<00:03:31.049> high<00:03:31.319> in<00:03:31.500> gluten<00:03:31.739> which<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.099> an<00:03:32.220> amino<00:03:32.400> acid

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
as high in gluten which is an amino acid

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.819 
as high in gluten which is an amino acid
high<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.090> gluten<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:33.720> those<00:03:33.900> would<00:03:33.989> be<00:03:34.049> wheat

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
high in gluten and those would be wheat

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.670 
high in gluten and those would be wheat
barley<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.609> rye<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> what<00:03:37.049> happens<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
barley and rye so what happens is the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.259 
barley and rye so what happens is the
gluten<00:03:38.010> protein<00:03:38.459> from<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.669> wheat<00:03:38.849> barley<00:03:39.030> and

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
rye and/or the casein protein from milk

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.349 
rye and/or the casein protein from milk

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
gets into the nervous system and it acts

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.470 
gets into the nervous system and it acts
like<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.630> drug<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.680> acts<00:03:46.889> like<00:03:47.010> LSD<00:03:47.760> or<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.359> know

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
like a drug it acts like LSD or you know

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
distortion of the environment so much so

that<00:04:10.590> it's<00:04:11.190> not<00:04:11.459> subtle<00:04:11.819> to<00:04:12.060> those<00:04:12.209> around<00:04:12.510> you

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
that it's not subtle to those around you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.750 
that it's not subtle to those around you
and<00:04:12.989> for<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.349> dealing<00:04:13.680> with<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.919> world<00:04:14.099> but

you<00:04:15.120> get<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.510> distortion<00:04:16.440> because<00:04:17.099> of<00:04:17.130> these

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
you get this distortion because of these

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.300 
you get this distortion because of these

you know these people have suffers

you know these people have suffers
terribly<00:04:44.870> from<00:04:45.950> eating<00:04:46.950> certain<00:04:47.220> kinds<00:04:47.340> of

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
foods and the nice thing is is you know

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.970 
foods and the nice thing is is you know
people<00:04:51.120> have<00:04:51.210> discovered<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.170> it's<00:04:52.830> not

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
people have discovered this and it's not

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.160 
people have discovered this and it's not
it's<00:04:53.250> not<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.460> well<00:04:54.180> known<00:04:54.390> message<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.020> have

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
it's not a well known message and I have

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.050 
it's not a well known message and I have
to<00:04:55.320> be<00:04:55.500> very<00:04:55.710> blunt<00:04:56.280> as<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.580> why<00:04:56.700> it's<00:04:56.850> why<00:04:57.000> I'm

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
to be very blunt as to why it's why I'm

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.670 
to be very blunt as to why it's why I'm
not<00:04:57.210> well-known<00:04:57.450> is<00:04:57.840> because<00:04:58.440> there's<00:04:58.620> no

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
not well-known is because there's no

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.830 
not well-known is because there's no
profit<00:04:58.980> behind<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.580> so<00:05:00.330> you've<00:05:00.420> got<00:05:00.540> all<00:05:00.570> these

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
profit behind it so you've got all these

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.480 
profit behind it so you've got all these
drug<00:05:01.080> companies<00:05:01.260> out<00:05:01.590> there<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.800> sell<00:05:02.130> drugs

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
other mental problems can be had and I

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.980 
other mental problems can be had and I
believe<00:05:29.610> by<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.790> vast<00:05:30.210> majority<00:05:30.450> of<00:05:30.840> people

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
believe by the vast majority of people

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.920 
believe by the vast majority of people
if<00:05:31.350> they<00:05:31.800> die<00:05:32.040> this<00:05:32.340> nugget<00:05:32.730> of<00:05:32.940> knowledge<00:05:33.480> and

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
if they die this nugget of knowledge and

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.350 
if they die this nugget of knowledge and
so<00:05:34.590> you<00:05:34.800> know<00:05:34.890> that<00:05:35.130> they<00:05:35.340> don't<00:05:35.550> eat<00:05:35.790> the<00:05:36.000> the

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
so you know that they don't eat the the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.000 
so you know that they don't eat the the
animal<00:05:36.660> foods<00:05:36.990> and<00:05:37.260> they<00:05:37.350> don't<00:05:37.560> eat<00:05:37.770> the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
animal foods and they don't eat the
