00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.120
 my ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.350
 welcome here at woodworks tv if 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.450
 it's about the beautiful craftsmanship 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.040
 design your furniture should go 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.510
 think about the edges 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.850
 if they pay attention 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.200
 industrially manufactured furniture is today 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.190
 almost always at the edges with one 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.169
 provided rounding 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.580
 so if you bundle with one 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.080
 make it round 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.190
 actually in common with industrial 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.930
 manufactured furniture 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.270
 that does not have to be another 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.470
 possibility is a ridge as a father 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.350
 to design 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.660
 a phase is nothing else than im 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.200
 area between this main area and 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.140
 the narrow surface is a 45 degree surface 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.490
 to bring this is the phase in the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.190
 usually she is such a two millimeter 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.110
 wide object is that you with it 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.690
 want to get on their own 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.370
 personal taste now how bring 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.530
 I have such a phase to different 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.059
 possibilities 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.250
 Variant one is I grab as in the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.490
 surface to my sanding block and 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.950
 try a clean phase here 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.509
 to grind on 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.490
 but there are the following problem and 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.469
 I therefore do not recommend this 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.810
 kock material is soft with that it is 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.289
 optimal for surface treatment 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.990
 suitable but in the edge it can be 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.579
 Pressing it can push it around 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.939
 Because I have a very high pressure on one 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.280
 then apply a small area so then one 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.880
 yes not cleanly defined phase 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.679
 created 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.299
 and there's a better one 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.119
 variant sanding block as such 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.219
 namely a piece of hardwood that 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.920
 here is a piece of beech that I already have 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.829
 for 15 20 years for this purpose in the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.810
 I have a very easy book here 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.999
 with a flat surface and 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.429
 accordingly hard so it does not work 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.259
 a press can 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.439
 I believe and then loop here 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.130
 the phase clean I pay attention to mine 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.679
 hand angle 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.889
 that's a bit of a joke and me 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.119
 Make sure that I have the number of mine 

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:09.670
 nice count 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.280
 this number I notice myself and at the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.450
 opposite knew so here 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.520
 then I put the same number of 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.890
 this side of 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.569
 thereby ensuring that the two 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.670
 I live here in the same way 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.379
 are big and through the hard area 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.760
 here in the underground I have one too 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.549
 clearly defined 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.879
 this is a viable way of the royal route 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.010
 on the other hand, this is the planing of phases 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.870
 This is very easy with a small plane 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.969
 good it is synonymous with a sharp pass 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.730
 planer very well and here I go 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:44.510
 actually quite similar before I test 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.450
 Immediately my planer in relation to the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.500
 saving measure 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.459
 there is something down well but 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.750
 not too much 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.780
 they also have to be a bit on it 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.439
 Make sure you do not break out here 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.450
 So they produce a bit too 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:03.189
 fiber direction in view but then have 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.859
 that should not be a problem 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.510
 and I go, I now here by 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:32.569
 sweep over this corner and so on 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:34.819
 phase create so that was now ten 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.010
 I still have a relative here 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.359
 I like it 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.040
 would have the rudeln this place still 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.109
 then you can adjust a bit more 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.180
 maybe we would have needed 06 over 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.060
 but that's the way it's done 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:54.290
 10 about this number I notice turning 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:56.900
 a workpiece and he drives now 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.040
 this also represents a phase with mine 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.659
 corresponding 10 lie 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.699
 I say goodbye to me 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:05.349
 put this and say to the next 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.349
