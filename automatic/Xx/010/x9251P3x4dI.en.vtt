00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.219
 excited about this video since I have not 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.400
 seen that nobody has all climbed all 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.900

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.430
 I'll upload guess if I feel 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.009
 pressed a lot I'll upload all of the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.770
 pull is the safest happens because 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.660
 there is a lot of work to render the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.920
 comment them and so on etcetera that 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.769
 I am simply teaching the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.379
 positions do not pay much attention to my voice 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.300
 you can the video every time 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.250
 that comes out of the ass what to go 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.589
 I will quietly teach the 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.170
 positions of the dolls this is the 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:55.750
 part of the barn I will put very very 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.300
 very slow so that nobody has problems 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.690
 I have to say I'm going to say the data 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.979
 unstable there is exactly exactly if 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 bad I do not remember 22 23 minikit and 22 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.650
 dolls worth in stables and 22 doll 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.020
 This does not mean that those who are 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.960
 stables you must count 22 dolls he 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.720
 as you should count then one two 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.580
 three times as many times as you give to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.900
 dolls is worth the times that is up 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:29.590
 there is a doll looks inside 1 2 3 4 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.370
 and 5 ok I think it's easy like this with 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.140
 all posts 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.910
 these are all the locations and 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.170
 you see how about the advantages how 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.870
 returns prodigy placed there the boots was 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.090
 the truth a joy that we carry 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.740
 looking for a long time here we are in 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.500
 the serious camera I think was here 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.130
 in the chucha in the candy store the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.700
 rock or in the area of ​​the rock or the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.190
 judged are in the store are 20 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.560
 little dolls you have to tell is worth 20 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.920
 Here puppet shows it slowly for 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.500
 let everyone see how it is done where 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.119
 they are positioning the dolls and good 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.979
 this was the round I'm going to teach the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.260
 round that came out ready 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.519
 We were quite time I had already 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.349
 eight failed attempts yes eight this was 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.180
 the ninth so imagine how is 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.659
 go desperate for the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.549
 point and three of the points that are is 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.160
 now it is simply to make it rite 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.019
 feng quietly with patience one day 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.209
 of this and already open the box a day of 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.060
 these against activity that samuel will 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.120
 come out the little blue eyes 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.819
 as I say 2020 in sweets shop 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.880
 22 in stable is worth the other thing that I have to 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.700
 to say is that after this step you 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.190
 You're sad because you know that zombies 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.200
 they are finished 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.120
 As it is good, I have already seen the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 recordings of maside rest of in the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.370
 final video and the truth is that it gives 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.190
 very sorry here in witches house 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.690
 I recommend that someone here who 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.010
 really really really have 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.439
 maximum precision 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.620
 and the street because they are 23 and I would say that 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.380
 is the most difficult area since there are 34 that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.260
 they are not visible 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.090
 in 23 you have to give I'm worth 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.330
 explaining what was going on the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.880
 pot this is the end of zombies no longer 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.980
 there are more zombies with these 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.390
 characters unless it attracts you 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.180
 go the pot but have hinted 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.760
 with the latest rite recordings 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.980
 and maximum that there will be no more zombies 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.950
 is here this chapter is already 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.290
 finished in the ecce room I 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.360
 I thought I would as I said it is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.400
 a triangle in the three heads 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.830
 I thought I was going to leave 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.420
 a pyre lt pyramid in the center 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.760
 or that the land was going to recover from 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.500
 the rockets of the world it turns out that this 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.820
 parallel universe that has nothing that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.770
 see is a striped I know it has nothing 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.820
 that see this universe with the universe in 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.700
 the one that most and toffee destroyed the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.370
 land here in this universe more and 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.930
 simply takes over the world if the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.410
 four you have all the history of 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.780
 maximum seize of the world seize 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.570
 save your daughter and destroy the world 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.570
 the whole earth destroys everything with the 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.280
 belt from the ether and good he saves 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.770
 and her daughter this is the lounge 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.940
 here is 19 the truth that is also 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.640
 difficult here 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.190
 and good as I was saying rite fence 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.100
 also seizes the ether god 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.300
 from the earth what would be a god can 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.310
 control all the bodies they 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.170
 get out of the ass and get into precisely 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.880
 the disarmament that's why you're going to mel 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.590
 You have seen some videos that shine 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.360
 the eyes like the zombies because the 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.760
 rest was found the wings all the 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.650
 zombies and also controls the earth and 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.360
 all the bodies that are in it and all 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.879
 the energy 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.650
 and not kill them from the earth anymore is 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.319
 possible more if we would say that it is the most 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.629
 bad although people always thought 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.990
 was the kinder of the two are bad 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.580
 but he was the one who was the most good 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.960
 has discovered practically I would say 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.879
 not because if you load the land and the 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.520
 universe I would say is not the good 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.189
 christophe on the other hand although the most 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.009
 bad in plan of the downtown magician the one 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:21.740
 controls everyone who saves the earth by 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.770
 so to say it does not destroy it simply 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.379
 he remains like a god he has been looking for 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.419
 time as you are seeing here the 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.729
 mutual joy 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.460
 the four doing crazy one pass 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.940
 the truth 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.120
 and good what I was saying that is worth 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.849
 expensive with the radio forgive me does not pass 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.250
 nothing but that is not heard much here 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.599
 it simply already teaches what the 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.370
 screams and then he taught a couple of 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.830
 silly stuff 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.960
 and well I think I have nothing else 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.460
 to say just thank all my 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.889
 subscribers that you followed me that 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.979
 you hope that it would bother me

 one kidney, practically one kidney 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.680
 but you can not imagine I think this 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.720
 It's a special Milan that's not a big deal 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.970
 you will say but it is that your face teaches us not 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.250
