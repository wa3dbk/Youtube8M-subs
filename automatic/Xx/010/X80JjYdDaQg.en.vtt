durability<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.140> these<00:00:19.410> pedals<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.039> pretty

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
durability of these pedals are pretty

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.390 
durability of these pedals are pretty
good<00:00:20.580> after<00:00:20.910> say<00:00:21.119> I've<00:00:21.810> had<00:00:22.350> them<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.250> them

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
good after say I've had them I have them

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.990 
good after say I've had them I have them
for<00:00:23.640> six<00:00:23.970> months<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.800> overall<00:00:26.000> barely

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
for six months and overall barely

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.599 
for six months and overall barely
anywhere<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> pins<00:00:28.099> except<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> side

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
anywhere on the pins except on the side

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.660 
anywhere on the pins except on the side
that's<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.720> right<00:00:30.929> side<00:00:34.309> this<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.370> my<00:00:35.550> left

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that's my right side this is my left

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.590 
that's my right side this is my left
side<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:38.809> have<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.110> say<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.460> last<00:00:41.670> quite<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
side I have to say they do last quite a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.290 
side I have to say they do last quite a
long<00:00:42.719> time<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:44.370> depends<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> kind

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
long time but really depends on the kind

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.350 
long time but really depends on the kind
of<00:00:45.360> rider<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.520> because<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.120> do

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
of rider you are because if you like do

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
of rider you are because if you like do
grinds<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> put<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:49.230> pedal<00:00:49.500> down<00:00:49.649> along

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
grinds and put your pedal down along

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
grinds and put your pedal down along
obviously<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.480> pins<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> wear

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
obviously the pins are going to wear

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.060 
obviously the pins are going to wear
down<00:00:52.949> pretty<00:00:53.250> fast<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.680> haven't<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.860> many

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
down pretty fast and haven't so many

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.360 
down pretty fast and haven't so many
people<00:00:57.030> who<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.859> recommend

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
people who do that so I do recommend

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.470 
people who do that so I do recommend
these<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.410> put<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.949> don't<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.340> your

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
these if you put if you don't put your

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.759 
these if you put if you don't put your
foot<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> do<00:01:04.170> grinds<00:01:04.559> but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
foot down when you do grinds but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.710 
foot down when you do grinds but
otherwise<00:01:05.369> they're<00:01:05.729> super<00:01:06.210> great<00:01:06.450> pedals<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
otherwise they're super great pedals the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
otherwise they're super great pedals the
grip<00:01:09.930> enos<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.470> these<00:01:10.619> pedals<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.189> amazing<00:01:11.820> op

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
grip enos of these pedals are amazing op

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.330 
grip enos of these pedals are amazing op
the<00:01:12.119> same<00:01:12.330> I've<00:01:13.080> only<00:01:13.320> gotten<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:14.010> shiners

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the same I've only gotten two shiners

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420 
the same I've only gotten two shiners
and<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.470> pedals<00:01:17.040> were<00:01:17.220> wet

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and that was because my pedals were wet

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.050 
and that was because my pedals were wet
so<00:01:18.020> usually<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> pedals<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.710> wet<00:01:20.060> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
so usually if the pedals are wet you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.929 
so usually if the pedals are wet you
will<00:01:21.210> end<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.689> slipping<00:01:21.960> off<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.939> otherwise

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
will end up slipping off but otherwise

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.380 
will end up slipping off but otherwise
there<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:24.930> great<00:01:25.320> pedals<00:01:28.640> so<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> only<00:01:30.000> flaw

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
there are great pedals so the only flaw

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.490 
there are great pedals so the only flaw
about<00:01:30.420> these<00:01:31.610> pedals<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.110> lots<00:01:34.350> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
about these pedals are if you do lots of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.100 
about these pedals are if you do lots of
grinds<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.640> said<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.479> pull<00:01:36.659> your<00:01:36.810> pedal

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
grinds as I said and you pull your pedal

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.730 
grinds as I said and you pull your pedal
down<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.740> wear<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:37.979> superfast<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.740> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
down they do wear out superfast and the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.950 
down they do wear out superfast and the
pros<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.700> pedals<00:01:42.090> are<00:01:42.240> they've<00:01:42.659> never

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
pros of these pedals are they've never

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.219 
pros of these pedals are they've never
snapped<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.619> me<00:01:43.770> whatsoever<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:45.229> that's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
snapped on me whatsoever and that's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
snapped on me whatsoever and that's
because<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.100> don't<00:01:47.310> pull<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:47.610> foot<00:01:48.060> down<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
because I don't pull my foot down when I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.590 
because I don't pull my foot down when I
do<00:01:48.600> grinds<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:50.189> lasts<00:01:50.399> way<00:01:50.759> longer<00:01:50.790> ones<00:01:51.390> if

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
do grinds the lasts way longer ones if

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.690 
do grinds the lasts way longer ones if
you<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
you don't do that

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.080 
you don't do that
they<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:53.970> grippy<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.170> feet<00:01:55.380> are<00:01:55.409> dry

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
they are grippy when your feet are dry

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
they are grippy when your feet are dry
also<00:01:57.090> they're<00:01:57.719> super<00:01:58.079> grippy<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.680> have

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
also they're super grippy if you have

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.359 
also they're super grippy if you have
like<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> waffle<00:01:59.820> design<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.719> your<00:02:01.560> pedal<00:02:02.009> on

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
like a waffle design on your pedal on

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.600 
like a waffle design on your pedal on
your<00:02:02.520> shoes<00:02:03.259> helps<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> lot<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.189> grip

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
your shoes helps out a lot with the grip

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.010 
your shoes helps out a lot with the grip
and<00:02:06.770> yeah<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.280> give<00:02:08.580> these<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.060> 9<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.750> 10

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
and yeah so I give these a 9 out of 10

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.400 
and yeah so I give these a 9 out of 10
they<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.009> grippy<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:12.030> are<00:02:12.090> really<00:02:12.569> durable

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
they are grippy they are really durable

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.990 
they are grippy they are really durable
and<00:02:14.190> also<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.000> actually<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.540> grinds

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and also if if you actually do grinds

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.310 
and also if if you actually do grinds
grind<00:02:18.000> put<00:02:18.330> your<00:02:18.480> pedal<00:02:18.720> down<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.080> one<00:02:19.290> side

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
grind put your pedal down on one side

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.850 
grind put your pedal down on one side
and<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:21.510> that's<00:02:21.690> why<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.900> will<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.230> stay<00:02:22.530> fresh

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
and so that's why I will like stay fresh

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.830
