joints<00:00:45.120> warmed<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> barbell

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
joints warmed up and if I use a barbell

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
joints warmed up and if I use a barbell
sometimes<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> activates<00:00:47.760> too<00:00:47.969> much<00:00:48.149> shoulder

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
sometimes it activates too much shoulder

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360 
sometimes it activates too much shoulder
I<00:00:48.840> want<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> avoid<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.770> shoulders<00:00:50.160> being

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
injured and I want to focus on the arms

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.490

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so I find bicep curls standing isolate

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
so I find bicep curls standing isolate
really<00:00:55.890> well<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.550> we're<00:00:56.699> gonna<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.149> we're

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
going to do warm up at about a forty

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.040 
going to do warm up at about a forty
percent<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.850> maximum<00:01:00.000> weight<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.930> then

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
percent of your maximum weight and then

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.779 
percent of your maximum weight and then
we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> move<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.770> twelve<00:01:02.579> reps

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
we're going to move into twelve reps

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.429 
we're going to move into twelve reps
each<00:01:03.000> arm<00:01:03.390> we're<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> make<00:01:04.170> sure<00:01:04.320> we

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
each arm we're going to make sure we

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
each arm we're going to make sure we
lift<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.949> way<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.580> tracting<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
lift it all the way up and tracting the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
lift it all the way up and tracting the
bicep<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.689> squeezing<00:01:07.320> focusing<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.130> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
bicep and squeezing focusing on that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
bicep and squeezing focusing on that
peak<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.060> bringing<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
peak and then bringing it down to the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
peak and then bringing it down to the
side<00:01:10.320> before<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.130> other<00:01:11.310> arm<00:01:11.549> lifts<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.450> we

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
side before the other arm lifts so we

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
side before the other arm lifts so we
have<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.869> make<00:01:13.020> sure<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> there's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.890> steady

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
have to make sure that there's a steady

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
have to make sure that there's a steady
momentum<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:15.869> start<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.380> move<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
momentum because if we start to move the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.640 
momentum because if we start to move the
dumbbell<00:01:17.340> too<00:01:18.119> quickly<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:19.020> gonna<00:01:19.140> use<00:01:19.409> too

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
dumbbell too quickly we're gonna use too

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.160 
dumbbell too quickly we're gonna use too
much<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> our<00:01:20.040> bodies<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.840> our<00:01:22.020> other

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
much of our bodies and and and our other

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.999 
much of our bodies and and and our other
muscles<00:01:22.650> around<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.189> bicep<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.860> are

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
muscles around the bicep so here we are

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.800 
muscles around the bicep so here we are
exercise<00:01:26.670> number<00:01:26.820> two<00:01:27.150> barbell<00:01:27.869> bicep

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.840 

now<00:01:33.590> we're<00:01:33.710> gonna<00:01:33.830> stand<00:01:34.100> up<00:01:34.250> on<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:34.490> one<00:01:34.670> and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
now we're gonna stand up on this one and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.460 
now we're gonna stand up on this one and
we're<00:01:34.940> gonna<00:01:35.030> make<00:01:35.270> sure<00:01:35.330> we<00:01:35.840> use<00:01:35.869> both<00:01:36.229> hands

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
we're gonna make sure we use both hands

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.380 
we're gonna make sure we use both hands
to<00:01:36.590> bring<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.860> bar<00:01:37.010> all<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.280> way<00:01:37.490> up<00:01:37.670> allowing

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
to bring the bar all the way up allowing

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.390 
to bring the bar all the way up allowing
the<00:01:38.600> elbows<00:01:38.930> slightly<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.680> come<00:01:39.830> forward<00:01:40.250> and

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
the elbows slightly to come forward and

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.609 
the elbows slightly to come forward and
get<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.970> maximum<00:01:41.479> peak<00:01:41.690> now<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.350> course<00:01:42.470> we're

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
get a maximum peak now of course we're

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.140 
get a maximum peak now of course we're
using<00:01:42.650> two<00:01:42.979> arms<00:01:43.310> we're<00:01:43.490> gonna<00:01:43.580> have<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.850> lot

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
using two arms we're gonna have a lot

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.120 
using two arms we're gonna have a lot
more<00:01:44.180> concentration<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.470> we're<00:01:45.590> gonna<00:01:45.710> feel

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
more concentration and we're gonna feel

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.680 
more concentration and we're gonna feel
a<00:01:46.159> lot<00:01:46.430> more<00:01:46.640> blood<00:01:46.820> flow<00:01:47.030> moving<00:01:47.270> into<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
a lot more blood flow moving into the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.330 
a lot more blood flow moving into the
arms<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.440> is<00:01:48.590> where<00:01:48.740> we<00:01:48.830> really<00:01:49.130> want<00:01:49.159> to

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
arms and this is where we really want to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.969 
arms and this is where we really want to
pump<00:01:49.610> them<00:01:49.790> up<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.149> get<00:01:50.570> them<00:01:50.600> full<00:01:50.990> now<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.710> lot

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979

of<00:01:52.070> people<00:01:52.310> refer<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.909> pump<00:01:53.210> as<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:54.110> sign

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
of people refer to the pump as a sign

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.200
