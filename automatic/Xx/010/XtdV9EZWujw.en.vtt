00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.109
 Tell me guys, you've got more than one video. 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.869
 of the channel links paper this time the subject 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.039
 addressed today the fall of 12 issues and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.410
 floor brakes 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 this issue is very controversial because 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 there are people who say that after the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.529
 aluminum brake or the aluminum sector 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.630
 fell on the ground can not be used more 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 this is a lie 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.890
 the material that aluminum mosquitoes 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 and brother philomene are made is called 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.170
 hard aluminum in this aluminum can 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.030
 Toucans if in case the carabiner falls 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.280
 on the floor but this does not necessarily 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 It means that if I were so 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 ground and is cracked 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.129
 the only way to prove it is you 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.559
 the carabiner or the brake 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 any abseiling equipment and sending 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 to make an X-ray of it 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.340
 black diamond has already made 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.739
 tests and carabiners released more than 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.320
 250 miles per hour and walls of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.150
 concrete and after that he made several 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.280
 tests of resistance, which was 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is proven that if the mosquito is 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.010
 opening correctly and closing the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.799
 correct manner without locking the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
 practically the same has decreased in the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.850
 maximum 10.1 km and this can be 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.439
 documented in the documentary 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.360
 black area where the brake already 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.909
 seemingly to have cracks and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.759
 very strong 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.150
 be x-rayed but there is no 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.700
 marci both brake and carabiner are 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.310
 with cracks the steel mosquitoes of 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 blogs or any other piece of steel are 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.320
 necessarily more resistant than the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.119
 aluminum mosquito screens are more 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.049
 resistant to falls but are more 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.479
 heavy 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.070
 I prefer corn already because when I 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.770
 I'm going to a waterfall to do 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.310
 any kind of exercise 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.479
 is abseiling is the aluminum brakes the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.429
 the aluminum sector make the 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.600
 equipment is lighter and this 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.490
 helps a lot 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.890
 steel equipment normally weighs 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.420
 The seat is too much and you end up tired. 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.549
 much more your day 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.950
 always remembering that the steel ones are more 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.110
 resistance if you liked the video not 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.980
 forget to give a gem and sign up for 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.980
 Channel is worth
