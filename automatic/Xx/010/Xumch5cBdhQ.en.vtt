00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:10.310
 Thank you for entering me This time junior high school third grader 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:16.430
 I will send you the electricity around you 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.600
 At the same time, let's have everyone study the changes that occur in the whole battery, and this battery is the leading role 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.660
 but 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:26.310
 It 's not about change but about the batteries around everyone's body 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:32.700
 You have a little study is a little boring felt because only character Nde there is no him much 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:36.900
 There is a problem but because the problem is slanted from 1 to 15 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.650
 Please stop by and try by all means while reading this 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.070
 I I Na do not know Deiya of we will do the fill-in-the-blank Omouko Come 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.930
 I would like to hear your ear 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:56.170
 e 7 Let's do our best to meet you soon. 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.030
 Then let's go or call me while I'm calling in the country, I'm going to go big then 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.490
 There are two types to divide 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.780
 So first of all it's a 0 manufacturer 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:09.250
 If you use it, the day morning will decline and the battery will not return 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.300
 In other words, it's a common battery that everyone is using The remote control of the guy who is in a barber mix 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.900
 I Toka 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.600
 Do not restore the battery 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 I say primary battery 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:25.979
 So if you use it, you 'll only have to reduce it and throw it away. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:31.909
 People who belong to the primary battery group are the ones that most people use 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.909
 Because it is good in order falling apart It is a improver who comes out well now 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.380
 later 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.380
 Alkaline and thought unique name is manganese battery 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.700
 I remember there that I've written is maniac and participation lawmakers Tanaka in 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.700
 Silver battery after the oxidation 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.760
 I think I say lithium battery 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 And the other is an air battery 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 Each feature does not come out so much , but it is always written in the textbook 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:09.990
 What kind of features do alkaline batteries use often? 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.790
 Please check it in the textbooks and be sure to belong to a group called primary battery. 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.210
 Of these five people 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:20.540
 It is a group of 5 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.140
 If it is good, it is the first kind called the first primary battery , then go to the next kind 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.220
 I will 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.990
 Battery that can be used repeatedly on the other hand 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:35.790
 I'm certain the battery at what here a temporary here says I secondary battery 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.790
 Or another name 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.740
 Use one Kanji character 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.550
 Is the rechargeable battery included ? 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.790
 Please remember the storage battery 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.790
 Understanding that this was off so I can be used repeatedly 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.620
 You look Kana this okay 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:05.330
 In among them lead to the negative pole belonging to the group of cats of the secondary battery among them 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.599
 + A hunt that does not participate in the song and this combination called thin flow 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.319
 Lead oxide, lead is a thin Takashi 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.220
 That of the battery used in combination of these guys 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.260
 I use lead 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.260
 Because it is a storage battery, that also connects 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.850
 It says I lead-acid batteries 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:34.159
 It is rude lead battery that Kusanagi turned off this time 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:40.159
 And from the outside to use repeatedly 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:46.280
 I'll send back a message by sending a message to the other side to return the voltage. 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.879
 If you say that it is ready to use and what kind of current flows from the outside , this will also be remembered 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.110
 Let's go 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.250
 Reversed ionization 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.250
 I will say 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.410
 Lay outer current flow to return voltage 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.170
 This is a lot everyone usually uses Do you have a cell phone in particular? 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.690
 10 years 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.780
 Everyone say to 10 years empress want Toka Well after game 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.720
 psp but whatever 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.870
 Say charging 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.680
 This primary battery is very famous 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:24.620
 Battery that wo n't return to the disposable when used once 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:30.400
 The remember your child's Tteyuu there is the Tteyuu That's 2 o'clock local alias storage battery can be used repeatedly 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.620
 And there is one other thing that is very famous , please remember this 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.639
 Let's go 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:40.740
 I'm going to open the water cache I'm going to go to the water battery 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.509
 I 'll add something to the water and then I'll let the current flow 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.930
 Water does not originally have current 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:52.490
 Guy who was studying at the time of this I second year to buy what mix to flow in 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.330
 Mix sodium hydroxide 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.330
 23 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.860
 When a current from sodium was added 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:09.600
 It was studied in the middle 2 that this to break down into a walk nyan 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.860
 I Since this 100,000 Which even say of That's electrolysis water 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.860
 This with hydrogen 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.830
 oxygen 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.830
 It can be broken down into 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:28.380
 Then you remove the power supply in the hydrogen and oxygen do the decomposition 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:34.950
 Furthermore, the current is turned off 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:40.100
 If you remove it, you 'll connect the electronic music box after removing the electronic rattle 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.100
 Then the electronic music box sounds 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:48.409
 Sorry if this is this part to excuse name and say why network 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:58.729
 Breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen Removes ionization 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:06:00.660
 Then it returns to once more water to compound this hydrogen and oxygen electricity when it returns to the water 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:04.680
 Energy is generated 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:11.340
 And thanks to the electric energy there is a music box 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:14.060
 The bench when it tries to return to such water unexpectedly 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.060
 Like this 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.390
 It is a quantity of noodles battery with burning amount 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:27.200
 I say that I am so good b 10 e 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.889
 Do Thats not only use water 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.560
 So 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:40.850
 Hazardous substances is not out at all 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.850
 Hazardous substances 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.070
 There is an advantage of not doing 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:54.710
 It is in this test 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:58.430
 The year comes to answer about fuel cells and what is the advantage? 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:03.050
 At that time I have written that it is good for the environment 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:09.060
 Certainly that's right, no harmful substances are generated and it's good for the environment 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:13.530
 I want because it is a woman just wrote the place I to say to you and eh why environment from teacher 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.950
 It may be triangle or punishment if it is good only for the environment 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:22.530
 Because no harmful substances are generated 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:25.639
 Please be good for the environment . It will be even round that no harmful substances are generated 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:30.169
 Please there in try doing careful 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:33.770
 This is a science in the third grade of junior high school this time 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:36.919
 It has been sent for the personal belongings of the swamp 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:41.409
 Thank you very much I am looking at it also this time 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:45.039
 Now that's the end of the battery. 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:49.989
 For there it says favor Toka alkaline 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:55.800
 I will do it with a little attention, but if you like, please take a look at the other side 

00:07:49.989 --> 00:07:55.800
 Well this time it is over with this Thank you very much-
