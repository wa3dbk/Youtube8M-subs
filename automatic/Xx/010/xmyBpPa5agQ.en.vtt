00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.040
 and you 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.480
 how about friends talking here with another 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.240
 video review this time I bring you nothing 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.530
 more and nothing less than first and 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.689
 bots project 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.480
 one of the bot projects like this is I went back to 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:23.110
 find a bot project this time now 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.830
 already in the city ​​of mexico so I can 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.480
 I can show these guys and 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.060
 here we have that first state is 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.940
 Transforms into an emergency vehicle 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.769
 and rescue and really it's a re 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.559
 molded off-road stand and with that 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.350
 changed all the use so all the 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.180
 shell from the outside and now 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.860
 instead of being a van, that 's 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.650
 a juve of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.290
 the rescue here we see the the ax that 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.640
 surely it is for rescue methods 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.150
 to knock down doors or something like that but 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.550
 well here we see that first state is 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.640
 converts in this type of vehicle from 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.130
 very nice emergency now as you 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.360
 you know, this transforms into a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.370
 leg or in a defender arm now 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.050
 I decided not to waste so much time alone 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.310
 I'm going to transform it to the mode 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:28.020
 to the limb mode that is going to be used 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.350
 in the combined if you want to see if 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.330
 you open it and how it transforms from the two 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.380
 forms below I 'm going to put the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.420
 link of my review of off-road can 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.740
 you see the transformation process 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.900
 of both to both extremities but good 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.420
 my dear friends very pretty pretty 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.070
 father very very good now for 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.930
 transform it to robot mode what we're going 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.250
 to do is that we are going to separate all this 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.280
 part well 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.320
 it for a little bit and I take it a little away 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.840
 way we are going to separate the whole part of 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.050
 back we're going to take all this assembly 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.220
 from here and we're going to all these panels the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.259
 let's separate 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.870
 sideways 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.269
 that's right now let's take it from here 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.860
 just and if you notice this 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.810
 panel is rotating in this way to this 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.019
 in a way that frees the articulation of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:29.299
 I'm going to spin it again there 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:32.659
 there it looks ok let's open your arms 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.420
 to the sides we are going to open all this 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.269
 assembly has also opened us from the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.569
 back now we download all this 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.120
 is on a hinge that connects this 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.000
 way and here has some small poles 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.230
 and here it has holes in the part 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.609
 of your knees that are going to assemble and you 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 they will give stability we separate them 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:02.129
 we separate these panels from the arms 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.910
 I was not crying but rather 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.910
 there is 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.220
 and there we have friends to first 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.970
 dates so I like to stay in 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.360
 way robots so I like to stay 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.840
 very pretty pretty well they took me away 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.180
 another little bit more the take it up to see it 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.790
 you of the beautiful design that you have in 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.430
 the face really although they are refusing 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.010
 the molds you see my dear ones 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.970
 friends 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.890
 to this already very blurry 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.319
 but enough change the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.409
 Sculpted face 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.659
 as to be able to grab us as 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.069
 another character I really like a lot 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.209
 what you are doing now with vainer 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.730
 This is very nice words figures 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.900
 quite possible here we see that you 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.049
 we can give the ax 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.460
 for your rescue work we can 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.200
 give also him 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.200
 because it's not the missile launcher 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.690
 and it is already 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.690
 hide well 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.540
 that this is your pizza is for him but not 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.310
 import 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.230
 so I like that these remain 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.260
 up like shoulder pads the signs of 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.950
 Very pretty emergency quite pretty 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.220
 well very very father now for 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.620
 transform it to tip mode let's 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.950
 take all these things off this guy 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.790
 It becomes nominally a leg 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.790
 of defender then what are we going to 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.720
 to do is that we are going to retract this 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.080
 assembly we're going to paste these little ones 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.080
 panels 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.080
 thus 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.770
 a bit difficult as you can see 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.720
 let's drag the head back 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.040
 completely so that the post of 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.640
 combined 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.720
 we facing us up we 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.720
 to join this 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.900
 stretch the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.500
 we're going to lower this again 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.500
 assembly 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.540
 this is thus flexed from this 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.640
 way here and now in the back 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.090
 it's as if we were basically in the way 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.470
 vehicle is in fact the vehicle mode 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.530
 but 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.689
 here has some small posts there is 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.989
 with just assembling 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:58.830
 we are going to open all this assembly to 

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:58.830
 separate from the knees to retract here 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:09.579
 this one that connects all this 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:18.909
 and connect everything and now that is 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.230
 in this way we are going to stretch this 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:28.270
 aparatejo well 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:31.240
 and we're going to put it as the top foot 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.400
 This is how it looks so beautiful 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.050
 dear friends pretty pretty good 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.050
 I really like it a lot 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:45.660
 you see the white so beautiful the 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.850
 roof that this one has the ambulance the 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.699
 Very nice rescue vehicle very 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:54.720
 Nice the truth, friendly friends soon 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:57.720
 will be ready the combined defender believes 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.729
 which is the second we will have ready 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.740
 because we still need to threaten to 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.320
 have the stones but for 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:07.380
 while I am skillful jr 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.310
 this is first state the protected bots and 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.310
 we said goodbye
