00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.599
 yes 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.849
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.959
 I am poker and today I bring you the 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.340
 next episode of the guide of the 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.869
 weapons one of the weapons that most 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.160
 they used the last heat the consumption 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.050
 to climb rounds to get 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.939
 dots at the beginning the round and if it is 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.930
 the bowie knife can not be improved no 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.460
 it comes out in the box we can only 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.009
 get in ataun in the van 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.630
 will be here and on the transit map only 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.969
 in the logger's cabin that is between 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.590
 electricity and the town is worth good 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.960
 This knife replaces the knife 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.399
 main given about nine times of damage 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.020
 more than the main knife to spread 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.059
 butter that little knife of 10 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.500
 centimeters or more and good bowie knife 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.690
 that will be very profitable if 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.760
 we buy in low rounds are worth round 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.770
 about the maximum the six advised her 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.940
 about seven could even stretch a 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.710
 little because the money we're going to 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.440
 recover in quotes as it kills 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.210
 until round 9 included in the dya and 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.820
 we would start stabbing him 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.530
 the 15 15 included then in the 16 already 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.020
 we should give them two or three 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.369
 stabbing and good the only accessory 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.990
 in quotes that can be added already 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.369
 I say you can not improve the only one 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.619
 accessories when we have hunting we 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.119
 they touch the ballistics and replace the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.670
 ballistic knife left by the bou 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.080
 and the damage notice that it's the same as if 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.729
 we did not arrive ballistic simply with 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.300
 the knife the only thing that gives us is more 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.440
 speed 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.060
 attack to say it somehow 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.040
 we can slash three times faster 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080
 I have not looked at it either nor have I 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.250
 studied but about three 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.350
 times faster than only with the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.580
 knife which is the only problem in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.990
 this case of last things with this 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 knife we already know that they have taken the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.430
 galvanized cuffs and have remained a 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.600
 short the good ones the knife uy 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.770
 what we are going to nose 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.980
 is a bit short because of the issue of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.350
 you kill until 9 but I tell you that 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.880
 lack of good bread are cakes so 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.400
 if we do not have enough money in the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.630
 round 67 to buy the pineapples 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.670
 galvanized we can buy 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.740
 perfectly the bowie that is going to 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.000
 replace without problems so nothing 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.500
 Here ends the guide I hope you have 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.390
 I think you know that if so the and 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.590
 favorite forgets help I imagine that the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.970
 next episode by logically 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.860
 should be the organized gal not yet 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.300
