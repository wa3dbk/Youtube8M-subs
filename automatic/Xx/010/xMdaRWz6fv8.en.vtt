00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
mean for it to be that way I realized it

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.460 
mean for it to be that way I realized it

i again had fun with my ribbon and
fibers<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:17.110> i<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:18.040> thought<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.459> a

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
fibers so i just thought this is a

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.040 
fibers so i just thought this is a
really<00:03:18.730> fun<00:03:18.880> album<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.239> came<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:19.780> that

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
really fun album I came with like that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.360 
really fun album I came with like that
it<00:03:20.110> was<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.290> think<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.530> was<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.650> sports<00:03:21.100> bra

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
it was I think it was a sports bra

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.310 
it was I think it was a sports bra
edition<00:03:21.940> or<00:03:22.060> whatever<00:03:22.300> but<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.840> meant<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.200> get

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
edition or whatever but I meant to get

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.780 
edition or whatever but I meant to get
the<00:03:23.440> full<00:03:23.620> cup<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.100> was<00:03:24.220> rounded<00:03:24.610> on<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
the full cup so it was rounded on the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.910 
the full cup so it was rounded on the
side<00:03:25.000> instead<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.360> pointy<00:03:25.690> but<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.470> ended<00:03:26.770> up

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
side instead of pointy but I ended up

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.180 
side instead of pointy but I ended up
just<00:03:27.489> cutting<00:03:27.850> off<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.150> edges<00:03:28.270> because<00:03:29.190> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
just cutting off the edges because the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.940 
just cutting off the edges because the
paper<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:30.820> got<00:03:31.090> was<00:03:31.390> 8<00:03:31.570> by<00:03:31.750> 8<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.140> this

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
paper that I got was 8 by 8 and this

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.490 
paper that I got was 8 by 8 and this
album<00:03:33.370> is<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.520> little<00:03:33.730> bit<00:03:33.850> bigger<00:03:34.200> sideways<00:03:35.200> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
album is a little bit bigger sideways so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.720 
album is a little bit bigger sideways so
it's<00:03:35.820> instead<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:38.050> cut<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.400> APA

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it's instead I cut it so that the APA

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.150 
it's instead I cut it so that the APA
paper<00:03:39.970> would<00:03:40.239> fit<00:03:40.420> exactly<00:03:40.750> on<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:42.100> know

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
paper would fit exactly on the you know

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.690 
paper would fit exactly on the you know
width<00:03:42.430> wise<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:44.040> otherwise<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.370> paper<00:03:45.580> i

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
width wise so otherwise on the paper i

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.670 
width wise so otherwise on the paper i
use<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.270> glitz<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.810> know<00:03:46.900> let's<00:03:47.200> pack<00:03:47.440> that's

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
use the glitz you know let's pack that's
