believe<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.199> sharing<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.010> good<00:00:56.930> but<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> one

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
believe that sharing is good but the one

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.590 
believe that sharing is good but the one
with<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> slug<00:00:58.920> isn't<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.879> big<00:01:00.059> believer<00:01:00.449> in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
with the slug isn't a big believer in

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.729 
with the slug isn't a big believer in
sharing<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:02.430> could<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> while<00:01:03.739> it's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
sharing this could take a while it's

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.429 
sharing this could take a while it's
very<00:01:04.979> entertaining<00:01:05.549> though<00:01:11.840> some<00:01:12.840> happen<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
very entertaining though some happen I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.760 
very entertaining though some happen I
think<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.600> was<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> fumble<00:01:15.990> oh<00:01:17.750> oh

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
think I think there was a fumble oh oh

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:30.650 
think I think there was a fumble oh oh
oh

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:40.110 

so<00:01:31.660> maybe<00:01:35.040> another<00:01:36.040> handoff<00:01:38.940> yeah<00:01:39.940> there's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
so maybe another handoff yeah there's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.150 
so maybe another handoff yeah there's
not<00:01:40.270> much<00:01:40.480> left<00:01:40.750> it's<00:01:41.080> already<00:01:41.470> pretty<00:01:41.770> chewed

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
not much left it's already pretty chewed

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.280 
not much left it's already pretty chewed
up<00:01:44.970> curries<00:01:45.970> they<00:01:46.120> cooperate<00:01:46.690> by<00:01:46.900> both

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
up curries they cooperate by both

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.960 
up curries they cooperate by both
grabbing<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.860> slug<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.130> ripping<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.760> half

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
grabbing the slug and ripping it in half

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.990 
grabbing the slug and ripping it in half
okay<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:49.960> now<00:01:50.229> uh<00:01:50.340> when<00:01:51.340> these<00:01:51.490> chickens<00:01:51.880> were

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
okay so now uh when these chickens were

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.640 
okay so now uh when these chickens were
first<00:01:52.240> here<00:01:52.510> they<00:01:52.780> weren't<00:01:53.020> too<00:01:53.140> keen<00:01:53.320> on<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
first here they weren't too keen on the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.390 
first here they weren't too keen on the
slugs<00:01:53.920> I'm<00:01:54.190> told<00:01:55.080> well<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.380> think<00:01:56.470> they'd<00:01:57.130> only

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
slugs I'm told well I think they'd only

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.660 
slugs I'm told well I think they'd only
eaten<00:01:58.080> grain<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.680> they<00:01:59.920> haven't<00:02:00.130> really<00:02:00.369> seen

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
eaten grain and they haven't really seen

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.030 
eaten grain and they haven't really seen
a<00:02:00.729> slug<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.200> don't<00:02:02.500> think<00:02:02.590> they<00:02:02.740> knew<00:02:02.860> what

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
a slug so I don't think they knew what

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.310 
a slug so I don't think they knew what
to<00:02:03.160> do<00:02:03.280> with<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:03.970> came<00:02:04.240> up<00:02:04.450> with<00:02:04.690> a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
to do with it and you came up with a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.280 
to do with it and you came up with a
technique<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:06.220> help<00:02:07.060> them<00:02:07.360> learn<00:02:07.540> about<00:02:07.600> the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
technique to help them learn about the

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.090 
technique to help them learn about the
joy<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.979> slugs<00:02:09.600> all<00:02:10.600> right<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.709> now<00:02:11.890> you're

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
joy of slugs all right and now you're

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.520 
joy of slugs all right and now you're
going<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.520> demonstrate<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:13.690> technique<00:02:14.170> gory

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
going to demonstrate this technique gory

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.900 
going to demonstrate this technique gory
technique<00:02:15.100> all<00:02:15.370> right

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
technique all right

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.890 
technique all right
scissor<00:02:16.690> method<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.470> scissor<00:02:17.800> method

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
scissor method the scissor method

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.570 
scissor method the scissor method
because<00:02:19.900> they<00:02:20.050> were<00:02:20.110> small<00:02:20.500> young<00:02:20.830> chickens<00:02:21.310> I

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
because they were small young chickens I

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.800 
because they were small young chickens I
didn't<00:02:21.790> think<00:02:21.940> they<00:02:22.000> could<00:02:22.150> eat<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.270> whole<00:02:22.450> slug

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
didn't think they could eat a whole slug

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.650 
didn't think they could eat a whole slug
so<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.140> cut<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.860> slug<00:02:24.130> into<00:02:24.459> pieces<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:25.450> seemed

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
so I cut the slug into pieces it seemed

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.090 
so I cut the slug into pieces it seemed
like<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.989> size<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> chicken<00:02:26.860> could<00:02:27.040> eat<00:02:27.540> so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
like the size but a chicken could eat so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.090 
like the size but a chicken could eat so
just<00:02:30.100> started<00:02:30.520> by<00:02:30.780> kind<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.840> dangling<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.620> slug

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
just started by kind of dangling a slug

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.270 
just started by kind of dangling a slug
head<00:02:33.340> over<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> chicken<00:02:34.030> coop<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.280> slipping
