00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
prevention obviously so the neck the jaw

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.810 
prevention obviously so the neck the jaw
supports<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> head<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.100> holds<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> brain

supports the head which holds the brain
your<00:00:51.329> brain<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.899> jello<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.860> fluid

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
skull so things that cause a concussion

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
skull so things that cause a concussion
are<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.770> quick<00:00:59.010> acceleration<00:00:59.370> like<00:01:00.000> when
