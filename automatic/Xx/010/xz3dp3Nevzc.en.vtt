I<00:00:02.790> made<00:00:03.790> a<00:00:03.820> huge<00:00:04.180> effort<00:00:04.390> in<00:00:04.689> these<00:00:04.779> powder

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
I made a huge effort in these powder

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.230 
I made a huge effort in these powder
skis<00:00:05.440> to<00:00:05.649> make<00:00:05.830> sure<00:00:06.009> they're<00:00:06.250> really<00:00:06.700> solid

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
skis to make sure they're really solid

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.879 
skis to make sure they're really solid
on<00:00:07.299> your<00:00:07.480> foot<00:00:07.750> and<00:00:07.899> in<00:00:08.379> the<00:00:08.469> tip<00:00:08.680> and<00:00:08.709> tail

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
on your foot and in the tip and tail

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.680 
on your foot and in the tip and tail
it's<00:00:09.280> a<00:00:09.340> little<00:00:09.549> more<00:00:09.639> forgiving<00:00:10.180> it's<00:00:10.420> a<00:00:10.510> lot

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
it's a little more forgiving it's a lot

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.959 
it's a little more forgiving it's a lot
more<00:00:11.020> lively<00:00:11.590> and<00:00:11.860> fun<00:00:12.100> and<00:00:12.340> playful<00:00:12.789> it's

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
more lively and fun and playful it's

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.029 
more lively and fun and playful it's
gonna<00:00:13.119> butter<00:00:13.420> real<00:00:13.750> comfortably<00:00:14.350> and<00:00:14.920> they

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
gonna butter real comfortably and they

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.500 
gonna butter real comfortably and they
have<00:00:15.129> just<00:00:15.369> the<00:00:15.459> right<00:00:15.549> flex<00:00:15.969> pattern<00:00:16.359> so

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
have just the right flex pattern so

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.659 
have just the right flex pattern so
they're<00:00:16.660> fun<00:00:16.960> light<00:00:17.230> and<00:00:17.380> lively<00:00:17.560> but<00:00:18.160> they're

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:18.669 
they're fun light and lively but they're

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.380 
they're fun light and lively but they're
not<00:00:18.820> gonna<00:00:18.970> flop<00:00:19.390> around<00:00:19.599> on<00:00:19.960> you<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.910> you<00:00:22.119> use

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
not gonna flop around on you if you use

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.509 
not gonna flop around on you if you use
the<00:00:22.570> right<00:00:22.749> geometry<00:00:23.439> in<00:00:23.710> rocker<00:00:24.130> and<00:00:24.429> the

amount of flex you actually don't need
as<00:00:28.060> much<00:00:28.300> rocker<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:29.140> way<00:00:29.259> I<00:00:29.289> design<00:00:29.829> it<00:00:30.039> is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
as much rocker the way I design it is

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.510 
as much rocker the way I design it is
for<00:00:31.029> distinctly<00:00:31.720> different<00:00:32.259> radiuses<00:00:33.130> all

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
for distinctly different radiuses all

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.880 
for distinctly different radiuses all
blended<00:00:34.300> together<00:00:34.450> seamlessly<00:00:35.110> into<00:00:35.860> a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
blended together seamlessly into a

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.220 
blended together seamlessly into a
parabolic<00:00:36.400> shape<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:37.180> largest<00:00:37.660> radius<00:00:37.870> is

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
parabolic shape the largest radius is

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.200 
parabolic shape the largest radius is
closest<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.740> your<00:00:38.890> foot<00:00:39.220> and<00:00:39.760> then<00:00:39.910> it<00:00:40.060> gets

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
closest to your foot and then it gets

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.970 
closest to your foot and then it gets
tighter<00:00:40.540> tighter<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:41.230> quicker<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:41.800> quicker

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
tighter tighter and quicker and quicker

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.740 
tighter tighter and quicker and quicker
as<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.430> gets<00:00:42.580> out<00:00:42.730> towards<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.120> tip<00:00:43.360> what

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
as it gets out towards the tip what

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.390 
as it gets out towards the tip what
that's<00:00:43.930> gonna<00:00:44.080> do<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.380> these<00:00:44.740> first<00:00:45.040> two<00:00:45.250> races

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
that's gonna do is these first two races

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.940 
that's gonna do is these first two races
that<00:00:45.880> are<00:00:46.000> larger<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.540> more<00:00:46.990> gentle<00:00:47.470> are

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
that are larger and more gentle are

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.770 
that are larger and more gentle are
gonna<00:00:48.070> get<00:00:48.370> up<00:00:48.460> on<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.640> plane<00:00:49.000> quicker<00:00:49.420> and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
gonna get up on a plane quicker and

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.900 
gonna get up on a plane quicker and
plane<00:00:50.200> right<00:00:50.440> up<00:00:50.560> on<00:00:50.710> top<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.190> spell<00:00:51.490> and

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
plane right up on top of the spell and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.370 
plane right up on top of the spell and
the<00:00:52.060> ones<00:00:52.240> up<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.570> front<00:00:52.840> those<00:00:53.170> are<00:00:53.290> gonna

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
the ones up in front those are gonna

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.050 
the ones up in front those are gonna
make<00:00:53.620> sure<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:53.950> stay<00:00:53.980> on<00:00:54.250> top<00:00:54.670> you're<00:00:55.000> just

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
make sure you stay on top you're just

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.180 
make sure you stay on top you're just
gonna<00:00:55.270> get<00:00:55.570> out<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:55.900> that<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.200> much<00:00:56.500> smoother

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
gonna get out of that a much smoother

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.790 
gonna get out of that a much smoother
float<00:00:58.000> I'm<00:00:58.270> much<00:00:58.450> more<00:00:58.630> effortless<00:00:59.230> flow<00:00:59.470> in<00:00:59.680> a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
float I'm much more effortless flow in a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.210 
float I'm much more effortless flow in a
larger<00:01:00.430> variety<00:01:00.940> of<00:01:00.970> conditions<00:01:01.890> back<00:01:02.890> around

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
larger variety of conditions back around

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.219 
larger variety of conditions back around
to<00:01:03.400> the<00:01:03.520> tip<00:01:03.730> shape<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.299> what<00:01:04.540> we've<00:01:05.049> done

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
to the tip shape and what we've done

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.160 
to the tip shape and what we've done
here<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.710> create<00:01:06.009> a<00:01:06.039> very<00:01:06.429> mellow<00:01:07.329> taper<00:01:07.840> so

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
here is create a very mellow taper so

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.469 
here is create a very mellow taper so
it's<00:01:08.469> a<00:01:08.619> lot<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:09.310> different<00:01:09.789> radiuses<00:01:10.210> going

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
it's a lot of different radiuses going

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.980 
it's a lot of different radiuses going
from<00:01:10.630> side<00:01:10.929> cut<00:01:11.259> to<00:01:11.979> no<00:01:12.490> side<00:01:12.820> cut<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.630> back

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
from side cut to no side cut to back

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.690 
from side cut to no side cut to back
around<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.469> the<00:01:14.560> tip<00:01:14.770> shape<00:01:15.039> and<00:01:15.280> what<00:01:15.369> it<00:01:15.490> lets

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
around to the tip shape and what it lets

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.109 
around to the tip shape and what it lets
you<00:01:15.820> do<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.270> really<00:01:16.869> butter<00:01:17.439> and<00:01:17.850> float<00:01:18.850> and

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
you do is really butter and float and
