warfare<00:00:14.340> 3<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> let's<00:00:16.379> go<00:00:16.470> ahead<00:00:16.500> up<00:00:16.800> into<00:00:17.160> this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
warfare 3 so let's go ahead up into this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.070 
warfare 3 so let's go ahead up into this
the<00:00:17.609> reason<00:00:17.789> i<00:00:17.940> don't<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.270> like<00:00:18.390> dome<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
the reason i don't really like dome is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.660 
the reason i don't really like dome is
because<00:00:19.410> it's<00:00:19.590> kind<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.859> hard<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> dictate

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
because it's kind of hard to dictate

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.160 
because it's kind of hard to dictate
where<00:00:20.850> people<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.210> coming<00:00:21.270> from<00:00:21.570> even<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
where people are coming from even if you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.290 
where people are coming from even if you
play<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> domination<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
play this on like a domination you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.640 
play this on like a domination you
always<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:24.990> guy<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.350> wants<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
always get that one guy that wants to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.170 
always get that one guy that wants to
push<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.220> building<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.640> keep<00:00:26.849> them<00:00:27.029> off

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
push into the building and keep them off

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.120 
push into the building and keep them off
the<00:00:27.210> beast<00:00:27.539> spawn<00:00:27.810> trap<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.890> seems<00:00:29.039> like

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the beast spawn trap and it seems like

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.020 
the beast spawn trap and it seems like

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.459 
modern warfare 3 kind of it's crazy how
they<00:00:33.180> set<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> nomination<00:00:33.719> flags<00:00:34.260> there

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
is i don't think off the top of my head

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.860 
is i don't think off the top of my head

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
up here we get that is in a straight

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180 
up here we get that is in a straight
line<00:00:41.540> but<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.140> could<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.410> wrong<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:44.040> there

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
line but but i could be wrong is there

any<00:00:44.399> flags<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:44.969> game<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
any flags on this game is actually in a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.700 
any flags on this game is actually in a
straight<00:00:45.840> line<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.110> pretty<00:00:46.289> much<00:00:46.320> everything

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
straight line of pretty much everything

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.270 
straight line of pretty much everything
is<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> triangle<00:00:47.430> pattern<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:49.620> makes

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
is the triangle pattern and that makes

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
is the triangle pattern and that makes
for<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.879> lot<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> hectic<00:00:51.539> gameplay

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
for really a lot of hectic gameplay

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.880 
for really a lot of hectic gameplay
guess<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.620> were<00:00:52.680> going

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
guess that's what they were going

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.760 
guess that's what they were going
forward<00:00:53.190> gun<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.550> gunn<00:00:53.760> action<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.420> maps<00:00:55.260> like

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
forward gun on gunn action but maps like

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
forward gun on gunn action but maps like
dome<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.760> my<00:00:57.059> opinion<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.600> shouldn't<00:00:57.989> exist

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
dome in my opinion they shouldn't exist

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.920 
dome in my opinion they shouldn't exist
if<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.710> exist<00:00:59.070> they<00:00:59.219> should<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> like

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
if they do exist they should be like

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.270 
if they do exist they should be like
free-for-all<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.770> something<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
free-for-all only or something like that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.619 
free-for-all only or something like that
but<00:01:02.460> i<00:01:02.550> couldn't<00:01:02.760> even<00:01:02.910> imagine<00:01:02.969> played<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
but i couldn't even imagine played this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.880 
but i couldn't even imagine played this
map<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.989> free<00:01:04.140> throw<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.559> there's<00:01:04.710> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
map on free throw because there's so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.429 
map on free throw because there's so
many<00:01:05.010> openings<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.320> example

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
many openings like for here for example

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.160 
many openings like for here for example
the<00:01:08.250> game<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.600> spawn<00:01:09.869> people

the game will all will spawn people

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
the game will all will spawn people
behind<00:01:10.439> me<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.189> time<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:11.820> standing

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
stronger areas in the game because one

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
stronger areas in the game because one
because<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> back<00:01:16.860> entrance<00:01:17.100> which

a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.470> mainly<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.060> fact<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
a lot mainly because the fact of

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
a lot mainly because the fact of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
to throw stuns flashes and aids faster

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
to throw stuns flashes and aids faster
than<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.799> normally<00:01:40.979> would<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.430> previous<00:01:41.909> Call

of Duty games and people take advantage
of<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.000> hardcore<00:01:45.570> since<00:01:46.020> life's<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
of this hardcore since life's are so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
of this hardcore since life's are so
short<00:01:46.799> they're<00:01:47.009> constantly<00:01:47.460> having<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.450> fresh

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
short they're constantly having a fresh

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.499 
short they're constantly having a fresh
set<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:48.990> flash<00:01:49.290> bangs<00:01:49.649> which<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:51.360> opinion

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
set of flash bangs which in my opinion

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.330 
set of flash bangs which in my opinion
in<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.110> game<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.619> lot<00:01:52.890> stronger<00:01:53.159> than

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
in this game are a lot stronger than

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.980 
in this game are a lot stronger than
they<00:01:53.579> were<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.729> previous<00:01:54.240> games<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.780> they

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
they were in previous games one they

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.170 
they were in previous games one they
still<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> overpower<00:01:56.460> time<00:01:56.880> like

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
still have that overpower time like

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.480 
still have that overpower time like
flash<00:01:57.780> bangs<00:01:58.079> last<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.590> day<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> night<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
flash bangs last a day and a night and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.639 
flash bangs last a day and a night and
then<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.509> add<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> quick<00:02:00.990> throw<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.290> them

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
then you add a quick throw to them

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.010 
then you add a quick throw to them
there's<00:02:02.040> no<00:02:02.159> reason<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.579> use<00:02:02.850> stun<00:02:03.119> especially

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
there's no reason to use stun especially

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.749 
there's no reason to use stun especially
when<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> take<00:02:04.439> stunts<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.009> limit<00:02:05.610> its

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
when you take stunts and limit its

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.869 
when you take stunts and limit its
stability<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> gate<00:02:07.129> so<00:02:08.129> stunt

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
stability right out the gate so stunt

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.990 
stability right out the gate so stunt
basically<00:02:09.660> slows<00:02:09.989> people<00:02:10.379> down<00:02:10.670> while<00:02:11.670> flash

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
basically slows people down while flash

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.820 
basically slows people down while flash
is<00:02:12.270> pretty<00:02:12.510> much<00:02:12.720> disables<00:02:13.319> them

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
is pretty much disables them

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
is pretty much disables them
they<00:02:14.250> can't<00:02:14.460> sound<00:02:14.670> war<00:02:15.000> they<00:02:15.210> can't<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.720> but

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
they can't sound war they can't see but

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.800 
they can't sound war they can't see but
they<00:02:16.320> can<00:02:16.470> move<00:02:16.650> around<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.280> same<00:02:17.490> speed<00:02:17.910> but

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
they can move around the same speed but

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.750 
they can move around the same speed but
it<00:02:18.990> has<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> blast<00:02:19.530> radius<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.250> 20<00:02:20.430> yards

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
it has a blast radius of like 20 yards

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.550 
it has a blast radius of like 20 yards
compared<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.420> 28<00:02:21.660> yards<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.320> stun

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
compared to 28 yards that the stun

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.910 
compared to 28 yards that the stun
grenade<00:02:22.890> actually<00:02:23.280> has<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:24.210> yeah<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.770> get

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
grenade actually has so yeah you get

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.190 
grenade actually has so yeah you get
flashed<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.490> lot<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.360> know<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.780> would<00:02:28.020> if

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
flashed a lot and you know it would if

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.330 
flashed a lot and you know it would if
we<00:02:28.350> think<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.620> would<00:02:28.800> kind<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.040> lead<00:02:29.220> you

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
we think that would kind of lead you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.250 
we think that would kind of lead you
toward<00:02:29.580> more<00:02:29.790> blast<00:02:30.030> shield<00:02:30.360> but<00:02:31.020> black

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
toward more blast shield but black

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
toward more blast shield but black
shield<00:02:31.530> doesn't<00:02:31.770> really<00:02:32.130> do<00:02:32.490> much<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:33.030> help

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
shield doesn't really do much to help

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.850 
shield doesn't really do much to help
you<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.630> with<00:02:33.810> stuns<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.320> needs<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.770> not

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
you out with stuns and needs and not

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.830 
you out with stuns and needs and not
like<00:02:35.070> tactical<00:02:35.460> mass<00:02:35.610> pro<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.000> black<00:02:36.240> ops<00:02:36.480> and

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.860 
but what else would either be I mean
overkill<00:03:17.640> would<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> popular<00:03:18.180> /<00:03:18.540> can<00:03:18.750> be<00:03:18.840> a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
overkill would be a popular / can be a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.470 
overkill would be a popular / can be a
really<00:03:19.019> popular<00:03:19.290> bird<00:03:19.739> but<00:03:20.640> which<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.000> figure

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
really popular bird but which I figure

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
overkill be a pockmark on here but it's

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.400 
overkill be a pockmark on here but it's
not<00:03:23.220> mainly<00:03:23.670> because<00:03:23.820> most<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.959> other

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
