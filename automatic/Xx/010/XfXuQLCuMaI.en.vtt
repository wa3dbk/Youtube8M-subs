it's actively changing environment the
seasons<00:01:33.390> change<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.709> need<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
seasons change so you need that

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.940 
seasons change so you need that
camouflage<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.149> change<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.109> what<00:01:37.709> I<00:01:37.740> want

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
camouflage to change with it what I want

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.520 
camouflage to change with it what I want
to<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.099> is<00:01:38.399> get<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.789> along<00:01:39.209> the<00:01:39.359> walls<00:01:39.569> go<00:01:40.349> down

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to do is get it along the walls go down

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.229 
to do is get it along the walls go down
around<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.069> edges<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.459> I<00:01:41.489> can<00:01:41.729> pull<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.179> up

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:42.239 
around the edges so I can pull it up
