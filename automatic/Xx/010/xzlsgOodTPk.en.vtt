00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.350

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.110
 mateus and let's go for another great card 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 blacks torhars game launch 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:21.300
 Galapagos 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:24.050
 Let's see what this little box comes to me. 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:32.130
 It seems to be a really cool game. 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:34.260
 is a game that calls the fast queue to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.620
 play knot with family members in a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620
 little party 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.050
 the box will start in the water 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:54.079
 cool, and the carts are gigantic 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.079
 the quality here gives the box very good 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.219
 the stuff I really liked the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.219
 quality word of congratulation depression 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:18.530
 Look at the size of this cargo 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.530
 this is neither a manual nor a booklet 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.920
 in a simple good done 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.460
 the eyes look at the size of this load 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.810
 finally at the personal stage I think a little 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:44.000
 very very simple very beautiful 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.350
 letter says dying man looks 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.350
 that the size of the letter 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:02:04.340
 look just came back curious that the staff 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:09.920
 knows that a dam on the ruler measuring the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.730
 size of that letter here're eight 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:19.250
 centimeters and a half 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:22.280
 approximate the tattoo decreases while eight 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.890
 and a half for 12 6 to more than 12 thousand 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:32.540
 68 and a half players for 12 and even 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:38.320
 size of this letter I do not think 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.320
 It had to be that way in a 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.590
 she comes in front she comes in history 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.590
 so behind 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.370
 the channel brings is speaking here in 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.150
 how are these young people because 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.090
 if you look like this the staff 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.270
 behind there will see what the letter is great 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.910
 gives to read depending on the distance 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.920
 partnership quietly 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.860
 I believe that within you placed 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.000
 so it's not personal at the time of hiding 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.790
 she should show this face 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.130
 everyone is traffic and only person who 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:43.140
 is what is making a game control 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:48.170
 will be good here carlos are coined 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:54.480
 many letters only this that comes to caxias 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:04:01.310
 many many mantha and staff positions 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:05.930
 but a boxing of a Galapagos card game 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.930
