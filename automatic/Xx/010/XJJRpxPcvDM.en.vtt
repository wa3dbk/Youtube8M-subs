exactly square so lying down the color

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.290 
exactly square so lying down the color
side<00:00:18.330> I'm<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.529> take<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.160> fold<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.150> into

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
side I'm going to take and fold it into

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 
side I'm going to take and fold it into
a<00:00:21.510> diagonal<00:00:22.080> or<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> triangle<00:00:22.710> here<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.279> make

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a diagonal or a triangle here and make

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.519 
a diagonal or a triangle here and make
sure<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.820> creases<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.320> nice

open it up crease it the other way just
like<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.110> an<00:00:37.380> X<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> middle

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
like this so you have an X in the middle

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.430 
like this so you have an X in the middle
lying<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.420> paper<00:00:39.629> down<00:00:39.930> you're<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
take one point one of the corners and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.350 
take one point one of the corners and
bring<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> center<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.940> X<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
bring it in to the center of the X that

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.540 
bring it in to the center of the X that
you've<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.750> created<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.469> make<00:00:47.129> sure<00:00:47.340> that

your your creases are sharp you can take

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
your your creases are sharp you can take
and<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> edge<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> ruler<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and use like the edge of a ruler you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770 
and use like the edge of a ruler you
could<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.590> use<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> pencil<00:00:53.570> something<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
could also use a pencil something you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
could also use a pencil something you
know<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.110> finger<00:00:55.410> isn't<00:00:55.559> working<00:00:56.010> very

well so once I've established that first

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.900 
well so once I've established that first
part<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.129> want<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> line<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.760> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
part because I want to line up this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.279 
part because I want to line up this
corner<00:01:00.329> I'm<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> hold<00:01:01.079> my

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
corner I'm going to kind of hold my

corner I'm going to kind of hold my
thumb<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.489> help<00:01:02.670> guide<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:02.969> put<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
thumb there to help guide it put it in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.120 
thumb there to help guide it put it in
the<00:01:03.930> center<00:01:05.150> bring<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.360> down

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
the center bring it down

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
the center bring it down
crease<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.810> turn<00:01:10.880> next<00:01:11.880> corner<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.450> holding

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
crease it turn next corner up holding

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.490 
crease it turn next corner up holding
that<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.439> corner<00:01:13.799> down<00:01:14.040> bringing<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.700> over

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
that other corner down bringing it over

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.859 
that other corner down bringing it over
crease<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.030> getting<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> last<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.689> up

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
crease it and getting the last one up

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.850 
crease it and getting the last one up
there<00:01:20.000> increasing<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.659> you've<00:01:21.840> got<00:01:22.590> all

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
there increasing that so you've got all

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.880 
there increasing that so you've got all
the<00:01:23.189> color<00:01:23.450> both<00:01:24.450> sides<00:01:24.780> turn<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> over<00:01:25.950> now

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
the color both sides turn it over now

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.899 
the color both sides turn it over now
repeat<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> same<00:01:29.250> thing<00:01:29.930> into<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> center

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
repeat the same thing into the center

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.190 
repeat the same thing into the center
creasing<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.600> careful<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
creasing it got to be careful so you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840 
creasing it got to be careful so you
don't<00:01:34.290> catch<00:01:34.500> those<00:01:34.799> flaps<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.460> inside

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
don't catch those flaps that are inside

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.069 
don't catch those flaps that are inside
there<00:01:36.060> because<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
there because you know it's kind of a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.380 
there because you know it's kind of a
double<00:01:37.380> side<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.970> guide<00:01:39.360> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
double side here but if you guide it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.740 
double side here but if you guide it
along<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:40.110> should<00:01:40.320> work<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.590> perfectly<00:01:41.340> fine

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
along it should work just perfectly fine

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.410 
along it should work just perfectly fine
bring<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> down<00:01:43.189> creasing<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.369> two<00:01:45.240> more

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
bring it down creasing it two more

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.990 
bring it down creasing it two more
corners

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.480 

so<00:01:53.570> you're<00:01:53.720> not<00:01:53.870> going<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.110> have<00:01:54.400> kind<00:01:55.400> of

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
so you're not going to have kind of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.910 
so you're not going to have kind of
these<00:01:55.670> here<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.330> these<00:01:57.050> flaps<00:01:57.380> here<00:01:57.710> but

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
these here and these flaps here but

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.200 
these here and these flaps here but
you've<00:01:58.070> got<00:01:58.220> one<00:01:58.400> more<00:01:58.580> step

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
you've got one more step

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.700 
you've got one more step
you've<00:01:59.540> already<00:01:59.750> down<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.200> side<00:02:00.500> you're

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
you've already down this side you're

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.500 
you've already down this side you're
going<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:01.100> what<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:01.670> did<00:02:01.850> one<00:02:02.450> more

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
going to do what you just did one more

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:12.280 
going to do what you just did one more
time<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.260> for<00:02:03.470> three<00:02:03.950> times

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.759 

you
