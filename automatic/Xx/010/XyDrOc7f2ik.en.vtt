 You are straw style liberal freedom lovers there 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.879

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.019
 But uh ... 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.099
 But one thing Jerry will do is share chances with the guns 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.339
 As I understand that uh ... 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.760
 arms 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.589
 Killing weapons 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.829

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.920
 In favor of allowing the local education districts to challenge the defender's premises 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.140

 In private schools is a good idea 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.850

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.250
 Statistical knowledge of each of these principles is gonna be around in 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.970
 Of the relative safety involved in that everyone is heavily armed 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.170
 In their schools
