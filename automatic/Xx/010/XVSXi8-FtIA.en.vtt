you<00:01:51.759> have<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.090> use<00:01:52.270> just<00:01:52.840> use<00:01:53.079> it<00:01:53.259> little<00:01:53.619> by

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
you have to use just use it little by

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.940 
you have to use just use it little by
little<00:01:54.749> sometimes<00:01:55.749> it<00:01:55.929> takes<00:01:56.170> more<00:01:56.469> vinegar

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
little sometimes it takes more vinegar

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.889 
little sometimes it takes more vinegar
to<00:01:57.159> curdle<00:01:57.490> sometimes<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:58.299> does<00:01:58.509> not<00:01:58.630> take

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
to curdle sometimes it does not take

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.940 
to curdle sometimes it does not take
much<00:01:58.929> so<00:01:59.740> at<00:02:00.369> this<00:02:00.609> point<00:02:00.880> my<00:02:01.060> milk<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:01.630> up

I will give it two more minutes when it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.580 
I will give it two more minutes when it
is<00:02:06.490> really<00:02:07.030> boiling<00:02:07.270> then<00:02:07.630> we'll<00:02:07.780> add<00:02:08.080> vinegar

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
so we pour that in be careful because it

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.039 
so we pour that in be careful because it
is<00:03:54.630> very<00:03:55.630> boiling<00:03:56.400> hot<00:03:57.400> liquid<00:03:57.940> handle<00:03:58.900> it

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
is very boiling hot liquid handle it

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.410 
is very boiling hot liquid handle it
carefully<00:03:59.230> so<00:04:00.160> once<00:04:00.459> this<00:04:00.700> has<00:04:00.910> done<00:04:03.299> what<00:04:04.299> I'm

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420

going to do is I am going to run cold

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.330 
going to do is I am going to run cold
water<00:04:07.150> at<00:04:07.389> a<00:04:07.420> slow<00:04:07.690> speed<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.230> better<00:04:08.769> easier

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
water at a slow speed the better easier

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.080 
water at a slow speed the better easier
way<00:04:09.549> is<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> grab<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.230> sides<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:12.090> your

granny<00:04:18.799> bag<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.859> when<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.370> am<00:04:22.430> going<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:25.330> keep

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
granny bag and when I am going to keep

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:34.719 
granny bag and when I am going to keep
the<00:04:26.750> vessel<00:04:26.900> side<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:28.520> run<00:04:29.229> cold<00:04:30.229> water

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.300 

you<00:04:35.120> see<00:04:35.270> what<00:04:35.569> is<00:04:35.689> happening<00:04:35.719> here<00:04:36.169> is<00:04:36.349> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
you see what is happening here is the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.600 
you see what is happening here is the
cold<00:04:37.580> water<00:04:37.639> helps<00:04:38.210> teas<00:04:39.199> to<00:04:39.469> get

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
cold water helps teas to get

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.490 
cold water helps teas to get
we<00:04:41.090> organized<00:04:41.540> with<00:04:41.810> basically<00:04:42.140> all<00:04:42.290> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
we organized with basically all the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.689 
we organized with basically all the
protein<00:04:42.890> will<00:04:43.400> get<00:04:43.640> assembled

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
protein will get assembled

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.510 
protein will get assembled
and<00:04:44.819> also<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.479> is<00:04:45.569> easier<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.020> handle<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.650> this

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
and also it is easier to handle and this

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.029 
and also it is easier to handle and this
alpha<00:04:47.909> versus<00:04:48.300> of<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.659> excess<00:04:49.110> vinegar<00:04:49.680> lemon

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
alpha versus of a excess vinegar lemon

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:50.959 
alpha versus of a excess vinegar lemon
whatever

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
whatever

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.309 
whatever
you<00:04:51.499> so<00:04:52.499> I'm<00:04:52.679> just<00:04:52.919> being<00:04:53.159> it<00:04:53.989> couple<00:04:54.989> minutes

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
you so I'm just being it couple minutes

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.819 
you so I'm just being it couple minutes
to<00:04:55.649> cool<00:04:55.860> down<00:04:56.189> under<00:04:56.549> cold<00:04:56.789> water<00:04:57.679> this<00:04:58.679> way

00:04:58.819 --> 00:04:58.829 
to cool down under cold water this way

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:01.740 
to cool down under cold water this way
it<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.039> easier<00:04:59.279> to<00:04:59.519> handle

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
it is easier to handle

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.960 
it is easier to handle
so<00:05:02.260> I'm<00:05:02.410> going<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.710> save<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:05.050> then<00:05:05.290> again

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
so I'm going to save it and then again

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.580 
so I'm going to save it and then again
pull<00:05:06.970> it<00:05:07.000> down<00:05:07.950> so<00:05:08.950> at<00:05:09.070> this<00:05:09.220> time<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:10.390> have<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.440> am

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
pull it down so at this time I have I am

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.410 
pull it down so at this time I have I am
done<00:05:12.100> running<00:05:12.130> cold<00:05:12.670> water<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:13.180> what<00:05:13.270> I'm

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
done running cold water so what I'm

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.110 
done running cold water so what I'm
going<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.720> do<00:05:14.230> is<00:05:14.500> I'm<00:05:14.710> going<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:15.010> keep<00:05:15.250> few

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
going to do is I'm going to keep few

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.850 
going to do is I'm going to keep few
twists<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:17.280> cloth<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:19.050> now<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.380> am<00:05:20.650> just

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
twists to this cloth and now I am just

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.790 
twists to this cloth and now I am just
going<00:05:20.980> to<00:05:21.220> tie<00:05:21.400> it<00:05:21.460> on<00:05:21.700> this<00:05:21.880> tap<00:05:22.150> and<00:05:22.650> keep<00:05:23.650> it

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
going to tie it on this tap and keep it

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.240 
going to tie it on this tap and keep it
like<00:05:23.980> that<00:05:24.010> for<00:05:24.310> 30<00:05:24.910> minutes<00:05:25.920> it's<00:05:26.920> that

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
like that for 30 minutes it's that

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.900 
like that for 30 minutes it's that
simple

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910

so<00:05:28.480> just<00:05:28.900> tie<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.200> on<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.080> have<00:05:32.380> tied<00:05:32.620> it

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
so just tie it on this so I have tied it

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.140 
so just tie it on this so I have tied it
on<00:05:33.250> my<00:05:33.700> tab

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
on my tab

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
few people like to put weights there is

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.460 
few people like to put weights there is
really<00:05:36.700> not<00:05:36.880> neat<00:05:37.180> not<00:05:37.540> any<00:05:37.690> need<00:05:37.930> we<00:05:38.110> want<00:05:38.380> to
