there's any rot though these grapes are
very<00:02:37.110> very<00:02:37.680> clean<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:39.299> so<00:02:39.569> there's<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.099> very

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
very very clean and so there's a very

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.030 
very very clean and so there's a very
little<00:02:41.370> little<00:02:42.000> rot<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.830> things

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
like to see this this golden to slightly

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.710 
like to see this this golden to slightly
brownish<00:02:52.230> color<00:02:53.120> which<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.299> get<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
brownish color which we get on the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.449 
brownish color which we get on the
outside<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.380> cluster<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:55.920> was<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.250> part

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
outside of the cluster this was the part

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.460 
outside of the cluster this was the part
that<00:02:56.519> was<00:02:56.730> facing<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> Sun<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.989> inside<00:02:58.350> of

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
that was facing the Sun the inside of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.180 
that was facing the Sun the inside of
the<00:02:58.560> cluster

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the cluster

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.990 
the cluster
this<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.209> actually<00:03:01.190> away<00:03:02.190> from<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.489> Sun<00:03:02.760> and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
this was actually away from the Sun and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.360 
this was actually away from the Sun and
it's<00:03:03.359> still<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:03.840> bit<00:03:04.019> green<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.709> one<00:03:05.250> of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's still a little bit green and one of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.559 
it's still a little bit green and one of
the<00:03:05.459> things<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:05.880> like<00:03:06.150> about<00:03:06.329> the

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
the things that I like about the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.270 
the things that I like about the
chardonnay<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.200> we<00:03:07.290> produce<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:08.100> that

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
chardonnay that we produce here is that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.490 
chardonnay that we produce here is that
real<00:03:08.519> balance<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.799> ripe<00:03:11.180> almost<00:03:12.410> kind<00:03:13.410> of

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
real balance of ripe almost kind of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.400 
real balance of ripe almost kind of
bottled<00:03:13.859> sunshine<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.079> green

bottled sunshine and the the green
lemony<00:03:16.980> flavors<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.819> make<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.569> wine<00:03:18.780> very

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
lemony flavors that make the wine very

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.250 
lemony flavors that make the wine very
refreshing<00:03:20.180> one<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.420> important<00:03:22.019> things

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
refreshing one of the important things

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.379 
refreshing one of the important things
to<00:03:22.380> note<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.280> fact<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.639> everybody<00:03:24.150> is

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
to note is the fact that everybody is

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.050 
to note is the fact that everybody is
using<00:03:24.870> these<00:03:25.019> these<00:03:25.769> small<00:03:26.100> clippers<00:03:26.579> and

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
using these these small clippers and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.420 
using these these small clippers and
this<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.109> one<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.709> things<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.100> we<00:03:29.220> do

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
this is one of the things that we do

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.420 
this is one of the things that we do
that<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.600> really<00:03:31.019> helps<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.040> improve

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
that that really helps to improve

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.250 
that that really helps to improve
quality<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.480> lot<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.660> areas<00:03:34.049> people

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
quality in a lot of areas people

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.190 
quality in a lot of areas people
actually<00:03:34.709> use<00:03:35.100> picking<00:03:35.549> knives<00:03:35.819> to<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:37.019> cut

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
actually use picking knives to to cut

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.199 
actually use picking knives to to cut
the<00:03:37.319> cluster<00:03:37.709> off<00:03:37.859> the<00:03:38.040> vine<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:38.910> find

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the cluster off the vine what we find

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.629 
the cluster off the vine what we find
though<00:03:39.480> when<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.930> use<00:03:40.139> a<00:03:40.170> knife<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.859> that<00:03:41.160> the

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
though when you use a knife is that the

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.849 
though when you use a knife is that the
cluster<00:03:41.850> gets<00:03:42.239> squeezed<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.079> everything

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
cluster gets squeezed and everything

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.280 
cluster gets squeezed and everything
that<00:03:44.010> we're<00:03:44.130> doing<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.609> this<00:03:44.760> process<00:03:45.299> is<00:03:45.510> is

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
that we're doing in this process is is

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.259 
that we're doing in this process is is
really<00:03:46.709> about<00:03:46.950> trying<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.519> treat<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.850> fruit

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
really about trying to treat the fruit

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.720 
really about trying to treat the fruit
as<00:03:48.540> as<00:03:48.810> gently<00:03:49.319> as<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.769> can<00:03:50.069> from<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.519> time

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
as as gently as we can from the time

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.850 
as as gently as we can from the time
that<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:51.000> harvest<00:03:51.450> until<00:03:51.659> we<00:03:51.959> take<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.620> grapes

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
that we harvest until we take the grapes

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.300 
that we harvest until we take the grapes
to<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.489> winery<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.810> that's<00:03:55.019> why<00:03:55.230> they<00:03:55.470> they

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
to the winery so that's why they they

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.400 
to the winery so that's why they they
use<00:03:56.549> these

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
use these

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.170 
use these
small<00:03:58.410> Clippers<00:03:58.830> it's<00:03:59.310> also<00:03:59.490> why<00:03:59.790> we<00:03:59.820> hand

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
small Clippers it's also why we hand

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.710 
small Clippers it's also why we hand
harvest<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.630> grapes<00:04:00.840> as<00:04:01.140> opposed<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:02.390> using<00:04:03.390> a

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
harvest the grapes as opposed to using a

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.810 
harvest the grapes as opposed to using a
giant<00:04:04.260> machine<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:05.280> would<00:04:05.430> run<00:04:05.610> through

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
giant machine that would run through

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.320 
giant machine that would run through
here<00:04:06.860> so<00:04:07.860> not<00:04:08.130> only<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.520> this<00:04:08.670> an<00:04:08.850> exciting

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
here so not only is this an exciting

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.660 
here so not only is this an exciting
time<00:04:09.540> for<00:04:09.600> me<00:04:09.930> when<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.250> know<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> feel<00:04:11.460> like
