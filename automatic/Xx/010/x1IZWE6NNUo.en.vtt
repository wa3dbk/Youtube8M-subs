00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
ton of rake in the hangar so when you

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.550 
ton of rake in the hangar so when you
flip<00:01:36.650> them<00:01:36.830> they<00:01:37.010> get<00:01:37.159> stupidly<00:01:38.090> low<00:01:38.530> so<00:01:39.530> you

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
flip them they get stupidly low so you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.910 
flip them they get stupidly low so you
can<00:01:39.890> do<00:01:40.070> um<00:01:40.810> downhill<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.990> them<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.470> don't

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
can do um downhill on them and don't

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.630 
can do um downhill on them and don't
need<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.280> worry<00:01:43.490> about<00:01:44.350> Wow<00:01:45.350> wobbles<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.460> not

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
need to worry about Wow wobbles and not

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.770 
need to worry about Wow wobbles and not
and<00:01:46.729> all<00:01:46.790> that<00:01:47.000> because<00:01:47.090> if<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.360> have<00:01:47.540> a<00:01:47.570> lot

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
and all that because if you have a lot

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.649 
and all that because if you have a lot
less<00:01:47.960> leverage<00:01:48.700> but<00:01:49.700> also<00:01:52.090> since<00:01:53.090> they<00:01:53.240> do<00:01:53.299> get

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
less leverage but also since they do get

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.440 
less leverage but also since they do get
really<00:01:53.930> really<00:01:54.229> low<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.070> top<00:01:55.430> mount<00:01:55.700> i'm

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
they are not restrictive by any means

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.879 
they are not restrictive by any means
which<00:02:43.069> i<00:02:43.370> really<00:02:43.579> like<00:02:43.700> for<00:02:44.000> free<00:02:44.180> ride<00:02:44.389> so<00:02:44.889> you

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
which i really like for free ride so you

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.190 
which i really like for free ride so you
get<00:02:46.069> up<00:02:46.189> the<00:02:46.430> full<00:02:46.700> range<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.239> motion<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.930> they

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
get up the full range of motion and they

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.979 
get up the full range of motion and they
also<00:02:48.379> do<00:02:48.829> give<00:02:49.159> you<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> lot<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.819> lean<00:02:50.120> but

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
also do give you a lot of lean but

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.050 
also do give you a lot of lean but
that's<00:02:51.139> also<00:02:51.349> in<00:02:51.650> your<00:02:51.680> bushings<00:02:52.159> to<00:02:52.430> UM<00:02:53.409> and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
that's also in your bushings to UM and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.199 
that's also in your bushings to UM and
with<00:02:56.060> these<00:02:56.239> they<00:02:57.169> do<00:02:57.230> feature<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.129> very<00:02:58.639> long

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
with these they do feature a very long

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.479 
with these they do feature a very long
pivot<00:03:00.280> um<00:03:01.280> but<00:03:02.030> also<00:03:02.209> one<00:03:02.599> thing<00:03:02.750> too<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.230> that

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
pivot um but also one thing too is that

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.729 
pivot um but also one thing too is that
even<00:03:04.489> like<00:03:04.879> brand<00:03:05.359> new<00:03:05.510> there<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.439> a<00:03:06.470> lot<00:03:06.680> of

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
even like brand new there was a lot of

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.949 
even like brand new there was a lot of
slop<00:03:07.250> in<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.819> pivot<00:03:08.090> cups<00:03:08.239> oh<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.480> just<00:03:08.569> wrapped

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
slop in the pivot cups oh I just wrapped

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.080 
slop in the pivot cups oh I just wrapped
a<00:03:09.049> piece<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.230> duct<00:03:09.590> tape<00:03:09.680> around<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.220> pivot<00:03:10.760> so

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
a piece of duct tape around the pivot so

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.949 
a piece of duct tape around the pivot so
you<00:03:11.989> don't<00:03:12.139> get<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.829> unnecessary<00:03:13.959> slob

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
you don't get all that unnecessary slob

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.649 
you don't get all that unnecessary slob
um<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:17.000> also<00:03:17.329> as<00:03:18.319> far<00:03:18.349> as<00:03:18.590> these<00:03:19.519> with<00:03:20.150> bending

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
um and also as far as these with bending

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.860 
um and also as far as these with bending
axles<00:03:21.199> go<00:03:21.379> um<00:03:22.209> haven't<00:03:23.209> had<00:03:23.449> much<00:03:23.629> of<00:03:23.690> a

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
axles go um haven't had much of a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.500 
axles go um haven't had much of a
problem<00:03:24.049> yet<00:03:24.500> I've<00:03:24.739> had<00:03:25.099> these<00:03:25.280> for<00:03:25.609> super

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
problem yet I've had these for super

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.280 
problem yet I've had these for super
long<00:03:26.720> but<00:03:27.650> these<00:03:28.430> are<00:03:28.900> these<00:03:29.900> do<00:03:30.109> you<00:03:30.169> have<00:03:30.260> a

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
long but these are these do you have a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.509 
long but these are these do you have a
decent<00:03:30.470> amount<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.769> use<00:03:30.919> because<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.220> didn't

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
decent amount of use because I didn't

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.619 
decent amount of use because I didn't
get<00:03:31.579> them<00:03:31.760> used<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:33.620> hangers<00:03:34.099> are<00:03:34.629> not

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
get them used and the hangers are not

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.770 
get them used and the hangers are not
really<00:03:35.959> that<00:03:36.139> bent<00:03:36.500> compared<00:03:37.099> to<00:03:37.340> on<00:03:37.780> how

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
really that bent compared to on how

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.869 
really that bent compared to on how
Randall's<00:03:39.379> or<00:03:39.500> pears<00:03:39.769> would<00:03:40.190> get<00:03:40.430> after

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
Randall's or pears would get after

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.689 
Randall's or pears would get after
around<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.359> same<00:03:41.540> amount<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.930> use<00:03:42.519> thanks<00:03:43.519> to

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
around the same amount of use thanks to

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.569 
around the same amount of use thanks to
the<00:03:43.970> ultra<00:03:44.479> beefy<00:03:44.930> design<00:03:45.349> and<00:03:45.709> these<00:03:46.370> have

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
the ultra beefy design and these have

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.180 
the ultra beefy design and these have
nice<00:03:46.940> really<00:03:47.629> large<00:03:47.959> gussets<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:49.010> should

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
nice really large gussets to it should

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.580 
nice really large gussets to it should
keep<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.609> supported<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:53.109> also<00:03:54.109> these<00:03:54.260> trucks

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
keep it supported and also these trucks

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.849 
keep it supported and also these trucks
to<00:03:54.799> they<00:03:55.069> do<00:03:55.269> have<00:03:56.269> very<00:03:56.989> similar<00:03:57.290> wheel<00:03:57.620> base

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
to they do have very similar wheel base

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.140 
to they do have very similar wheel base
effect<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.549> of<00:03:58.939> calibers<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.709> if<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:02.030> are

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
effect to that of calibers so if you are

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.379 
effect to that of calibers so if you are
comparing<00:04:02.900> these<00:04:03.079> two<00:04:03.139> Randall's<00:04:03.799> um<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:05.299> are

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
comparing these two Randall's um you are

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.949 
comparing these two Randall's um you are
going<00:04:05.479> to<00:04:05.540> get<00:04:05.629> a<00:04:05.689> shorter<00:04:06.139> wheelbase<00:04:07.959> it's

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
going to get a shorter wheelbase it's

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.569 
going to get a shorter wheelbase it's
all<00:04:09.079> preference<00:04:09.379> but<00:04:09.859> I<00:04:09.919> prefer<00:04:10.370> like<00:04:10.549> a

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
all preference but I prefer like a

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.969 
all preference but I prefer like a
slightly<00:04:10.909> longer<00:04:11.150> wheelbase<00:04:11.540> well<00:04:12.379> truck

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
slightly longer wheelbase well truck

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:13.990 
slightly longer wheelbase well truck
that<00:04:13.129> gives<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.459> a<00:04:13.489> slightly<00:04:13.639> longer

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
that gives you a slightly longer

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.629 
that gives you a slightly longer
wheelbase<00:04:14.739> mostly<00:04:15.739> because<00:04:15.889> wheel<00:04:16.430> bite

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
wheelbase mostly because wheel bite

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.849 
wheelbase mostly because wheel bite
issues<00:04:17.090> on<00:04:18.669> board<00:04:19.669> with<00:04:19.849> cutouts<00:04:20.329> or<00:04:21.019> even

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
issues on board with cutouts or even

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.070 
issues on board with cutouts or even
with<00:04:22.010> ike<00:04:22.190> not<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.820> really<00:04:23.120> did<00:04:23.270> wheel<00:04:23.810> wells

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
with ike not that really did wheel wells

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.300 
with ike not that really did wheel wells
either<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:26.090> these

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
either and these

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.560 
either and these
sit<00:04:27.850> I'll<00:04:28.600> on<00:04:29.020> flip<00:04:29.440> two<00:04:30.400> point<00:04:30.760> six<00:04:31.060> inches

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
sit I'll on flip two point six inches

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.460 
sit I'll on flip two point six inches
off<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:31.990> ground<00:04:32.590> so<00:04:33.330> they<00:04:34.330> do<00:04:34.389> sit<00:04:34.810> pretty

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
off the ground so they do sit pretty

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.040 
off the ground so they do sit pretty
high<00:04:35.860> but<00:04:36.520> it's<00:04:36.910> not<00:04:37.419> really<00:04:37.540> that<00:04:37.720> much<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
high but it's not really that much of a

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.290 
high but it's not really that much of a
problem<00:04:38.080> because<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:39.130> can<00:04:39.310> just<00:04:39.340> get<00:04:39.880> used<00:04:40.060> to

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
problem because you can just get used to

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
problem because you can just get used to
it<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:42.460> if<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:42.880> have<00:04:43.000> any<00:04:43.150> questions<00:04:43.690> just

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
it and if you have any questions just

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.080 
it and if you have any questions just
comment<00:04:44.860> below<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:46.360> will<00:04:46.389> get<00:04:46.660> back<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:47.050> you
