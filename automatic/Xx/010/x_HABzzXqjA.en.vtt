00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
ECW title which was a good choice for

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.690 
ECW title which was a good choice for

one<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.030> top<00:01:55.270> hardcore<00:01:55.810> legends<00:01:56.550> they

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
one of the top hardcore legends they

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.280 
one of the top hardcore legends they
also<00:01:57.730> did<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> really<00:01:58.390> good<00:01:58.570> job<00:01:58.630> on<00:01:58.990> his<00:01:59.110> entry

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
also did a really good job on his entry

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.020 
also did a really good job on his entry
so<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.590> looks<00:01:59.740> just<00:02:00.070> like<00:02:00.250> something<00:02:00.640> dreaming

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
so it looks just like something dreaming

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.850 
so it looks just like something dreaming
would<00:02:01.180> do<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:01.900> how<00:02:02.080> they<00:02:02.290> threw<00:02:02.590> in<00:02:02.680> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
would do I like how they threw in the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.490 
would do I like how they threw in the
shouting<00:02:03.430> taunt<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.000> he<00:02:04.150> does<00:02:04.390> every<00:02:05.350> once

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
shouting taunt that he does every once

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.290 
shouting taunt that he does every once
in<00:02:05.650> a<00:02:05.710> while<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.160> think<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.610> was<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.060> nice

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
in a while and I think that was a nice

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.160 
in a while and I think that was a nice
touch<00:02:07.540> as<00:02:07.960> far<00:02:08.290> as<00:02:08.440> his<00:02:08.649> finishers<00:02:09.250> go<00:02:09.460> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
touch as far as his finishers go I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.480 
touch as far as his finishers go I
thought<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.500> dreamer<00:02:11.740> driver<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.370> we

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
thought that the dreamer driver that we

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.430 
thought that the dreamer driver that we
got<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.850> year<00:02:13.120> looks<00:02:13.360> great<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.320> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
got this year looks great that is the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.560 
got this year looks great that is the
one<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.710> he's<00:02:14.860> been<00:02:15.100> doing<00:02:15.250> recently<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
one that he's been doing recently in the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.290 
one that he's been doing recently in the
current<00:02:16.930> ECW<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:18.220> hopefully<00:02:18.580> we<00:02:18.760> also<00:02:18.910> get

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
current ECW but hopefully we also get
