00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
$300 price tag well first of all it's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
$300 price tag well first of all it's
it's<00:00:43.530> force-feedback<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.640> forced<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> vac<00:00:45.480> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it's force-feedback but forced to vac is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
it's force-feedback but forced to vac is
on<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.930> lot<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.410> racing<00:00:46.860> wheels<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.190> what<00:00:47.280> makes

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
on a lot of racing wheels so what makes

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
on a lot of racing wheels so what makes
this<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.760> special<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.899> well<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this one special this one well first of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.540 
this one special this one well first of
all<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:49.980> made<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> higher<00:00:50.370> quality

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
all it's just made of higher quality

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.130 
all it's just made of higher quality
components<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.239> actually<00:00:51.539> has<00:00:51.629> dual<00:00:51.840> motor

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
components but actually has dual motor

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319 
components but actually has dual motor
so<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.039> forced<00:00:53.370> feedback<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.850> two<00:00:54.030> motors

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
so it's forced feedback with two motors

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.110 
so it's forced feedback with two motors
inside<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.780> opposed<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.910> it's<00:00:56.910> actually

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
inside as opposed to one it's actually

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.080 
inside as opposed to one it's actually
got<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.809> full-out<00:00:58.620> shifter<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.940> can

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
got a full-out shifter so you can

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.299 
got a full-out shifter so you can
actually<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.719> full-out<00:01:01.469> shifting<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
actually do full-out shifting with it

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.560 
actually do full-out shifting with it
when<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:02.879> doing<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.239> racing

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
when you're when you're doing a racing

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.899 
when you're when you're doing a racing
game<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> complaints<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.790> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
game one of the complaints is that it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
game one of the complaints is that it
does<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.360> reverse<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.990> I'm<00:01:07.229> looking<00:01:07.680> at

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
does not have reverse but I'm looking at

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
does not have reverse but I'm looking at
right<00:01:07.920> now<00:01:07.950> when<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> has<00:01:08.520> reverse<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.299> maybe

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
right now when it has reverse so maybe

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
right now when it has reverse so maybe
those<00:01:10.140> people<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.530> free<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> g25<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.640> don't

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
those people are free to g25 I don't

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.310 
those people are free to g25 I don't
know<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.420> say<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.810> according<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
know but all I can say is according to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.469 
know but all I can say is according to
the<00:01:13.439> Box<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.369> does<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.000> reverse

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the Box this one does have a reverse

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.200 
the Box this one does have a reverse
gear<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.530> also<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.890> LEDs<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.970> right

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
gear on here it also has LEDs so right

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
gear on here it also has LEDs so right
around<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.720> top<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.110> wheel<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:19.470> actually

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
around on top of the wheel here actually

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.950 
around on top of the wheel here actually
has<00:01:20.040> LEDs<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.640> there<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.360> games<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.869> are

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
has LEDs in there so for games that are

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.070 
has LEDs in there so for games that are
compatible<00:01:22.640> it'll<00:01:23.640> actually<00:01:23.790> show<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.630> rpm

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
compatible it'll actually show your rpm

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.380 
compatible it'll actually show your rpm
on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.590> wheel<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> let<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
on the wheel and let you know when to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
on the wheel and let you know when to
shift<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> choice<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.400> can

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
shift so you have a choice you can

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.310 
shift so you have a choice you can

far<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.829> real<00:01:47.009> car<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.670> can

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
far as it can go in a real car you can

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.280 
far as it can go in a real car you can
do<00:01:47.909> more<00:01:48.060> than<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.049> does

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
do more than that so this one does

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.520 
do more than that so this one does
support<00:01:49.799> full<00:01:50.159> 900<00:01:50.790> degree<00:01:51.060> turning<00:01:51.530> what

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
support full 900 degree turning what

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.160 
support full 900 degree turning what
else<00:01:52.649> does<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.100> real<00:01:53.790> leather<00:01:54.170> obviously

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
else does it have real leather obviously

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.429 
else does it have real leather obviously
I<00:01:55.409> would<00:01:56.070> expect<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.640> as<00:01:57.540> well<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.259> made

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
I would expect that as well as it's made

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.929 
I would expect that as well as it's made
out<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> full<00:01:59.070> steel<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.020> steel<00:02:01.020> around<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
out of full steel so a steel around I

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.120 
out of full steel so a steel around I
guess

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
guess

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.920 
guess
the<00:02:03.250> internal<00:02:03.640> guts<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:03.969> also<00:02:04.180> use<00:02:04.450> Steel's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
the internal guts that also use Steel's

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.270 
the internal guts that also use Steel's
I<00:02:05.020> guess<00:02:05.289> some<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.649> cheaper<00:02:05.920> wheels<00:02:06.070> use

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
I guess some of the cheaper wheels use

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.510 
I guess some of the cheaper wheels use
more<00:02:06.549> plasticky<00:02:07.090> type<00:02:07.329> components<00:02:08.289> so<00:02:08.619> not

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
more plasticky type components so not

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.830 
more plasticky type components so not
too<00:02:09.700> too<00:02:09.849> much<00:02:09.970> else<00:02:10.209> that's<00:02:10.420> pretty<00:02:10.599> much<00:02:10.660> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
too too much else that's pretty much the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.509 
too too much else that's pretty much the
same<00:02:10.959> takes<00:02:11.260> your<00:02:11.410> all<00:02:11.500> throughout<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.069> has

pretty bad it's artists it used to have
a<00:02:52.810> legitimate<00:02:53.200> wheel<00:02:53.470> which<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.830> have<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.250> I'm

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
a legitimate wheel which I have but I'm

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.650 
a legitimate wheel which I have but I'm
selling<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:54.970> because<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.209> doesn't<00:02:55.329> work<00:02:55.540> too

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
selling it because it doesn't work too

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.970 
selling it because it doesn't work too
well<00:02:55.690> for<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> computer<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.440> new<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:56.799> is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
well for the computer but the new one is

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.400 
well for the computer but the new one is
it's<00:02:57.579> not<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> wheel<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.420> big<00:02:58.599> u-shaped<00:02:58.930> and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
it's not a wheel it's a big u-shaped and

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.860 
it's not a wheel it's a big u-shaped and
you<00:02:59.470> like<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.239> hold<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.599> in<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.750> air

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you like this is you hold it in the air

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.470 
you like this is you hold it in the air
and<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.650> guess<00:03:03.099> it's<00:03:03.280> what<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.459> connect

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
and I guess it's what that connect

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.020 
and I guess it's what that connect
my<00:03:04.690> problem<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.349> don't<00:03:05.470> know<00:03:05.769> I'm<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.430> Z<00:03:06.489> I'm<00:03:06.880> not

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
my problem I don't know I'm a Z I'm not

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.569 
my problem I don't know I'm a Z I'm not
so<00:03:07.209> fond<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.690> ok<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.859> taking<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> look<00:03:09.400> at

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
so fond of it ok so taking a look at

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.090 
so fond of it ok so taking a look at
this<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:09.940> you've<00:03:10.090> got<00:03:10.269> several<00:03:11.230> components<00:03:11.980> in

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
this so you've got several components in

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.900 
this so you've got several components in
here<00:03:12.250> we're<00:03:12.370> going<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.549> start<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
here we're going to start with the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.690 
here we're going to start with the
smaller<00:03:13.180> items<00:03:13.569> such<00:03:13.930> as<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.380> AC<00:03:14.920> adapter

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
smaller items such as the AC adapter

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.220 
smaller items such as the AC adapter
unit<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.329> fairly<00:03:17.260> basic<00:03:17.620> it's<00:03:18.069> some<00:03:19.019> about<00:03:20.019> the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
unit so fairly basic it's some about the

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.160 
unit so fairly basic it's some about the
size<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:21.069> notebook<00:03:21.519> charger<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.480> pretty

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
size of a notebook charger so pretty

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.580 
size of a notebook charger so pretty
pretty<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:25.480> same<00:03:25.750> their<00:03:27.959> power<00:03:28.959> core

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
pretty the same their power core

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.140 
pretty the same their power core
this<00:03:29.889> one<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.220> removable<00:03:30.700> which<00:03:30.819> is<00:03:30.970> nice

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
this one is removable which is nice

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.879 
this one is removable which is nice
because<00:03:31.389> if<00:03:31.660> this<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:32.049> not<00:03:32.200> long<00:03:32.470> enough<00:03:32.500> for

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
because if this is not long enough for

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.129

all<00:05:11.620> that<00:05:12.190> pressure<00:05:12.550> on<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:12.880> wire<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.270> do<00:05:13.479> not

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
all that pressure on the wire you do not

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.800 
all that pressure on the wire you do not
want<00:05:14.350> pressure<00:05:14.710> on<00:05:14.950> your<00:05:15.100> wire<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:16.060> what<00:05:16.690> else

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
want pressure on your wire so what else

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.640 
want pressure on your wire so what else
do<00:05:16.900> we<00:05:16.960> have<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.289> this<00:05:17.789> box<00:05:18.789> here<00:05:19.470> we've<00:05:20.470> got

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
do we have in this box here we've got

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.210 
do we have in this box here we've got
the<00:05:21.720> shifter<00:05:22.720> here<00:05:22.990> it's<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.590> separate

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
the shifter here it's a separate

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.550 
the shifter here it's a separate
attachment<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:25.030> you<00:05:25.660> can<00:05:25.840> either<00:05:25.930> attach<00:05:26.350> it

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
attachment so you can either attach it

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.600 
attachment so you can either attach it
or<00:05:26.710> detaching<00:05:27.400> it's<00:05:28.060> got<00:05:28.390> the<00:05:29.110> clamps<00:05:29.530> here<00:05:29.770> to

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
or detaching it's got the clamps here to

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.060 
or detaching it's got the clamps here to
plant<00:05:31.180> the<00:05:31.300> to<00:05:31.510> your<00:05:31.990> desk<00:05:32.289> and<00:05:32.500> all<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.830> I'm

plant the to your desk and all that I'm

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.070 
plant the to your desk and all that I'm
not<00:05:33.850> sure<00:05:34.060> specifically<00:05:34.570> how<00:05:34.720> it<00:05:34.750> works<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:35.020> lot

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
not sure specifically how it works a lot

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.900 
not sure specifically how it works a lot
to<00:05:35.260> experiment<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.860> this<00:05:36.010> one<00:05:36.190> is<00:05:36.340> again<00:05:36.729> the

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
to experiment and this one is again the

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.969 
to experiment and this one is again the
same<00:05:37.090> type<00:05:37.300> of<00:05:37.330> plug<00:05:37.630> it's<00:05:38.350> actually<00:05:38.800> got<00:05:38.950> a

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
same type of plug it's actually got a

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.830 
same type of plug it's actually got a
bunch<00:05:39.190> of<00:05:39.340> programmable<00:05:40.000> keys<00:05:40.270> up<00:05:40.450> here<00:05:40.660> too

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
bunch of programmable keys up here too

bunch of programmable keys up here too
as<00:05:41.020> well<00:05:41.169> as<00:05:41.289> a<00:05:41.350> d-pad<00:05:41.650> so<00:05:41.919> fairly<00:05:42.220> interesting

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
as well as a d-pad so fairly interesting

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.400 
as well as a d-pad so fairly interesting
for<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.060> shifter<00:05:43.450> so<00:05:43.740> as<00:05:44.740> it<00:05:45.039> is<00:05:45.220> using<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.640> h1

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
for the shifter so as it is using the h1

all<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.050> way<00:05:48.169> down<00:05:48.919> for<00:05:49.160> a<00:05:49.220> verse<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.729> it's

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
all the way down for a verse and it's

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.870 
all the way down for a verse and it's
got<00:05:50.060> leather<00:05:50.360> on<00:05:50.660> the<00:05:51.169> actual<00:05:51.590> ball<00:05:52.130> part<00:05:52.639> of

that what they call it I guess I mean

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.210 
that what they call it I guess I mean
it's<00:05:59.270> not<00:05:59.449> like<00:05:59.509> a<00:05:59.720> skirt<00:06:00.169> the<00:06:00.680> skirt<00:06:00.710> that's

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
it's not like a skirt the skirt that's

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.100

the<00:06:01.430> term<00:06:01.610> to<00:06:01.759> skirt<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.419> skirt<00:06:02.449> for<00:06:02.930> it<00:06:03.020> is

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
the term to skirt the skirt for it is

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.350 
the term to skirt the skirt for it is
also<00:06:03.259> leather<00:06:03.830> which<00:06:04.160> is<00:06:04.370> phenomenal

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
also leather which is phenomenal

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
thing is to make no it shows the H

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.590 
thing is to make no it shows the H
pattern<00:06:09.919> but<00:06:10.100> does<00:06:10.250> not<00:06:10.430> show<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.789> numbers<00:06:11.240> so

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
pattern but does not show the numbers so

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.060 
pattern but does not show the numbers so
that's<00:06:11.840> one<00:06:12.080> complaint<00:06:12.500> that<00:06:12.530> some<00:06:12.770> people

enjoy<00:06:16.960> using<00:06:17.960> an<00:06:18.080> actual<00:06:18.380> shifter<00:06:18.919> this<00:06:19.460> one

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
enjoy using an actual shifter this one

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.150 
enjoy using an actual shifter this one
does<00:06:19.970> have<00:06:20.000> paddle<00:06:20.930> shifts<00:06:21.349> so<00:06:21.889> if<00:06:21.979> you're

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
does have paddle shifts so if you're

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.830 
does have paddle shifts so if you're
using<00:06:22.340> more<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.729> Formula<00:06:23.150> One<00:06:23.300> style<00:06:23.570> then

using more the Formula One style then

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.409 
using more the Formula One style then
that's<00:06:24.050> great<00:06:24.349> the<00:06:24.770> shifters<00:06:25.490> are<00:06:25.699> full<00:06:26.090> metal

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
that's great the shifters are full metal

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.600 
that's great the shifters are full metal
which<00:06:26.720> the<00:06:26.960> xbox<00:06:27.349> 360<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:27.889> paddles<00:06:28.340> on<00:06:28.460> there

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
which the xbox 360 the paddles on there

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.490 
which the xbox 360 the paddles on there
were<00:06:28.729> actually<00:06:29.090> classic<00:06:29.539> so<00:06:29.660> this<00:06:29.810> is<00:06:29.930> full

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
were actually classic so this is full

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.189 
were actually classic so this is full
metal<00:06:30.770> it's<00:06:31.370> got<00:06:31.550> a<00:06:31.580> very<00:06:32.030> very<00:06:32.210> satisfying

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199

programmable keys on the steering wheel

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.150 
programmable keys on the steering wheel
which<00:06:39.169> would<00:06:39.320> be<00:06:39.410> nice<00:06:39.590> because<00:06:39.830> if<00:06:39.949> you're<00:06:40.130> in

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
which would be nice because if you're in

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.680 
which would be nice because if you're in
your<00:06:40.280> game<00:06:40.520> and<00:06:40.669> you<00:06:40.759> program<00:06:41.210> it<00:06:41.330> to<00:06:41.449> switch

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
your game and you program it to switch

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.330 
your game and you program it to switch
the<00:06:41.870> song<00:06:42.080> then<00:06:42.470> it's<00:06:42.650> kind<00:06:42.860> of<00:06:42.889> like<00:06:43.039> you<00:06:43.130> just

the song then it's kind of like you just
kind<00:06:43.520> of<00:06:43.550> drive<00:06:43.789> you<00:06:43.910> just<00:06:44.090> switch<00:06:44.270> the<00:06:44.419> song

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
kind of drive you just switch the song

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.379 
kind of drive you just switch the song

at the push of a thumb button which

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.770 
at the push of a thumb button which
would<00:06:47.539> be<00:06:47.630> pretty<00:06:47.810> damn<00:06:48.020> cool<00:06:48.349> it's<00:06:49.190> got<00:06:49.370> full

is<00:06:55.970> that<00:06:56.120> it's<00:06:56.560> surprisingly<00:06:57.560> quiet<00:06:57.860> because

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
is that it's surprisingly quiet because

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.300 
is that it's surprisingly quiet because
the<00:06:58.820> g27<00:06:59.360> is<00:06:59.720> an<00:06:59.810> upgrade<00:07:00.139> from<00:07:00.260> the<00:07:00.380> g25<00:07:00.860> so

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
the g27 is an upgrade from the g25 so

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.700 
the g27 is an upgrade from the g25 so
they<00:07:01.669> made<00:07:01.849> a<00:07:01.880> kick-ass<00:07:02.180> racing<00:07:02.900> wheel<00:07:03.050> listen

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
they made a kick-ass racing wheel listen

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.260 
they made a kick-ass racing wheel listen
to<00:07:03.860> what<00:07:04.039> the<00:07:04.159> complaints<00:07:04.639> were<00:07:04.729> about<00:07:04.970> it<00:07:05.120> and

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
they fixed it really sit the complaints

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:08.529 
they fixed it really sit the complaints
with<00:07:07.820> the<00:07:07.909> g25

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:08.539 
with the g25

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.719 
with the g25
was<00:07:08.990> the<00:07:09.110> shifter<00:07:09.500> felt<00:07:09.800> very<00:07:09.979> plasticky<00:07:10.610> and

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:10.729 
was the shifter felt very plasticky and

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.909 
was the shifter felt very plasticky and
fake<00:07:10.940> they<00:07:11.300> upgraded<00:07:11.870> that<00:07:12.050> this<00:07:12.500> thing<00:07:12.740> was

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
fake they upgraded that this thing was

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:15.129 
fake they upgraded that this thing was
very<00:07:13.159> very<00:07:13.580> very<00:07:13.820> noisy<00:07:14.360> but<00:07:14.539> now<00:07:14.810> is<00:07:14.960> not<00:07:15.080> a

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:15.139 
very very very noisy but now is not a

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.210 
very very very noisy but now is not a
good<00:07:15.289> time<00:07:15.500> to<00:07:15.530> test<00:07:15.770> it<00:07:15.830> because<00:07:15.919> it's<00:07:16.159> not

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
good time to test it because it's not

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.070 
good time to test it because it's not
even<00:07:16.490> on<00:07:16.669> but<00:07:16.970> they<00:07:17.360> made<00:07:17.539> it<00:07:17.659> a<00:07:17.690> lot<00:07:17.840> quieter

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
even on but they made it a lot quieter

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.180 
even on but they made it a lot quieter

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
for the g27
