and then it's got the black siding which

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.090 
and then it's got the black siding which
will<00:01:24.270> protect<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.840> sides<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.830> still

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

so<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.299> basically<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so this one if you this is basically the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.420 
so this one if you this is basically the
starter<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> next<00:01:50.100> level

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
starter this is kind of the next level

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.219 
starter this is kind of the next level
up<00:01:50.640> where<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> signing<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.780> then

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
up where you have the signing and then

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.609 
up where you have the signing and then
our<00:01:52.409> final<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.570> flex<00:01:55.020> fit<00:01:55.320> pad

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
our final one this is the flex fit pad

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.080 
our final one this is the flex fit pad
this<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> flexpay<00:01:56.369> Pat<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.729> actually

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this is the flexpay Pat this is actually

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.630 
this is the flexpay Pat this is actually
my<00:01:57.180> favorite<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.899> these<00:01:58.049> three<00:01:58.640> basically

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
my favorite of these three basically

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
my favorite of these three basically
it's<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.000> clear<00:02:00.299> pad<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.680> made<00:02:01.979> out

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it's just a clear pad that is made out

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's just a clear pad that is made out
of<00:02:02.130> silicone<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.299> very

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
of silicone so you can see it's very

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.749 
of silicone so you can see it's very
flexible<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.860> goes<00:02:05.070> all<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> way<00:02:05.610> around

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
flexible but it goes all the way around

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.290 
flexible but it goes all the way around
and<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.380> fits<00:02:07.950> very<00:02:08.369> snug<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and it really fits very snug with the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.270 
and it really fits very snug with the
and<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:10.080> pretty<00:02:10.320> simple<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.680> put<00:02:10.830> on<00:02:11.010> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
and it's pretty simple to put on and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.400 
and it's pretty simple to put on and
once<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> put<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.820> on<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.570> really<00:02:13.050> really

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
once you put it on it's really really

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.200 
once you put it on it's really really
nice<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.890> protects<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.370> only<00:02:14.430> sides<00:02:14.880> but

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
nice that it protects not only sides but

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.440 
nice that it protects not only sides but
the<00:02:15.330> back<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.470> really<00:02:17.000> do<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> lot<00:02:18.120> with

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
the back so you can really do a lot with

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.940 
the back so you can really do a lot with
it<00:02:18.510> not<00:02:18.780> have<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.140> worry<00:02:19.350> about<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> one

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
it not have to worry about it the one

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.990 
it not have to worry about it the one
thing<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.250> want<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.580> make<00:02:20.670> sure<00:02:20.730> you're

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
thing I do want to make sure you're

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.310 
thing I do want to make sure you're
thinking<00:02:21.360> about<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.690> how<00:02:21.930> are<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
thinking about is how are you going to

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.110 
thinking about is how are you going to
use<00:02:22.440> your<00:02:22.590> iPad<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.700> should<00:02:23.880> dictate

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
use your iPad and that should dictate

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.400 
use your iPad and that should dictate
what<00:02:24.570> type<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.750> case<00:02:25.020> you're<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.350> to

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
what type of case you're going to

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.740

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
purchase for instance with this this is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.660

your iPad but better yet find one that
actually<00:02:46.140> has<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> cover<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.310> protects<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.820> so

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
actually has a cover that protects it so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.640 
actually has a cover that protects it so
if<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> put<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.390> backpack<00:02:48.570> things<00:02:49.440> aren't

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.270 
going that's on top of your iPad in risk
breaking<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:52.560> these<00:02:52.740> screens<00:02:53.070> are

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
breaking it because these screens are

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.130 
breaking it because these screens are
very<00:02:53.550> expensive<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.120> then<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:54.870> void<00:02:55.050> your
