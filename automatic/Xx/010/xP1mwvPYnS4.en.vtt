00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
yourselves at LSC and I mean it's not

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
yourselves at LSC and I mean it's not
exactly<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.750> same<00:01:00.960> thing<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.460> much

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
exactly the same thing like it's a much

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.880 
exactly the same thing like it's a much
deeper<00:01:03.059> purple<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> used<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
deeper purple the one that I used but it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.289 
deeper purple the one that I used but it
was<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> closest<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> could<00:01:05.760> actually<00:01:05.880> get

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
was the closest you could actually get

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.460 
was the closest you could actually get
at<00:01:07.200> los<00:01:07.380> santos<00:01:07.710> customs<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.610> i<00:01:09.060> think<00:01:09.600> what's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
at los santos customs and i think what's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.320 
at los santos customs and i think what's
even<00:01:10.590> better<00:01:10.770> about<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.400> remake<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
even better about the remake is that it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.440 
even better about the remake is that it
actually<00:01:12.890> glows<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.310> dark<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:15.060> bloody

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
actually glows in the dark really bloody

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
actually glows in the dark really bloody
brightly<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.189> really<00:01:17.460> nice

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
brightly like it's it's a really nice

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
brightly like it's it's a really nice
color<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.330> looks<00:01:18.360> modded<00:01:18.960> even<00:01:19.409> though

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
color and it looks modded even though

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
color and it looks modded even though
it's<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.280> something<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.060> made<00:01:21.299> at<00:01:21.840> LSC
