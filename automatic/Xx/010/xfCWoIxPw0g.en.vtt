00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
lash line as possible and you might need

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.469 
lash line as possible and you might need

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
to move it back and forth so that way it

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.530 
to move it back and forth so that way it
will<00:04:57.750> be<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.470> correct<00:04:58.830> spot<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.640> it<00:05:00.270> looks

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
will be in the correct spot and it looks

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.200 
will be in the correct spot and it looks
natural<00:05:01.050> as<00:05:01.500> possible<00:05:02.040> so<00:05:02.610> next<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.150> just
