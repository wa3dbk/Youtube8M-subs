00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.679
 today a new video of 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.689
 presentation video presentation a 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.499
 memory kit from home 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.380
 kingston xom hyperx predator so 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.449
 logically we had thought so come a 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.850
 former governor of california for 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.010
 make the video we were denied 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.170
 budget issue would seem so its 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.340
 scholar makes humble servant who will do 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.100
 the presentation video 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.690
 So here we are going to discover the left 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.809
 notice right now huh not exceed 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.519
 to kingson is black pcb recently 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.679
 but here we still have on the green pcb at 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.980
 aluminum level is bluish with 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.199
 a black x which bar all together 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.940
 pretty pretty 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:09.530
 it's very open to the gamer 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:14.509
 5 which is very clean then the pcd 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.500
 measure 3 cm and with cooling 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.470
 we reach 5 4 cm so it will take 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.390
 to be wary surely with some leave 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.950
 with a cpu cooler because of that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.270
 may not go through with all that 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.780
 then at the specification level 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.159
 techniques we are at 2400 billion in 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.869
 xmp profiles in saddle 11 with a voltage 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.540
 1.65 volts 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.420
 it is a kit cjga so two 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.759
 8 gigabyte arrays 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.000
 so we'll do a test 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.700
 we will deliver soon and inevitably 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.530
 hope a bone is pushed enough that 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.659
 really very very very gamer 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.659
 overclockers this is goodbye
