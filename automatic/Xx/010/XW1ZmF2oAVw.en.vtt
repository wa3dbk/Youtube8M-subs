that<00:04:00.180> are<00:04:00.300> five<00:04:00.600> pounds<00:04:01.430> but<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.610> average<00:04:02.790> is

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
that are five pounds but the average is

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.820 
that are five pounds but the average is
probably<00:04:03.420> closer<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.810> about<00:04:04.050> one<00:04:04.380> or<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
probably closer to about one or one and

probably closer to about one or one and
a<00:04:04.920> half<00:04:05.240> but<00:04:06.240> uh<00:04:06.300> this<00:04:06.600> link<00:04:06.840> gets<00:04:07.020> actually<00:04:07.380> a

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
a half but uh this link gets actually a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.480 
a half but uh this link gets actually a
lot<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:07.680> pressure<00:04:07.920> even<00:04:08.220> though<00:04:08.310> there's

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490
