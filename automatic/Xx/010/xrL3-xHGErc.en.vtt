 my father nailed smash as always here in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.779
 this little video I will show you five 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:14.219
 interesting life hacking with your favorite 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:16.470
 another phone your wires for 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.300
 charging constantly get confused are lost or 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.130
 trite fall under the table where they need 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.560
 get from a pile of other wires from me 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.220
 there is an interesting solution for you 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.720
 little man and left 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.580
 his hand is perfect for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.900
 modern wires especially under 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 lightning from apple 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.230
 and if you have several such 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 characters or other details you can 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.730
 do something more interesting for example 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.739
 docking station want to watch a movie or 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.899
 just convenient to keep track of time but not 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.149
 what to put the phone if you are in 2000 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.579
 years of actively listening to music then maybe 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.410
 you have cassette cases from them 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.950
 suitable for this but what to do on 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.180
 the street 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 I will not go everywhere with this 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 ask about such a case 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.449
 stand you can use glasses in 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.039
 while taking photos everyone wants to be in 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.840
 frame but then who will hold the phone 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.719
 you will not believe but it can do 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.239
 scotch yes yes scotch you didn't hear everything 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.820
 Just insert the phone inside and the end 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.680
 stick to anything in most 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.270
 phones are not very loud speakers and 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.430
 sometimes even on the street is difficult to make out 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.740
 speech or song lyrics but what to do on 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.840
 party where the cardboard is very noisy and out 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.880
 roll of napkins or toilet paper and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.680
 just cut a hole and paste 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720
 there phone if you try you can 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.820
 make a system of several cardboard 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 it will only enhance the effect also for this. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 may be a glass or deep 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.720
 the plate can not be said that it is very 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 cool life hacking but the effect is still there 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.229
 like to photograph something small 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
 near but no money for a special lens 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.130
 for a phone like a lens can 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.470
 get out of the baby laser which i 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.020
 I think many have for this need a lens 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.790
 a clip or a small barrette and tape 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 now the photo near will be incredible 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.420
