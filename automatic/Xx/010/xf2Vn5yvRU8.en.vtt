good<00:01:50.359> to<00:01:50.450> know<00:01:50.479> we<00:01:50.659> should<00:01:50.810> top<00:01:51.289> dress<00:01:51.500> with

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
good to know we should top dress with

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.679 
good to know we should top dress with
some<00:01:51.770> compost<00:01:52.130> that<00:01:52.369> yes<00:01:52.880> well<00:01:53.420> especially

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
some compost that yes well especially

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.749 
some compost that yes well especially
some<00:01:54.409> of<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.560> problems<00:01:54.740> what<00:01:55.039> we've<00:01:55.640> been

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
some of the problems what we've been

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.700 
some of the problems what we've been
seeing<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.359> some<00:01:56.390> yellowing<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> inside

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
seeing is some yellowing on the inside

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.109 
seeing is some yellowing on the inside
of<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.979> leaves<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.490> don't<00:01:58.729> know<00:01:58.820> if<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.000> was<00:01:59.090> a

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
of the leaves I don't know if it was a

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.899 
of the leaves I don't know if it was a
combination<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.109> spring<00:02:01.100> being<00:02:01.399> so<00:02:01.640> cool

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
combination of the spring being so cool

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.380 
combination of the spring being so cool
and<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:03.619> winter<00:02:03.920> when<00:02:04.549> we<00:02:04.700> had<00:02:04.880> those<00:02:05.030> nine

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
and the winter when we had those nine

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.240 
and the winter when we had those nine
ten<00:02:05.689> degrees<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:06.320> we<00:02:06.500> might<00:02:06.979> have<00:02:07.130> to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
ten degrees so we might have to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.130 
ten degrees so we might have to
fertilize<00:02:07.399> this<00:02:07.850> year<00:02:08.060> okay<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.630> hydrangeas

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
fertilize this year okay the hydrangeas

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.300 
fertilize this year okay the hydrangeas
in<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> ground<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.800> because<00:02:10.039> we're<00:02:10.190> already

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
in the ground so because we're already

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.440 
in the ground so because we're already
starting<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:10.940> little<00:02:11.060> bit<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.300> yellow

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
starting to see a little bit of yellow

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.210 
starting to see a little bit of yellow
leaf<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.440> know<00:02:12.500> here<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.100> that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
leaf and I know here you have that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.580 
leaf and I know here you have that
really<00:02:13.400> great<00:02:13.640> formula<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.560> hydrangeas<00:02:15.560> a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
really great formula for hydrangeas a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.500 
really great formula for hydrangeas a
good<00:02:15.890> fertilizer<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:16.670> yes<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.300> come<00:02:17.420> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
good fertilizer so yes we can come and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.420 
good fertilizer so yes we can come and
pick<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.840> here<00:02:17.990> too<00:02:18.140> yes<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.710> then<00:02:19.280> what

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
pick it up here too yes and then what

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.470 
pick it up here too yes and then what
other<00:02:19.520> problems<00:02:19.760> because<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.210> know

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
other problems because I know

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.149 
other problems because I know
that<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:20.930> many<00:02:21.019> people<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.590> hydrangeas<00:02:21.920> and

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
that so many people have hydrangeas and

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.699 
that so many people have hydrangeas and
they're<00:02:22.550> just<00:02:22.760> kind<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:22.970> worried<00:02:23.209> about<00:02:23.420> them

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
they're just kind of worried about them

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.589 
they're just kind of worried about them
it's<00:02:24.709> just<00:02:24.950> not<00:02:25.099> it's<00:02:25.459> not<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> crazier<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.390> has

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
it's just not it's not a crazier it has

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.890 
it's just not it's not a crazier it has
been<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.810> crazier<00:02:27.760> animated<00:02:28.760> suspension<00:02:29.330> of

been a crazier animated suspension of

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.839 
been a crazier animated suspension of
blooms<00:02:30.200> you<00:02:30.349> get<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> beautiful<00:02:30.680> bud<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:31.370> then

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
blooms you get a beautiful bud and then

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.210 
blooms you get a beautiful bud and then
it<00:02:31.970> stops<00:02:32.599> for<00:02:32.959> it's<00:02:33.530> been<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.680> month<00:02:33.890> now<00:02:34.190> and

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
leafed ones it was an Annabelle okay

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.099 
leafed ones it was an Annabelle okay
there<00:03:04.489> are<00:03:04.609> Burrell<00:03:04.879> since<00:03:05.090> Annabelle<00:03:05.510> okay

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
there are Burrell since Annabelle okay

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.050 
there are Burrell since Annabelle okay
well<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.040> mean<00:03:07.280> there's<00:03:07.489> not<00:03:07.579> like<00:03:07.819> it's<00:03:08.000> not

always next year and there's maybe a
little<00:03:11.239> bit<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.450> leaf<00:03:11.599> spot<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.260> can

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
little bit of leaf spot and you can

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.869 
little bit of leaf spot and you can
always<00:03:12.470> kind<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.799> trim<00:03:12.980> those<00:03:13.160> off<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.730> the

and we have been seeing a little bit

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.960 
and we have been seeing a little bit
more<00:03:17.629> leaf<00:03:17.840> spot<00:03:18.140> with<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.590> with<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.730> Sun
