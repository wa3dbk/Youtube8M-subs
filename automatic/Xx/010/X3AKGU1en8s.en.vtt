00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
the sport and backing is still you know

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400 
the sport and backing is still you know
arguably<00:02:33.700> pretty<00:02:34.300> new<00:02:34.510> niche<00:02:34.810> motorsport

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
arguably pretty new niche motorsport

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.110 
arguably pretty new niche motorsport
that's<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.640> said<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.970> just

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
that's it's like I said it's just

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.110 
that's it's like I said it's just
growing<00:02:37.390> exponentially<00:02:37.930> every<00:02:38.170> year<00:02:38.590> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
growing exponentially every year so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.490 
growing exponentially every year so
there's<00:02:40.120> still<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.630> do-it-yourself

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
there's still that do-it-yourself

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.830 
there's still that do-it-yourself
attitude<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.880> honestly<00:02:43.330> don't<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:43.600> it's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
attitude I honestly don't think it's

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.440 
attitude I honestly don't think it's
gonna<00:02:43.989> ever<00:02:44.319> go<00:02:44.650> away<00:02:44.770> because<00:02:45.190> everybody<00:02:45.760> you

tire makers basically because you know

tire makers basically because you know
that<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.459> one<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.730> biggest<00:03:03.880> things<00:03:04.269> that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
that is one of the biggest things that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.590 
that is one of the biggest things that
we<00:03:05.440> utilize<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:06.040> our<00:03:06.130> sport<00:03:06.459> which<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.880> dino

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
we utilize in our sport which is a dino

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.289 
we utilize in our sport which is a dino
to<00:03:07.840> kind<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.380> show<00:03:09.220> off<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.580> car<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.000> style

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
to kind of show off the car the style

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.390 
to kind of show off the car the style
and<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.900> obviously<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.860> tire<00:03:12.069> smoke

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
and and obviously like the tire smoke

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.520 
and and obviously like the tire smoke
makes<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:13.000> what<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.930> makes<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.500> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
makes that what it is and makes the the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.850 
makes that what it is and makes the the
car<00:03:15.489> more<00:03:16.000> action-packed<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:17.590> makes<00:03:17.739> it

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
car more action-packed and just makes it

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.500 
car more action-packed and just makes it
look<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.100> lot<00:03:18.220> cool<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:18.700> what<00:03:18.910> you're<00:03:19.150> what

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
look a lot cool with what you're what

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.270 
look a lot cool with what you're what
you're<00:03:19.540> doing<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.140> obviously<00:03:20.470> I'm<00:03:20.920> having

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
you're doing so obviously I'm having

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.220 
you're doing so obviously I'm having
that<00:03:21.430> tire<00:03:21.790> manufacturer<00:03:22.450> brand<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.019> car

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
that tire manufacturer brand on the car

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.280 
that tire manufacturer brand on the car
is<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.680> plays<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.920> big<00:03:24.220> role<00:03:24.459> in<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:25.290> in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
is it plays a big role in in in

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.740 
is it plays a big role in in in
marketing<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.010> what<00:03:27.220> people<00:03:27.609> would<00:03:28.450> want<00:03:28.660> to

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
marketing and what people would want to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.870 
marketing and what people would want to
purchase<00:03:29.190> for<00:03:30.190> their<00:03:30.340> for<00:03:30.609> their<00:03:30.700> personal

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
purchase for their for their personal

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.490 
purchase for their for their personal
cars<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.570> think<00:03:31.690> that's<00:03:31.930> why<00:03:32.079> a<00:03:32.109> lot<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.380> the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
cars so I think that's why a lot of the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.050 
cars so I think that's why a lot of the
tire<00:03:32.680> manufacturers<00:03:33.250> have<00:03:33.430> come<00:03:33.670> into<00:03:33.820> the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
tire manufacturers have come into the

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.479 
tire manufacturers have come into the
sport<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.790> kind<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.920> grown<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.310> mean

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
sport and and have kind of grown I mean

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.280 
sport and and have kind of grown I mean
grown<00:03:39.730> drifting<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.299> what<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.600> now<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.930> mean

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
grown drifting to what it is now I mean

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.949 
grown drifting to what it is now I mean
you<00:03:42.220> could<00:03:42.370> arguably<00:03:43.150> say<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.780> tire

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
you could arguably say that the tire

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.720 
you could arguably say that the tire
manufacturers<00:03:44.620> are<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:45.100> ones<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.370> made<00:03:45.579> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
manufacturers are the ones that made the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.940 
manufacturers are the ones that made the
sport<00:03:46.060> grow<00:03:46.329> as<00:03:46.480> much<00:03:46.660> as<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.900> has<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.410> brought

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
sport grow as much as it has and brought

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.340 
sport grow as much as it has and brought
it<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.100> where<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:48.519> at<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:48.790> point<00:03:49.170> what<00:03:50.170> you

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
it to where it is at this point what you

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.349 
it to where it is at this point what you
feel<00:03:50.620> are<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.250> major<00:03:51.579> technical<00:03:52.090> attributes

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
feel are the major technical attributes

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.509 
feel are the major technical attributes
of<00:03:52.840> tires<00:03:53.109> that<00:03:53.500> you're<00:03:53.890> looking<00:03:54.010> for<00:03:54.340> when

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
of tires that you're looking for when

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.220 
of tires that you're looking for when
you<00:03:54.609> have<00:03:54.640> drifted<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.840> major<00:03:56.220> technical

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
you have drifted the major technical

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.190 
you have drifted the major technical
attributes<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.799> tires<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.220> guess<00:04:00.370> would<00:04:00.549> be

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
attributes to the tires I guess would be

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.330 
attributes to the tires I guess would be
you<00:04:02.200> know<00:04:02.290> number<00:04:02.560> one<00:04:02.680> finding<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.100> tire<00:04:03.310> that

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
you know number one finding a tire that

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.930 
you know number one finding a tire that
can<00:04:03.760> can<00:04:04.329> last<00:04:04.569> something<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.319> has<00:04:05.940> some

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
can can last something that has some

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.599 
can can last something that has some
some<00:04:07.299> tread<00:04:07.540> depth<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.190> another<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:09.370> one

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
some tread depth to it another one one

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.130 
some tread depth to it another one one
that<00:04:09.700> doesn't<00:04:09.970> fall<00:04:10.150> apart<00:04:10.299> when<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.750> gets<00:04:10.900> too

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
that doesn't fall apart when it gets too

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.380 
that doesn't fall apart when it gets too
hot<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:11.709> when<00:04:11.890> you're<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.069> half<00:04:12.400> way<00:04:12.640> through<00:04:13.329> a

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
hot so when you're a half way through a

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.620 
hot so when you're a half way through a
lap<00:04:13.630> or

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
lap or
