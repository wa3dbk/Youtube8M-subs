00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
not 300 or 400 is still it's so good to

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.250 
not 300 or 400 is still it's so good to
have<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> help<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.489> out<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:10.080> you

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
know that actually helps up to I believe

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.979 
know that actually helps up to I believe
4<00:03:12.750> F<00:03:12.930> stops<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.730> potentially<00:03:15.420> do<00:03:15.750> some

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
4 F stops so you can potentially do some

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.949 
4 F stops so you can potentially do some
you<00:03:16.350> know<00:03:16.790> sport<00:03:17.790> shooting<00:03:18.329> at<00:03:18.480> night<00:03:18.720> with

you know sport shooting at night with
this<00:03:19.079> lens<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:21.620> yeah<00:03:22.620> if<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.890> take<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.040> look<00:03:23.130> at

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
this lens and yeah if you take a look at

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.190 
this lens and yeah if you take a look at
this<00:03:23.280> front<00:03:23.940> glass<00:03:24.269> Elm<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.870> it's<00:03:25.040> one<00:03:26.060> huge

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
this front glass Elm and it's one huge

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.349 
this front glass Elm and it's one huge
glass<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:29.180> that's<00:03:30.180> where<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.810> Kong<00:03:31.109> comes<00:03:31.470> in

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
glass and that's where the Kong comes in

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.550 
glass and that's where the Kong comes in
you<00:03:33.359> could<00:03:33.570> probably<00:03:33.720> handle<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:35.070> lens<00:03:35.430> for

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
you could probably handle this lens for

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.140 
you could probably handle this lens for
5<00:03:37.560> maybe<00:03:37.829> 10<00:03:37.950> minutes<00:03:38.400> do<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.850> guys<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.060> how

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
5 maybe 10 minutes do you guys know how

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.910 
5 maybe 10 minutes do you guys know how
much<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.390> work<00:03:39.570> out<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.380> you're<00:03:40.530> looking<00:03:40.620> at

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
much you work out so you're looking at

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.680 
much you work out so you're looking at
no<00:03:41.220> well<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:41.880> what<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> pound<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> half

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
no well this is what a pound and a half

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.990 
no well this is what a pound and a half
so<00:03:43.019> this<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.320> seven<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.709> half<00:03:43.739> pounds<00:03:44.070> in

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
so this is seven and a half pounds in

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.360 
so this is seven and a half pounds in
one<00:03:45.329> hand<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.170> all<00:03:46.739> you're<00:03:46.920> doing<00:03:47.100> your<00:03:47.220> right

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
one hand and all you're doing your right

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.460 
one hand and all you're doing your right
hand<00:03:47.579> is<00:03:47.760> you're<00:03:48.000> taking<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.450> pictures<00:03:48.780> so

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
hand is you're taking the pictures so

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.460 
hand is you're taking the pictures so
the<00:03:49.739> column<00:03:50.070> would<00:03:50.190> be<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:51.660> very<00:03:51.750> heavy<00:03:52.410> and

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
the column would be it's very heavy and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.370 
the column would be it's very heavy and
also<00:03:55.470> it's<00:03:55.590> very<00:03:55.620> expensive<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.630> by<00:03:57.630> try<00:03:58.019> or

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
also it's very expensive so by try or

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.009 
also it's very expensive so by try or
don't<00:03:58.680> buy<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.459> thought<00:04:00.150> long<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.480> hard<00:04:00.720> about

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
don't buy I thought long and hard about

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.520 
don't buy I thought long and hard about
this<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.040> definitely<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.329> try<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.410> can

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
this and it is definitely a try you can
