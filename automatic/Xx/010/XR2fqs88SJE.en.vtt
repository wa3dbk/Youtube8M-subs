this<00:00:00.480> is<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.719> future<00:00:00.900> site<00:00:01.199> of<00:00:01.469> my<00:00:01.709> herb

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
this is the future site of my herb

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.370 
this is the future site of my herb
spiral<00:00:02.370> now<00:00:03.090> when<00:00:03.810> you're<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.049> build<00:00:04.230> an

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
spiral now when you're going to build an

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.599 
spiral now when you're going to build an
herb<00:00:04.500> spiral<00:00:04.799> first<00:00:05.100> thing<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.310> want<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.460> do

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
herb spiral first thing you want to do

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.530 
herb spiral first thing you want to do
is<00:00:05.700> you're<00:00:05.790> going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:05.970> want<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.150> lay<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.420> out

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
is you're going to want to lay it out

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.450 
is you're going to want to lay it out
and<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.960> like<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.470> use<00:00:07.589> flags<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.220> then<00:00:08.309> also

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
and I like to use flags and then also

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.850 
and I like to use flags and then also
some<00:00:08.910> paint<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.510> can<00:00:09.780> see<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
some paint just so I can see with the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.799 
some paint just so I can see with the
turf<00:00:11.280> marking<00:00:11.670> paint<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:11.969> get<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> better

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
turf marking paint I can get a better

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.160 
turf marking paint I can get a better
visual<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.590> exactly<00:00:14.389> how<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.420> spa<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.020> going

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
visual of exactly how the spa is going

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.220 
visual of exactly how the spa is going
to<00:00:16.230> look<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.270> also<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.420> tape<00:00:18.660> measure<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.170> you

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
to look and also a tape measure so you

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.890 
to look and also a tape measure so you
can<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> perfect<00:00:20.580> circle<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.210> basically

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
can get a perfect circle and basically

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.269 
can get a perfect circle and basically
what<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.410> find<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:22.920> find<00:00:22.949> your

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
what you do is find they find your

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.560 
what you do is find they find your
middle<00:00:23.460> point<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> where<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.240> want<00:00:24.420> your

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
middle point of where you want your

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.830 
middle point of where you want your
spiral<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:26.570> typically<00:00:27.570> these

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
spiral to be and then typically these

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.599 
spiral to be and then typically these
herb<00:00:28.019> spirals<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.650> permaculture<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.279> about

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
herb spirals and permaculture are about

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.299 
herb spirals and permaculture are about
three<00:00:30.510> feet<00:00:30.750> from<00:00:31.439> off<00:00:31.710> center<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.219> you'll

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
three feet from off center so you'll

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.670 
three feet from off center so you'll
have<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.489> three<00:00:32.790> foot<00:00:33.000> diameter<00:00:33.380> which<00:00:34.380> ends<00:00:34.620> up

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
have a three foot diameter which ends up

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.620 
have a three foot diameter which ends up
being<00:00:34.739> six<00:00:35.219> feet<00:00:35.399> across

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
being six feet across

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
being six feet across
now<00:00:37.230> depending<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:37.950> what<00:00:38.070> type<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> stone

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
now depending on what type of stone

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.369 
now depending on what type of stone
you're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> use<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.840> me<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.140> using<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
you're going to use for me I'm using a

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.869 
you're going to use for me I'm using a
field<00:00:43.379> stone<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:43.950> relatively<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> lot<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
field stone that's relatively a lot of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.330 
field stone that's relatively a lot of
pieces<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.300> relatively<00:00:45.660> wide<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> want<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
pieces are relatively wide so I want a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
pieces are relatively wide so I want a
pretty<00:00:47.579> strong<00:00:47.820> wall<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> I'm<00:00:49.879> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.969> start

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
pretty strong wall so I'm going to start

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.959 
pretty strong wall so I'm going to start
my<00:00:51.570> field<00:00:51.989> stone<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.100> balls<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
my field stone so my balls can be a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
my field stone so my balls can be a
little<00:00:54.180> wider<00:00:54.360> well<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.829> actually<00:00:57.500> three

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
little wider well here is actually three

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.520 
little wider well here is actually three
feet<00:00:58.739> off<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.850> Center<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.320> actually

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
feet off of Center but I'm actually

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.149 
feet off of Center but I'm actually
going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:02.460> building<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:03.170> wall<00:01:04.170> probably

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
going to be building my wall probably

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
going to be building my wall probably
about<00:01:05.250> six<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.850> eight<00:01:06.119> inches<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.930> further

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
about six to eight inches out further

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.560 
about six to eight inches out further
just<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.189> compensate<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.180> build<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
just to compensate because if I build it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
just to compensate because if I build it
further<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.950> I'm<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.460> have

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
further in here I'm not going to have

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
further in here I'm not going to have
enough<00:01:11.820> planting<00:01:12.240> space<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.380> basically<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
enough planting space but basically the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
enough planting space but basically the
idea<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.549> you're<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> build<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
idea is you're going to going to build a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
idea is you're going to going to build a
wall<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> wall<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.310> start

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
wall and the wall would actually start

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600 
wall and the wall would actually start
down<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.500> gradually<00:01:20.070> step<00:01:20.369> up

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
down in here and then gradually step up

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.940 
down in here and then gradually step up
and<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.659> gets<00:01:21.840> hired<00:01:22.140> higher<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> comes

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and and it gets hired higher as it comes

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
and and it gets hired higher as it comes
as<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.430> comes<00:01:23.909> all<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> way<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> end<00:01:24.630> in

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
as it comes all the way to the end in

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.420 
as it comes all the way to the end in
the<00:01:24.930> top<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.439> tops<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> end<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.340> be

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the top and then tops to end up would be

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.330 
the top and then tops to end up would be
about<00:01:27.049> three<00:01:28.049> feet<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
about three feet or so and then you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.319 
about three feet or so and then you
backfill<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> wall<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> then<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.180> can

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
backfill the wall and and then you can

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.530 
backfill the wall and and then you can
plant<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> backfill<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.130> ideally<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
plant in the backfill and ideally the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
plant in the backfill and ideally the
areas<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.259> front<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:37.950> nice<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.130> low<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
areas in front that are nice and low and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.539 
areas in front that are nice and low and
in<00:01:39.119> front<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.840> put<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.549> sun-loving

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
in front you can put your sun-loving

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.310 
in front you can put your sun-loving
stuff<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.240> likes<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:43.079> more

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
stuff that likes it a little bit more

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.310 
stuff that likes it a little bit more
damp<00:01:44.100> stuff<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> back<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.990> sits

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
damp stuff in the back that like sits

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.670

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
use a carpenter's level and just go

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.400 
use a carpenter's level and just go
right<00:03:04.000> along<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.599> ground<00:03:04.810> just<00:03:05.170> make<00:03:05.290> sure

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
right along the ground just make sure

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.199 
right along the ground just make sure
everything's<00:03:05.769> level<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.519> way<00:03:06.670> your<00:03:06.910> stone

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
everything's level that way your stone

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.500 
everything's level that way your stone
wall<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:08.260> going<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.530> end<00:03:08.650> up<00:03:08.769> being<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.480> has<00:03:10.480> a

nice level base when you're building it

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.390 
nice level base when you're building it
now<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.480> ended<00:03:13.989> up<00:03:14.080> having<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.440> step<00:03:14.799> up<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.190> few

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
now I ended up having to step up a few

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000 
now I ended up having to step up a few
in<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.610> few<00:03:15.790> places<00:03:15.940> because<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.930> would<00:03:17.829> have<00:03:17.890> had

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
in a few places because I would have had

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.590 
in a few places because I would have had
to<00:03:18.070> excavate<00:03:18.430> quite<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.880> bit<00:03:19.120> which<00:03:19.299> I<00:03:19.390> didn't

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
to excavate quite a bit which I didn't

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.920 
to excavate quite a bit which I didn't
want<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.810> do<00:03:19.959> which<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:20.980> ok<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.489> can<00:03:21.750> you<00:03:22.750> can

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
want to do which is ok you can you can

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.949 
want to do which is ok you can you can
make<00:03:23.140> as<00:03:24.100> long<00:03:24.250> as<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:24.640> level<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.570> then

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
make as long as it's level here and then

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.690 
make as long as it's level here and then
you<00:03:26.079> can<00:03:26.200> have<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.530> stone<00:03:26.799> step<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.400> that's

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
you can have the stone step up that's

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.849 
you can have the stone step up that's
that's<00:03:27.970> absolutely<00:03:28.690> ok

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
that's absolutely ok

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.430 
that's absolutely ok
after<00:03:30.430> you've<00:03:30.609> leveled<00:03:30.850> your<00:03:31.090> surface<00:03:31.959> out<00:03:32.140> I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
after you've leveled your surface out I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.590 
after you've leveled your surface out I
would<00:03:33.040> highly<00:03:33.310> recommend<00:03:33.340> painting<00:03:34.209> as<00:03:34.329> you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
would highly recommend painting as you

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.000 
would highly recommend painting as you
can<00:03:34.720> see<00:03:34.840> here<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.049> painted<00:03:35.440> where<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> spiral

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
can see here I painted where the spiral

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.650 
can see here I painted where the spiral
is<00:03:36.100> going<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.280> go<00:03:36.430> but<00:03:37.090> make<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.450> lot<00:03:37.630> easier

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
is going to go but make it a lot easier

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.400 
is going to go but make it a lot easier
to<00:03:38.170> visualize<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.859> make<00:03:39.010> sure<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.400> it's<00:03:39.579> a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
to visualize it make sure that it's a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.110 
to visualize it make sure that it's a
make<00:03:41.410> sure<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.799> it's<00:03:41.980> what<00:03:42.579> you<00:03:42.609> want<00:03:42.940> before

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
make sure that it's what you want before

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.819 
make sure that it's what you want before
you<00:03:43.299> start<00:03:43.600> building<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.109> then<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.590> next

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
you start building and then the next

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.710 
you start building and then the next
step<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.190> probably<00:03:45.730> want<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.090> do<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.480> to

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
step you probably want to do is to

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.460 
step you probably want to do is to
separate<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.889> stones<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.579> in<00:03:49.510> piles<00:03:49.870> based<00:03:50.290> on

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
separate the stones in in piles based on

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.379 
separate the stones in in piles based on
their<00:03:50.650> width<00:03:50.859> so<00:03:51.280> that<00:03:51.430> way<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.609> can<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.209> can

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
their width so that way you can you can

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.080 
their width so that way you can you can
use<00:03:52.630> all<00:03:52.840> like<00:03:53.530> width<00:03:53.889> for<00:03:54.280> different<00:03:54.940> courses

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
use all like width for different courses

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.770 
use all like width for different courses
of<00:03:55.269> stone

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
of stone

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.170 
of stone
so<00:03:56.440> after<00:03:56.709> you've<00:03:56.829> leveled<00:03:57.010> your<00:03:57.190> site<00:03:57.489> next

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
so after you've leveled your site next

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.220 
so after you've leveled your site next
thing<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.359> want<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.540> do<00:03:58.660> is<00:03:58.750> separate<00:03:59.109> your

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
thing you want to do is separate your

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.500 
thing you want to do is separate your
stone<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.739> I<00:03:59.859> would<00:04:00.040> recommend<00:04:00.609> if<00:04:01.269> you're

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
stone and I would recommend if you're

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.569 
stone and I would recommend if you're
purchasing<00:04:02.170> stone<00:04:02.440> or<00:04:02.709> if<00:04:02.799> you're<00:04:02.950> going<00:04:03.489> to

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
purchasing stone or if you're going to

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.970 
purchasing stone or if you're going to
find<00:04:03.790> your<00:04:03.910> own<00:04:04.030> stone<00:04:04.359> look<00:04:04.989> for<00:04:05.230> stones<00:04:05.739> that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
find your own stone look for stones that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.970 
find your own stone look for stones that
are<00:04:06.069> nice<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.430> flat<00:04:06.639> on<00:04:06.910> at<00:04:07.239> least<00:04:07.389> 3<00:04:07.630> sides

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
are nice and flat on at least 3 sides

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.319 
are nice and flat on at least 3 sides
it's<00:04:08.980> going<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.190> make<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.519> building<00:04:10.000> process

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
it's going to make the building process

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.900 
it's going to make the building process
a<00:04:10.600> lot<00:04:10.840> easier<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.440> your<00:04:12.340> wall<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.609> lot

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
a lot easier and your wall a lot

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.030 
a lot easier and your wall a lot
sturdier<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:13.780> what<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:13.959> like<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.650> do<00:04:14.799> is

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
sturdier so what I like to do is

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.560 
sturdier so what I like to do is
separate<00:04:15.489> them<00:04:15.639> by<00:04:15.819> width<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.389> I'll<00:04:16.510> actually

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
separate them by width so I'll actually

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.960 
separate them by width so I'll actually
measure<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.289> width<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.590> each<00:04:17.739> stone<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:18.340> I'll

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
measure the width of each stone and I'll

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.610 
measure the width of each stone and I'll
do<00:04:19.120> them<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.329> half-inch<00:04:19.660> increments<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.440> we

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
do them in half-inch increments so we

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.680 
do them in half-inch increments so we
started<00:04:20.919> down<00:04:21.070> here<00:04:21.100> at<00:04:21.489> about<00:04:21.729> an<00:04:22.000> inch<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.659> a

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
started down here at about an inch and a

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.600 
started down here at about an inch and a
half<00:04:22.720> all<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.349> way<00:04:23.500> up<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.860> four<00:04:24.159> inch<00:04:24.310> stones

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
half all the way up to four inch stones

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.240 
half all the way up to four inch stones
so<00:04:25.210> I've<00:04:25.300> built<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.690> first<00:04:25.930> couple<00:04:26.349> courses

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
so I've built the first couple courses

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.150 
so I've built the first couple courses
of<00:04:27.370> stone<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.570> what<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.410> did<00:04:29.620> was<00:04:29.830> I<00:04:29.950> started

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
of stone and what I did was I started

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.070 
of stone and what I did was I started
with<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:31.000> thinnest<00:04:31.630> pieces<00:04:33.750> working<00:04:34.750> my<00:04:35.050> way

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
with the thinnest pieces working my way

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.650 
with the thinnest pieces working my way
from<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.770> lowest<00:04:36.400> point<00:04:36.640> using<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.270> thinnest

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
from the lowest point using the thinnest

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.220 
from the lowest point using the thinnest
pieces<00:04:38.850> using<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:39.940> widest<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.720> my<00:04:40.870> thinnest

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
pieces using the widest of my thinnest

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.400 
pieces using the widest of my thinnest
pieces<00:04:41.530> on<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.800> bottom<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:42.400> then<00:04:43.180> my<00:04:43.720> smaller

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
pieces on the bottom and then my smaller

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.730 
pieces on the bottom and then my smaller
of<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.920> thinner<00:04:45.130> pieces<00:04:45.430> as<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:46.480> steps<00:04:46.690> up<00:04:46.960> and

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
of the thinner pieces as it steps up and

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.710 
of the thinner pieces as it steps up and
then<00:04:48.160> once<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.550> get<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.880> the<00:04:49.000> next<00:04:49.150> thickness

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
then once I get to the next thickness

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.990 
then once I get to the next thickness
then<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:49.990> start<00:04:50.260> running<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.770> next<00:04:51.460> thickness

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
then I start running the next thickness

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.420 
then I start running the next thickness
of<00:04:52.210> courses<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.230> what<00:04:53.470> ends<00:04:53.680> up<00:04:53.770> happening<00:04:53.830> is

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
of courses so what ends up happening is

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.600 
of courses so what ends up happening is
as<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.640> wall<00:04:54.970> comes<00:04:55.810> around<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.350> spiral<00:04:56.920> the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
as the wall comes around the spiral the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.640 
as the wall comes around the spiral the
thickness<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.750> wall<00:04:58.960> is<00:04:59.260> going<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.470> get

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
thickness of the wall is going to get

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.710 
thickness of the wall is going to get
thicker<00:04:59.919> so<00:05:00.790> therefore<00:05:01.210> when<00:05:01.360> I<00:05:01.390> have<00:05:01.570> to

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
thicker so therefore when I have to

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.380 
thicker so therefore when I have to
build<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.020> wall<00:05:02.200> higher<00:05:02.610> it's<00:05:03.610> it's<00:05:03.880> sturdier

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
build the wall higher it's it's sturdier

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.409 
build the wall higher it's it's sturdier
without<00:05:05.380> wasting<00:05:05.919> all<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.700> stone<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.270> can

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
without wasting all the stone and I can

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.780 
without wasting all the stone and I can
use<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.600> thinner<00:05:07.900> stone<00:05:08.260> where<00:05:09.220> it's<00:05:09.370> shorter

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
use a thinner stone where it's shorter

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.030 
use a thinner stone where it's shorter
however<00:05:10.510> I<00:05:10.630> try<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.080> use<00:05:11.380> regardless<00:05:11.710> of

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
however I try to use regardless of

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.680 
however I try to use regardless of
thinness<00:05:12.310> or<00:05:12.610> thickness<00:05:12.850> of<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.150> stone<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.390> try

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
thinness or thickness of the stone I try

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.620 
thinness or thickness of the stone I try
to<00:05:13.750> use<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.169> wider<00:05:14.470> stones<00:05:15.210> on<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.480> bottom

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
to use the wider stones on the bottom

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.680 
to use the wider stones on the bottom
for<00:05:17.020> support<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:18.000> whether<00:05:19.000> it's<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.270> thicker

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
for support and whether it's a thicker

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.260 
for support and whether it's a thicker
thin<00:05:20.200> stone<00:05:20.500> on<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.160> bottom<00:05:21.490> it's<00:05:21.910> not<00:05:22.060> really

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
thin stone on the bottom it's not really

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.430 
thin stone on the bottom it's not really
important<00:05:22.630> what's<00:05:22.750> important<00:05:23.110> is<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:23.230> you

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
important what's important is that you

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.610 
important what's important is that you
have<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.590> nice<00:05:23.770> wide<00:05:24.130> base<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.760> it's<00:05:25.300> level<00:05:25.620> so

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
have a nice wide base and it's level so

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.990 
have a nice wide base and it's level so
from<00:05:26.860> here<00:05:27.070> I'm<00:05:27.280> going<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.460> build<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:27.820> up<00:05:27.880> a

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
from here I'm going to build it up a

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.370 
from here I'm going to build it up a
little<00:05:28.090> bit<00:05:28.330> further<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.900> then<00:05:28.960> I'm<00:05:29.200> going<00:05:29.320> to

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
little bit further and then I'm going to

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.740 
little bit further and then I'm going to
go<00:05:29.530> ahead<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.919> backfill<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:31.300> soil

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
go ahead and backfill the soil

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.840 
go ahead and backfill the soil
another<00:05:32.350> thing<00:05:32.650> is<00:05:32.919> anytime<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.580> have<00:05:33.790> a

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
another thing is anytime you have a

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.219 
another thing is anytime you have a
stone<00:05:34.840> that's<00:05:35.850> wobbly<00:05:37.050> anything<00:05:38.050> like<00:05:38.200> that

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
stone that's wobbly anything like that

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.290 
stone that's wobbly anything like that
you<00:05:38.620> can<00:05:38.650> use<00:05:38.979> little<00:05:39.340> pieces<00:05:39.520> of<00:05:39.669> stone<00:05:40.030> as

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
you can use little pieces of stone as

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.230 
you can use little pieces of stone as
shims<00:05:40.630> just<00:05:41.380> to<00:05:41.530> make<00:05:42.400> sure<00:05:42.430> that<00:05:42.790> it's<00:05:42.940> stable

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
shims just to make sure that it's stable

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.150 
shims just to make sure that it's stable
and<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:44.680> know<00:05:44.830> relatively<00:05:45.460> level<00:05:47.070> so<00:05:48.070> the

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
and you know relatively level so the

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.310 
and you know relatively level so the
construction<00:05:48.610> of<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.210> herb<00:05:49.630> spiral<00:05:50.200> is

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
construction of the herb spiral is

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.320 
construction of the herb spiral is
complete<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:51.460> only<00:05:51.610> thing<00:05:51.790> left<00:05:51.970> to<00:05:52.120> do<00:05:52.300> now

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
complete the only thing left to do now

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.020 
complete the only thing left to do now
is<00:05:52.570> to<00:05:52.930> plant<00:05:53.200> it<00:05:53.440> which<00:05:53.650> I'll<00:05:53.830> cover<00:05:54.040> in<00:05:54.190> part

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
is to plant it which I'll cover in part

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.030 
is to plant it which I'll cover in part
2<00:05:55.270> of<00:05:55.570> how<00:05:55.660> to<00:05:56.260> build<00:05:56.470> an<00:05:56.650> herb<00:05:56.800> spiral<00:05:58.890> all<00:05:59.890> in

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
2 of how to build an herb spiral all in

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.190 
2 of how to build an herb spiral all in
all<00:06:00.190> I<00:06:00.220> think<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.760> project<00:06:01.570> turned<00:06:01.720> out<00:06:01.870> okay

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
all I think the project turned out okay

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.600 
all I think the project turned out okay
I<00:06:02.229> used<00:06:02.710> about<00:06:03.160> 3000<00:06:03.880> pounds<00:06:04.330> of<00:06:04.479> stone<00:06:05.610> which

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
I used about 3000 pounds of stone which

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.460 
I used about 3000 pounds of stone which
was<00:06:06.880> one<00:06:07.150> pallet<00:06:07.690> of<00:06:08.160> stone<00:06:09.160> and<00:06:09.580> using<00:06:09.910> the

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
was one pallet of stone and using the

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.440 
was one pallet of stone and using the
thicker<00:06:11.490> pieces<00:06:12.490> that<00:06:13.090> were<00:06:13.740> pretty<00:06:14.740> flat

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
thicker pieces that were pretty flat

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.969 
thicker pieces that were pretty flat
definitely<00:06:16.450> helped<00:06:16.720> quite<00:06:17.229> a<00:06:17.350> bit<00:06:17.440> so<00:06:17.800> if<00:06:17.860> you

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
definitely helped quite a bit so if you

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.900 
definitely helped quite a bit so if you
can<00:06:18.130> find<00:06:18.370> stone<00:06:18.940> that's<00:06:19.360> nice<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.140> flat<00:06:20.380> and

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
can find stone that's nice and flat and

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.310 
can find stone that's nice and flat and
relatively<00:06:21.910> thick<00:06:22.120> pieces<00:06:22.390> it<00:06:22.780> makes<00:06:22.960> a<00:06:23.110> lot

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
relatively thick pieces it makes a lot

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.570 
relatively thick pieces it makes a lot
easier<00:06:23.350> to<00:06:23.950> build<00:06:24.190> a<00:06:24.990> sturdy<00:06:25.990> herb<00:06:26.830> spiral<00:06:27.220> I

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
easier to build a sturdy herb spiral I

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.690 
easier to build a sturdy herb spiral I
just<00:06:28.090> giving<00:06:28.419> you<00:06:28.510> kind<00:06:28.540> of<00:06:28.900> a<00:06:29.340> little<00:06:30.340> bit<00:06:30.550> of

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
just giving you kind of a little bit of

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
just giving you kind of a little bit of
a<00:06:30.820> look<00:06:31.229> basically<00:06:32.229> it<00:06:32.320> starts<00:06:32.650> right<00:06:32.979> here

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
a look basically it starts right here

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.800 
a look basically it starts right here
completely<00:06:34.720> level<00:06:35.110> no<00:06:35.260> stone

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
completely level no stone

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.980 
completely level no stone
and<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.320> spiral<00:06:37.740> comes<00:06:37.950> around<00:06:38.660> here<00:06:39.660> we

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
and the spiral comes around here we

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.650 
and the spiral comes around here we
start<00:06:40.320> -<00:06:40.650> this<00:06:41.430> is<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:41.670> first<00:06:41.940> course<00:06:42.330> and

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
start - this is the first course and

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.600 
start - this is the first course and
actually<00:06:43.080> the<00:06:43.139> first<00:06:43.380> it's<00:06:44.100> actually<00:06:44.250> dug

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
actually the first it's actually dug

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.100 
actually the first it's actually dug
underneath<00:06:44.910> the<00:06:45.150> ground<00:06:45.419> so<00:06:45.720> there's<00:06:45.900> a

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
underneath the ground so there's a

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.710 
underneath the ground so there's a
couple<00:06:46.980> courses<00:06:47.520> of<00:06:47.610> stone<00:06:47.850> underneath<00:06:48.450> and

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
couple courses of stone underneath and

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.230 
couple courses of stone underneath and
then<00:06:49.680> you<00:06:49.830> can<00:06:49.950> see<00:06:50.130> as<00:06:50.280> we<00:06:50.550> get<00:06:50.790> further

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
then you can see as we get further

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.890 
then you can see as we get further
around<00:06:51.870> the<00:06:52.050> spiral<00:06:53.090> we<00:06:54.090> start<00:06:54.360> to<00:06:54.450> build<00:06:54.690> up

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
around the spiral we start to build up

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.360 
around the spiral we start to build up
here<00:06:55.620> we're<00:06:55.770> starting<00:06:55.889> to<00:06:56.130> get<00:06:56.190> a<00:06:56.280> little

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
here we're starting to get a little

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.400 
here we're starting to get a little
higher<00:06:56.960> as<00:06:57.960> we<00:06:58.169> come<00:06:58.350> around<00:06:58.470> the<00:06:58.770> spiral<00:07:00.410> we

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
higher as we come around the spiral we

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:09.260 
higher as we come around the spiral we
get<00:07:01.560> higher<00:07:01.800> still<00:07:03.320> and<00:07:04.320> come<00:07:04.590> all<00:07:04.830> around<00:07:08.270> to

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
get higher still and come all around to

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
get higher still and come all around to
top

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.290 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.780 

so<00:07:21.010> come<00:07:21.310> spring<00:07:21.640> we'll<00:07:21.940> have<00:07:22.090> to<00:07:22.360> install<00:07:22.930> the

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 
so come spring we'll have to install the

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:30.030 
so come spring we'll have to install the
dryer<00:07:26.400> Sun<00:07:27.400> sunny<00:07:27.850> stuff<00:07:28.180> at<00:07:28.330> the<00:07:28.420> top<00:07:29.040> the

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040 
dryer Sun sunny stuff at the top the

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.920 
dryer Sun sunny stuff at the top the
stuff<00:07:30.280> that<00:07:30.430> likes<00:07:30.640> moist<00:07:31.210> conditions<00:07:31.720> but

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
stuff that likes moist conditions but

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.040 
stuff that likes moist conditions but
also<00:07:31.990> Sun<00:07:32.560> at<00:07:32.800> the<00:07:32.950> very<00:07:33.250> bottom<00:07:33.810> the<00:07:34.810> things

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
also Sun at the very bottom the things

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.170 
also Sun at the very bottom the things
like<00:07:35.290> the<00:07:35.440> shade<00:07:35.710> will<00:07:36.010> go<00:07:36.130> on<00:07:36.430> the<00:07:36.640> backside

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
like the shade will go on the backside

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.930 
like the shade will go on the backside
and<00:07:37.740> then<00:07:38.740> it<00:07:38.800> will<00:07:38.890> situate<00:07:39.370> everything<00:07:39.790> in

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:39.940 
and then it will situate everything in

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.970
