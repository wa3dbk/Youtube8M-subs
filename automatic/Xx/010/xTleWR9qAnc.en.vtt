00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.810
 at the beginning it is something very simple if at least 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.330
 and this month a lot of wood seems at first sight that homogeneous thing the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.499
 two 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.499
 it turns out that under the omc that is anything but trivial 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.440
 what happens on this point to no avail 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.460
 change behaviors 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.010
 mechanical 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.790
 visit this wood is so the reason and differently 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.700
 that is to say that we can modify the resonance of the wood by intervening by the 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.030
 through a friend on the plateau of the mechanical structure of the wood in 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 decomposition its mechanical behavior and therefore its presence 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.780
 the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 what 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.320
 the big machines that will look at what's on schedule 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.150
 long we discover mineral elements 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.840
 which saves quite unexpected during my violin making was found 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.830
 especially the polyclinic case the question arises immediately that do 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.070
 following the controversy under lock and key 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.550
 it turns out that I met in 92 an old gentleman who had passed his 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.290
 childhood to work in a shipyard in venice and who told me even 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 quite funny because those of mineral subcontractors will collapse 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.300
 winter of a treatment that was done on public roads 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.450
 naval 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 to avoid rotting woes cholet was in a wet environment 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.120
 he gives me a recipe on the other hand so that he gives up this time thanks 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.410
 at this recipe I do one thing it's about play but on the roads 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.620
 I'm finally a thing in terms of technology is say by woman 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
 but when I go up a notch it sounds differently 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.520
 in the process of recreating an instrument in the style of the time 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.620
 the door 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.250
 also diane 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.880
 a wood treatment and albert ii 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.790
 what foot on ancient techniques enriched dad my opinion the table of 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.789
 funding 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.629
 the job of toppling chavez friend 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.159
 in this way no one would dare so I took twenty to react 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.659
 sufficient knowledge of this profession disappeared to be able to do 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 to dry 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.779
 everything was recreated in the bowels of vermont i can say that 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:39.849
 I have seen go to the bottom of Italy and resins nine that 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.939
 come out of a patio barbecue say that 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.099
 I'm trying to make the work of the fmi 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.209
 shimizu 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.290
 the trouble the source of two the price of raw materials at the source of a 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.049
 technical 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.739
 she used it 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.360
 to be able to carry out this very special week
