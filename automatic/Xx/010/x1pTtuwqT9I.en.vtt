00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.490 
there I think that if Hogan is their
tips<00:05:13.210> their<00:05:13.390> hand<00:05:13.600> on<00:05:13.750> him<00:05:13.930> coming<00:05:14.200> back<00:05:14.350> to

tips their hand on him coming back to
the<00:05:14.620> company<00:05:15.040> so<00:05:15.220> they<00:05:15.250> might<00:05:15.610> not<00:05:15.760> do<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.060> but

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
the company so they might not do it but

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.880
