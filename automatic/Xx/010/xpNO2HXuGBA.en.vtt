the<00:01:35.130> battery<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:37.909> here<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> blu<00:01:39.720> cig

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the battery here here is a blu cig

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.980 
the battery here here is a blu cig
battery<00:01:40.369> these<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.520> very<00:01:41.670> small<00:01:42.090> probably

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
battery these are very small probably

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.539 
battery these are very small probably
some<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> smaller<00:01:43.710> batteries<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.310> there

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
some of the smaller batteries out there

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.210 
some of the smaller batteries out there
and<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> you'll<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.890> when<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> screw<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.759> in

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
and so you'll see when you screw this in

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
and so you'll see when you screw this in
it<00:01:50.220> will<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.930> signal<00:01:52.320> light<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
it will this the signal light up a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.710 
it will this the signal light up a
little<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.070> flash<00:01:53.430> quick<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.540> that

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
little little flash quick and see that

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.789 
little little flash quick and see that
that's<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.850> side<00:01:57.090> there<00:01:57.649> that's<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that's a on the side there that's the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.899 
that's a on the side there that's the
charging<00:01:59.340> light<00:01:59.990> when<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.140> goes<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.729> if<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
charging light when that goes out if I

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.899 
charging light when that goes out if I
can<00:02:03.090> screw<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.920> once<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.369> here<00:02:05.729> goes

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
can screw it in once this like here goes

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.160 
can screw it in once this like here goes
out<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.329> fully<00:02:06.719> charged<00:02:07.170> pretty<00:02:08.009> basic

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
out then it's fully charged pretty basic

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.790 
out then it's fully charged pretty basic
and<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:14.040> yes<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.610> pretty<00:02:14.819> nifty<00:02:14.970> little<00:02:15.270> case

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
and so yes it's pretty nifty little case

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.140 
and so yes it's pretty nifty little case
you<00:02:16.800> know<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.160> nice<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:17.970> actually

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
you know it's nice and you can actually

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.570 
you know it's nice and you can actually
also<00:02:18.540> fit<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> see<00:02:19.739> right<00:02:20.010> over<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
also fit if you see right over here you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.540 
also fit if you see right over here you
can<00:02:20.760> put<00:02:20.970> five<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.010> flavor<00:02:23.010> cartridges

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
can put five of the flavor cartridges

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.309 
can put five of the flavor cartridges
which<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.000> look<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.020> could<00:02:25.170> put

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
which just look like this you could put

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.490 
which just look like this you could put
those<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:26.360> on<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.600> go<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:29.930> actually<00:02:30.930> Bowen

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
those in on the go and actually Bowen

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.870 
those in on the go and actually Bowen
couldn't<00:02:31.890> seem<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.100> want<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> go<00:02:32.430> all<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.730> way

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
couldn't seem to want to go all the way

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.520 
couldn't seem to want to go all the way
but<00:02:34.340> maybe<00:02:35.340> they<00:02:35.520> don't<00:02:35.610> fit<00:02:36.019> well<00:02:37.019> maybe<00:02:37.410> it's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
but maybe they don't fit well maybe it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.759 
but maybe they don't fit well maybe it's
this<00:02:37.680> way<00:02:38.209> yeah<00:02:39.209> okay<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.989> they<00:02:40.110> fit<00:02:40.349> there<00:02:40.590> and

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
this way yeah okay so they fit there and

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.070 
this way yeah okay so they fit there and
you<00:02:41.670> can<00:02:41.790> put<00:02:42.000> two<00:02:42.180> batteries<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.900> over

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
you can put two batteries right over

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.600 
you can put two batteries right over
here<00:02:43.290> there's<00:02:43.530> an<00:02:43.680> empty<00:02:43.950> slot<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
here there's an empty slot and then the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.559 
here there's an empty slot and then the
one<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.910> charges<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.730> now<00:02:48.060> I'll

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
one that charges and so now I'll

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.039 
one that charges and so now I'll
demonstrate<00:02:50.209> there's<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.269> little<00:02:51.690> bit<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
demonstrate there's a little bit of a

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.990 
demonstrate there's a little bit of a
sound<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:53.040> these<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:54.000> too<00:02:54.180> bad<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.850> is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
sound to these it's not too bad this is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.710 
sound to these it's not too bad this is
one<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.540> cartridge<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
one with the cartridge on it this is the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.509 
one with the cartridge on it this is the
menthol<00:03:00.720> flavor<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.440> I'm<00:03:02.100> going<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.310> do<00:03:02.400> this

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
menthol flavor so I'm going to do this

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.699 
menthol flavor so I'm going to do this
right<00:03:02.819> next<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.420> camera<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.290> hear

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
right next to the camera so you can hear

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.340 
right next to the camera so you can hear
it<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.040> case<00:03:05.940> that's<00:03:06.150> something<00:03:07.049> that's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
it in case that's something that's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.590 
it in case that's something that's
important<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:09.000> these<00:03:09.299> aren't<00:03:09.569> very

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
important to you it's these aren't very

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.990 
important to you it's these aren't very
loud<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.049> there<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.380> like<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.590> little<00:03:11.000> hiss

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
loud but there is like a little hiss

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.890 
loud but there is like a little hiss
when<00:03:12.390> you're<00:03:13.609> inhaling<00:03:14.609> and<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.720> then

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
when you're inhaling and then and then

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.259 
when you're inhaling and then and then
some<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.739> these<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.310> kind<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.760> does<00:03:17.970> like<00:03:18.120> this

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
some of these it kind of does like this

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.780 
some of these it kind of does like this
recoil<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.470> don't<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.100> you'll<00:03:20.310> hear<00:03:20.519> in

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
recoil like I don't know you'll hear in

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:32.470 
recoil like I don't know you'll hear in
a<00:03:20.910> second<00:03:21.269> here

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.509 

and<00:03:32.720> they<00:03:33.319> light<00:03:33.530> up<00:03:33.560> blue<00:03:33.830> just<00:03:34.129> like<00:03:34.220> that

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
and they light up blue just like that

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.460 
and they light up blue just like that
what<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.209> could<00:03:35.360> hear<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.629> I<00:03:35.870> inhaled<00:03:36.319> three

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
what you could hear is I inhaled three

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.990 
what you could hear is I inhaled three
times<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.860> then<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.159> second<00:03:37.670> half<00:03:37.819> of<00:03:37.909> the

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
times and then the second half of the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.250 
times and then the second half of the
sound<00:03:38.239> was<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:41.030> guess<00:03:41.659> it<00:03:41.810> sucks<00:03:42.019> air

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
sound was the it I guess it sucks air

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.149 
sound was the it I guess it sucks air
back<00:03:42.440> in<00:03:42.590> or<00:03:42.709> something<00:03:42.920> after<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:45.129> take<00:03:46.129> a

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
back in or something after you take a

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.150 
back in or something after you take a
babe<00:03:46.670> off<00:03:46.849> it<00:03:47.090> but<00:03:47.780> about<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.140> size<00:03:48.560> also<00:03:48.980> i

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
babe off it but about the size also i

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.570 
babe off it but about the size also i
wanted<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.519> just<00:03:49.700> show<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:49.970> little<00:03:50.170> size

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
wanted to just show a little size

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.750 
wanted to just show a little size
demonstration<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.870> joy<00:03:54.400> 510<00:03:55.400> battery

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
demonstration this is a joy 510 battery

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.750 
demonstration this is a joy 510 battery
so<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:56.720> can<00:03:56.870> see<00:03:57.110> that<00:03:57.519> that's<00:03:58.519> that's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
so you can see that that's that's

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.960 
so you can see that that's that's
considered<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.329> pretty<00:03:59.510> small<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:01.430> here

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
considered a pretty small one and here

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.699 
considered a pretty small one and here
is<00:04:03.790> one<00:04:04.790> second<00:04:05.239> for<00:04:05.299> why<00:04:05.450> this<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.230> green

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
is one second for why this is a green

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.240 
is one second for why this is a green
smoke<00:04:07.129> battery<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.590> can<00:04:09.980> see<00:04:10.220> that

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
smoke battery so you can see that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.319 
smoke battery so you can see that
compared<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.120> these<00:04:11.329> two<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:12.319> blue<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:13.329> quite

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
compared to these two the blue is quite

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.420 
compared to these two the blue is quite
a<00:04:14.359> bit<00:04:14.569> smaller<00:04:14.780> it's<00:04:15.560> almost<00:04:15.769> practically

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
a bit smaller it's almost practically

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.050 
a bit smaller it's almost practically
half<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:17.000> size<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.829> green<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.100> they<00:04:20.000> do

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
half the size of the green and they do

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.439 
half the size of the green and they do
you<00:04:20.389> know<00:04:20.539> they<00:04:21.169> do<00:04:21.880> go<00:04:22.880> kind<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.210> quick

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
you know they do go kind of quick

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.040 
you know they do go kind of quick
respectively<00:04:24.080> um<00:04:25.510> they're<00:04:26.510> definitely<00:04:26.690> cool

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
respectively um they're definitely cool

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.200 
respectively um they're definitely cool
little<00:04:27.350> tiny<00:04:27.680> compact<00:04:28.220> e-cigs<00:04:28.669> very<00:04:28.940> light

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
little tiny compact e-cigs very light

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.469 
little tiny compact e-cigs very light
but<00:04:29.449> they<00:04:30.229> do<00:04:30.289> we're<00:04:31.160> out<00:04:31.310> quicker<00:04:31.970> than<00:04:32.210> some

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
but they do we're out quicker than some

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.330

high I believe that's high strength as

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.760 
high I believe that's high strength as
far<00:05:34.800> as<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.220> flavors<00:05:35.790> go<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.810> vaping

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
lighter than a lot of the others like v2

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
menthol to me it's a little bit more

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.010 
menthol to me it's a little bit more
just<00:06:04.590> like<00:06:04.710> a<00:06:04.770> light<00:06:05.520> mint<00:06:05.910> flavor<00:06:06.210> which

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
just like a light mint flavor which

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.860 
just like a light mint flavor which
isn't<00:06:07.290> bad<00:06:07.790> in<00:06:08.790> the<00:06:08.910> coffee<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.330> same<00:06:09.630> thing

kind<00:06:10.140> of<00:06:10.230> along<00:06:10.470> that<00:06:10.620> same<00:06:10.830> theme<00:06:11.100> it's<00:06:11.310> just

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
kind of along that same theme it's just

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.900 
kind of along that same theme it's just
like<00:06:11.670> a<00:06:11.700> light<00:06:11.970> coffee<00:06:12.270> flavor<00:06:12.810> not<00:06:12.990> sweet<00:06:13.350> and

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
like a light coffee flavor not sweet and

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.200 
like a light coffee flavor not sweet and
this<00:06:14.910> regular<00:06:15.390> tobacco<00:06:15.540> to<00:06:15.930> me<00:06:16.050> was<00:06:16.260> just<00:06:16.380> the

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
this regular tobacco to me was just the

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.150 
this regular tobacco to me was just the
it<00:06:18.210> was<00:06:18.360> very<00:06:18.570> subtle<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.530> me<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.770> actually

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
it was very subtle to me it actually

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.190 
it was very subtle to me it actually
tasted<00:06:20.730> like<00:06:20.850> it<00:06:20.910> had<00:06:21.060> a<00:06:21.210> hint<00:06:21.480> of<00:06:21.600> coffee<00:06:21.900> to

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
tasted like it had a hint of coffee to

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.100 
tasted like it had a hint of coffee to
it<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.530> was<00:06:22.650> just<00:06:22.830> a<00:06:23.420> smooth<00:06:25.550> flavor<00:06:26.930> with<00:06:27.930> yeah

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
it it was just a smooth flavor with yeah

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.050 
it it was just a smooth flavor with yeah
just<00:06:28.350> like<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.560> touch<00:06:28.800> of<00:06:28.950> coffee<00:06:29.160> I<00:06:29.580> don't<00:06:29.970> know

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
just like a touch of coffee I don't know

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.120 
just like a touch of coffee I don't know
what<00:06:30.210> to<00:06:30.240> compare<00:06:30.510> to<00:06:31.020> I've<00:06:31.260> seen<00:06:32.010> some

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
what to compare to I've seen some

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.860 
what to compare to I've seen some
reviews<00:06:32.550> and<00:06:32.730> they<00:06:32.790> spoke<00:06:33.090> about<00:06:33.300> some<00:06:33.570> fine

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
reviews and they spoke about some fine

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.080 
reviews and they spoke about some fine
tobaccos<00:06:34.470> so<00:06:34.770> maybe<00:06:36.890> maybe<00:06:37.890> that's<00:06:38.190> what

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
tobaccos so maybe maybe that's what

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.520 
tobaccos so maybe maybe that's what
those<00:06:39.240> taste<00:06:39.450> like<00:06:39.600> I<00:06:39.930> personally<00:06:40.470> just

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
those taste like I personally just

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.870 
those taste like I personally just
smoked<00:06:41.400> Marlboro<00:06:41.790> Reds<00:06:42.090> and<00:06:43.730> probably<00:06:44.730> the

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
smoked Marlboro Reds and probably the

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.930 
smoked Marlboro Reds and probably the
closest<00:06:45.360> thing<00:06:45.510> to<00:06:45.720> that<00:06:45.840> would<00:06:46.170> be<00:06:46.440> a<00:06:46.940> movie

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
closest thing to that would be a movie

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.350 
closest thing to that would be a movie
too<00:06:48.150> and<00:06:48.390> green<00:06:48.720> smoker<00:06:49.050> clothes<00:06:49.680> I<00:06:49.980> guess<00:06:50.940> v2

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
too and green smoker clothes I guess v2

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.150 
too and green smoker clothes I guess v2
would<00:06:51.570> be<00:06:51.660> the<00:06:51.780> closest<00:06:52.200> to<00:06:52.320> that<00:06:52.380> so<00:06:52.920> that's

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
would be the closest to that so that's

and you wanted to try out the blu cig

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.720 
and you wanted to try out the blu cig
you<00:07:29.670> can<00:07:29.700> actually<00:07:30.800> put<00:07:31.800> this<00:07:31.830> is<00:07:32.130> this<00:07:32.520> fits

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:32.730 
you can actually put this is this fits

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.830 
you can actually put this is this fits
of<00:07:32.850> 510<00:07:33.270> this<00:07:33.450> thread<00:07:33.810> is<00:07:33.840> the<00:07:34.140> same<00:07:34.670> so<00:07:35.840> you

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 
of 510 this thread is the same so you

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.500 
of 510 this thread is the same so you
can<00:07:36.990> actually<00:07:37.110> fit<00:07:37.620> the<00:07:37.950> threads<00:07:38.610> not<00:07:39.300> all<00:07:39.450> of

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:39.510 
can actually fit the threads not all of

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.210 
can actually fit the threads not all of
them<00:07:39.690> are<00:07:39.780> like<00:07:39.930> this<00:07:40.140> but<00:07:40.440> these<00:07:40.710> ones<00:07:41.040> are

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
them are like this but these ones are

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.000 
them are like this but these ones are
interchangeable<00:07:41.760> to<00:07:41.940> joy<00:07:42.150> 5<00:07:42.420> 10<00:07:42.750> and<00:07:42.960> the<00:07:43.860> blu

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.010 
interchangeable to joy 5 10 and the blu

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.550 
interchangeable to joy 5 10 and the blu
cig<00:07:44.280> so<00:07:44.610> maybe<00:07:45.270> that'll<00:07:45.480> be<00:07:45.630> a<00:07:45.660> save<00:07:46.230> you<00:07:46.380> one

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 
cig so maybe that'll be a save you one

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.950 
cig so maybe that'll be a save you one
part<00:07:47.010> or<00:07:47.280> if<00:07:47.970> you<00:07:48.090> wanted<00:07:48.420> a<00:07:48.510> miniature

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 
part or if you wanted a miniature

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.350 
part or if you wanted a miniature
battery<00:07:49.320> with<00:07:49.680> any<00:07:49.890> really<00:07:50.430> like<00:07:50.610> some<00:07:50.970> flavor

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 
battery with any really like some flavor

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.690 
battery with any really like some flavor
that<00:07:51.600> fit<00:07:52.230> onto<00:07:52.380> the<00:07:52.620> joy<00:07:52.830> or<00:07:53.130> you<00:07:53.340> wanted<00:07:53.640> to

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:53.700 
that fit onto the joy or you wanted to

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.690 
that fit onto the joy or you wanted to
use<00:07:53.790> an<00:07:53.910> atomizer<00:07:54.980> they'll<00:07:55.980> work<00:07:56.190> for<00:07:56.220> you<00:07:56.520> so

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:56.700 
use an atomizer they'll work for you so

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.720 
use an atomizer they'll work for you so
that's<00:07:56.850> one<00:07:57.210> little<00:07:57.420> plus<00:07:57.800> so<00:07:58.800> I<00:07:58.830> think<00:07:59.520> that's

00:07:59.720 --> 00:07:59.730 
that's one little plus so I think that's

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.060 
that's one little plus so I think that's
about<00:07:59.940> it
