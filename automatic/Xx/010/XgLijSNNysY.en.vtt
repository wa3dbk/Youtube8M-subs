00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.070 
here and there's a little clamp on there
and<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:13.860> will<00:00:14.009> take<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.610> fuel<00:00:15.420> line<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.660> press

and we will take the fuel line and press
it<00:00:16.289> onto<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.740> spout<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.550> Gasquet

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.580 

squeeze<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.380> clamp

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.200 

that<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:36.770> place

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.860 

and<00:00:39.660> these<00:00:39.930> notches<00:00:40.470> here<00:00:41.210> slip<00:00:42.210> into<00:00:42.450> there

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and these notches here slip into there

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.160 
and these notches here slip into there
and<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.880> idea<00:00:45.210> behind<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.690> they'll

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and then the idea behind is they'll

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.800 
and then the idea behind is they'll
catch<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.830> little<00:00:47.130> nubs<00:00:47.400> so<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.510> doesn't

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
catch on these little nubs so it doesn't

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.270 
catch on these little nubs so it doesn't
come<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:48.989> off<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.770> should<00:00:52.770> press<00:00:53.040> down

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
come back off so you should press down

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.599 
come back off so you should press down
until<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.790> snap<00:00:53.850> into<00:00:54.270> place
