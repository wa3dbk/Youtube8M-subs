00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 and this is the era of lynx check 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.650
 welcome to you on my channel this is the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 manifest because today we will check the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.000
 shoot of my hair so it's stack 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.010
 hair one year 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 since my last Czech language I 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.970
 think they have pushed well I do not know 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.350
 what you say but they have me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:31.019
 seem to have pushed quite a bit since 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:33.300
 last time so small precision to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.270
 during this year I cut three 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 my hair seems to me that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.510
 it was three times no more and at each 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.370
 once I cut between 1 and 2 cm because 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.820
 that I am a great follower of twists 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.149
 out 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.969
 and who says without 10 points you look 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.059
 tip that rubs and so tip that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.860
 is damaged very quickly so here I have 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.860
 had to cut regularly because of that 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.470
 besides what I have right now on 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.540
 the head is a twist out but a twist 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.600
 out a little bit special the kind of tristane 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.470
 that I love I call it a twist out re 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.710
 twist and I'll do a tutorial just 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.720
 after to tell you how I do 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:27.430
 so first wick 35 cm the wick of 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.049
 in front of memory not for memory 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.670
 to tell the truth I rechecked a 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.830
 old video because I had forgotten 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 a year ago in the front I was 29 cm 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:47.909
 so six centimeters more 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:55.200
 rather pretty on the side on caudroit 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:02:01.840
 36 cm and last year at 7 at this place 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.030
 I had you seen 30 cm so the same 6 cm 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.960
 the other side of the left side 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.090
 I am now good ah so here I 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.980
 shows you a little bit stretched what that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.560
 given 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:19.810
 I am cucq to 38 cm so it's a small 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.720
 little further on that side or so 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.090
 maybe I had the hair that was 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 are more damaged on the right side 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.959
 and so I may have cut more from 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.310
 right side 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.930
 I can not tell you it's a small 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.220
 little Afro hair magic as they 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.410
 are mostly retract I 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.329
 would be worried if we talk with the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.450
 terms a little bit specific but we 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.359
 not see the difference so on the wick 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.400
 right back I'm at 35 cm a year 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.430
 last I was 26 cm so here I am 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.620
 ultra proud because I was not at all 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.850
 happy to have the back much more 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.150
 short and there on the other side 35 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:04.950
 centimeters while I was 28 cm from 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.200
 So that's that side I made less 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.959
 I made less dense remove this 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:19.620
 year well it paid off and on the wick 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:22.410
 in the middle of my head I am 40 cm 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.550
 last year I was 31 cm so 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.010
 overall 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:33.640
 + 6 cm in front and on the sides and more 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.060
 10 cm in the back and in the middle of the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.580
 head 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.340
 I am rather very satisfied then there 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.410
 I make you a little bit of 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.200
 small lynx cake visuals for you 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.780
 can see where my hair is coming from 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.340
 but I would say I would say for the most 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.470
 long 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.860
 mbl big bag linked high that is to say at 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.650
 middle back and then in for the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.380
 majority can be rather bsl high 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.120
 level at the shoulder strap of the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.490
 bra so I'm rather 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.480
 happy with this evolution in four 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.900
 years of natural I equaled my length of 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.460
 relaxed hair so it's time to 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.460
 move on to a new adventure
