00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
standard rig for fishing pellets what is

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.460 
standard rig for fishing pellets what is
important<00:02:25.120> with<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.270> rig<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.170> when<00:02:26.320> you're

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
important with a rig so for when you're

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.160 
important with a rig so for when you're
fishing<00:02:26.650> short<00:02:27.100> shallow<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.780> length<00:02:28.960> of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
fishing short shallow is the length of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.530 
fishing short shallow is the length of

since<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.350> can<00:02:32.500> see<00:02:32.710> it's<00:02:32.860> quite<00:02:33.070> long<00:02:34.230> it's

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
since you can see it's quite long it's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.230 
since you can see it's quite long it's
definitely<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.340> definitely<00:02:36.520> catch<00:02:36.970> more

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
definitely you definitely catch more

I mentioned when I was talking about

I mentioned when I was talking about
bait<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.660> use<00:03:16.810> slop<00:03:17.080> sometimes<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.060> if

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
bait I like to use slop sometimes and if

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.140 
bait I like to use slop sometimes and if
the<00:03:19.870> fishing<00:03:20.110> slightly<00:03:20.680> more<00:03:20.860> difficult<00:03:21.430> then

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
the fishing slightly more difficult then

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.840 
the fishing slightly more difficult then
feeding<00:03:22.900> tightly<00:03:23.590> with<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:24.040> slop<00:03:24.459> rather

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
feeding tightly with the slop rather

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.510 
feeding tightly with the slop rather
than<00:03:25.209> throwing<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:26.260> definitely<00:03:26.680> be<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.920> big

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
than throwing it can definitely be a big

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.600 
than throwing it can definitely be a big
advantage

one out and then I'll run you through

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:54.440 
one out and then I'll run you through
what<00:03:35.730> I'm<00:03:36.240> doing<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.690> catch<00:03:36.870> them<00:03:37.080> today

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.750 

but<00:03:55.450> today<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.959> found<00:03:56.350> that<00:03:56.590> fishing<00:03:57.400> with<00:03:57.550> an<00:03:57.640> 8

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
but today I found that fishing with an 8

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.220 
but today I found that fishing with an 8
mil<00:03:57.970> pellet<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.480> making<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.840> little<00:03:58.990> bit<00:03:59.110> more

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
mil pellet and making a little bit more

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.990 
mil pellet and making a little bit more
noise<00:03:59.620> has<00:03:59.860> definitely<00:04:00.310> been<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.520> best<00:04:00.819> way

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
noise has definitely been the best way

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.800 
noise has definitely been the best way
forward<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:03.130> put<00:04:03.370> another<00:04:03.580> one<00:04:03.820> on<00:04:03.850> now<00:04:04.209> and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
forward just put another one on now and

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.750 
forward just put another one on now and
I'll<00:04:04.959> get<00:04:05.170> ships<00:04:05.470> out<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.010> show<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:06.550> all

out<00:04:16.900> bring<00:04:17.170> it<00:04:17.200> slightly<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:17.860> right<00:04:18.160> and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
out bring it slightly to the right and

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.780 
out bring it slightly to the right and
what<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.959> reason<00:04:20.290> for<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.770> you<00:04:20.950> Sarkis<00:04:21.489> I

what the reason for that is you Sarkis I
can<00:04:21.970> slap<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.240> rig<00:04:22.570> over<00:04:22.750> initially<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.830> have

it pass the Polti and then it's just a

it pass the Polti and then it's just a
case<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:29.460> picking<00:04:30.460> up<00:04:30.990> six<00:04:31.990> or<00:04:32.080> eight<00:04:32.260> pellets

I'm<00:04:36.790> repeating<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.450> again<00:04:37.630> just<00:04:38.290> flicking<00:04:38.590> it

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
I'm repeating it again just flicking it

out past the pole tip that's very very
