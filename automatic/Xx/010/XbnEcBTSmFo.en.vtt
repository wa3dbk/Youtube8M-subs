wet thing on that so this is what you're
getting<00:03:47.419> 26<00:03:48.419> inches<00:03:48.780> this<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.049> how<00:03:49.290> much<00:03:49.470> what

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
getting 26 inches this is how much what

thing you're getting again it goes by

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.369 
thing you're getting again it goes by
weight<00:03:52.139> so<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:53.129> longer<00:03:53.519> your<00:03:53.699> hair<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.379> the

thing is or what I'm trying to say the

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.610 
thing is or what I'm trying to say the
bundle<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.769> smaller<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.480> that's<00:04:03.629> 26<00:04:04.139> inches

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
bundle is smaller so that's 26 inches

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
let me put this back in the back so I

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.949 
let me put this back in the back so I
don't<00:04:06.090> want<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.299> mix<00:04:06.449> up<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.720> lean<00:04:07.019> for<00:04:08.959> that's

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
don't want to mix up the lean for that's

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.020 
don't want to mix up the lean for that's
what<00:04:10.079> you're<00:04:10.229> getting<00:04:10.319> there<00:04:10.620> 424<00:04:11.340> again<00:04:11.790> it

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
goes by weight so the longer the hair is

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.089 
goes by weight so the longer the hair is
the<00:04:15.659> smaller<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.229> bundle<00:04:16.680> will<00:04:16.889> be<00:04:18.590> this<00:04:19.590> hair
