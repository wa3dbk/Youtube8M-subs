what we do here is we capture most of
the<00:02:05.110> water<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.320> comes<00:02:05.500> from<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.740> sky<00:02:05.890> and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
the water that comes from the sky and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.440 
the water that comes from the sky and
prevent<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.580> from<00:02:06.610> turning<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.119> depleting

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
prevent it from turning and depleting

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.500 
prevent it from turning and depleting
runoff<00:02:08.040> this<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.340> rain<00:02:09.489> forest<00:02:09.790> dome<00:02:09.940> okay

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
runoff this is the rain forest dome okay

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.030 
runoff this is the rain forest dome okay
and<00:02:10.720> behind<00:02:11.019> us<00:02:11.170> there<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.560> planetarium

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and behind us there is the planetarium

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.110 
and behind us there is the planetarium
dome<00:02:12.100> you'll<00:02:12.280> see<00:02:12.400> there's<00:02:12.549> two<00:02:12.670> equal<00:02:12.970> sized

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
dome you'll see there's two equal sized

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.820 
dome you'll see there's two equal sized
domes<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.660> roof<00:02:13.870> these<00:02:14.530> domes<00:02:14.739> are

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
domes on the roof these domes are

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.990 
domes on the roof these domes are
actually<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.100> really<00:02:15.250> important<00:02:15.700> part<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
actually a really important part of the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.699 
actually a really important part of the
passive<00:02:16.360> cooling<00:02:16.660> system<00:02:17.170> for<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.410> building

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
passive cooling system for the building

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.410 
passive cooling system for the building
as<00:02:17.799> well<00:02:17.920> cold<00:02:18.280> air<00:02:18.459> sweeps<00:02:18.790> across<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.239> roof

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
as well cold air sweeps across the roof

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.270 
as well cold air sweeps across the roof
and<00:02:19.630> actually<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.380> goes<00:02:20.500> across<00:02:20.830> these<00:02:21.010> domes

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
and actually it goes across these domes

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.550 
and actually it goes across these domes
on<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.090> hills<00:02:22.269> here<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.630> channels

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
on the on the hills here and channels

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.960 
on the on the hills here and channels
down<00:02:23.739> into<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.160> Piazza<00:02:24.549> which<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.820> right

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
down into the Piazza which is right

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.789 
down into the Piazza which is right
behind<00:02:25.120> us<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.660> although<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.260> piazza<00:02:26.620> looks

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
behind us and although the piazza looks

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:27.930 
behind us and although the piazza looks
like<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.100> closed<00:02:27.430> from<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.730> outside

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
like it's closed from the outside

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.890 
like it's closed from the outside
elements<00:02:28.239> there's<00:02:28.360> actually<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.660> perimeter

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
elements there's actually a perimeter

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.150 
elements there's actually a perimeter
gap<00:02:29.200> all<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.440> way<00:02:29.530> around<00:02:29.799> it<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.070> was

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
gap all the way around it it was

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.890 
gap all the way around it it was

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
Piazza because cold air sinks and then

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.110 
Piazza because cold air sinks and then
we<00:02:35.890> have<00:02:36.040> windows<00:02:36.430> at<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.700> base<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
skylights here in the dome so we have

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.479

money the Academy of Sciences was built

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.190 
money the Academy of Sciences was built
with<00:02:53.920> water<00:02:54.189> conservation<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.939> mind<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.629> we

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
with water conservation in mind and we

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.720 
with water conservation in mind and we
have<00:02:56.230> make<00:02:56.530> up<00:02:56.560> water<00:02:56.860> coming<00:02:57.310> from<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.459> beach

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
have make up water coming from the beach

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.000 
have make up water coming from the beach
for<00:02:58.450> our<00:02:58.569> aquarium<00:02:59.049> system<00:02:59.409> so<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.709> we<00:02:59.799> don't

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
for our aquarium system so that we don't

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.670 
for our aquarium system so that we don't
have<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.280> use<00:03:00.400> domestic<00:03:00.849> water<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:02.409> cooler

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680

have to use domestic water and cooler
water<00:03:03.579> conservation<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.329> a<00:03:04.360> critical<00:03:04.870> issue

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
water conservation is a critical issue

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.289 
water conservation is a critical issue
and<00:03:05.440> we're<00:03:06.099> really<00:03:06.310> focused<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.940> creating

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
and we're really focused on creating

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.599 
and we're really focused on creating
education<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.140> awareness<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:09.099> consumers

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
education and awareness to consumers

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.220 
education and awareness to consumers
about<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.940> benefits<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.540> saving<00:03:10.930> water<00:03:11.049> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
about the benefits of saving water and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.229 
about the benefits of saving water and
how<00:03:11.409> they<00:03:11.530> can<00:03:11.680> do<00:03:11.829> that<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.489> most<00:03:12.700> important

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
how they can do that the most important

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.190 
how they can do that the most important
and<00:03:13.359> effective<00:03:13.599> way<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:13.840> we<00:03:14.019> minimize

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
and effective way that we minimize

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.050 
and effective way that we minimize
political<00:03:14.980> water<00:03:15.159> use<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.670> we<00:03:15.819> actually

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
political water use is that we actually

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.940 
political water use is that we actually
have<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> pipe<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:17.290> goes<00:03:17.319> three<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:17.859> half

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
have a pipe that goes three and a half

miles underground from this aquarium

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.170 
miles underground from this aquarium
here<00:03:19.810> out<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.620> Pacific<00:03:21.010> Ocean<00:03:21.129> and<00:03:21.549> so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
here out to the Pacific Ocean and so

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.089 
here out to the Pacific Ocean and so
what<00:03:22.359> we<00:03:22.480> do<00:03:22.599> is<00:03:22.750> we<00:03:22.870> draw<00:03:23.109> in<00:03:23.349> salt<00:03:23.769> water<00:03:23.920> from

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
what we do is we draw in salt water from

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.800 
what we do is we draw in salt water from
the<00:03:24.220> Pacific<00:03:24.549> Ocean<00:03:24.639> into<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.269> aquarium<00:03:25.629> here

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
the Pacific Ocean into the aquarium here

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.569 
the Pacific Ocean into the aquarium here
and<00:03:25.959> we<00:03:26.049> treat<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.190> salt<00:03:27.430> water

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
and we treat it so that the salt water

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.190 
and we treat it so that the salt water
becomes<00:03:27.909> a<00:03:28.030> little<00:03:28.209> more<00:03:28.540> specific<00:03:29.019> for<00:03:29.109> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
becomes a little more specific for the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.330 
becomes a little more specific for the
different<00:03:29.440> types<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.739> tanks<00:03:30.099> in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.280> aquarium

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
different types of tanks in the aquarium

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.910 
different types of tanks in the aquarium
what<00:03:31.239> I've<00:03:31.389> learned<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:31.930> when<00:03:32.079> we<00:03:32.680> can

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
what I've learned is that when we can

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.140 
what I've learned is that when we can
connect<00:03:33.250> with<00:03:33.310> people<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.760> meaningful<00:03:33.909> way

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
and help them understand that there are

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.289 
and help them understand that there are
things<00:03:36.190> they<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:36.459> do<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.670> help<00:03:36.700> they're

and my experience has been that people

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.159 
and my experience has been that people
although<00:03:44.680> not<00:03:45.159> always<00:03:45.549> easily<00:03:46.389> shifted<00:03:46.930> into

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
although not always easily shifted into

I've seen around the United States in

I've seen around the United States in
particular<00:03:58.449> is<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.280> consumers<00:04:00.280> are<00:04:00.400> now

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
particular is that consumers are now

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.369 
particular is that consumers are now
becoming<00:04:00.940> aware<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.419> water<00:04:01.660> efficiency<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.349> a

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
becoming aware of water efficiency is a

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.170 
becoming aware of water efficiency is a
it's<00:04:02.829> an<00:04:02.919> opportunity<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.609> save<00:04:03.790> water<00:04:03.970> in

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
it's an opportunity to save water in

it's an opportunity to save water in
their<00:04:04.329> homes<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.840> think<00:04:05.319> what<00:04:05.799> we've<00:04:05.980> really

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
their homes I think what we've really

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.659 
their homes I think what we've really
looked<00:04:07.209> at<00:04:07.389> is<00:04:08.010> getting<00:04:09.010> them<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.340> real

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
looked at is getting them a real

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.400 
looked at is getting them a real
understanding<00:04:09.879> of<00:04:10.419> how<00:04:10.660> much<00:04:10.870> they<00:04:11.049> can<00:04:11.109> save

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
understanding of how much they can save

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.930 
understanding of how much they can save
and<00:04:12.560> once<00:04:13.010> they<00:04:13.190> see<00:04:13.250> that<00:04:13.460> they<00:04:13.700> get<00:04:13.820> excited

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
and once they see that they get excited

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.600 
and once they see that they get excited
about<00:04:14.300> it
