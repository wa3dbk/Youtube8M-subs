00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
very firm control of the middle of the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.149 
very firm control of the middle of the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
map and he's going to go and see this

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.499 
map and he's going to go and see this
control<00:01:53.549> tower<00:01:53.729> maybe<00:01:54.030> take<00:01:54.240> control<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
control tower maybe take control a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
control tower maybe take control a
little<00:01:54.570> bit<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:54.930> well<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.290> sensor<00:01:55.950> tower<00:01:56.130> has

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
little bit as well a sensor tower has

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.800 
little bit as well a sensor tower has
gone<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> middle<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.149> he<00:01:57.210> will<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
gone about the middle so he will see the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.039 
gone about the middle so he will see the
exact<00:01:58.170> movements<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:59.420> hugs<00:02:00.420> troops<00:02:00.810> it's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
exact movements of hugs troops it's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.410 
exact movements of hugs troops it's
almost<00:02:01.500> kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.829> unfair

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
almost kind of unfair

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.359 
almost kind of unfair
but<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:04.040> does<00:02:04.310> cause<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.610> good<00:02:04.909> bit<00:02:05.150> of<00:02:05.180> gas<00:02:06.369> once

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
but it does cause a good bit of gas once

I think he's only mining from about half

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.740 
I think he's only mining from about half
the<00:02:57.290> minerals<00:02:57.590> because<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:58.010> other<00:02:58.160> half<00:02:58.430> is

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
the minerals because the other half is

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.900 
the minerals because the other half is

almost a Templar at the moment we saw a

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.540 
almost a Templar at the moment we saw a
lot<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.230> production<00:04:54.680> facilities<00:04:55.160> going<00:04:55.430> up

lot of production facilities going up

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.550 
lot of production facilities going up
for<00:04:55.820> more<00:04:56.510> over<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:56.900> place<00:04:57.050> taking<00:04:57.350> another

for more over the place taking another
expansion<00:04:57.950> sensing<00:04:58.550> his<00:04:58.640> immediate

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
expansion sensing his immediate

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.140 
expansion sensing his immediate
advantage<00:04:59.710> he<00:05:00.710> seizes<00:05:01.070> another<00:05:01.370> tank<00:05:01.700> up<00:05:01.910> and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
advantage he seizes another tank up and

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.800 
advantage he seizes another tank up and
now<00:05:03.020> this<00:05:03.500> is<00:05:03.680> very<00:05:04.010> very<00:05:04.220> difficult<00:05:04.580> for<00:05:05.060> how

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
now this is very very difficult for how

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.240 
now this is very very difficult for how
to<00:05:05.870> do<00:05:06.110> if<00:05:06.260> he<00:05:06.350> doesn't<00:05:06.380> have<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.740> resources

to do if he doesn't have the resources
to<00:05:07.400> deal<00:05:07.730> with<00:05:07.880> this<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.300> he's<00:05:08.450> mining<00:05:08.900> only

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200
