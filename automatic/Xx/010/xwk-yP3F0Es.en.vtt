just come over here to the two side just
like<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.470> means<00:04:25.710> it's<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.980> single

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
like that and that means it's a single

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.550 
like that and that means it's a single
down<00:04:26.430> here<00:04:26.760> so<00:04:27.630> if<00:04:27.690> we<00:04:27.720> don't<00:04:27.930> get<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.290> switz

down here so if we don't get the switz

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.810 
down here so if we don't get the switz
then<00:04:28.800> we're<00:04:28.920> gonna<00:04:29.010> get<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.280> off<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.520> single

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
then we're gonna get it off the single

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.720 
then we're gonna get it off the single
down<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.600> set<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:30.990> angle<00:04:31.380> like<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.830> set

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730
