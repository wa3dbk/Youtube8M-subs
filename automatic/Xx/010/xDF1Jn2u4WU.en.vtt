00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
you can see I'm working on another Neo

you can see I'm working on another Neo
Geo<00:00:05.879> AES<00:00:06.350> one<00:00:07.350> thing<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.649> you'll<00:00:07.770> notice

Geo AES one thing that you'll notice

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.470 
Geo AES one thing that you'll notice
about<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.460> one<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:08.970> just<00:00:09.090> came<00:00:09.300> in

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
about this one this one just came in

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
about this one this one just came in
here<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.710> has<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> replacement<00:00:12.230> card<00:00:13.230> slot

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
here and it has a replacement card slot

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.980 
here and it has a replacement card slot
here<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.519> see<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> pins<00:00:15.059> here<00:00:15.299> one<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
here you can see the pins here one of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.279 
here you can see the pins here one of
the<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.920> prongs<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> side<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.630> bent

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the the prongs here on the side was bent

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.109 
the the prongs here on the side was bent
down<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.920> tried<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> pry<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.460> back<00:00:20.520> up<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
down so I tried to pry it back up but it

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.269 
down so I tried to pry it back up but it
broke<00:00:21.330> off<00:00:21.539> but<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.260> still<00:00:22.500> has<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:23.010> pin

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
broke off but it still has one pin

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.820 
broke off but it still has one pin
touching<00:00:24.210> there<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.930> should<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.199> okay<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
touching there so that should be okay I

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
touching there so that should be okay I
had<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> bend<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.550> couple<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> these<00:00:27.090> pins<00:00:27.390> back

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
had to bend a couple of these pins back

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
had to bend a couple of these pins back
but<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.740> there's<00:00:28.980> no<00:00:29.189> tabs<00:00:29.820> here

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
but you can see there's no tabs here

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
but you can see there's no tabs here
that<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.359> holding<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.960> pins<00:00:31.590> back<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.219> are

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
that are holding the pins back these are

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.900 
that are holding the pins back these are
kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.850> similar<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.870> MVS<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> it's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
kind of similar to the MVS but it's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.729 
kind of similar to the MVS but it's
still<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.390> bit<00:00:36.630> different<00:00:37.050> nonetheless

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
still a little bit different nonetheless

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.380 
still a little bit different nonetheless
this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> problem

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this is not the problem

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.360 
this is not the problem
problem<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.110> having<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.340> here

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
problem that I'm having it is down here

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.240 
problem that I'm having it is down here
I<00:00:41.820> found<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.750> scraped<00:00:43.440> away<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> little<00:00:43.890> bit<00:00:44.010> at

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
I found I scraped away a little bit at

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
I found I scraped away a little bit at
it<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> could<00:00:44.850> find<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> problem<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.140> as

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it so I could find the problem but as

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.930 
it so I could find the problem but as
you<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.039> there's<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.460> trace<00:00:47.730> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you can see here there's one trace in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.479 
you can see here there's one trace in
the<00:00:47.969> middle<00:00:48.270> has<00:00:48.780> two<00:00:49.050> dashes<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the middle has two dashes in it and that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
the middle has two dashes in it and that
trace<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> eaten<00:00:51.120> away<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.510> these<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.809> really

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
trace is eaten away and these are really

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
trace is eaten away and these are really
really<00:00:52.440> thin<00:00:52.860> traces<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> thing<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> not

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
really thin traces this thing is not

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910 
really thin traces this thing is not
gonna<00:00:54.180> focus<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.379> give<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:55.890> idea

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
gonna focus in to give you a good idea

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.700 
gonna focus in to give you a good idea
of<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.550> look<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.379> very

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of what they look like but they are very

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340 
of what they look like but they are very
very<00:00:58.920> thin<00:00:59.219> traces<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.020> I'm<00:01:01.020> gonna<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
very thin traces and I'm gonna have to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.160 
very thin traces and I'm gonna have to
see<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.219> over<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> maybe<00:01:03.930> use

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
see if I can go over this and maybe use

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.380 
see if I can go over this and maybe use
a<00:01:04.199> little<00:01:04.320> bit<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> solder<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.180> can

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a little bit of solder and see if I can

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050 
a little bit of solder and see if I can
run<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> along<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.619> side<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:07.890> hopefully<00:01:08.670> be

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
run it along the side here hopefully be

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.170 
run it along the side here hopefully be
able<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.560> get<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.799> solder<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.729> points

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
able to get some solder on these points

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
able to get some solder on these points
without<00:01:12.510> bridging<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.500> give<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> an

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
without bridging them but give you an

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.710 
without bridging them but give you an
idea<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:14.970> doing<00:01:15.270> here

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
idea what it's doing here

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.499 
idea what it's doing here
I<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:16.200> King<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.920> Fighters<00:01:17.009> 95<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.270> we'll<00:01:18.390> put

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
I got King of Fighters 95 so we'll put

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.080 
I got King of Fighters 95 so we'll put
this<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.380> bit<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> loose

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
this in it's a little bit of a loose

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.499 
this in it's a little bit of a loose
slot<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.850> everything<00:01:24.090> aligned

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
slot but so I get everything aligned

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.510 
slot but so I get everything aligned
here<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.659> watch<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.200> front<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
here but if you watch the front here you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.569 
here but if you watch the front here you
can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.210> there's<00:01:30.500> some<00:01:31.500> lines<00:01:31.799> through

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
can see how there's some lines through

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
can see how there's some lines through
the<00:01:32.729> NeoGeo<00:01:33.299> part<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> top<00:01:34.229> those<00:01:34.920> should

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the NeoGeo part up the top those should

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.969 
the NeoGeo part up the top those should
not<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.369> there<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.350> that's<00:01:37.530> due

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
not be there and I think that that's due

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
not be there and I think that that's due
to<00:01:38.189> those<00:01:38.670> lines<00:01:39.030> being<00:01:39.329> eaten<00:01:39.659> away<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.020> those

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to those lines being eaten away or those

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
to those lines being eaten away or those
traces<00:01:40.619> being<00:01:40.860> eaten<00:01:41.100> away<00:01:41.189> you'll<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.030> able

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
traces being eaten away you'll be able

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.030 
traces being eaten away you'll be able
to<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.509> bit<00:01:42.810> worse<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to see it a little bit worse here you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.539 
to see it a little bit worse here you
can<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> lines<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.390> SNK

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
can see the lines going through the SNK

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.620 
can see the lines going through the SNK
so

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.719 

here<00:01:50.630> there's<00:01:50.960> parts<00:01:51.229> missing<00:01:51.490> it's<00:01:52.490> playing

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
here there's parts missing it's playing

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.179 
here there's parts missing it's playing
the<00:01:52.880> game<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:53.329> it's<00:01:54.140> not<00:01:54.380> playing<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.799> perfect

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
the game but it's not playing it perfect

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.609 
the game but it's not playing it perfect

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
at all and the next screen will be able

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.679 
at all and the next screen will be able
to<00:01:57.770> show<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:58.729> see<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:58.939> Lions<00:01:59.390> going

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
to show you you can see the Lions going

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.529 
to show you you can see the Lions going
up<00:01:59.810> and<00:01:59.960> down<00:02:00.079> looks<00:02:01.039> really<00:02:01.340> bad<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:01.880> what

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
up and down looks really bad so what

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.350 
up and down looks really bad so what
we're<00:02:02.659> gonna<00:02:02.719> try<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.170> do<00:02:03.289> here<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:04.149> see<00:02:05.149> about

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
we're gonna try and do here is see about

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.229 
we're gonna try and do here is see about
adding<00:02:05.869> some<00:02:06.079> solder<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.759> that<00:02:07.759> area<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:10.239> see

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
adding some solder to that area and see

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:11.860 
adding some solder to that area and see
what<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.480> get

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
what we get

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.820 
what we get
need<00:02:12.140> some<00:02:12.410> flux<00:02:12.800> here<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.349> see<00:02:15.349> if<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.709> do

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
need some flux here and see if I can do

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.800 
need some flux here and see if I can do
this<00:02:16.040> well<00:02:16.640> since<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.000> got<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.209> camera<00:02:17.450> here

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
this well since I got the camera here

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.900 
this well since I got the camera here
and<00:02:17.840> might<00:02:18.049> as<00:02:18.140> well<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.440> give<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> shot

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
and might as well just give it a shot

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.070 
and might as well just give it a shot
I<00:02:21.549> got<00:02:22.549> my<00:02:22.670> solder<00:02:22.940> out<00:02:23.180> or<00:02:23.330> not<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.930> to

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
I got my solder out or not I have to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.069 
I got my solder out or not I have to
double<00:02:24.230> check<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:25.220> got<00:02:25.970> my<00:02:26.090> flux<00:02:26.390> here<00:02:26.720> so

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
double check but got my flux here so

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.050 
double check but got my flux here so
let's<00:02:27.890> give<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> shot<00:02:28.489> here<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.790> see<00:02:28.940> what

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
let's give it a shot here and see what

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.280 
let's give it a shot here and see what
happens<00:02:29.090> see<00:02:29.599> if<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.840> get<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.079> picture

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
happens see if we can get this picture

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.020 
happens see if we can get this picture
any<00:02:30.560> better<00:02:30.739> let's<00:02:31.250> kind<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.459> put<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.700> camera

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
any better let's kind of put the camera

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.539 
any better let's kind of put the camera
down<00:02:32.060> for<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.510> second<00:02:35.769> put<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.829> little<00:02:37.220> bit<00:02:37.370> of

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
down for a second put a little bit of

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.729 
down for a second put a little bit of
this<00:02:38.030> flux<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.630> here<00:02:38.870> I've<00:02:38.989> disconnected<00:02:39.319> the

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
this flux on here I've disconnected the

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.660 
this flux on here I've disconnected the
power<00:02:39.769> cable<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:43.180> put<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.360> down<00:02:44.540> there

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
power cable but put that down there

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.910 
power cable but put that down there
and<00:02:47.049> see<00:02:48.049> about<00:02:48.170> running<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.769> over<00:02:53.920> see

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
and see about running this over see

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.670 
and see about running this over see
about<00:02:55.120> put<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> little<00:02:56.510> bit<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.720> solder<00:02:57.350> on<00:02:57.470> the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
about put a little bit of solder on the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.430 
about put a little bit of solder on the
end<00:02:57.799> here<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.639> it's<00:02:58.790> kind<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.150> turn<00:03:00.079> this<00:03:00.230> up

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
end here and it's kind of turn this up

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.020 
end here and it's kind of turn this up
this<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:01.329> not<00:03:02.329> really<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:03.109> good<00:03:04.450> tip<00:03:05.450> but<00:03:07.030> see

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
this is not really a good tip but see

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:24.050 
this is not really a good tip but see
what<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.239> can<00:03:08.420> do

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.280 

all<00:03:25.060> right<00:03:25.270> as<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.350> see<00:03:26.560> down<00:03:26.710> here<00:03:27.030> I've

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
all right as you can see down here I've

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.360 
all right as you can see down here I've
tinned<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.410> up<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.650> little<00:03:29.800> bit

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
tinned it up a little bit

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.400 
tinned it up a little bit
looks<00:03:31.000> like<00:03:31.150> those<00:03:31.390> those<00:03:31.840> parts<00:03:32.200> in<00:03:32.320> the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
looks like those those parts in the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.550 
looks like those those parts in the
middle<00:03:32.560> are<00:03:32.770> still<00:03:33.160> capped<00:03:33.940> but<00:03:34.390> see<00:03:35.350> if<00:03:35.440> it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
middle are still capped but see if it

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.610 
middle are still capped but see if it
does<00:03:35.740> anything<00:03:35.980> different<00:03:37.440> plug<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.560> thing

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
does anything different plug this thing

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:51.450 
does anything different plug this thing
back<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:49.050> put<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.170> power<00:03:50.350> back<00:03:50.440> in<00:03:50.830> this<00:03:51.400> thing

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
back in put the power back in this thing

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.980 
back in put the power back in this thing
probably<00:03:51.820> will<00:03:52.060> still<00:03:52.300> do<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.540> same<00:03:52.780> thing

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.030 

yeah<00:03:59.100> still<00:04:00.100> not<00:04:00.400> yet<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:01.000> still<00:04:01.300> has<00:04:01.540> some

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
yeah still not yet you still has some

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.810 
yeah still not yet you still has some
lines<00:04:03.040> through<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.490> up<00:04:03.610> at<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.820> top<00:04:04.030> there<00:04:04.300> I

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
lines through it up at the top there I

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.310 
lines through it up at the top there I
can't<00:04:06.820> tell<00:04:07.000> if<00:04:07.120> that's<00:04:07.270> better<00:04:07.600> or<00:04:07.720> not

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
can't tell if that's better or not

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.680 
can't tell if that's better or not
nope<00:04:08.740> guess<00:04:09.459> not<00:04:11.490> still<00:04:12.490> glitching<00:04:13.240> out<00:04:13.390> quite

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
nope guess not still glitching out quite

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.250 
nope guess not still glitching out quite
a<00:04:13.720> bit<00:04:13.890> I'll<00:04:14.890> go<00:04:15.100> over<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.400> again<00:04:15.459> see<00:04:16.390> see<00:04:17.140> what

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
a bit I'll go over it again see see what

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.250 
a bit I'll go over it again see see what
I<00:04:17.320> can<00:04:17.500> do<00:04:17.620> here<00:04:18.480> I'll<00:04:19.480> probably<00:04:19.660> get<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.959> couple

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
I can do here I'll probably get a couple

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.060 
I can do here I'll probably get a couple
of<00:04:20.350> connections<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.920> are<00:04:22.050> together<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:26.830> is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
of connections that are together this is

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.550 
of connections that are together this is
the<00:04:27.310> fun<00:04:28.030> part<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.510> trying<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.930> repair<00:04:29.410> these

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
the fun part of trying to repair these

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:49.279 
the fun part of trying to repair these
things

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.070 

yeah<00:04:50.289> I<00:04:50.770> think<00:04:51.039> that<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:52.509> middle<00:04:52.809> one<00:04:52.960> I'm

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
yeah I think that the middle one I'm

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.369 
yeah I think that the middle one I'm
gonna<00:04:53.199> have<00:04:53.409> to<00:04:53.620> try<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.839> see<00:04:55.839> if<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.050> can<00:04:56.229> find

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:56.379 
gonna have to try and see if I can find
