00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.209
 it is 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.209
 that's great 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.200
 there are no deaths in fact I think 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.600
 that there are no wines for things 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.950
 too huge in twice a month that's 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.260
 really it's such a beautiful fix was 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:37.460
 it's not for nothing that they 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:40.370

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.200
 and on my life no longer has tri-nations 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.290

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.290
 make 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.079
 and financial 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 this is it that it was so cool 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.420

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.960

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.640
 areas clearly for seven days we have 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.510
 still had the cure the atmosphere was 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.310
 really nice episodes and who 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.310
 it does not go through 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.580
 class 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.580
 pettis morizet 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.400
 it will make people vote for us 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.020
 stay in our presentation to have 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 the clichÃ©s actually we will be heading out 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.290
 place and then organized gang the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.920
 trip then simply and we will go 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:45.040
 on the spot have assumed and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:50.520
 the longest wait the next fc metz 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.520
 is there the scene we're going this movie is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.759
 produced after our video because the 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.479
 people they actually think of imaged 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:04.330
 but act by wearing his name what 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.330
 people think the big trouble the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.730
 project I think 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.370
 it is 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.260
 it serves as a waffle and 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:17.920
 projects and bakou your very fair on the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.480
 project and succeed in doing so even though their 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.330
 project they do not vary immediately 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.980
 shown where are we going it's an idea are not 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.180
 still it can not really when fix 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.940
 that they go there and that they 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.300
 believe and I love it allows to 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.130
 jesper of those just evolving tempted and 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.730

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.540
