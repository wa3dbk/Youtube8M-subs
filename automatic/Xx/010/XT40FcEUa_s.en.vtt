00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.949
 more than one in three older 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.990
 patients over 65 who are in it 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.789
 end up in the hospital that you 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.590
 be malnourished 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.879
 that's a pretty big group 1 on 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.170
 the 3 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.210
 those people who go home and those 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.040
 have all returned condition 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.610
 what should they do but who in her home and 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 that's not easy 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.640
 if we try to do is one for this 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.400
 chart how many people are 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.030
 already malnourished and we also try 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.519
 people do better with simple tools 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.930
 to eat 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.570
 because recently in the hospital 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.430
 is people at their own request 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.290
 order food not three times 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.510
 offering food per day but that people do 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.890
 allow as much as possible throughout the day 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.259
 eat what they themselves want what we ourselves 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 they like it so well 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.250
 possibly the diet 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.640
 these have a menu and from 10 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.259
 minutes off they can themselves 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.719
 make a choice and that can be 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.700
 pass on by telephone then we will take care of that 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.799
 with the patient within 45 minutes 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.520
 is delivered 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.009
 yes it is fantastic a la carte food 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.569
 first visit what is on the news time 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.969
 and then you think oh this draw this 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:37.259
 swallow this swallow only 3 times a day 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.220
 so really work 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.430
 jelle 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.430
 Yes 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.909
 we hope that in addition to the things we do now 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.649
 do with the patients 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.860
 offer the physiotherapist medication 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.850
 often already switch that on with power 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.890
 can treat people better than are 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.560
 redecorate faster that they are also faster 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.979
 and that they can be home sooner 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.979
 pleasant 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.750
 I also think it's for the extra joy 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.420
 of the people in beds 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 you lie idle all day 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.350
 yes then you can really use this memory 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.750
 we in hospital it kicks in no way 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.860
 eat beam bridge 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.330
 it is very important for the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.750
 hospitals to have good ethical 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.750
 strengthen 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.610
 a very nice collaboration from here 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.890
 and the Wageningen University a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 very short distance away where the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.850
 university in wageningen 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.990
 knows a lot about nutrition 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.550
 the general sense and we are natural 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.770
 the people in the hospital you 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.260
 understanding of the patients and of 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.610
 the state of health 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.990
 and what we are looking at is one 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.370
 lots of things to 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.230
 how much protein is ingested how much 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 energy you need but also to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.430
 other nutrients such as vitamins 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.680
 and minerals whether or not one 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.910
 lack or just too much and what 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 the role of that 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.350
 any deficits or those that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.990
 surpluses or what their role is 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.770
 the clinical picture or treatment of the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.630
 disease that people have we try 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.730
 apply those investigations within 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.860
 our menu and vice versa we get it 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.780
 information from our patients about 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.700
 habits that they have choices that they 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.140
 to share it with the car in or 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.340
 they see if things can 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.010
 improve 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.630
 we hope there is with those investigations 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.870
 able to make protocols 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.450
 whereby we will advise certain 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.070
 diet or some more than 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.260
 average or let it stand 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.580
 because we might discover that 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.050
 certain foods for some diseases 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.050
 wanting is not wise at all 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.560
 we are often especially with the older people 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.140
 looking for products that someone the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.170
 already know but why the extra 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.170
 nutrients added are bread with 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.519
 extra protein or a soup or one 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.109
 fruit juice 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.689
 products that people already know 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.090
 that suit the people what someone 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.040
 anyway eat but where or in everyone 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.750
 they had that use again 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.519
 more nutrients more nutrients 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.049
 in it 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.879
 we try the from the hospital 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.040
 think about what patients eat 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.480
 must or can change 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.919
 it 's for the hospital or the 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.180
 outpatient clinic is actually a very short one 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.650
 moment because sometimes you look after the patient 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.400
 half an hour a week or maybe one 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.989
 half an hour a month 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.419
 Of course we know that nutrition in particular 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.699
 takes place at home and what we do now 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.229
 together with agreements we make with the 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.250
 and we have a doctor with you 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.930
 crates 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.539
 that we have around the doctor 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.849
 we give courses and courses 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.310
 increasingly 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.770
 the importance of good nutrition at home 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.330
 or emphasize at home 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.070
 so you percent like that is home but 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.720
 also for that in the hospital that 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.070
 He is also a good nutritional 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.720
 when it comes to operations but also 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.240
 for example after a recording or to 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.760
 someone who has had chemotherapy then 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.800
 You see very often that the nutrition 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.560
 a lady is still limited and then the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.330
 conduction sound through the home situation 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.060
 the doctor or the one it is is a whole 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.220
 very important so no it goes a lot 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.310
 beyond just what we are here in it 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.310
 Hospital
