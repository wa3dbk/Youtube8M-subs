00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.190 

so<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.880> did<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.240> front<00:02:18.480> end<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> same<00:02:18.930> way<00:02:18.959> so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
so I did the front end the same way so

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.290 
so I did the front end the same way so
hopefully<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.600> don't<00:02:21.600> feel<00:02:21.720> good<00:02:23.750> anyways<00:02:24.750> um

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
hopefully I don't feel good anyways um

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.080 
hopefully I don't feel good anyways um
get<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.569> on<00:02:27.720> these<00:02:27.840> panels<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.880> them

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
get going on these panels here get them

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.449 
get going on these panels here get them
ready<00:02:30.270> for<00:02:30.510> some<00:02:30.660> more<00:02:30.780> primer<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.440> then<00:02:31.500> when

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
ready for some more primer and then when

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.059 
ready for some more primer and then when
I'm<00:02:32.550> ready<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.270> will<00:02:33.890> prime<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
I'm ready for that I will prime the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.460 
I'm ready for that I will prime the
inside<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.030> hood<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.420> those<00:02:36.810> panels<00:02:37.170> at

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
inside of the hood and those panels at

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.840 
inside of the hood and those panels at
the<00:02:37.560> same<00:02:37.770> time

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
the same time

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.890 
the same time
so

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
so

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.300 
so
probably<00:02:41.200> move<00:02:41.319> these<00:02:41.439> fenders<00:02:41.799> back<00:02:42.010> over

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
probably move these fenders back over

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.550 
probably move these fenders back over
