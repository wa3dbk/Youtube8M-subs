00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
mother doesn't notice that the stroller

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.380 
mother doesn't notice that the stroller
is<00:00:33.200> basically<00:00:33.980> moving<00:00:34.370> away<00:00:34.670> from<00:00:35.000> her

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390

toward<00:00:35.929> the<00:00:36.170> train<00:00:36.410> tracks<00:00:36.649> but<00:00:37.579> then<00:00:37.789> it

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
toward the train tracks but then it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.810 
toward the train tracks but then it
moves<00:00:38.120> away<00:00:38.559> just<00:00:39.559> as<00:00:39.859> the<00:00:40.160> train<00:00:40.489> is<00:00:40.730> coming

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
moves away just as the train is coming

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.450 
moves away just as the train is coming
you're<00:00:41.300> like

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.250 

uh<00:00:48.790> it's<00:00:49.790> such<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:50.000> disaster<00:00:50.629> and<00:00:50.809> then<00:00:51.079> boom

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
uh it's such a disaster and then boom

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.080 
uh it's such a disaster and then boom
the<00:00:51.410> train<00:00:51.649> oh<00:00:51.860> come<00:00:52.280> on<00:00:52.399> he<00:00:52.550> can't<00:00:52.790> get<00:00:52.940> any

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
the train oh come on he can't get any

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.689 
the train oh come on he can't get any
worse<00:00:53.300> than<00:00:53.329> that<00:00:53.890> but<00:00:54.890> luckily<00:00:55.309> it's<00:00:55.610> a

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
worse than that but luckily it's a

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.030 
worse than that but luckily it's a
miracle<00:00:56.030> baby<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:57.079> arrived<00:00:57.410> now<00:00:57.980> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
miracle baby and it's arrived now the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.650 
miracle baby and it's arrived now the
reasons<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.670> survived<00:00:59.000> apparently<00:00:59.540> are

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
reasons it survived apparently are

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.450 
reasons it survived apparently are
because<00:01:00.019> this<00:01:00.140> train<00:01:00.649> was<00:01:00.860> of<00:01:00.980> course<00:01:01.160> coming

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
because this train was of course coming

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.280 
because this train was of course coming
to<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.610> stop<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:02.210> was<00:01:02.300> going<00:01:02.690> as<00:01:02.960> slow<00:01:03.170> as

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
to a stop so it was going as slow as

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.100 
to a stop so it was going as slow as
possible<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:04.309> was<00:01:04.550> strapped<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.720> that

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
possible to was strapped in and that

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.719 
possible to was strapped in and that
wound<00:01:06.530> up<00:01:06.740> apparently<00:01:07.130> saving<00:01:07.550> its<00:01:07.640> life

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
wound up apparently saving its life

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.850 
wound up apparently saving its life
because<00:01:08.600> they<00:01:08.690> never<00:01:08.899> fell<00:01:09.170> out<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:09.619> didn't

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
because they never fell out and didn't

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.100 
because they never fell out and didn't
get<00:01:10.009> crushed<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.909> stroller<00:01:11.210> got<00:01:11.479> crushed<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
get crushed the stroller got crushed and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.530 
get crushed the stroller got crushed and
what<00:01:12.680> if<00:01:12.770> they<00:01:12.979> have<00:01:13.250> an<00:01:13.399> adjust<00:01:13.700> like<00:01:13.880> minor

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
what if they have an adjust like minor

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.370 
what if they have an adjust like minor
