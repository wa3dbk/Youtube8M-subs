00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
number of inputting jars whatever you

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.089 
number of inputting jars whatever you
wanna<00:02:46.530> call<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.220> click<00:02:47.579> confirm<00:02:48.239> and

wanna call it and this click confirm and

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.080 
wanna call it and this click confirm and
now<00:02:50.099> I've<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> 27<00:02:51.629> inputting<00:02:52.049> jars<00:02:52.319> in<00:02:52.560> my

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
now I've got a 27 inputting jars in my

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.600 
now I've got a 27 inputting jars in my
inventory<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.599> I'm<00:02:54.690> quickly<00:02:55.290> gonna<00:02:55.829> finish

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
all this off and then I'm gonna resume

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.000 
all this off and then I'm gonna resume
and<00:02:59.930> sell<00:03:00.930> them<00:03:01.110> at<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.319> GE<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.829> this<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
and sell them at the GE and this is a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.289 
and sell them at the GE and this is a
lot<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.430> sampling<00:03:05.819> jar<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.840> took<00:03:07.140> about

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
lot of sampling jar and that took about

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.569 
lot of sampling jar and that took about
seven<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.870> eight<00:03:09.900> minutes<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.560> do<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:11.010> fairly

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
seven to eight minutes to do it's fairly

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.479 
seven to eight minutes to do it's fairly
quickly<00:03:12.000> i<00:03:12.209> think<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.739> 30<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:14.010> 45

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
quickly i think it's like 30 to 45

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.349 
quickly i think it's like 30 to 45
seconds<00:03:14.910> per<00:03:15.120> run<00:03:15.889> so<00:03:16.889> after<00:03:17.579> this<00:03:17.970> i'm<00:03:18.180> just

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
seconds per run so after this i'm just

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.839 
seconds per run so after this i'm just
gonna<00:03:18.450> sell<00:03:18.720> them<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.200> think<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.250> think<00:03:20.730> we

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
gonna sell them I think this I think we

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.539 
gonna sell them I think this I think we
made<00:03:21.030> an<00:03:21.150> insane<00:03:21.450> profit<00:03:22.019> at<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.069> beginning<00:03:23.459> I

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
made an insane profit at the beginning I

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.680 
made an insane profit at the beginning I
forgot<00:03:23.880> it's<00:03:24.120> actually<00:03:25.609> 11<00:03:26.609> impinger<00:03:27.239> makes

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
forgot it's actually 11 impinger makes

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.610 
forgot it's actually 11 impinger makes
three<00:03:27.989> empty<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.470> bling<00:03:28.680> jars<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:31.260> doesn't

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
three empty and bling jars so it doesn't

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.610 
three empty and bling jars so it doesn't
actually<00:03:31.739> have<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.130> be<00:03:32.220> under<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:33.620> inputting

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
actually have to be under the inputting

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.530 
actually have to be under the inputting
jar<00:03:34.799> price<00:03:35.069> at<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.310> GE<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:38.150> yeah<00:03:39.150> that's<00:03:39.299> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
jar price at the GE so yeah that's a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.530 
jar price at the GE so yeah that's a
mistake<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.500> made<00:03:40.680> at<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.889> beginning<00:03:41.419> now<00:03:42.419> this

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
mistake I made at the beginning now this

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.539 
mistake I made at the beginning now this
is<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.780> thing<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.109> hate<00:03:43.139> about<00:03:43.319> this<00:03:43.769> if<00:03:44.190> you're

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
is the thing I hate about this if you're

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.610 
is the thing I hate about this if you're
clicking<00:03:44.790> around<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.359> yet<00:03:45.480> get<00:03:45.989> exactly<00:03:46.470> in

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
clicking around it yet get exactly in

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.370 
clicking around it yet get exactly in
one<00:03:46.769> spot<00:03:47.130> in<00:03:47.370> order<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.700> leave<00:03:47.930> which<00:03:48.930> gets<00:03:49.139> so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
one spot in order to leave which gets so

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.729 
one spot in order to leave which gets so
annoying<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:52.220> then<00:03:53.720> Ferring<00:03:54.720> back<00:03:56.269> to

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
annoying and then Ferring back to

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:05.449 
annoying and then Ferring back to
edgeville<00:04:00.650> code<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:02.209> DKR<00:04:03.209> i<00:04:03.980> think<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.190> one<00:04:05.430> of

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
edgeville code is DKR i think in one of

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:31.230 
edgeville code is DKR i think in one of
my<00:04:05.579> videos<00:04:05.609> absently<00:04:06.480> set<00:04:06.720> dks<00:04:08.000> tkr

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.029 

okay<00:04:32.080> let's<00:04:32.410> see<00:04:32.949> how<00:04:33.130> much<00:04:33.310> they<00:04:33.490> sell<00:04:33.759> for

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
okay let's see how much they sell for

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:44.820 
okay let's see how much they sell for
and<00:04:36.039> it's<00:04:36.819> a<00:04:37.060> holy<00:04:40.319> ok<00:04:41.319> that's<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:43.830> 520,000

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
and it's a holy ok that's a 520,000

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.760 
and it's a holy ok that's a 520,000
profit<00:04:45.430> in<00:04:48.539> seven<00:04:49.539> minutes<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.169> I'm<00:04:50.650> gonna

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
profit in seven minutes so I'm gonna

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.390 
profit in seven minutes so I'm gonna
calculate<00:04:51.340> this<00:04:51.729> right<00:04:51.970> now<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.770> that's<00:04:53.979> about

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
calculate this right now so that's about

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.339 
calculate this right now so that's about
nine<00:04:55.270> rounds<00:04:55.599> per<00:04:56.080> minute<00:04:56.229> so<00:04:57.509> 520,000<00:04:58.509> this

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
nine rounds per minute so 520,000 this

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.640 
nine rounds per minute so 520,000 this
is<00:05:00.090> 4.5<00:05:01.090> mil<00:05:01.419> per<00:05:01.660> hour<00:05:01.780> holy

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
is 4.5 mil per hour holy

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.219 
is 4.5 mil per hour holy
okay<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:06.069> use<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:06.669> guide<00:05:06.940> when<00:05:07.180> you<00:05:07.300> can<00:05:07.539> well

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
okay so use this guide when you can well

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.600 
okay so use this guide when you can well
as<00:05:08.440> soon<00:05:08.620> as<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:08.860> learn<00:05:08.949> about<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.580> don't

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
as soon as you learn about it I don't

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.330 
as soon as you learn about it I don't
think<00:05:09.880> it's<00:05:10.120> going<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.270> crash<00:05:10.479> that<00:05:10.780> quickly

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
think it's going to crash that quickly

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.820 
think it's going to crash that quickly
because<00:05:12.340> I<00:05:13.000> just<00:05:13.449> saw<00:05:14.110> there's<00:05:14.409> actually<00:05:14.800> a
