00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.640
 a video of me I was very big at 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.049
 shopping if so much bought 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.120
 I thought I'll just show you again 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.800
 I have a small one today 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.940
 once new concealer used mine 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.650
 gone longer this is 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 manhattan makeup concealer little fire 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.279
 and there was one for me 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.359
 you this patrice lay with camouflage 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.240
 pleased principle a 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.400
 that is this liquid variant of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 camouflage cream the cafés are already listening 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.820
 and I really like that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.439
 and I will make you such a little one too 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.119
 compare a dazzle like that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.830
 my dark circles without concealer and with 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.630
 this concealer looks like this and me 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.930
 find him really really good of the super 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 cheap it costs 12 95 or so and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 does not cover super there either 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.790
 I bought another concealer I know 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.050
 a little stupid but i could 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.489
 somehow not decide and because of that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.140
 I have a private one so cheap 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 namely the other with and indeed 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 is the perfect one from adecco 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.920
 concealer and the offer of goods we 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.219
 I think nine euro 33 or so because the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.600
 had such a 30 actions and that 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.670
 actually a good concealer 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.430
 I have the color five because in viva 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 513 Whatever and this one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.689
 endes other applicator I think that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 also great for the eyebrows so for example 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.510
 rand and a bit 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.820
 to highlight and also as a concealer 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 super easy online comparison show 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.110
 from her and the patrice concealer 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.150
 characterized by also more adecco as a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.259
 Stock taken and if you like me 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.869
 you know a little longer you know 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.189
 Educating alone is not my thing 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.380
 This now also a very precise 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.990
 Eyeliner and he also a value world 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.150
 top and I have to tell you myself 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.950
 I made it with it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.810
 to draw uniform and one can one 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.880
 was really good as you can that completely 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.439
 very, very thin layers of all you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 you can barely see it, too 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.820
 pull just as good thick layer of ice 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.619
 and it 's really really good I'm just one 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.119
 I doubt if that too 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.750
 dry out easily because he is one too 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.370
 has vicious tip and that 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.410
 happened more often with such donations 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.820
 but i will expand that eye 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.290
 I can only say so far 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.310
 that I really like him 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.900
 I have a new lipliner 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.479
 bought and I have just now 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.100
 extremely hard for you and made 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.930
 that is so little on the lips wear 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.670
 he is one of them 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.229
 new long annoying planners this 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.720
 somehow only at müller I believe 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.120
 and that's the color 08 girl next door 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.740
 that it is a really nice nude and the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.150
 I also wanted to have a bit 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.470
 similar to my lips driver 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.360
 just emphasize that one 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.100
 Nice and I just wanted 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.630
 I have them just as a color 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.160
 found and I am satisfied with that 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.930
 he also had over once before 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.640
 contain it and have to say that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.709
 Shelf life is really really good there 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.140
 not taken with two products by 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.090
 garnier fructis and they were both on 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.250
 one euro reduced than this this 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.480
 Lush mane spray and that was for it 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.739
 Just think a little bit more 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.209
 volume to go a little bit more 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.950
 I'm glad that I have it now 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.390
 tested and I have to say that I have too 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.650
 Not so different from shopping 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.150
 But I will definitely eat 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.950
 Continue testing before I enter 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.510
 decent conclusion to submit 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.250
 then I have this fit 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.709
 Career break this handy length 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.959
 taken with serum and that's what you do 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.430
 midrand cloth dry hair 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.019
 that happened just so in the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.060
 length 1 so not to the approach but 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.620
 the points and lengths and that should 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.090
 simply always many are so enter 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.860
 a bit more grip in the hair 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.570
 and I have not now 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.700
 Do not use that much yet 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.170
 therefore another highlight of eating 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.120
 taken along and actually complete 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.739
 Buy because eight euro real times so expensive 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.510
 for a nail polish and I'm always like that 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.070
 stingy but I still have a job 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.630
 somehow I did not look for a good one 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.220
 found net everything I have 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.739
 I just took it with me 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.750
 take on me it is the color watermelon 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.100
 and she is just super nice me 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.829
 she was drinking too 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.510
 it's so red, but it's so instinctive 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.549
 then eagle rattle 52 of these 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.860
 First, from this go out of line 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.670
 one of which is the color one 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.680
 change 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.810
 that's a really nice red thing 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.579
 a stitch has really strong 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.140
 rise in contrast to it, the 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.800
 Nail polishes now also quite that 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.350
 staff 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.630
 So pink is pink and stingy 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.610
 this nail polish from essence just like that 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.220
 orange is active and by the way I like 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.750
 this essential Polish quite like 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.250
 I really think that's really real 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.840
 Well, they are really great for that 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.950
 so cheap are we catching completely 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.350
 Classical for me 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.730
 Cleaning towels I bought your stock 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.170
 somehow I was almost the same 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.390
 Always use and always when I'm on 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.850
 my team is with me and not this time 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.140
 added for normal simply because I 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.940
 The company does not really matter 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.290
 contemplative , both are well under the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.820
 last two products are which of 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.720
 reads learns and maybe if you 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.760
 my videos are a bit longer 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.070
 do you know from riesa hama of 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.299
 steffi bey used us super great 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.950
 Well, and I found myself now 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.840
 bought and that is probably you do 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.580
 you should strengthen the hair at the beginning and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.650
 to quasi convey simply faster 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.280
 and to grow better too healthier too 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.020
 to grow 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.000
 and then got used to that 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.870
 I realized that I have much less hair 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.340
 have failed 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.630
 i have pretty long and i have 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.910
 have often so I have my 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.410
 Just go out here is me then 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.090
 happened friendly today and then as 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.100
 I have used these masks in the 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.050
 time that is essential 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.460
 gotten better so I have to say real 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.169
 apparently that really really 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.610
 helped and I convinced them so much 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.980
 that was the right one for me 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.660
 shampoo taken this time again and 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.220
 later he himself will effect this 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.690
 already the shampoo to give me just 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.250
 like to go upstairs when i watch the video 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.800
 I liked it and you can find it 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.540
 social media sites like internet chat 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.950
 about my last video i wish you 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.850
