00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you just go from a relaxed position so

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730 
you just go from a relaxed position so
you<00:01:23.520> always<00:01:24.090> take<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.539> drill<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.289> start<00:01:25.680> off

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you always take a drill you start off

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.830 
you always take a drill you start off
with<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.920> most<00:01:26.190> simple<00:01:26.610> elements<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.420> then

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
with the most simple elements and then

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.389 
with the most simple elements and then
you<00:01:27.930> work<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.560> make<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> more

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
you work it and make it more and more

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.969 
you work it and make it more and more
exciting<00:01:30.179> and<00:01:30.330> complicated<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.410> first<00:01:31.710> is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
exciting and complicated so the first is

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.550 
exciting and complicated so the first is
I'm<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.240> her<00:01:33.360> neck<00:01:33.660> and<00:01:33.899> she's<00:01:34.289> going

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
I'm going for her neck and she's going

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:45.700 
I'm going for her neck and she's going

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.859 

now<00:01:46.700> she's<00:01:46.970> got<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.360> trust<00:01:49.000> her<00:01:50.000> own<00:01:50.180> instincts

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
now she's got to trust her own instincts

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.280 
now she's got to trust her own instincts
you<00:01:51.229> see<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:52.420> see<00:01:53.420> if<00:01:53.479> she's<00:01:53.630> going<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:54.080> could

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
you see that see if she's going I could

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.080 
you see that see if she's going I could
actually<00:01:54.500> she's<00:01:55.010> going<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.340> even<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.850> little

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
actually she's going to even a little

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.070 
actually she's going to even a little
early<00:01:56.690> because<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:58.040> see<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:59.420> see<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.630> see<00:02:00.050> I

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
early because you see you see I see I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.840 
early because you see you see I see I
see<00:02:00.409> how<00:02:00.680> she<00:02:00.770> starts<00:02:01.159> with<00:02:01.369> it's<00:02:01.549> just

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
see how she starts with it's just

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.090 
see how she starts with it's just
natural<00:02:02.119> that's<00:02:03.080> why<00:02:03.290> martial<00:02:03.740> arts<00:02:03.890> training

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
natural that's why martial arts training

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.190 
natural that's why martial arts training
is<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:04.610> important<00:02:05.149> because<00:02:05.600> you've<00:02:05.930> got<00:02:06.050> to

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
is so important because you've got to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.889 
is so important because you've got to
take<00:02:06.470> what's<00:02:06.770> natural<00:02:07.310> work<00:02:07.970> with<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.479> and

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
take what's natural work with it and and

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.220 
take what's natural work with it and and
overcome<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.910> because<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.360> know<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.690> as<00:02:12.050> she

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
overcome it because you know so as she

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.030 
overcome it because you know so as she
comes<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.650> see<00:02:13.100> at<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.489> point<00:02:13.819> I'm<00:02:14.660> out<00:02:14.900> ok<00:02:15.620> so

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
comes in see at that point I'm out ok so

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.970 
comes in see at that point I'm out ok so
now<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:17.600> second<00:02:18.019> element<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.500> this<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.800> how

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
now the second element of this is how

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.330 
now the second element of this is how
she<00:02:19.100> goes<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:19.610> my<00:02:19.730> neck<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.040> we'll<00:02:22.160> do

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
she goes for my neck so so so we'll do

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.750 
she goes for my neck so so so we'll do
it<00:02:22.459> slow<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.180> first<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.690> go<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:25.610> she

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
it slow so first I go here and then she

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.660 
it slow so first I go here and then she
just<00:02:25.790> comes<00:02:26.360> through<00:02:26.860> ok<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.430> drill

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
just comes through ok so the drill

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:44.030 
just comes through ok so the drill
becomes<00:02:29.440> becomes<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:31.700> two<00:02:32.510> three

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.040 

or<00:02:45.040> we<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.340> do<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:46.150> can<00:02:46.300> do<00:02:46.390> one<00:02:46.600> piece<00:02:46.870> of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
or we can just do we can do one piece of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.990 
or we can just do we can do one piece of
it<00:02:47.170> from<00:02:47.440> from<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.430> standing<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.970> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
it from from just you standing to the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.740 
it from from just you standing to the
side<00:02:49.180> ways<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:50.380> just<00:02:50.800> up<00:02:51.400> right<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.570> so

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
side ways and it's just up right and so

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:14.460 
side ways and it's just up right and so
she<00:02:52.780> goes<00:02:53.080> up<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.410> I<00:03:12.600> ok<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.930> next<00:03:14.230> piece<00:03:14.410> is

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
she goes up and I ok the next piece is

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.000

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
to develop the same abilities with their

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.670 
to develop the same abilities with their
other<00:04:06.250> hand<00:04:06.610> which<00:04:07.360> is<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.570> lot<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:07.870> fun<00:04:08.050> in

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
other hand which is a lot of fun in

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.140 
other hand which is a lot of fun in
particularly<00:04:09.280> because<00:04:09.460> I'm<00:04:09.940> very

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
particularly because I'm very

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.210 
particularly because I'm very
right-handed<00:04:10.930> why<00:04:11.320> do<00:04:11.380> things<00:04:11.710> with<00:04:11.800> my<00:04:11.950> left

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
right-handed why do things with my left

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.670 
right-handed why do things with my left
they<00:04:12.340> always<00:04:12.550> feel<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.510> weird<00:04:13.840> but<00:04:14.470> it's

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
they always feel so so weird but it's

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.660 
they always feel so so weird but it's
good<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:14.980> practice<00:04:15.310> this<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:15.880> then<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.420> say<00:04:17.670> the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
good to practice this and then I say the

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.300 
good to practice this and then I say the
drill<00:04:18.940> is<00:04:20.160> would<00:04:21.160> be<00:04:22.530> just<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.620> simple<00:04:23.980> like

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
drill is would be just a simple like

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.490 
drill is would be just a simple like
you're<00:04:24.490> going<00:04:24.730> from<00:04:25.000> from<00:04:25.270> here<00:04:25.570> going<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.380> my

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
you're going from from here going to my

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:35.349 
you're going from from here going to my
neck<00:04:26.740> right<00:04:27.040> so

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:35.359 

00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:37.909 

yeah<00:04:36.359> I<00:04:36.389> like<00:04:36.539> this<00:04:36.569> I<00:04:36.809> just<00:04:36.869> I<00:04:37.199> just<00:04:37.349> basically

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
yeah I like this I just I just basically

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.679 
yeah I like this I just I just basically
stand<00:04:38.339> around<00:04:38.609> and<00:04:38.879> she<00:04:39.359> does<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:39.949> everything

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.169

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:48.179 
so with drills you want to start start

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:49.729

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:49.739 
off kind of rhythmically and then you

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:51.499 
off kind of rhythmically and then you
build<00:04:50.009> and<00:04:50.339> change<00:04:50.609> your<00:04:50.699> rhythms<00:04:51.179> and<00:04:51.329> don't
