based<00:00:11.730> boss<00:00:12.090> fight<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:13.230> basically<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:14.730> very

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
based boss fight so basically it's very

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.269 
based boss fight so basically it's very
very<00:00:15.509> very<00:00:15.750> similar<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> halloween<00:00:16.859> boss

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
very very similar to the halloween boss

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.750 
very very similar to the halloween boss
fight<00:00:17.580> which<00:00:18.050> you<00:00:19.050> summon<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.680> boss<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
have to fight through waves of enemies

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.820 
have to fight through waves of enemies
to<00:00:23.310> tonight<00:00:23.550> each<00:00:23.760> way<00:00:24.000> they<00:00:24.180> get<00:00:24.420> harder<00:00:24.830> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to tonight each way they get harder and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.540 
to tonight each way they get harder and
this<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.970> fight<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.420> 20<00:00:27.689> waves

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
this in this fight there are 20 waves

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.939 
this in this fight there are 20 waves
and<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.880> said<00:00:29.939> earlier<00:00:30.150> each<00:00:30.570> is

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
and like I said earlier each is

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.549 
and like I said earlier each is
increasing<00:00:31.949> difficulty<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> basically<00:00:34.530> my

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
increasing difficulty so basically my

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
increasing difficulty so basically my
setup<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.940> campfires<00:00:38.940> so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
setup for this is I have campfires so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.729 
setup for this is I have campfires so
basically<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> first<00:00:40.140> thing<00:00:40.320> i<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.559> i

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
basically the first thing i do is i

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.229 
basically the first thing i do is i
flatten<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.250> ground<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.790> it's<00:00:41.910> easy<00:00:42.120> for

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
flatten out the ground so it's easy for

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.020 
flatten out the ground so it's easy for
me<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.540> move<00:00:42.809> back<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.200> forth<00:00:43.730> then<00:00:44.730> i<00:00:44.760> have

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
me to move back and forth then i have

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.490 
me to move back and forth then i have
campfire<00:00:45.690> set<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.200> I'm<00:00:46.320> constantly

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
campfire set up so I'm constantly

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.310 
campfire set up so I'm constantly
constantly<00:00:47.570> slowly<00:00:48.570> regenerating<00:00:49.289> health

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
constantly slowly regenerating health

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.880 
constantly slowly regenerating health
which<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.480> very<00:00:51.480> important<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.199> most<00:00:52.649> boss

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
which is a very important in most boss

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.340 
which is a very important in most boss
fights<00:00:53.219> i<00:00:53.489> recommend<00:00:54.329> campfires<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.170> pretty

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
fights i recommend campfires with pretty

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
fights i recommend campfires with pretty
much<00:00:55.440> every<00:00:55.710> boss<00:00:55.890> by<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> game<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.640> be

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
much every boss by the game actually be

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.640 
much every boss by the game actually be
honest

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
honest

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.760 
honest
and<00:00:58.340> then<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:58.580> have<00:00:59.060> water<00:00:59.990> candles<00:01:00.470> set<00:01:00.680> up

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
and then I have water candles set up

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.710 
and then I have water candles set up
actually<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.490> water<00:01:01.880> candles<00:01:02.330> do<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.570> they

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
actually and water candles do is they

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.400 
actually and water candles do is they
attract<00:01:03.370> enemies<00:01:04.370> and<00:01:04.610> basically<00:01:05.260> that<00:01:06.260> will

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
attract enemies and basically that will

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.020 
attract enemies and basically that will
spawn<00:01:06.680> more<00:01:06.890> enemies<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:07.550> I<00:01:07.640> get<00:01:07.700> more

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
spawn more enemies so that I get more

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.800 
spawn more enemies so that I get more
kills<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.290> waves<00:01:09.560> are<00:01:09.950> based<00:01:10.190> on<00:01:10.810> how

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
kills and the waves are based on how

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.170 
kills and the waves are based on how
many<00:01:11.870> enemies<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.740> kill<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:13.340> basically<00:01:13.880> for

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
many enemies you kill so basically for

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.630 
many enemies you kill so basically for
like<00:01:14.540> wave<00:01:14.720> 14<00:01:15.320> for<00:01:15.890> example<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.310> might<00:01:16.520> have

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
like wave 14 for example you might have

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.480 
like wave 14 for example you might have
to<00:01:16.730> kill<00:01:16.910> like<00:01:17.060> 20<00:01:17.390> enemies<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.020> if<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.130> water

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
to kill like 20 enemies and if the water

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.340 
to kill like 20 enemies and if the water
candles<00:01:19.940> are<00:01:20.090> spawning<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.600> onions<00:01:20.930> faster<00:01:21.320> I

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
candles are spawning the onions faster I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.020 
candles are spawning the onions faster I
can<00:01:21.530> kill<00:01:21.830> them<00:01:21.980> faster<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.670> be<00:01:22.820> more

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
can kill them faster and be more

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.700 
can kill them faster and be more
efficient<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.540> way<00:01:25.390> basically<00:01:26.390> my<00:01:27.170> problem

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
efficient that way basically my problem

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.490 
efficient that way basically my problem
with<00:01:28.520> this<00:01:28.730> is<00:01:28.970> that<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.600> don't<00:01:29.690> kill<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
with this is that I don't kill the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.340 
with this is that I don't kill the
enemies<00:01:30.830> fast<00:01:31.220> enough<00:01:31.720> not<00:01:32.720> necessarily<00:01:33.140> that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
enemies fast enough not necessarily that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.250 
enemies fast enough not necessarily that
I<00:01:33.410> die<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.740> do<00:01:34.010> die<00:01:34.369> but<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:34.940> have<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.240> spawn<00:01:35.810> set<00:01:36.140> up

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
I die I do die but I have a spawn set up

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.730 
I die I do die but I have a spawn set up
right<00:01:36.530> next<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.979> my<00:01:37.360> little<00:01:38.360> my<00:01:38.780> little<00:01:38.810> battle

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
right next to my little my little battle

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.190 
right next to my little my little battle
ground<00:01:39.979> here<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:41.150> right<00:01:41.540> when<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.750> die<00:01:41.810> can

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
ground here so that right when I die can

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.900 
ground here so that right when I die can
heal<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.560> get<00:01:42.650> back<00:01:42.860> into<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.190> fight<00:01:43.250> and

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
heal and get back into the fight and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.670 
heal and get back into the fight and
keep<00:01:44.119> working<00:01:44.300> on<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.600> now<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.020> problem<00:01:45.350> is

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
keep working on that now the problem is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.609 
keep working on that now the problem is
that<00:01:45.740> if<00:01:46.900> nighttime<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:48.050> over<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.410> goes

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
that if nighttime is over and goes

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.490 
that if nighttime is over and goes
daytime<00:01:49.130> then<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:50.060> boss<00:01:50.240> fight<00:01:50.479> ends<00:01:50.900> in<00:01:51.080> the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
daytime then the boss fight ends in the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.280 
daytime then the boss fight ends in the
waves<00:01:51.770> calm<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:53.540> that's<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.869> major<00:01:54.020> problem

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
waves calm and that's a major problem

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.260 
waves calm and that's a major problem
because<00:01:54.770> if<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.280> if<00:01:55.580> there<00:01:55.850> wasn't<00:01:56.210> a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
because if that if there wasn't a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.260 
because if that if there wasn't a
limitation<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.229> time<00:01:57.590> then<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.850> could<00:01:59.000> in

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
limitation on time then you could in

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.240 
limitation on time then you could in
theory<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.869> could<00:02:00.170> basically<00:02:00.320> keep<00:02:00.740> continue

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
theory I could basically keep continue

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.820 
theory I could basically keep continue
to<00:02:01.369> dies<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.540> wouldn't<00:02:03.230> have<00:02:03.320> any<00:02:03.470> problems

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
to dies and I wouldn't have any problems

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.120 
to dies and I wouldn't have any problems
until<00:02:03.980> I<00:02:04.190> of<00:02:04.460> course<00:02:04.670> until<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.120> run<00:02:05.330> out<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:06.130> run

christmas tree sword so basically my

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.620 
christmas tree sword so basically my

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
strategy is the first couple of rounds

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.540 
strategy is the first couple of rounds
especially<00:03:32.260> I'm<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.980> be<00:03:33.069> using<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550

rainbow<00:03:33.940> gun<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> lot<00:03:34.480> because<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.440> doesn't<00:03:36.010> use

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
rainbow gun a lot because it doesn't use

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.949 
rainbow gun a lot because it doesn't use
that<00:03:36.340> much<00:03:36.519> mana<00:03:36.819> especially<00:03:37.540> compared<00:03:37.870> to

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
that much mana especially compared to
