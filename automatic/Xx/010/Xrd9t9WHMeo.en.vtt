00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.330
 as a result 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.330
 Today I want to show you how we do 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.440
 We win our red wine win 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:51.290
 already red wall since 1953 and always 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.590
 the same way you are here 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.370
 in meran see is a real michael 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.570
 masher 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.840
 this trunk is provided with wood rammer 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.660
 with holes in the middle which causes when 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.210
 we stomp the mesh that the juice 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.250
 passes through the holes and the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.920
 gray sleeves go down 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.250
 why is this done in front of me? 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.970
 stands are late burgundy grapes and 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.860
 these late burgundy grapes had 2012 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.830
 95 degrees oechsle 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.060
 that's the most weight and what to do 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.600
 we with this rammer the gray sleeve 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.210
 has the dyes in it and that 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.399
 maybe it would be green and the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.100
 Cores settled on the ground 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.490
 but the bears are lighter today 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.370
 and the grapes must rise to the top 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.470
 sleeves every three to four hours after 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.799
 the classic metier procedure 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.540
 be tamped around the color from the 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.729
 berries hülsten to solve 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.729
 I will make them even before 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.590
 Here you can see clearly here 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.530
 the dress the hat will be now 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.110
 pounded down and you look beautiful 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.340
 like the liquids a bright red 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.340
 Color one would say that's it 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.130
 drive again and that has something else 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.310
 become deeply dark 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.580
 most of us stay around ten 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.450
 to be under the charge of the late Baroque and become 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.570
 then originated every three to four hours 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.930
 so that they would be optimal today 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:41.230
 be leached and the color in the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.959
 Wine later comes to light here 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.630
 we see two glasses of red wine to 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:51.370
 different stages in my 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.459
 Right Glass is a party already 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.390
 changed the way I showed it before 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.550
 had that the late burgundy is beautiful 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.380
 to have this mission mashed 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.660
 We did that with the Portuguese too 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.720
 and this portuguese is now 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.420
 already pressed and in my left 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.090
 glass one sees here with the right glass 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.430
 quite clearly the tube substances still 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.950
 there is something floating in the air 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.370
 Of course it is very clear for a young one 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.739
 man that has fragrances and he will 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.959
 now stored in wooden barrels like us 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.660
 to see that behind us and this 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.170
 wooden houses lay he will at least 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.980
 see half a year in my left hand 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.190
 they glass equipped with a spätburgunder the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.380
 is already worth the unfair and the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.480
 They already cry in ours 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.070
 can get salesroom 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.630
 in common have stored in a wooden barrel 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.550
 or the young was camped 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.180
 wooden barrel and in the nearly 100 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.690
 then comes the late burgundy purely the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.600
 zidan at next summer or autumn 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.220
 can try us and be them 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.190
 just curious what from the 2012 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.330
 it will cry like that already 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.780
 Excellent as its mostgewicht 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.180
 and mild acid 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.180
 we are all very excited 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.020
 the size is optimal one smells completely 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.510
 clearly in this delicious 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.290
 late burgundy the raspberries east and 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.800
 With this lighter Portuguese one has 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.710
 beautiful red fruit bears in the nose and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.050
 I am already looking forward to it when we have this 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.950
 was the first time separate from the yeast 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.950
 for the benefit 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.669
 here again the demonstration the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:08.620
 bears skin deep dark violet colors 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.510
 The flesh is yellowish green and 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.990
 in the middle are the two 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.919
 We like this color naturally 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.710
 solve it now and that's why we give it 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.530
 on some so that the marge fermentation 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.560
 You can go if you have one 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.650
 would like to win rossi elections then does 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.160
 you directly cellar and thus you have the 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.120
 dyes are not dissolved from the sleeves 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.669
 and you have a rosé-colored wine 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.210
 Chilled drunk red wine in 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.210
 room temperature
