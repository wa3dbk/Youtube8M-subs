00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.920
 and so is my beloved polyculture in hamburg in a local with another video that 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.030
 in this case is one lived 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.939
 from an application 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.039
 bm 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.759
 I saw how daily application 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.009
 but before that 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.609
 I want to tell you a thing or two 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.289
 the first one is out there someone asked me how what buttons the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.320
 boticas 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.320
 or the only ones they have are this 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.099
 in which they vote will explain the series that the project 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.510
 because they did not know who reluctant until available can see it here 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.530
 she likes me 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.060
 the vowels that you have to click on will decrease the screen of the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.750
 computer in the efe box that we downloaded 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.910
 kris m 50 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.430
 it tells you you're going 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 ps I think the first this year 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.860
 that explains it for a while 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.020
 and then that piqué are 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.360
 this one above 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.380
 then without letting go of the one above 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.290
 what luck sixth 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.520
 according to me 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.300
 so it is put in f1 mode what it is that the computer asks you for 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.310
 olympics and the pessimism to do it 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 another very important clarification 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.180
 It's very important 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 it's going to turn red 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.190
 the clarification is 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.160
 the week kiel that is right now 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.320
 it's only for 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.140
 to the well 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.470
 mod there week makeup 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.610
 to the properties says version 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.600
 so we go straight 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 four point version 1 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.850
 8 b 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 eleven 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.939
 is not for models in that poque to which I am telling you is that an error 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.190
 of 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.070
 in the orb code neglect or something like that 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.030
 that's why 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.720
 it is not possible that already implies does not apply to mc models 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.869
 bahamas aranda is taking ice weeks 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.869
 other companions and comfortable ex boyfriends the sides 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
 illegal nilda and leads to be possible with him 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.060
 on this disk for models or months 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.949
 until now 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.549
 those who have it rolled past with their bow but 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.249
 do not do it they're going to waste time 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.699
 first review and enough settings 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.189
 or near him 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.779
 and they go to the version there tells them if it's a model in bs 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.209
 says I think before the 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.140
 before the draw four points deaths 1 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.699
 and not the beating 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.699
 nor his bow 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.289
 a challenge is also reached there may be problems 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.289
 then the application cobos has reviewed today is practically 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.079
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.009
 they have left everything 2 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.989
 for the bow because there is an oxymoron basket 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.409
 but he is a native 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.549

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.259
 very similar 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.899
