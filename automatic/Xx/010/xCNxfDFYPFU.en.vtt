this<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.699> how<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.840> used<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this is how it is going to be used this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.349 
this is how it is going to be used this
is<00:00:58.859> how<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.460> assemble<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
is how you can actually assemble it and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.240 
is how you can actually assemble it and
we<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.289> come<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:01.980> steps

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
we will just come on to these steps

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.389 
we will just come on to these steps
later<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.649> we<00:01:04.800> are<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.190> to

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
later on so first of all we are going to

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.160 
later on so first of all we are going to
unbox<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:06.000> package<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> package

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
unbox this package and this package

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770 
unbox this package and this package
looks<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.340> good<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.910> the<00:01:09.030> logo<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> group

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
looks pretty good with the logo of group

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.999 
looks pretty good with the logo of group
over<00:01:10.050> here<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.820> side<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.300> nothing

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
over here and this side we have nothing

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.900 
over here and this side we have nothing
it<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.160> very<00:01:14.429> nicely<00:01:14.759> packed<00:01:15.240> under<00:01:15.990> these

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
it is very nicely packed under these

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.949 
it is very nicely packed under these
paper<00:01:17.910> pads<00:01:18.740> let<00:01:19.740> me<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.250> open<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.479> package

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:21.959 
paper pads let me just open this package

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.350 
paper pads let me just open this package
and<00:01:22.080> again<00:01:22.349> it<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.649> quite<00:01:23.039> heavy<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:24.209> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and again it is quite heavy that is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
and again it is quite heavy that is
something<00:01:24.660> I<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:24.869> say<00:01:25.429> because<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.759> dock

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
something I would say because the dock

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.480 
something I would say because the dock
is<00:01:27.300> actually<00:01:27.750> very<00:01:28.050> good<00:01:28.470> income<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.429> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
is actually very good income for the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.529 
is actually very good income for the
overall<00:01:29.819> build<00:01:30.060> quality<00:01:31.099> okay<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:33.330> here<00:01:33.509> we

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
overall build quality okay so here we

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.880 
overall build quality okay so here we
have<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.979> connectors<00:01:35.459> protectors<00:01:36.209> and<00:01:36.890> here

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
have the connectors protectors and here

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.150 
have the connectors protectors and here
we<00:01:38.069> have<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> dots<00:01:39.270> again<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.649> part<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.099> the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
we have the dots again this part of the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.570 
we have the dots again this part of the
dock<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.910> be<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:43.080> stable<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.770> hold<00:01:44.429> your

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
dock will be very stable to hold your

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.930 
dock will be very stable to hold your
iPhone<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.239> it<00:01:45.660> is<00:01:45.780> quite<00:01:46.440> solid<00:01:46.800> but<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.819> is

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
iPhone and it is quite solid but it is

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.180 
iPhone and it is quite solid but it is
actually<00:01:48.270> made<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.599> of<00:01:48.720> metal<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.440> think<00:01:49.800> it

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
actually made up of metal or I think it

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.029 
actually made up of metal or I think it
could<00:01:50.459> be<00:01:50.610> metal<00:01:51.300> alloy<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.929> well<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
could be metal alloy as well and you

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.669 
could be metal alloy as well and you
have<00:01:53.250> these<00:01:53.429> registers<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:55.050> will<00:01:55.410> go

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
have these registers which will go

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.190 
have these registers which will go
inside<00:01:56.099> this<00:01:56.369> particular<00:01:56.700> dock<00:01:57.179> so<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
inside this particular dock so that you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.760 
inside this particular dock so that you
can<00:01:58.349> actually<00:01:58.500> either<00:01:59.009> use<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.770> 30-pin

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
can actually either use the 30-pin

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.669 
can actually either use the 30-pin
connector<00:02:01.830> cable<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.989> also<00:02:04.140> use<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
connector cable so you can also use the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.910 
connector cable so you can also use the
8<00:02:04.860> pin<00:02:05.099> connector<00:02:05.489> cable<00:02:05.819> itself<00:02:06.560> as<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.739> can

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
8 pin connector cable itself as you can

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.469 
8 pin connector cable itself as you can
see<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.520> these<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> two<00:02:09.090> connectors

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
see so these are the two connectors

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.960 
see so these are the two connectors
which<00:02:09.840> come<00:02:10.619> within<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> package<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:11.760> will

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
which come within the package they will

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.540 
which come within the package they will
go<00:02:12.180> inside<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.599> dock<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.349> will<00:02:13.709> explain

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
go inside the dock and I will explain

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.720 
go inside the dock and I will explain
the<00:02:14.940> functionality<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.599> these<00:02:15.959> later<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.730> here

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
the functionality of these later on here

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.510 
the functionality of these later on here
we<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.390> wooden<00:02:18.599> part<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.980> wooden<00:02:20.310> part

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
we have the wooden part the wooden part

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.670 
we have the wooden part the wooden part
which<00:02:20.700> actually<00:02:21.150> covers<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.140> top<00:02:22.319> from<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
which actually covers the top from the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.000 
which actually covers the top from the
top

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
top

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.530 
top
like<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:25.450> actually<00:02:25.599> like<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.540> then

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
like this is actually like this and then

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.559 
like this is actually like this and then
it<00:02:28.810> will<00:02:29.049> make<00:02:29.230> sure<00:02:29.409> that<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:29.769> can<00:02:29.920> actually

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
insert the iPhone into the dock even

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.869 
insert the iPhone into the dock even
when<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.110> having<00:02:35.409> a<00:02:35.620> case<00:02:35.799> on<00:02:36.129> so<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.670> can

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
when it is having a case on so you can

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
branding over here which looks pretty

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.130 
branding over here which looks pretty
good<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.700> bottom<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:49.209> see<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.810> section

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
good at the bottom we see the section

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.710 
good at the bottom we see the section
for<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.379> cable<00:02:50.769> so<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.670> data<00:02:51.849> cable<00:02:52.329> for

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
for the cable so that the data cable for

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.530 
for the cable so that the data cable for
your<00:02:52.870> iPhone<00:02:53.230> will<00:02:53.409> go<00:02:53.590> through<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.790> it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
your iPhone will go through this and it

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.300 
your iPhone will go through this and it
will<00:02:55.690> hold<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.230> data<00:02:56.470> cable<00:02:56.709> quite<00:02:57.010> tightly

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
will hold the data cable quite tightly

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.850 
will hold the data cable quite tightly
and<00:02:58.000> here<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.569> actually<00:02:58.750> see<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.440> you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
and here you can actually see that you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.740 
and here you can actually see that you
can<00:03:00.040> actually<00:03:00.190> use<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.030> 30-pin<00:03:01.690> connector

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
can actually use the 30-pin connector

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.110 
can actually use the 30-pin connector
cable<00:03:02.440> because<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.890> cut<00:03:03.040> out<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.430> quite<00:03:03.700> big

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
cable because the cut out is quite big

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.420 
cable because the cut out is quite big
and<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.019> also<00:03:05.170> use<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.650> 8<00:03:05.799> pin<00:03:06.040> connector

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
and you can also use the 8 pin connector

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.270 
and you can also use the 8 pin connector
cable<00:03:06.760> quite<00:03:07.540> easily

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
cable quite easily

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.490 
cable quite easily
we<00:03:09.280> do<00:03:09.459> have<00:03:09.609> rubber<00:03:09.940> padding<00:03:10.359> at<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.140> bottom

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
we do have rubber padding at the bottom

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.119 
we do have rubber padding at the bottom
of<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:12.549> stand<00:03:13.379> which<00:03:14.379> will<00:03:14.620> make<00:03:14.799> sure<00:03:14.950> that

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
of this stand which will make sure that

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.849 
of this stand which will make sure that
whenever<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.790> place<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.269> dock<00:03:17.200> on<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> table

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
whenever you place this dock on a table

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.250 
whenever you place this dock on a table
like<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.549> won't<00:03:18.819> slip<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.989> won't

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
like this it won't slip and it won't

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.770 
like this it won't slip and it won't
move<00:03:20.590> as<00:03:20.890> well<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.640> easily<00:03:21.970> because<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.690> is

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
move as well very easily because it is

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.300 
move as well very easily because it is
quite<00:03:23.049> heavy<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.500> terms<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.920> weight<00:03:24.069> and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
quite heavy in terms of the weight and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.509 
quite heavy in terms of the weight and
one<00:03:25.000> thing<00:03:25.150> which<00:03:25.329> guru<00:03:26.049> has<00:03:26.290> actually<00:03:26.739> done

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
one thing which guru has actually done

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.670 
one thing which guru has actually done
good<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.450> they<00:03:28.599> have<00:03:28.810> added<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.500> little

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
good is that they have added a little

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.000 
good is that they have added a little
magnet<00:03:30.250> over<00:03:30.549> here<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.389> once<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:31.930> guys<00:03:32.829> this

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
magnet over here so once you guys this

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.180 
magnet over here so once you guys this
thing<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.549> will<00:03:33.849> automatically<00:03:34.480> get<00:03:34.720> flip

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
thing it will automatically get flip

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.009 
thing it will automatically get flip
attached<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:37.000> should<00:03:37.180> not<00:03:37.299> come<00:03:37.510> out<00:03:37.660> easy

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
attached and it should not come out easy

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.099 
attached and it should not come out easy
so<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.709> not<00:03:38.980> loose<00:03:39.310> actually<00:03:39.810> although<00:03:40.810> it

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
so it is not loose actually although it

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.020 
so it is not loose actually although it
is<00:03:41.260> pretty<00:03:41.590> ok<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.040> terms<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.459> overall<00:03:42.549> fit

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
is pretty ok in terms of the overall fit

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.199 
is pretty ok in terms of the overall fit
and<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.840> have<00:03:44.079> nice<00:03:44.410> finishing<00:03:45.340> because<00:03:46.030> this

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
and you have nice finishing because this

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.330 
and you have nice finishing because this
part<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.599> actually<00:03:46.690> made<00:03:47.109> up<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.319> work<00:03:47.590> whereas

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
part is actually made up of work whereas

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.849 
part is actually made up of work whereas
the<00:03:48.459> bottom<00:03:48.760> part<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.120> made<00:03:49.359> up<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.599> metals<00:03:50.019> so

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
the bottom part is made up of metals so

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.710 
the bottom part is made up of metals so
let<00:03:51.160> me<00:03:51.340> just<00:03:51.519> show<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> how<00:03:52.389> you<00:03:52.450> can
