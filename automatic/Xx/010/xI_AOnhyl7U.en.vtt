00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.480
 hi i am jordi cobbler of the company 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.639
 rim de sa in collaboration with swimming pools 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.550
 I'm going to explain the 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.130
 different ways of measuring the ph of the 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.560
 pool the first way the simplest 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.540
 and economic are the analytical strips 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.119
 these analytical strips are immersed in the 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.509
 water we wait a reaction time and 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.420
 according to the color it will tell us how we have 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.130
 the ph of the pool 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.990
 the second type is using the phenol network 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.110
 is the typical comparator that has everything 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.240
 the world at home we put a sample of 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.690
 pool water we add 5 droplets of 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.950
 phenol network and it gives us a color there 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.980
 compare it with the color scale 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.290
 and will mark us what is the ph we have 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.730
 in the pool 7.76 here would be the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:00.950
 ideal values ​​there is also the same 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.200
 type of comparator but a little more 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.960
 sophisticated in the sense that the 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.910
 Dosage of phenol red comes in pill with 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.720
 which do not depend on the drops that 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.280
 they are always a bit random and the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.200
 pill gives us the amount of phenol 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.650
 exact rate is also compared by 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.530
 color and it gives us the measurement from 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.080
 here we would have what are the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.390
 photometers there are photometers of everything 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.550
 type and of all price the most affordable 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.979
 and more simple are these for use 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.470
 particular is immersed in the water and we 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.570
 give the little screen the value of the ph 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.920
 here we can move to photometers a lot 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.050
 more sophisticated that are capable of 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.110
 calculate up to 10 and 15 parameters of the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.110
 Water 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.780
 thanks for watching this video I hope that 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.060
 has been useful if you have 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 Any doubt you can consult our 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.789
 website www.ryanair.com or visit 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.679
