00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260 

I<00:00:00.030> am<00:00:00.299> edge<00:00:00.450> to<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.840> China<00:00:01.170> box<00:00:01.580> this<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.760> the

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
I am edge to this China box this is the

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.940 
I am edge to this China box this is the
same<00:00:03.510> method<00:00:03.750> that<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.049> would<00:00:04.319> use<00:00:04.529> if<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.799> was

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
same method that I would use if I was

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.190 
same method that I would use if I was
applying<00:00:05.160> gold<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.000> edge<00:00:06.150> but<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.109> this

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
applying gold to the edge but for this

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.870 
applying gold to the edge but for this
experiment<00:00:07.919> we're<00:00:08.010> going<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.250> just<00:00:08.429> do<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.730> in

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
experiment we're going to just do it in

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.129 
experiment we're going to just do it in
a<00:00:08.910> black<00:00:09.120> page<00:00:09.950> you<00:00:10.950> have<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.160> take<00:00:11.929> some<00:00:12.929> black

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
a black page you have to take some black

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:25.759 
a black page you have to take some black
powder<00:00:17.240> some<00:00:18.240> oil<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:24.660> mix<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.230> black<00:00:25.470> powder

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
powder some oil and mix the black powder

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.820 
powder some oil and mix the black powder
into<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.820> flat<00:00:27.029> tile

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.290 

ideally<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.070> want<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.550> enough<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:33.120> how

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
ideally you want just enough that's how

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
ideally you want just enough that's how
it<00:00:33.360> works<00:00:33.750> out

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
it works out

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.430 
it works out
the<00:00:34.920> black<00:00:35.130> powder<00:00:37.430> this<00:00:38.430> will<00:00:38.670> give<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
the black powder this will give it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
the black powder this will give it
behind<00:00:40.440> density<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.850> color<00:00:49.879> as<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.239> see

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
behind density at color as you can see

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.870 
behind density at color as you can see
my<00:00:51.719> mixture<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.230> getting<00:00:52.559> quite<00:00:52.710> dry

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.730 

which<00:01:01.880> all<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:02.240> need<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.720> enough<00:01:03.140> that's<00:01:03.560> all

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
which all you need is enough that's all

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.200 
which all you need is enough that's all
too<00:01:04.010> wet<00:01:04.190> out<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.970> pigments<00:01:05.480> and<00:01:06.940> now<00:01:07.940> go<00:01:08.150> to

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
too wet out the pigments and now go to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:23.650 
too wet out the pigments and now go to
add<00:01:08.510> some<00:01:08.720> turpentine<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.910> this<00:01:23.120> finish<00:01:23.510> the

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
add some turpentine and this finish the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:02:02.900 
add some turpentine and this finish the
mixture<00:01:24.050> dough

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:11.460 

now<00:02:03.910> achieved<00:02:05.490> dense<00:02:06.490> black<00:02:07.420> liquid<00:02:10.470> I'm

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
now achieved dense black liquid I'm

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.360 
now achieved dense black liquid I'm
going<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.800> transfer<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.760> little<00:02:13.090> well

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
going to transfer that to a little well

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.390 
going to transfer that to a little well
if<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.580> was<00:02:15.760> adding<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.300> gold<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.770> edge<00:02:17.920> I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
if I was adding the gold to the edge I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:29.160 
if I was adding the gold to the edge I
would<00:02:19.180> place<00:02:19.540> my<00:02:19.570> gold<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.310> same<00:02:21.640> way<00:02:28.170> to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
would place my gold in the same way to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.860 
would place my gold in the same way to
apply<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.560> mixture<00:02:30.280> I'm<00:02:31.270> going<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.630> take<00:02:31.840> a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
apply this mixture I'm going to take a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.550 
apply this mixture I'm going to take a
pair<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.280> small<00:02:33.280> round<00:02:34.410> dead-ended<00:02:35.790> scissors

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
pair of small round dead-ended scissors

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.900 
pair of small round dead-ended scissors
but<00:02:38.560> I'm<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> hold<00:02:39.190> as<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.700> like

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
but I'm going to hold as this is like

00:02:39.910 --> 00:03:03.000 
but I'm going to hold as this is like
this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.800 

our<00:03:04.010> twisting<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.670> turning<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:06.740> round<00:03:07.010> edge

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
our twisting and turning the round edge

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.790 
our twisting and turning the round edge
you<00:03:08.810> can<00:03:09.020> adjust<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.760> edge<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.560> black

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
you can adjust the edge of the black

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:24.280 
you can adjust the edge of the black
panes<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.970> same<00:03:20.240> width<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.900> charity

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
panes to the same width as the charity

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:45.949 
panes to the same width as the charity
box

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.190 

so<00:03:46.959> matches<00:03:47.349> are<00:03:47.500> better<00:03:47.650> than<00:03:47.860> others<00:03:49.200> and

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
so matches are better than others and

00:03:50.200 --> 00:04:02.130 
so matches are better than others and
this<00:03:50.349> is<00:03:50.530> about<00:03:50.739> one<00:04:00.569> if<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:01.720> do<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.930> make<00:04:02.110> a

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
this is about one if I do you make a

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.449 
this is about one if I do you make a
mess<00:04:02.500> just<00:04:04.560> take<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.590> couple<00:04:05.830> more<00:04:06.099> but<00:04:06.340> just

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
mess just take a couple more but just

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.700 
mess just take a couple more but just
tidy<00:04:09.459> up
