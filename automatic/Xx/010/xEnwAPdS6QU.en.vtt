00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.500
 So what you're saying is that, 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.800
 This is a dinosaur rocket! 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:11.300
 [music] 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.420
 Well, today is our special edition to the ecterior as you can see 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.510
 We will play with a dinosaur rocket ship 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.550
 In fact it is not a dinosaur, it is a pteranodon 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.450
 and a pteranodon classified as a reptile. 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.750
 Could you repeat this in a weird voice? 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.160
 In fact it is not a dinosaur, it is a pteranodon 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 and pteranodons are classified as reptiles. 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 Anyway, according to the diagram, I have to find an animated rabbit, 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
 and I'll put it in the muzzle 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.470
 and I will blow for him what he will do that he can throw Pteranodon in the air. 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.070
 Where can we find this drawing rabbit? 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.190
 I do not see anything 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.570
 I think this will be our next WTF. 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.180
 Well let's look at this. 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.880
 Now the reason why we believe that this is a WTF is, 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.800
 I know you have many toys and things like these in Canada, 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.130
 but I inflate it with air and let it go out 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.720
 It's like a balloon, like a balloon out of control 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.530
 It's like inflating a balloon and letting it go. 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.850
 Pterrorodon Pteranodon! Ptespantante from -65,000 AC. 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.240
 TEE HEE HEE. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.170
 Yes, I think so. Oh it's okay 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.060
 That's all right. We do not want it too big. 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.580
 Well, now we put the straw in the hole and we blow a bit of air. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.890
 I know a lot of serious little! 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.780
 It's really like ... 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.690
 AAAHH !! 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.700
 Have you lost the straw? [NO!] 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 This is really like party balloons with the same technology to blow 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120
 to put a straw in a hole and blow. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.720
 Korea is very fascinated to put pallets in the holes and blow! 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.340
 Well We are ready! 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 Can you stop sucking this and hurrying and throwing the cursed Pteranodon? 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470
 [epic music of pteranodon] 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.690
 WAAAHHAHHHAAAAHAAA! 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.570
 That's sorry! Well my turn! 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.800
 How did you dump everything? 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.690
 AAHHHH! 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.310
 It's from the lawn [PD La lava no babeja] 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.720
 Time to throw a Pteranodon, like a man! 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.230
 ENTLE-HO! 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 Oh! Not too far away! 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.220
 The Pteranodon is sorry! 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.050
 The Pteranodon is sorry! I'm not surprised that you are extinguished! 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.580
 EH! 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.190
 FAST! 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.080
 Launching Pteranodons ... like a man! 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.790
 HAHAHAHAHA! 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.500
 It's still shame 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.910
 Well, Daiso! I was disappointed! 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.720
 VERA PTERANODON! 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.220
 BEFORE YOU ARE FREE! 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.830
 It's really much like a long and sad balloon. 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.230
 That is, it is, it's exceptionally sad! 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.940
 I have bean all over my face! 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.770
 Not only has I been disappointed, I am wet ... and uncomfortable! 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.360
 So that's how you should be, 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.880
 You supposedly have to be a happy and carefree child 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.480
 Being like "Pteranodon is the best thing in the world!" 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.820
 but that's how you end up seeing: 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.630
 [Baby crying] 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.240
 I know. I am sorry small! 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.160
 I have to say, that has disappointed me a lot. 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.170
 Yes, this is the first WTF that really pays off 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 It's like the terrible treasure found. 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.380
 THE TRESOR FOUND PTERANODON! 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.880
 PTERRIBLE! 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.890
 With a p, 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.680
 a silent p 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.190
 Terrible! With a silent p! 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.790
 Who was the silent p? 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.410
 It's like, the silly letter that's there! 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.620
 I've been waiting for this like, since winter. 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.820
 We bought it so long ago; We were waiting for the perfect day 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.270
 to go outside and play there. 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.470
 It was like "Simon, can we go to play with Pteranodon?" 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.870
 And he responded as "no" and I was like 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.490
 oh 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.490
 And at last we played today, and it's a pity! 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.300
 I'm considering, maybe, hanging up at home 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.500
 Like, grab a punch, but the problem is that it is lightweight. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.940
 maybe I take a punch and I hang it up? 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.650
 And then throw it away, and then it will give people face to face and bleed them. 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.670
 Like a real pteronodon! 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.090
 And then we can begin to pay the demands, 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.880
 YAY DEMANDS! 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.600
 With a silent p. There is no silent p 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.010
 GONG! 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.820
 Well it's that W time of the month again 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.540
 For our draw of the WTF package! 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.560
 YAY! OH GOD! This is pterrorific! 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.730
 With a silent p 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.740
 Well, this time we will give the pterterodontic pteranodon. 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.940
 Um, the grandmother's sun visor, which can also be used to weld. 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.470
 The "chopsticks" to train: 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.310
 yes, we apparently will not send to Australia 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.600
 Because everyone in Australia for some reason has it, 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.910
 And also the fantastic WTF tits. 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.220
 If! Japanese QE tetas are very much 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.640
 the best WTF find this month 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.050
 Well, our difficult question, which will be very challenging too. 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.950
 You will have to use your mates, geographer, artistic techniques. 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.180
 Macguyver Techniques as well. 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.990
 Yes, and our question for you is 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.300
 If you could use the instant teas for something else 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.220
 Apart from attracting men, why would you use them? 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.820
 This is a question only for our YouTube subscribers. 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.320
 If you want to participate in the draw, 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.610
 leave your answer to the comments in this video. 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.530
 And we will announce the winners next week. 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.620
 It's so clear, guys! 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.030
 It's very painful. I want to go home, and hide in the apartment. 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.900
 I want an ice cream! 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.650
 The sun has just left! HISS! 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.130
 Email to the internet! 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.130
 GONG!
