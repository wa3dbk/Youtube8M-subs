see its steering required so you put you
just<00:01:40.160> touch<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.490> steering<00:01:40.790> wheel<00:01:40.910> let<00:01:41.180> it

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
just touch the steering wheel let it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.340 
just touch the steering wheel let it

and it'll keep going

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.719 
and it'll keep going
so<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.320> real<00:01:45.470> purpose<00:01:45.800> isn't<00:01:46.040> necessarily<00:01:46.580> so

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
so the real purpose isn't necessarily so

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.999 
so the real purpose isn't necessarily so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
something happens and you take your eyes

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.010 
something happens and you take your eyes
off<00:01:54.980> the<00:01:55.250> road<00:01:55.400> if<00:01:55.970> you're<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.390> this<00:01:56.510> mode<00:01:56.750> it

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
off the road if you're in this mode it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.350 
off the road if you're in this mode it
should<00:01:57.290> keep<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.620> in<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.800> lane<00:01:57.980> so<00:01:58.909> there's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
should keep you in the lane so there's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.990 
should keep you in the lane so there's
that<00:01:59.770> now<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.010> how<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.250> works<00:02:01.430> very

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
that now this is how it works very

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.320 
that now this is how it works very
simple<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:04.040> have<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.340> get<00:02:04.460> above<00:02:04.700> 45<00:02:05.150> miles

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
simple so you have to get above 45 miles

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.060 
simple so you have to get above 45 miles
per<00:02:05.390> hour<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.960> then<00:02:06.409> over<00:02:06.770> here<00:02:06.890> on<00:02:06.979> the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
per hour and then over here on the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.070 
per hour and then over here on the
steering<00:02:07.340> wheel<00:02:07.430> down<00:02:08.000> here<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.540> a<00:02:08.810> little

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
steering wheel down here is a little

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.410 
steering wheel down here is a little
steering<00:02:09.530> wheel<00:02:09.709> symbol<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:10.729> lines<00:02:10.970> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
steering wheel symbol with lines and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.850 
steering wheel symbol with lines and
that's<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.840> you<00:02:11.989> just<00:02:12.140> activate<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.769> by

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
that's it you just activate it by

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.979 
that's it you just activate it by
pressing<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.580> then<00:02:14.090> on<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.630> center

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
pressing that and then on the center

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.990 
pressing that and then on the center
display<00:02:15.320> it'll<00:02:15.769> tell<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.160> it's<00:02:16.519> on<00:02:16.730> by

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
display it'll tell you that it's on by

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.060 
display it'll tell you that it's on by
showing<00:02:17.239> you<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.570> dashed<00:02:17.750> lines<00:02:18.140> which<00:02:18.920> is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
showing you the dashed lines which is

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.740 
showing you the dashed lines which is
exactly<00:02:19.400> what<00:02:19.549> it's<00:02:19.670> doing<00:02:19.730> right<00:02:19.910> now<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.360> am

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
exactly what it's doing right now I am

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.630 
exactly what it's doing right now I am

which<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.680> actually<00:02:26.980> kind<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.220> cool<00:02:27.400> now<00:02:27.880> some

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
which is actually kind of cool now some

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.970 
which is actually kind of cool now some
systems<00:02:28.510> do<00:02:29.170> something<00:02:29.470> similar<00:02:29.710> but<00:02:29.860> they

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
systems do something similar but they

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.710 
systems do something similar but they
only<00:02:30.130> use<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.520> brakes<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.180> they're<00:02:31.540> actually

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
only use the brakes and they're actually

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.450 
only use the brakes and they're actually
squeezing<00:02:32.410> different<00:02:32.920> brakes<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.250> different

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
squeezing different brakes and different

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.740 
squeezing different brakes and different
sides<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.790> car<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.150> make<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.330> move<00:02:34.570> into

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
sides of the car to make it move into

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.080 
sides of the car to make it move into
the<00:02:34.900> lane<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:35.890> case<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.490> is<00:02:36.550> using

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
the lane and in this case it is using

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.490 
the lane and in this case it is using
the<00:02:37.180> actual<00:02:37.420> steering<00:02:37.840> wheel<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:38.140> moving<00:02:38.410> it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the actual steering wheel and moving it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.720 
the actual steering wheel and moving it
around<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.920> order<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.130> keep<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.460> in<00:02:39.580> your<00:02:39.610> lane

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
around in order to keep you in your lane

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.220 
around in order to keep you in your lane
and<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.720> works<00:02:40.900> seamlessly<00:02:42.270> now<00:02:43.270> with<00:02:44.080> that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and it works seamlessly now with that

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.350 
and it works seamlessly now with that
being<00:02:44.380> said<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:45.460> intersections<00:02:45.970> right<00:02:46.000> Andre

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
being said the intersections right Andre

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.510 
being said the intersections right Andre
yeah<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:46.960> know<00:02:47.140> I'm<00:02:47.260> saying<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:48.160> get<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.430> an

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
yeah you know I'm saying you get to an

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.220 
yeah you know I'm saying you get to an
intersection<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.330> immediately<00:02:49.840> cuts<00:02:50.050> off

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
intersection and it immediately cuts off

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.900 
intersection and it immediately cuts off
what<00:02:50.590> happens<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.190> doesn't<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> lanes

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
what happens is it doesn't see the lanes

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.710 
what happens is it doesn't see the lanes
anymore<00:02:52.420> or<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:53.500> gets<00:02:54.030> yeah<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.060> know<00:02:55.180> let's<00:02:55.600> see

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
anymore or it gets yeah I know let's see

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.020 
anymore or it gets yeah I know let's see
if<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.900> works<00:02:56.050> that's<00:02:56.710> right<00:02:56.890> good<00:02:57.580> boy

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
if it works that's right good boy

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.500 
if it works that's right good boy
yeah<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:59.380> doesn't<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.830> that<00:03:00.040> okay<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.300> folks

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
yeah it doesn't like that okay so folks

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.060 
yeah it doesn't like that okay so folks
what<00:03:01.720> happened<00:03:02.080> there<00:03:02.230> was<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.620> turn<00:03:02.860> was

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
what happened there was the turn was

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.340 
what happened there was the turn was
just<00:03:03.400> too<00:03:03.580> tight<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.540> doesn't<00:03:04.930> want<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.230> do

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
just too tight it doesn't want to do

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.400 
just too tight it doesn't want to do
anything<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.720> strenuous<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:08.170> doesn't

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
anything that is strenuous it doesn't

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.630 
anything that is strenuous it doesn't
want<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.740> go<00:03:08.860> flying<00:03:09.190> through<00:03:09.370> an

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
want you to go flying through an

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.460 
want you to go flying through an
intersection<00:03:10.210> or<00:03:10.270> in<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.480> case<00:03:10.660> around<00:03:11.380> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
intersection or in this case around a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.950 
intersection or in this case around a
corner<00:03:11.770> at<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.760> high<00:03:13.030> rate<00:03:13.240> of<00:03:13.360> speed<00:03:13.540> where<00:03:13.870> it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
corner at a high rate of speed where it

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.470 
corner at a high rate of speed where it
cannot<00:03:14.260> keep<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.800> there<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.760> stops<00:03:16.180> and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
cannot keep you in there so it stops and

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.470 
cannot keep you in there so it stops and
it<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.900> saw<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.140> red<00:03:17.800> flash<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.640> yelling

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
it you saw the red flash and the yelling

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.020 
it you saw the red flash and the yelling
at<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.020> this<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:21.030> screaming

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
at you and this and that screaming

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.810 
at you and this and that screaming
people<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:23.500> system<00:03:23.950> actually<00:03:24.340> works<00:03:24.730> quite

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
people the system actually works quite

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.490 
people the system actually works quite
well<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.600> once<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.840> get<00:03:25.960> to<00:03:26.050> an<00:03:26.170> intersection

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
well so once you get to an intersection

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.250 
well so once you get to an intersection
though<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:28.030> lines<00:03:28.270> disappear<00:03:28.540> when<00:03:29.140> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
though the lines disappear when the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.990 
though the lines disappear when the
lines<00:03:29.470> disappear<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:30.190> car<00:03:30.370> can't<00:03:30.640> see<00:03:30.850> them

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
lines disappear the car can't see them

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.670 
lines disappear the car can't see them
when<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.209> car<00:03:31.360> can't<00:03:31.600> see<00:03:31.780> them<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.260> shuts<00:03:32.590> the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
when the car can't see them it shuts the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.230 
when the car can't see them it shuts the
system<00:03:33.070> off<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.580> are<00:03:33.610> basically<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:34.209> your

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
system off and you are basically on your

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
system off and you are basically on your
own

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
own

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.649 
own
it<00:03:35.830> doesn't<00:03:36.370> really<00:03:36.670> give<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.180> too<00:03:37.450> much<00:03:37.599> of

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
it doesn't really give you too much of

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.630 
it doesn't really give you too much of
an<00:03:37.870> audio<00:03:38.170> but<00:03:38.379> warning<00:03:38.799> saying<00:03:38.980> hey<00:03:39.189> you<00:03:39.250> now

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
an audio but warning saying hey you now

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.179 
an audio but warning saying hey you now
are<00:03:39.879> stuck<00:03:40.209> there<00:03:40.780> are<00:03:40.930> beeps<00:03:41.170> little<00:03:42.040> beeps

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
are stuck there are beeps little beeps

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.350 
are stuck there are beeps little beeps
and<00:03:42.489> little<00:03:42.700> beeps<00:03:42.849> can<00:03:43.030> mean<00:03:43.150> multiple

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
and little beeps can mean multiple

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.690 
and little beeps can mean multiple
things<00:03:43.840> but<00:03:44.739> if<00:03:45.040> you're<00:03:45.220> smart<00:03:45.459> enough<00:03:45.640> to

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
things but if you're smart enough to

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.890 
things but if you're smart enough to
actually<00:03:46.060> look<00:03:46.209> at<00:03:46.299> your<00:03:46.390> display<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.780> can

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
actually look at your display you can

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.479 
actually look at your display you can
figure<00:03:47.170> out<00:03:47.349> exactly<00:03:47.470> what's<00:03:47.920> going<00:03:48.099> on<00:03:48.220> and

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
figure out exactly what's going on and

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.910 
figure out exactly what's going on and
in<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:48.790> particular<00:03:49.000> case<00:03:49.379> in<00:03:50.379> terms<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.769> what

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
in this particular case in terms of what

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.960 
in this particular case in terms of what
this<00:03:51.040> vehicle<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.430> doing<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:51.730> I'm<00:03:51.790> going<00:03:51.940> to

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
this vehicle is doing that I'm going to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.699 
this vehicle is doing that I'm going to
activate<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.420> system<00:03:52.569> right<00:03:52.810> now<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.409> once

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
activate the system right now so once

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.619 
activate the system right now so once
again<00:03:53.799> pushing<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:54.280> steering<00:03:54.579> wheel<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:55.329> sees

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
again pushing the steering wheel it sees

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.289 
again pushing the steering wheel it sees
the<00:03:55.780> lines<00:03:56.019> we're<00:03:56.650> trying<00:03:56.890> again<00:03:56.950> there<00:03:57.790> yeah

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
the lines we're trying again there yeah

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.059 
the lines we're trying again there yeah
now<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.720> sees<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.989> line<00:03:59.170> so<00:03:59.349> it's<00:03:59.470> gonna<00:03:59.560> nope

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
now it sees the line so it's gonna nope

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.289 
now it sees the line so it's gonna nope
doesn't<00:04:00.310> want<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.579> keep<00:04:00.700> me<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:00.879> there<00:04:01.000> see<00:04:01.150> too

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
doesn't want to keep me in there see too

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.390 
doesn't want to keep me in there see too
much<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.599> turn<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.500> likes<00:04:02.680> gentle<00:04:03.159> turns

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
much of a turn it likes gentle turns

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.770 
much of a turn it likes gentle turns
yeah<00:04:04.239> if<00:04:04.359> you're<00:04:04.480> going<00:04:04.599> through<00:04:04.720> a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
yeah if you're going through a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.179 
yeah if you're going through a
neighborhood<00:04:05.079> this<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.349> systems<00:04:05.829> not<00:04:06.040> gonna

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
neighborhood this is systems not gonna

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.009 
neighborhood this is systems not gonna
work<00:04:06.340> there<00:04:06.609> we<00:04:06.700> go<00:04:06.790> okay<00:04:07.239> it's<00:04:07.390> on<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.840> I'm

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
work there we go okay it's on and I'm

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.680 
work there we go okay it's on and I'm
gonna<00:04:08.140> go<00:04:08.319> into<00:04:08.590> cruise<00:04:08.829> control<00:04:09.190> at<00:04:09.940> 55<00:04:10.450> miles

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
gonna go into cruise control at 55 miles

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.960 
gonna go into cruise control at 55 miles
per<00:04:10.810> hour<00:04:10.930> which<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.379> speed<00:04:11.530> limit<00:04:11.970> for

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
per hour which is the speed limit for

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.729 
per hour which is the speed limit for
this<00:04:13.389> particular<00:04:13.750> Road<00:04:14.079> it's<00:04:15.040> okay<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:17.229> there

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
this particular Road it's okay so there

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.640 
this particular Road it's okay so there
it<00:04:17.829> is<00:04:17.919> it's<00:04:18.070> working<00:04:18.370> okay<00:04:18.609> now<00:04:19.440> what<00:04:20.440> does

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
it is it's working okay now what does

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.490 
it is it's working okay now what does
this<00:04:20.829> say<00:04:21.100> about<00:04:21.660> autonomous<00:04:22.660> driving<00:04:22.930> this

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
this say about autonomous driving this

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.560 
this say about autonomous driving this
is<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.740> baby<00:04:24.130> step<00:04:24.460> this<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.030> little<00:04:25.330> tiny

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
is a baby step this is a little tiny

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.480 
is a baby step this is a little tiny
step<00:04:25.900> if<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.590> took<00:04:26.740> this<00:04:26.949> system<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
step if you took this system and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.710 
step if you took this system and
combined<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.940> let's<00:04:28.090> say<00:04:28.210> with<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.479> one<00:04:28.600> that

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
combined it let's say with the one that

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.689 
combined it let's say with the one that
mercedes-benz<00:04:29.169> is<00:04:29.530> using<00:04:29.889> which<00:04:30.490> is

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
mercedes-benz is using which is

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.610 
mercedes-benz is using which is
basically<00:04:31.120> autonomous<00:04:31.720> driving<00:04:31.960> below<00:04:32.260> 19

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
basically autonomous driving below 19

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.770 
basically autonomous driving below 19
miles<00:04:32.770> per<00:04:32.979> hour<00:04:33.479> suddenly<00:04:34.479> you<00:04:34.600> have<00:04:34.750> a

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
miles per hour suddenly you have a

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.650 
miles per hour suddenly you have a
system<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.199> would<00:04:35.410> be<00:04:35.470> able<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:36.240> what<00:04:37.240> it's

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
system that would be able to what it's

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.330 
system that would be able to what it's
Lane<00:04:38.080> Departure<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.650> doesn't<00:04:38.889> like<00:04:39.010> it<00:04:39.190> it

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
Lane Departure it doesn't like it it

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.339 
Lane Departure it doesn't like it it
just<00:04:39.370> corrected<00:04:40.180> itself<00:04:40.449> there<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.990> go

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
just corrected itself there you go

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.909 
just corrected itself there you go
so<00:04:42.220> going<00:04:42.610> back<00:04:42.760> to<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.360> would<00:04:44.139> be<00:04:44.260> two<00:04:44.470> systems

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
so going back to it would be two systems

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.070 
so going back to it would be two systems
working<00:04:45.130> together<00:04:45.370> possibly<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.810> let<00:04:46.960> you

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
working together possibly to let you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.500 
working together possibly to let you
drive<00:04:47.380> from<00:04:48.220> point<00:04:48.430> A<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.550> point<00:04:48.639> B<00:04:48.910> with<00:04:49.240> very

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
drive from point A to point B with very

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.409 
drive from point A to point B with very
little<00:04:49.780> input<00:04:50.220> one<00:04:51.220> step<00:04:51.520> beyond<00:04:51.849> that<00:04:52.090> and

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
little input one step beyond that and

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.870 
little input one step beyond that and
we're<00:04:53.229> suddenly<00:04:53.470> at<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.770> place<00:04:54.010> where<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.610> can

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
we're suddenly at a place where you can

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.430 
we're suddenly at a place where you can
jump<00:04:55.300> into<00:04:55.449> your<00:04:55.599> car<00:04:55.720> and<00:04:55.870> say<00:04:55.960> take<00:04:56.139> me<00:04:56.289> home

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
jump into your car and say take me home

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.529 
jump into your car and say take me home
I'm<00:04:56.650> tired<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:57.190> then<00:04:57.789> lay<00:04:58.000> back<00:04:58.030> while<00:04:58.449> the

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
I'm tired and then lay back while the

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.820 
I'm tired and then lay back while the
car<00:04:58.720> does<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:58.990> driving<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.530> we're<00:04:59.650> almost

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
car does the driving and we're almost

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.130 
car does the driving and we're almost
there

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
there

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.020 
there
yep<00:05:01.620> see<00:05:01.830> says<00:05:02.040> Lane<00:05:02.190> Departure<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.700> yelling

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
yep see says Lane Departure is yelling

the<00:05:09.600> system<00:05:10.020> is<00:05:10.260> working<00:05:10.590> right<00:05:10.920> now<00:05:11.160> it's

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
the system is working right now it's

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.520 
the system is working right now it's
pretty<00:05:12.030> intuitive<00:05:12.360> it's<00:05:12.810> pretty<00:05:13.080> simple<00:05:13.470> but

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
pretty intuitive it's pretty simple but

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.620 
pretty intuitive it's pretty simple but
it's<00:05:14.520> also<00:05:14.700> not<00:05:15.360> very<00:05:15.390> intrusive<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:17.630> with

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
it's also not very intrusive and with

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.790 
it's also not very intrusive and with
the<00:05:18.720> exception<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.230> telling<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.680> you

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
the exception of it telling you that you

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.110 
the exception of it telling you that you
need<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:20.130> touch<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.310> steering<00:05:20.730> wheel<00:05:20.850> or<00:05:21.000> else

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
need to touch the steering wheel or else

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.330 
need to touch the steering wheel or else
that's<00:05:21.270> going<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.510> disengage<00:05:22.070> other<00:05:23.070> than

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
that's going to disengage other than

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.640 
that's going to disengage other than
that<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:24.030> system<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.510> very<00:05:24.810> simple<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.620> very

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
that the system is very simple and very

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.980 
that the system is very simple and very
basic<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.760> think<00:05:27.330> about<00:05:27.540> it<00:05:27.690> even<00:05:27.810> though

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
basic and think about it even though

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.750 
basic and think about it even though
it's<00:05:28.110> simple<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.500> basic<00:05:28.860> imagine<00:05:29.340> all<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.610> the

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
it's simple and basic imagine all of the

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.250 
it's simple and basic imagine all of the
electronics<00:05:30.360> all<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:30.600> technology<00:05:31.110> that's

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
electronics all the technology that's

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.230 
electronics all the technology that's
required<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.740> make<00:05:31.920> this<00:05:32.040> thing<00:05:32.250> work<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.730> find

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
required to make this thing work I find

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.360 
required to make this thing work I find
it<00:05:33.390> rather<00:05:33.510> extraordinary<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.860> system<00:05:35.250> is

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
it rather extraordinary this system is

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.210 
it rather extraordinary this system is
cool<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:36.120> needs<00:05:36.480> a<00:05:36.750> little<00:05:37.020> bit<00:05:37.140> more<00:05:37.290> autonomy

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
cool it needs a little bit more autonomy

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.040 
cool it needs a little bit more autonomy
in<00:05:38.340> order<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.730> really<00:05:39.030> be<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:39.390> benefit<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:39.930> the

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
in order to really be a benefit to the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.170 
in order to really be a benefit to the
driver<00:05:40.320> in<00:05:40.530> my<00:05:40.560> mind<00:05:40.860> but<00:05:41.640> there<00:05:41.910> are<00:05:42.030> some

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
driver in my mind but there are some

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.820 
driver in my mind but there are some
people<00:05:42.420> out<00:05:42.540> there<00:05:42.600> who<00:05:42.810> on<00:05:43.170> a<00:05:43.200> long<00:05:43.500> stretch

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
people out there who on a long stretch

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.070 
people out there who on a long stretch
of<00:05:43.860> highway<00:05:44.310> could<00:05:45.180> really<00:05:45.480> use<00:05:45.750> something

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
of highway could really use something

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.660 
of highway could really use something
like<00:05:46.110> this<00:05:46.470> you<00:05:47.160> know<00:05:47.280> just<00:05:47.460> as<00:05:47.550> they're

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
like this you know just as they're

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.860 
like this you know just as they're
cruising<00:05:48.090> I<00:05:48.120> got<00:05:48.300> their<00:05:48.390> hand<00:05:48.570> on<00:05:48.630> this<00:05:48.750> to

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
cruising I got their hand on this to

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.090 
cruising I got their hand on this to
really<00:05:49.050> take<00:05:49.350> it<00:05:49.500> off<00:05:49.620> they're<00:05:49.860> doing

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
really take it off they're doing

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.870 
really take it off they're doing
something<00:05:50.400> and<00:05:50.490> they're<00:05:50.610> not<00:05:50.640> being

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
something and they're not being

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.310 
something and they're not being
attention<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.450> highways<00:05:51.750> craving

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
attention that the highways craving

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.040 
attention that the highways craving
check<00:05:53.010> it<00:05:53.130> out<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.640> power<00:05:53.910> curves<00:05:54.270> those

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
check it out the power curves those

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.050 
check it out the power curves those
around<00:05:55.200> the<00:05:55.320> girl<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:55.560> should<00:05:55.740> say<00:05:55.940> piece<00:05:56.940> of

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
around the girl I should say piece of

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.630 
around the girl I should say piece of
cake<00:05:57.210> right<00:05:57.390> well<00:05:57.900> yeah<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.920> but<00:05:59.160> I<00:05:59.280> think<00:05:59.520> two

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
cake right well yeah and but I think two

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.280 
cake right well yeah and but I think two
more<00:05:59.760> points<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.510> think<00:06:00.540> the<00:06:00.870> lawyers

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
more points that I think the lawyers

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.620 
more points that I think the lawyers
from<00:06:01.470> Acura<00:06:01.890> would<00:06:02.100> say<00:06:02.370> do<00:06:02.970> not<00:06:03.150> take<00:06:03.480> your

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
from Acura would say do not take your

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.090 
from Acura would say do not take your
hands<00:06:03.960> off<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.110> steering<00:06:04.260> wheel<00:06:04.650> which<00:06:04.920> I

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
hands off the steering wheel which I

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.630 
hands off the steering wheel which I
don't<00:06:05.160> recommend<00:06:05.490> myself<00:06:07.040> and<00:06:08.040> then<00:06:08.160> it

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
don't recommend myself and then it

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.970 
don't recommend myself and then it
reminds<00:06:09.060> me<00:06:09.120> about<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:09.870> about<00:06:10.050> every<00:06:10.620> 15

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
reminds me about you about every 15

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.740 
reminds me about you about every 15
seconds<00:06:11.430> correct<00:06:11.820> yeah<00:06:12.000> we<00:06:12.120> timed<00:06:12.420> it<00:06:12.570> and

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
seconds correct yeah we timed it and

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.390 
seconds correct yeah we timed it and
it's<00:06:12.870> about<00:06:13.020> every<00:06:13.290> 15<00:06:13.710> seconds<00:06:14.100> you<00:06:14.220> take

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
it's about every 15 seconds you take

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.060 
it's about every 15 seconds you take
your<00:06:14.520> hand<00:06:14.670> off<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:14.850> wheel<00:06:15.680> for<00:06:16.680> it<00:06:16.800> to<00:06:16.890> come

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
your hand off the wheel for it to come

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.410 
your hand off the wheel for it to come
back<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.370> beep<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:17.700> say<00:06:17.790> hey<00:06:17.940> we<00:06:18.180> need<00:06:18.300> an

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
back and beep and say hey we need an

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.640 
back and beep and say hey we need an
input<00:06:18.600> here<00:06:18.960> or<00:06:19.020> else<00:06:19.110> we're<00:06:19.200> gonna<00:06:19.290> shut<00:06:19.530> the

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
input here or else we're gonna shut the

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.980 
input here or else we're gonna shut the
system<00:06:19.800> down<00:06:19.980> but<00:06:20.730> just<00:06:20.970> so<00:06:21.150> you<00:06:21.210> know<00:06:21.330> that's

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
system down but just so you know that's

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.930 
system down but just so you know that's
how<00:06:22.230> far<00:06:22.470> this<00:06:22.620> tech<00:06:22.860> has<00:06:23.040> gone<00:06:23.250> it's<00:06:23.610> a<00:06:23.760> death

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
how far this tech has gone it's a death

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.030 
how far this tech has gone it's a death
it's<00:06:24.210> a<00:06:24.300> baby<00:06:24.630> step<00:06:24.930> in<00:06:25.140> the<00:06:25.350> right<00:06:25.500> direction

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
it's a baby step in the right direction

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.980 
it's a baby step in the right direction
for<00:06:26.430> those<00:06:26.550> of<00:06:26.730> you<00:06:26.820> who<00:06:27.030> are<00:06:27.270> interested<00:06:27.690> in

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
for those of you who are interested in

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.080 
for those of you who are interested in
an<00:06:28.080> autonomous<00:06:28.290> driving<00:06:28.770> for<00:06:29.310> me<00:06:29.430> it's

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
an autonomous driving for me it's

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.730 
an autonomous driving for me it's
terrifying<00:06:30.630> because<00:06:30.840> it's<00:06:31.110> one<00:06:31.290> step<00:06:31.500> closer

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
terrifying because it's one step closer

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.660 
terrifying because it's one step closer
to<00:06:32.010> the<00:06:32.100> robots<00:06:32.400> taking<00:06:32.610> over<00:06:34.220> done<00:06:35.220> yeah

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
to the robots taking over done yeah

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:47.599 
to the robots taking over done yeah
adios<00:06:36.120> amigos

00:06:47.609 --> 00:06:50.939 

once<00:06:48.609> upon<00:06:48.879> a<00:06:48.939> time<00:06:49.439> you<00:06:50.439> had<00:06:50.559> to<00:06:50.589> watch<00:06:50.829> a

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949 
once upon a time you had to watch a
