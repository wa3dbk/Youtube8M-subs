think<00:01:27.510> he<00:01:27.780> probably<00:01:27.900> could<00:01:28.200> rise<00:01:28.440> maybe<00:01:29.040> 10k

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
think he probably could rise maybe 10k

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280 
think he probably could rise maybe 10k
15k<00:01:29.730> more<00:01:30.270> than<00:01:30.420> his<00:01:30.540> average<00:01:30.750> prices<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.230> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
15k more than his average prices at the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.990 
15k more than his average prices at the
moment<00:01:31.620> so<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.550> he<00:01:32.730> might<00:01:32.880> be

them to all be you know hopefully well
not<00:02:20.680> hopefully<00:02:21.159> I<00:02:21.189> think<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.640> generally

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
not hopefully I think I just generally

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.910 
not hopefully I think I just generally
think<00:02:22.329> they<00:02:22.450> could<00:02:22.689> rise<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.470> bit<00:02:23.860> in

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
think they could rise a little bit in

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.619 
think they could rise a little bit in
price<00:02:24.069> but<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.909> see<00:02:25.209> here<00:02:25.360> we're<00:02:25.480> going

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
market this is a very good technique

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.309 
market this is a very good technique
that<00:03:27.340> works<00:03:27.489> pretty<00:03:27.970> well<00:03:28.090> especially<00:03:29.049> when

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
that works pretty well especially when

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.689 
that works pretty well especially when
you<00:03:29.440> have<00:03:29.590> like<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.829> certain<00:03:30.190> amount<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.430> coins

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
you have like a certain amount of coins

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.030 
you have like a certain amount of coins
for<00:03:30.819> example<00:03:31.150> i<00:03:31.180> put<00:03:31.419> minimum<00:03:32.109> by<00:03:32.379> now<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.010> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
for example i put minimum by now so a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.890 
for example i put minimum by now so a
minimum<00:03:33.430> bidding<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:33.909> 10,000<00:03:34.449> coins<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.780> then

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
minimum bidding of 10,000 coins and then

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.229 
minimum bidding of 10,000 coins and then
maximum<00:03:35.349> bidding<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.790> 25,000<00:03:36.790> coins<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.120> that

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
maximum bidding of 25,000 coins in that

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.149 
maximum bidding of 25,000 coins in that
oversee<00:03:37.599> filter<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.440> maximum<00:03:38.829> amount<00:03:38.919> of

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
coins i can spend on a player because i

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.689 
coins i can spend on a player because i
only<00:03:40.959> have<00:03:41.079> 25<00:03:41.379> thousand<00:03:41.739> coins<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.129> it<00:03:42.609> will

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
only have 25 thousand coins and it will

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.319 
only have 25 thousand coins and it will
just<00:03:42.849> put<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.239> 10<00:03:44.370> bidding<00:03:45.370> 10k<00:03:45.970> bidding

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
just put a 10 bidding 10k bidding

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.479 
just put a 10 bidding 10k bidding
minimum<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.139> so<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.379> bumps<00:03:47.739> up<00:03:47.859> to<00:03:48.280> all<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
minimum just so it bumps up to all the

forestall<00:04:15.760> weak<00:04:15.909> foot<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.269> is<00:04:16.449> very

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
forestall weak foot so that is very

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.689 
forestall weak foot so that is very
appealing<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.859> he<00:04:17.979> plays<00:04:18.159> in<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.340> league<00:04:18.489> one

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
appealing and he plays in the league one

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.789 
appealing and he plays in the league one
so<00:04:18.909> you<00:04:18.970> know<00:04:19.150> both<00:04:19.329> of<00:04:19.389> them<00:04:19.630> sort<00:04:20.229> of<00:04:20.289> aspects

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
so you know both of them sort of aspects

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.200 
so you know both of them sort of aspects
really<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.310> sort<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.669> grab<00:04:21.880> hold<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.120> that

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
really do sort of grab hold of that

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.790 
really do sort of grab hold of that
player<00:04:22.449> and<00:04:22.840> make<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.139> think<00:04:23.349> you<00:04:23.409> know<00:04:23.530> I'm

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
player and make you think you know I'm

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.960 
player and make you think you know I'm
the<00:04:23.919> tri-mountain<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.460> I'm<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.789> I<00:04:24.820> did

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
the tri-mountain of I'm and I did

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.029 
the tri-mountain of I'm and I did
actually<00:04:25.060> use<00:04:25.330> him<00:04:25.570> his<00:04:25.990> normal<00:04:26.349> card<00:04:26.590> earlier

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
actually use him his normal card earlier

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.269 
actually use him his normal card earlier
in<00:04:28.029> the<00:04:28.270> year<00:04:28.300> well<00:04:28.840> foot<00:04:29.169> for<00:04:29.440> 313<00:04:30.010> actually

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:30.279 
in the year well foot for 313 actually

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.060 
in the year well foot for 313 actually
really

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
really

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.130 
really
quite<00:04:31.700> neither<00:04:31.910> star<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.420> he<00:04:32.540> was<00:04:32.630> fantastic

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
quite neither star and he was fantastic

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.780 
quite neither star and he was fantastic
just<00:04:33.260> a<00:04:33.410> normal<00:04:33.620> card<00:04:33.890> really<00:04:34.490> good<00:04:34.670> long

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
just a normal card really good long

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.340 
just a normal card really good long
short<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> think<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.420> probably<00:04:35.540> will<00:04:35.810> make<00:04:36.320> a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
short so I think I probably will make a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.720 
short so I think I probably will make a
squid<00:04:36.620> around<00:04:36.890> him<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.190> probably<00:04:37.370> do<00:04:37.550> like<00:04:37.670> a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
squid around him and probably do like a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.060 
squid around him and probably do like a
hard<00:04:37.970> score<00:04:38.240> better<00:04:38.360> with<00:04:38.960> him<00:04:39.170> as<00:04:39.350> well<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.890> I

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
hard score better with him as well so I

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.100 
hard score better with him as well so I
think<00:04:40.460> we<00:04:40.640> do<00:04:40.760> list<00:04:40.970> him<00:04:41.090> up<00:04:41.210> for<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.480> round<00:04:41.720> I

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
think we do list him up for a round I

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.840 
think we do list him up for a round I
think<00:04:42.770> we<00:04:42.860> try<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.070> little<00:04:43.340> bit<00:04:43.490> more<00:04:43.640> than<00:04:43.700> i

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
think we try a little bit more than i

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.060 
think we try a little bit more than i
was<00:04:43.970> expecting<00:04:44.060> actually<00:04:44.600> no<00:04:44.750> no<00:04:45.080> don't<00:04:45.320> as<00:04:45.950> a

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
was expecting actually no no don't as a

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.830 
was expecting actually no no don't as a
fail<00:04:46.310> but<00:04:46.340> yeah<00:04:46.670> we<00:04:46.880> put<00:04:47.030> him<00:04:47.120> up<00:04:47.180> for<00:04:47.210> 18,000

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
fail but yeah we put him up for 18,000

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.750 
fail but yeah we put him up for 18,000
hundred<00:04:48.140> 50<00:04:48.410> coins<00:04:48.530> overnight<00:04:49.190> for<00:04:49.400> 12<00:04:49.610> hours

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.810 
hundred 50 coins overnight for 12 hours
and<00:04:50.090> we<00:04:50.480> also<00:04:50.660> put<00:04:50.840> up<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.050> wheter<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:52.220> think

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
and we also put up this wheter I think

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.300 
and we also put up this wheter I think
we<00:04:52.880> put<00:04:53.030> my<00:04:53.180> for<00:04:53.360> about<00:04:53.510> 1.5<00:04:53.840> k<00:04:54.500> which<00:04:55.010> spirit

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
we put my for about 1.5 k which spirit

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.500 
we put my for about 1.5 k which spirit
respects<00:04:55.580> boy<00:04:55.730> I<00:04:55.760> didn't<00:04:56.030> actually<00:04:56.090> check<00:04:56.360> his

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
respects boy I didn't actually check his

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.910 
respects boy I didn't actually check his
price<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:56.840> i<00:04:56.870> could<00:04:57.050> have<00:04:57.140> maybe<00:04:57.350> got<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.830> little

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
price so i could have maybe got a little

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.400 
price so i could have maybe got a little
bit<00:04:58.280> more<00:04:58.460> but<00:04:58.700> you<00:04:58.910> know<00:04:59.210> never<00:04:59.420> know<00:04:59.600> I<00:04:59.810> put

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
my for 1.5 k and then hopefully he will

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.830

sell<00:05:03.200> in<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.500> coming<00:05:03.890> clip<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:04.630> yeah<00:05:05.630> there's
