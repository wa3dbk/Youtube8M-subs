00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
schools are safer I think our teachers

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.810 
schools are safer I think our teachers
probably<00:03:27.490> feel<00:03:28.490> more<00:03:28.520> comfortable<00:03:29.140> it's

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
probably feel more comfortable it's

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.580 
probably feel more comfortable it's

you total gratification I do believe

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.310 
you total gratification I do believe
schools<00:04:07.670> across<00:04:07.910> America<00:04:08.570> would<00:04:08.750> be<00:04:08.870> safer

with<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:10.190> safe<00:04:10.610> Seaver<00:04:11.000> pack<00:04:11.239> in<00:04:11.510> all<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.930> their

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
with a safe Seaver pack in all of their

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.070 
with a safe Seaver pack in all of their
classrooms<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.790> think<00:04:14.450> if<00:04:14.600> they<00:04:14.750> had<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
classrooms I think if they had the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.190 
classrooms I think if they had the
opportunity<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:15.920> see<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.820> in<00:04:16.940> action<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
opportunity to see it in action that the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.020 
opportunity to see it in action that the
teachers<00:04:18.919> wouldn't<00:04:19.160> want<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.459> go<00:04:19.519> another<00:04:19.669> day

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
teachers wouldn't want to go another day

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.430 
teachers wouldn't want to go another day
without<00:04:20.150> it

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
without it

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.500 
without it
