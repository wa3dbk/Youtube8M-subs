00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
pellets slide right over where is now

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.790 
pellets slide right over where is now
again<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.650> should<00:01:54.830> have<00:01:54.860> been<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.590> right

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
again you should have been and right

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.500 
again you should have been and right
about<00:01:58.040> there<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.369> think<00:01:58.700> he<00:01:58.850> realizes<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
about there I think he realizes the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.660 
about there I think he realizes the
gravity<00:01:59.540> of<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.080> situation<00:02:03.400> this<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.580> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
gravity of the situation this is the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.420 
gravity of the situation this is the

first bird of the day that we took the

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.130 
first bird of the day that we took the
winds<00:02:07.790> going<00:02:08.090> left<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.510> right<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.750> little<00:02:08.990> bit

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
winds going left to right a little bit

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.960 
winds going left to right a little bit
about<00:02:09.470> 60<00:02:09.890> yard<00:02:10.100> shot<00:02:10.399> here<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.050> this<00:02:12.050> bird

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
about 60 yard shot here and this bird

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.340 
about 60 yard shot here and this bird
takes<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.620> more<00:02:15.620> solid<00:02:16.190> hit<00:02:19.720> now<00:02:20.720> he<00:02:20.810> flies<00:02:20.990> away

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
takes a more solid hit now he flies away

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.090 
takes a more solid hit now he flies away
there<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.430> pellet<00:02:22.760> actually<00:02:23.180> clipped

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
there but the pellet actually clipped

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.760 
there but the pellet actually clipped
clipped<00:02:25.100> his<00:02:25.280> windpipe<00:02:25.970> not<00:02:26.450> his<00:02:26.630> neck<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.590> on

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770

clipped his windpipe not his neck and on
his<00:02:27.920> spinal<00:02:28.190> cord<00:02:28.430> but<00:02:28.670> his<00:02:28.790> windpipe<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.290> he

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
his spinal cord but his windpipe so he

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.490 
his spinal cord but his windpipe so he
went<00:02:30.590> about<00:02:30.830> 50<00:02:31.610> yards<00:02:31.820> on<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.930> gas<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.410> was

interesting<00:02:58.610> here<00:02:58.970> is<00:02:59.030> watch<00:02:59.330> this<00:02:59.629> he<00:02:59.870> takes

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
interesting here is watch this he takes

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.740 
interesting here is watch this he takes
a<00:03:00.230> step<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.069> left<00:03:01.280> it's<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.269> very<00:03:02.450> subtle

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
a step to the left it's a very subtle

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.250 
a step to the left it's a very subtle
step<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:04.069> had<00:03:04.250> he<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.489> taken<00:03:04.940> that<00:03:05.260> this

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
step but had he not taken that this

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.089 
step but had he not taken that this
pellet<00:03:06.739> would<00:03:07.489> not<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:07.819> impacted<00:03:08.450> him<00:03:08.660> in

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
pellet would not have impacted him in

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.949 
pellet would not have impacted him in
the<00:03:10.099> kill<00:03:10.310> zone<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:11.540> would<00:03:11.690> have<00:03:11.810> actually

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the kill zone it would have actually

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.830 
the kill zone it would have actually
played<00:03:12.410> out<00:03:12.680> more<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:14.000> scenario<00:03:14.540> right

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
played out more like this scenario right

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.729 
played out more like this scenario right

scenario about to play out here you'll
see<00:03:40.129> this<00:03:40.250> shot<00:03:40.489> go<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:42.019> winds<00:03:42.290> picking<00:03:42.500> up<00:03:42.620> a

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
see this shot go the winds picking up a

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.630 
see this shot go the winds picking up a
little<00:03:42.799> bit<00:03:43.040> there<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.280> can<00:03:43.400> see<00:03:43.519> his

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
little bit there you can see his

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.640 
little bit there you can see his
feathers<00:03:43.940> blowing<00:03:44.209> around<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:45.470> watch

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
feathers blowing around and you watch

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.550 
feathers blowing around and you watch
the<00:03:45.829> shot<00:03:46.040> right<00:03:46.280> here

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.680 

it<00:03:49.010> looks<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.640> barely<00:03:50.209> clipped<00:03:50.480> his

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
it looks like it barely clipped his

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.420 
it looks like it barely clipped his
shoulder<00:03:51.140> but<00:03:51.380> he<00:03:51.470> went<00:03:51.680> down<00:03:51.920> like<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.190> ton<00:03:52.400> of

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
shoulder but he went down like a ton of

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.550 
shoulder but he went down like a ton of
bricks<00:03:52.870> now<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.080> is<00:03:54.260> why<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.720> shot<00:03:57.020> enters

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
bricks now this is why the shot enters

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.550 
bricks now this is why the shot enters
the<00:03:57.739> upper<00:03:58.099> left<00:03:58.310> shoulder<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.319> as<00:04:00.319> you<00:04:00.440> can

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
the upper left shoulder and as you can

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.150 
the upper left shoulder and as you can
see<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.860> exit<00:04:01.340> out<00:04:01.520> is<00:04:01.700> back<00:04:02.500> now<00:04:03.500> why<00:04:03.770> this<00:04:03.830> is

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
see it exit out is back now why this is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.949 
see it exit out is back now why this is
so<00:04:04.340> significant<00:04:05.030> is<00:04:05.209> because<00:04:05.269> if<00:04:05.569> we<00:04:05.599> look<00:04:05.840> at

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
so significant is because if we look at

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.410 
so significant is because if we look at
pigeon<00:04:06.319> anatomy<00:04:06.800> here<00:04:07.040> their<00:04:07.730> spinal<00:04:08.060> cord

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
pigeon anatomy here their spinal cord

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.479 
pigeon anatomy here their spinal cord
twists<00:04:08.900> upward<00:04:09.380> against<00:04:09.830> their<00:04:09.980> back<00:04:10.190> along

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
twists upward against their back along

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.970 
twists upward against their back along
with<00:04:10.519> all<00:04:10.819> their<00:04:10.970> vital<00:04:11.269> organs<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:12.830> high

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
with all their vital organs so it's high

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.830 
with all their vital organs so it's high
it's<00:04:13.280> not<00:04:13.459> low<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> area<00:04:14.510> where<00:04:14.720> their

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
it's not low in the area where their

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.349 
it's not low in the area where their
breastplate<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.500> flight<00:04:15.950> muscles<00:04:16.340> are<00:04:16.489> so

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
breastplate and flight muscles are so

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.000 
breastplate and flight muscles are so
that<00:04:17.540> pellet<00:04:17.930> hit<00:04:18.139> this<00:04:18.350> bird<00:04:18.560> right<00:04:18.799> in<00:04:18.919> the
