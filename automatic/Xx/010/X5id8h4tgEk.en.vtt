make<00:01:14.460> me<00:01:14.640> feel<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.030> slightest<00:01:15.600> bit<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
make me feel the slightest bit of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960 
make me feel the slightest bit of
emotion<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.040> guessing<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
emotion so what I'm guessing is is a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
emotion so what I'm guessing is is a
possibility<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> when<00:01:19.380> he<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.920> rare

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
possibility that when he was just rare

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.060 
possibility that when he was just rare
Jesus<00:01:20.880> baby<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.479> some<00:01:21.720> shit<00:01:21.990> maybe<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.920> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Jesus baby or some shit maybe this is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
Jesus baby or some shit maybe this is
where<00:01:23.250> he<00:01:23.400> grew<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.700> or<00:01:23.880> maybe<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> where

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
where he grew up or maybe this is where

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.760 
where he grew up or maybe this is where
he<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.990> informed<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.409> know<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.619> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
he was more informed we know at this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580 
he was more informed we know at this
point<00:01:26.009> maybe<00:01:26.430> he<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.270> soul<00:01:27.570> Kings<00:01:28.049> baby

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
point maybe he was the soul Kings baby

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
point maybe he was the soul Kings baby
and<00:01:28.950> maybe<00:01:29.159> something<00:01:29.460> happened<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and maybe something happened and the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
and maybe something happened and the
hospital<00:01:31.170> feels<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.590> maybe<00:01:32.159> he<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.970> feel

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
hospital feels like maybe he would feel

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.179 
hospital feels like maybe he would feel
a<00:01:33.240> certain<00:01:33.659> weight<00:01:33.900> returning<00:01:34.650> back<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
a certain weight returning back here and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.710 
a certain weight returning back here and
that's<00:01:35.310> why<00:01:35.490> he's<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> fuck

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that's why he's kind of like my the fuck

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.499 
that's why he's kind of like my the fuck
would<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> feel<00:01:37.170> anyway<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.770> Bach<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.700> really

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.880 
would I feel anyway like Bach is really
getting<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.439> especially<00:01:40.530> with

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
getting up there for me especially with

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.530 
getting up there for me especially with
this<00:01:41.100> chapter<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> way<00:01:41.820> he<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.390> like

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this chapter the way he was just like

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.569 
this chapter the way he was just like
standing<00:01:43.259> there<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> boss<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.250> giving<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
standing there like a boss not giving a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.730 
standing there like a boss not giving a
fuck<00:01:44.790> he's<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.590> me

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
fuck he's really going up there for me

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.530 
fuck he's really going up there for me
but<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.640> he<00:01:47.850> said<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.270> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but just the way he said that is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.120 
but just the way he said that is
definitely<00:01:49.020> making<00:01:49.200> me<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:49.560> he<00:01:49.799> has<00:01:49.920> some

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
definitely making me think he has some

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.399 
definitely making me think he has some
huge<00:01:50.520> ties<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> soul<00:01:51.780> palace<00:01:52.229> and

huge ties to the soul palace and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
probably even the soul king and then

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.389 
probably even the soul king and then

Bobby<00:04:20.820> yet<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.060> wonder<00:04:21.239> if<00:04:21.690> Bobby<00:04:21.930> eras

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
Bobby yet I wonder if Bobby eras

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.080 
Bobby yet I wonder if Bobby eras
personality<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:23.160> intact<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.760> oh<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:23.880> mean

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
personality is intact that oh I mean

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.960 
personality is intact that oh I mean
Bobby<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.630> looked<00:04:24.930> pretty<00:04:25.169> much<00:04:25.260> dead<00:04:25.560> there

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
Bobby I looked pretty much dead there

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.850 
Bobby I looked pretty much dead there
last<00:04:26.180> time<00:04:26.390> we<00:04:26.510> saw<00:04:26.690> her<00:04:26.810> she'll<00:04:27.020> be<00:04:27.050> ripped<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
last time we saw her she'll be ripped to

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.680 
last time we saw her she'll be ripped to
shreds<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.430> imagine<00:04:28.730> that's<00:04:29.330> just<00:04:29.570> like<00:04:29.660> a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
shreds so I imagine that's just like a

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.630 
shreds so I imagine that's just like a

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
got fucking one of the zeroes of vision

this himself one of the zeroes arisen
let<00:04:44.660> let's<00:04:44.870> be<00:04:45.050> clear<00:04:45.290> one<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.680> zeros

let let's be clear one of the zeros

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.410 
let let's be clear one of the zeros
emerging<00:04:46.280> which<00:04:46.400> pretty<00:04:46.640> much<00:04:46.730> it<00:04:47.090> seems<00:04:47.300> as

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
emerging which pretty much it seems as

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.510 
emerging which pretty much it seems as
though<00:04:47.570> zero<00:04:48.140> divisions<00:04:48.710> are<00:04:48.890> just<00:04:49.130> beyond

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
zero vision versus do haha and then we

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.700 
zero vision versus do haha and then we
have<00:04:54.770> zombie<00:04:55.280> dude<00:04:55.520> with<00:04:56.180> bambietta<00:04:56.990> zombie
