00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
and I had to be a little resistant on

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.809 
and I had to be a little resistant on
the<00:01:59.689> way<00:01:59.840> down<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.189> had<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.429> push<00:02:01.670> it

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
the way down and and I had to push it

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.719 
the way down and and I had to push it
back<00:02:01.969> up<00:02:02.000> as<00:02:02.360> hard<00:02:02.390> as<00:02:02.719> I<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:04.340> not<00:02:04.399> that

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
back up as hard as I can it's not that

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.590 
back up as hard as I can it's not that
easy<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:06.200> as<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:06.649> see
