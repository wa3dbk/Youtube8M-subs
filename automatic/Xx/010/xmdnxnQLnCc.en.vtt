00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.350
 good kids that you are doing was already a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.750
 time decided that we had efe 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 news and honestly it 's good as well 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.320
 when there is one has more chicha than is 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.309
 what we all want but in the end I do not 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.929
 I want to entertain too much 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.789
 lately I 'm busy as you know if 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.650
 we have enough material and also 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.390
 quite varied and let's start with 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 harlem that I have very abandoned that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.540
 have recently been announced the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.190
 first characteristics of activity 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.630
 with the first dlc we will receive 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.310
 for this game that we still do not know 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.110
 bigger things like map names and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.580
 all those things but if we know 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.260
 some preliminary data like that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.090
 we will be able to enjoy as always 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.440
 four new maps of which two 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 weeks being turns that also 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.550
 will contain new vehicles again 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.350
 announced apart from that it also seems 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.610
 that will get more destruction than the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.410
 truth is that it is a thing that was missing 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 a lot on good base maps in the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.890
 base maps except block that with the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.899
 what was left over there they could have gotten for 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 the rest and we would have been filled with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 awesome destructions of maps 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 but I do not know if you remember outside of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.170
 a couple of videos I told you that one of the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 Key heart lane that has gone to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.440
 is that the dlcs have not been 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.329
 announced fast enough and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920
 I still believe in fact I think that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 trailers should have started doing 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 at least a couple of weeks since 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.570
 we talk about leaving her in this layer 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.820
 visceral fall speaks 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.680
 of this at least about pc where 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.570
 the plummeting has been most remarkable 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920
 in fact since we are in case some do not 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.690
 he knows how much he has fallen in pc 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.760
 While writing this video there are 25 thousand 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.470
 players in battlefield 4 while in 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.970
 hard line does not reach 4000 which I 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 it surprises even me because it is that it is 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.510
 incredible is not that hard line that came out 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.250
 two months ago have five times less 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.830
 players that the 4 that came out 2 years ago 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.960
 is that battlefield 3 that came out almost 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.420
 5 has 12 thousand almost three times 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.070
 players it's really amazing what 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.660
 what has happened with hard line and this does not 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
 I say it because it's pessimistic is that 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.140
 in front of numbers you can not do anything 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.369
 but in the end what we were going the thing is 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.810
 that you saw at last next to the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.610
 problem and they say they will not forget 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.440
 of pci have praised what has done dais 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.060
 with the initiative of the ct that as already 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.500
 you know is something that is very close in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.940
 harlem and that you saw the dawn to employ 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.610
 as a method to rescue the game 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.320
 let's hope they get it and that is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.729
 very curious two months ago I was 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380
 crazy for looking for garden news 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.330
 lately so more interested 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.190
 I am for the 4 that is played by 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.479
 wonder I do not know in the end what he said 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.550
 since they would fix the game it was 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 true to see it would have been grateful to the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.239
 reduce a little bit the wait not much a 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.950
 couple of years nothing but good 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.840
 appreciate that it has been fixed at the end 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.310
 and the best thing seems to be that it's what 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.200
 it comes because the news we have is 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.610
 quite positive the other day davids 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.989
 irlan that will sound to you dao that is a 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.370
 incredible news source and in addition 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.650
 one of the most responsible for the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.060
 TV 4 and ct said the rest of the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.400
 content that they will develop for the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 game will be totally free giving 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.640
 for same premium as not premium and I 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.410
 like most of the community 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.519
 I bought the premium in its day but the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.140
 truth is that it still follows me 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.489
 this movement seems quite good 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.080
 since we are taking advantage and I say that 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.310
 lately it's surprising me a lot 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.930
 what they are doing as they follow 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.640
 fixing the game sticks and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.950
 over extend your life gives me that 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.239
 they will count on me for quite some time and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.860
 too long ago that we 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.780
 we received news from a galaxy very 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.489
 very far away and there are good and bad 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.049
 the good ones are that we have been confirmed 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.610
 finally when we will have our first 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.380
 gameplay batch the bad one is that it will be 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.090
 within a month on June 15 at e3 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.470
 where we can see what has already been 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.269
 confirmed it will not be a continuation 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.620
 of the saga but a complete reboot that 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.450
 I'm looking forward to see how these 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.250
 Christmas other than that they have left 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.170
 pretty mini news about the gameplay 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.489
 he has brought them to us yet but if many 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.440
 are you interested tell me in 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.030
 comments and I try to bring you the o 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.769
 Well, I tell you directly that you 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.019
 I bring that talking about Star Wars 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.460
 do or do not do it but do not try and 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.020
 well these would be all the news 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.700
 we would have for the moment this week I think 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.650
 that by letting more time pass / efe ni 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.390
 bcn leaves everything with a little more than played 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.620
 before saying goodbye I have to tell you 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.820
 that I've been looking at the result of 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.230
 the latest videos and I liked 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.730
 very much to see that dedicating more 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.560
 time each video individually is 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.540
 taking effect I'm glad you are 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.070
 enjoying the most that while I 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.960
 I looked at the comments I noticed 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.940
 that you are very heavy the comment more 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.040
 undoubtedly repeated is that he put the music 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.600
 old and good since we are with 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.490
 I leave a series with music 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.840
 old I do not know is 36 and leave our 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.690
 opinion as I ask in each time 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.980
 news so nothing said this I 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.670
 dismissal 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.670
 goodbye kids
