air<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> give<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> good<00:01:09.600> flame<00:01:09.990> off

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
air we're going to give a good flame off

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.580 
air we're going to give a good flame off
everything<00:01:11.759> sterile<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.320> we're<00:01:13.470> going

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
everything sterile and then we're going

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.680 
everything sterile and then we're going
to<00:01:13.710> open<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.220> our<00:01:14.460> tube<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.420> eight

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
to open up our tube we have eight

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.160 
to open up our tube we have eight
samples<00:01:16.050> 8<00:01:16.530> times<00:01:16.890> 3<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.250> 24<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> does<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
samples 8 times 3 is 24 so it does a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:30.470 
samples 8 times 3 is 24 so it does a
little<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> point<00:01:20.190> for

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.720 

okay<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.440> then<00:01:31.560> there's<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.400> thing<00:01:32.610> is

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
okay and then there's this thing is

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.390 
okay and then there's this thing is
labeled<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.420> ways<00:01:33.630> those<00:01:34.200> counts<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.100> from

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
labeled in two ways those counts up from

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.150 
labeled in two ways those counts up from
that<00:01:35.520> way<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:36.030> then<00:01:36.570> down<00:01:37.050> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> other<00:01:37.830> side

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
that way and then down on the other side

all the walk is gonna go take and that
goes<00:05:57.520> over<00:05:57.790> night<00:05:57.970> and<00:05:58.120> then<00:05:58.990> the<00:06:00.360> CR<00:06:01.360> mixture

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.440 

yeah<00:06:14.190> run<00:06:15.230> colony<00:06:16.230> pcr<00:06:16.380> and<00:06:17.340> we<00:06:17.730> want<00:06:17.940> 1k

program<00:06:18.900> we<00:06:19.050> have<00:06:19.080> a<00:06:19.200> fragment<00:06:19.680> of<00:06:19.710> about

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
program we have a fragment of about

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.710 
program we have a fragment of about
seven<00:06:20.310> hundred<00:06:20.340> base<00:06:20.640> pairs<00:06:20.670> so<00:06:21.450> this<00:06:21.600> will

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
seven hundred base pairs so this will

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.830 
seven hundred base pairs so this will
work<00:06:21.840> for<00:06:21.900> us<00:06:22.140> just<00:06:22.830> put<00:06:23.010> our<00:06:23.130> strips<00:06:23.400> in<00:06:23.550> there

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
work for us just put our strips in there

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.110 
work for us just put our strips in there
close<00:06:24.840> it<00:06:25.080> tighten<00:06:25.890> it<00:06:26.010> and<00:06:27.260> proceed<00:06:28.260> run

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
close it tighten it and proceed run

we're<00:06:30.120> doing<00:06:30.390> tubes<00:06:30.950> 25<00:06:31.950> microliter<00:06:32.430> volume

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
we're doing tubes 25 microliter volume

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.060 
we're doing tubes 25 microliter volume
he<00:06:33.540> did<00:06:33.690> lid<00:06:33.900> yes<00:06:34.230> the<00:06:34.500> reason<00:06:34.740> we<00:06:34.860> use<00:06:34.890> the

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
he did lid yes the reason we use the

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.400 
he did lid yes the reason we use the
heated<00:06:35.370> lid<00:06:35.580> is<00:06:35.760> if<00:06:35.910> we<00:06:36.030> do<00:06:36.180> not<00:06:36.330> then<00:06:36.720> the

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
heated lid is if we do not then the

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.800 
heated lid is if we do not then the
liquid<00:06:37.620> will<00:06:37.980> start<00:06:38.400> to<00:06:38.580> evaporate<00:06:39.120> from<00:06:39.630> the

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
liquid will start to evaporate from the

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.140 
liquid will start to evaporate from the
pool<00:06:40.080> condensed<00:06:41.040> off<00:06:41.220> top<00:06:41.520> and<00:06:41.850> that<00:06:42.000> will

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
pool condensed off top and that will

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.690 
pool condensed off top and that will
throw<00:06:42.360> off<00:06:42.390> the<00:06:42.780> buffering<00:06:43.140> conditions<00:06:43.650> so<00:06:44.280> we

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
throw off the buffering conditions so we

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.100 
throw off the buffering conditions so we
always<00:06:44.850> wanted<00:06:45.180> to<00:06:45.270> he's<00:06:45.420> lid<00:06:45.720> to<00:06:45.870> make<00:06:45.960> sure

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
always wanted to he's lid to make sure

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.450 
always wanted to he's lid to make sure
there's<00:06:46.260> no<00:06:46.380> condensation<00:06:46.740> and<00:06:47.190> all<00:06:47.340> the

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
there's no condensation and all the

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.180 
there's no condensation and all the
liquid<00:06:47.760> stays<00:06:47.970> down<00:06:48.270> and<00:06:48.570> the<00:06:49.320> master<00:06:50.010> mix

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
liquid stays down and the master mix

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.170 
liquid stays down and the master mix
area<00:06:50.520> so<00:06:50.940> he<00:06:51.810> did<00:06:51.960> live<00:06:52.170> yes<00:06:52.740> and<00:06:53.100> then<00:06:53.940> it's

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
area so he did live yes and then it's

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.400 
area so he did live yes and then it's
running<00:06:54.540> right<00:06:54.630> now<00:06:54.690> it<00:06:54.870> will<00:06:55.110> be<00:06:55.200> done<00:06:55.350> in

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
running right now it will be done in

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.340 
running right now it will be done in
about<00:06:55.680> two<00:06:56.040> hours<00:06:56.070> hour<00:06:56.550> 40<00:06:56.940> minutes<00:06:57.000> and<00:06:57.420> what

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
about two hours hour 40 minutes and what

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.720 
about two hours hour 40 minutes and what
this<00:06:58.440> is<00:06:58.500> going<00:06:58.620> to<00:06:58.740> tell<00:06:58.950> us<00:06:58.980> is<00:06:59.340> we're<00:06:59.610> going

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
this is going to tell us is we're going

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.070 
this is going to tell us is we're going
to<00:06:59.820> run<00:07:00.060> this<00:07:00.270> we're<00:07:00.480> going<00:07:00.570> to<00:07:00.630> see<00:07:00.840> a<00:07:00.870> band

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
to run this we're going to see a band

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.290 
to run this we're going to see a band
hook<00:07:01.350> with<00:07:01.530> the<00:07:01.650> right<00:07:01.830> size<00:07:02.070> and<00:07:02.460> then<00:07:03.000> if<00:07:03.180> we

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
hook with the right size and then if we

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.550 
hook with the right size and then if we
see<00:07:03.450> the<00:07:03.570> band<00:07:03.750> of<00:07:03.870> the<00:07:03.900> right<00:07:04.050> size<00:07:04.260> that

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
see the band of the right size that

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.980 
see the band of the right size that
means<00:07:04.800> as<00:07:05.040> a<00:07:05.070> culture<00:07:05.970> and<00:07:06.180> there<00:07:06.390> has<00:07:06.960> a

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
means as a culture and there has a

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.690 
means as a culture and there has a
plasma<00:07:07.590> that<00:07:07.710> has<00:07:07.890> a<00:07:07.920> part<00:07:08.310> that<00:07:08.430> the<00:07:08.550> right

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
plasma that has a part that the right

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.270 
plasma that has a part that the right
size<00:07:08.910> and<00:07:09.240> we<00:07:09.570> can<00:07:09.720> then<00:07:09.870> assume<00:07:10.200> that<00:07:10.650> that<00:07:11.040> is

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
size and we can then assume that that is

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
size and we can then assume that that is
something<00:07:11.460> that<00:07:11.580> we<00:07:11.760> want<00:07:11.940> to<00:07:12.000> look<00:07:12.180> at

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
something that we want to look at

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.210 
something that we want to look at
further<00:07:12.510> will<00:07:13.140> then<00:07:13.290> miniprep<00:07:13.770> it<00:07:13.890> tomorrow

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
further will then miniprep it tomorrow

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.850 
further will then miniprep it tomorrow
eat<00:07:14.940> go<00:07:15.120> BAM<00:07:15.330> it<00:07:15.540> you<00:07:15.720> know<00:07:15.780> map<00:07:16.050> it<00:07:16.290> and<00:07:16.500> then

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
eat go BAM it you know map it and then

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.470 
eat go BAM it you know map it and then
send<00:07:17.040> it<00:07:17.130> off<00:07:17.220> for<00:07:17.280> sequencing<00:07:17.880> but<00:07:18.360> that's

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
send it off for sequencing but that's

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.110 
send it off for sequencing but that's
calling<00:07:18.750> a<00:07:18.780> VCR
