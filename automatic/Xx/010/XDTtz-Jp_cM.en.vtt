00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
getting on with it and fine I think yeah

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.319 
getting on with it and fine I think yeah
no<00:00:36.750> problem<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.380> first<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.969> shape<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
no problem at first because the shape of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
no problem at first because the shape of
the<00:00:39.480> mouthpiece<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.260> slightly<00:00:40.590> different<00:00:41.010> but

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the mouthpiece is slightly different but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
the mouthpiece is slightly different but
I<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:41.520> I've<00:00:41.789> got<00:00:41.940> used<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> now<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:44.719> mean<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
I think I've got used to it now I mean I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.549 
I think I've got used to it now I mean I
don't<00:00:46.559> honestly<00:00:46.859> feel<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.109> any<00:00:49.289> better

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
don't honestly feel you know any better

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.490 
don't honestly feel you know any better
I've<00:00:49.949> not<00:00:50.100> felt<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.430> huge<00:00:51.000> difference<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
I've not felt a huge difference but I

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.340 
I've not felt a huge difference but I
wasn't<00:00:52.739> sure<00:00:52.920> if<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.090> could<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.600> my<00:00:55.019> fault

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
wasn't sure if that could be my fault

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
wasn't sure if that could be my fault
because<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:56.120> occasionally<00:00:57.120> forget<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> use
