00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.920
 Today is the former Olympic team representative from the forest Eat today also Mori Takayujuku athlete project 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.680
 Thank you for visit 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.000
 I think it's a little more up to now, but by putting the video together 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.760
 The image is in 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:34.880
 I think it will be easier to 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:37.360
 If you can check by all means from the perspective that you are conscious of such a place while listening 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 I think 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.400
 I will answer the comments today . 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.190
 so 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 How can I spread out at an angle of how much is when writing also hand but I'm a single sale 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:03.150
 About two when you say the time and the date of the 0:00 of the pull will be different 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:09.330
 How much Kedomo I thing that is better for the front and cormorant is the attitude of the time after class 5 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:14.730
 This way of spreading the hand is as in the case of video distribution, and this is narrow or wide 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 And it is better to give looking for the Tteyuu where the most force to enter rather than a sense of Tteyuu or 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.540
 think 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.140
 For that purpose, if it is one drill, it will not be shot on the day when it is bought 8 days, but only with the face 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.610
 Like this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.869
 There is a place where you won't sink if you move your hands . 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:36.220
 Because the place where it does not sink is the place where the power enters most 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:42.520
 If you go head to head and try to go swimming 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.130
 Decided to say too much high-angle So we will know is that whether narrow or wider spread 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.390
 Because there is not 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.869
 I hope you find something that you have been looking for 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.270
 And also looked at but I know eyes were Mashi Length in the form of about still stream also called forward 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:03.289
 By all means you of in the think whether those who include the good 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.289
 Please by all means make sure I stream line after kicking the kick
