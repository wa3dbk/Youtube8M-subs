00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello friends and youtube friends us 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.580
 we are the sisters of sunset 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.679
 story in our video 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.389
 today we are going to teach how to make clothes 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.569
 for boys and their legal and their stories 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:23.099
 zygotes as saws trainer and if 

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:24.989
 them new purchases if good we are in 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:31.470
 another quarter because it is the fourth of a 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:36.019
 prima see everything pretty that is a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.019
 true fan of a time of adventure 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.530
 and making comics 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.010
 but only that I do not my children 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:58.329
 we need a piece of cloth or some 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 towel or whatever it is 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:08.030
 then if we are now 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.750
 and by the way I'm the one we started 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.900
 we need a little zygote dress 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:20.830
 called money 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.400
 then they place like this so that since they 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.690
 see that it starts from here then they see 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.370
 that you can not open these topics and 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.330
 good here 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.080
 you turn it around so it stays like that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.920
 of brands here with something and now what 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.860
 we did like that with a down and then what 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.380
 remember we already did it so 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.380
 Band-aid was not written 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.290
 then we started we measure your baby 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.510
 on purpose 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.230
 from now on to start recording 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.230
 is 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:17.210
 well then we will win like this 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.000
 and you are going to feel born you 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:24.130
 they highlight when a down or any 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.740
 thing of mark texts you mark the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.150
 circles 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.000
 that are supposed to be where they're going 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.530
 facer al 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.620
 after remembering here it was already cropped 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.889
 In rock 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.540
 on our part because with the nose 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:51.760
 that removes your finger 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 then we better need a bit 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.989
 spring 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.359
 good short soundtracks and there it 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.739
 van is event both beard for the most 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:09.459
 important that so he records he loses it 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.010
 we need the spring we put it like that 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.450
 It left little longer than 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.490
 there is the cloth band 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:30.400
 and we cut it will stay like that 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:32.750
 so then you put it on good 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.650
 you put it here 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.650
 and then the crazy ones is that your feet 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:47.920
 then do not let you sew then 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:53.230
 call some adult take your hand 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.230
 technique then 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.550
 his little arms are passing through here and melinda 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.420

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.700
 shore until you can not can not 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.640
 they lose an older adult and on this side 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.730
 who have to see how far 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.300

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.810
