00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.610
 fine little bar and care too 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:18.929
 there is something like or can 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.929
 separate kenig others do the following 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:34.560
 removed the lock now take one 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:42.430
 sides of the same candy toss cargo 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:52.260
 we twist the same side by side 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:56.650
 the most here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:00.910
 put the lock on as usual rubber 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.490
 aside and leave about 2 years. 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:09.600
 about two threads on this side 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:19.780
 on the contrary, we can even make it flush 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:22.899
 connect together and what we do from here on 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.569
 this dumbbell lock succeeds my 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:30.579
 We start to wind the lock 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.030
 u literally so that about too on 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.020
 two turns he came in later with this office 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.329
 here this way 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:43.329
 this lock is starting to spin 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:47.560
 towards and drawing them together so 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:52.090
 to better fix we take the neck itself 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.779
 and twirled the lock-nut too 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.639
 way once more that for sure 

00:01:54.779 --> 00:02:03.969
 raised hand here and here and same 

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:05.500
 rotation already on pancakes times we 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.149
 happened 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.220
 I have 4 there 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.980
 if you need more length neck 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.980
 can do the following need to do 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.270
 for example, I planted from the anther in the forest 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.500
 imagine that this is an iron pipe 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:33.050
 dress here in the tube 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.290
 a large hole is drilled 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.790
 than the bolt welded to it 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.790
 hole gadget 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.820
 and this bolt will curl 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.739
 and so bolt tighten with 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.830
 on one side, on the other side 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.800
 we get such a long sin not 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.180
 a full-fledged big bar will 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.420
 it's for sure if we want 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:06.519
 use big weights 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:11.660
 way you can do more 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:19.010
 change yuri once again showing here on 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:22.600
 we say sovereign tighten once all 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.600
 we have what 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.200
