00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.859
 all or probably we all know that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.900
 in mini craft there are some discs 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.930
 music that allows you to listen to a song 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.550
 of the game at the time we want 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.929
 these discs are extracted from the clippers 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.179
 when they die at the hands of a skeleton 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.989
 however there is a disc that is 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.039
 completely different the number 11 the 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.050
 reason for being is completely 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 unknown and today there are 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 animations trying to capture in a way 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.979
 audiovisual what may have happened 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 at the time of recording the 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:34.980
 theories on the subject 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.720
 they run rampant in the forums and the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 truth is that there is nothing that sheds light 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.670
 to this issue for now the fact that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.830
 this disc is so dark our 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.960
 its deteriorated appearance but its particular 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.880
 recording that could be inferred that no 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.520
 are more than the last moments of 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.060
 life of someone desperate trying to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060
 survive 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.549
 we go 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.030
 we go 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 or 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.799
 good 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.799
 ah 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.580
 Y 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.800
 have you ever noticed anything strange 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.290
 while you were watching in this game something 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.380
 creepy to be heard there in the distance 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.820
 where there is nothing but darkness the game 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.940
 has a sound section 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.030
 spectacular by hands of cech 418 the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.890
 however no official composer has 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.840
 clarified that creature generates these 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.860
 sounds in half of the cells 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.860
 From the earth 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.170
 the day they confirmed that they are going to put 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.510
 a new mobile to the game we all 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.460
 we were happy that was until we gave ourselves 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.340
 mind that it was the square version of 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.020
 so feared slender man so is a the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.360
 brother is more than a mode based on the 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.610
 history of the original slender man but 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.590
 there is something strange about his behavior 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.230
 can avoid collecting the blocks and in 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.940
 most of them are land, leaving no more 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.910
 hollow in the area taking it to some other 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.520
 place the question is clear where they carry 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.160
 all that land we have verified that the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.900
 end is full of them but you've seen 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.900
 a single piece of land there 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.739
 probably in the mode that most 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.049
 reggae kids has obtained to date 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.599
 that sound so characteristic to many 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.849
 it has caught us by surprise however 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.220
 this creature that does not gender you by mistake 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.900
 has an interesting peculiarity and is 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.659
 which is the only mobile that gives some 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.129
 reason cats are afraid that there will be 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.680
 happened in the past so that these 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.409
 explosive beings have panic to these 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.890
 small and harmless creatures with 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.890
 monkeys that are 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.900
 from here we go into a 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.940
 darker part of the top of this game 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.090
 so friendly specifically in his 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.470
 particular hell so is the net air what 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.380
 that would be the dimension of 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.550
 the underworld has many more hostiles 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.620
 worthy of the worst nightmares 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.840
 desperate is that many of them 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.490
 they will never stop following you until they spill 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.380
 the last drop of blood left of you 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.300
 but in counting on these zombies 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.160
 mutated flying giants that fire 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.260
 fireballs dark skeletons that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.720
 they create curses and even cousins 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.489
 far from the slam although fire and a 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.769
 little bit bigger there is something that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.389
 surpasses all this 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.949
 and is that thinking that there is a block in 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.800
 concrete that could turn around the 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.629
 tortilla in this top fills me with emotion 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.729
 the sauce translated by its name in 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.729
 English sand of souls seems to contain what 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.229
 that his own name indicates souls the 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.330
 form and states that it causes are very 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.129
 particular to begin with is an object 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.620
 very macabre that is not difficult to distinguish 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.870
 between its texture as it simulates faces of 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.430
 agony of suffering or pain as if 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.129
 this block was holding them 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.169
 down there and it's more curious than passing 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.210
 about it your character is affected 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.490
 by the attitude as if something held her 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.930
 be there in that block as if they 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.940
 you'll hold on so you do not get 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.800
 you escape the story after this block 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.810
 It can be very extensive and there are many 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.940
 theories bypassing that the cne the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.220
 Stone rakes full of soul blood 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.520
 sand is for me the darkest object of the 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.520
 game 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.610
 but brain there is not much to say about 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.870
 this subject since everyone knows 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.120
 the existence of this and its 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.800
 corresponding crepe and pasta but not 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.110
 stop being a mystery and a curiosity 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.930
 that even though it's just a myth in 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.360
 the history of the game its authors mo yan 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.880
 they do not stop repeating that they have eliminated it 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.100
 of the game attributing the merit of 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.950
 have eliminated it completely in the code 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.050
 of this means what could have been 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.490
 existed, check it yourself when 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.380
 abras minecraft of the last 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.380
 updates and you'll understand 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.369
 Steve's story creates everything 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.659
 steve heart is not only the 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:59.849
 history behind he can be much more 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.589
 extensive of what you can think for 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.199
 start when we start the world 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:06.989
 we are alone for some strange reason 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.179
 also when we find a village one 

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:12.509
 witch a golem we realize that 

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:15.959
 they are not like us who are another race and 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.549
 I say another race because they are different and 

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:20.039
 even the zombie miracles are 

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:23.069
 different from the rest means this that 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.139
 in minecraft there were two races or more 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.429
 what is the true past of steve and 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.139
 because we are the only ones that we have 

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:30.629
 survived whatever it is that has 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.789
 happened to our colleagues and what 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.919
 it's more curious are the souls of our 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.259
 comrades those who are down there in 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.360
 the hell trapped in those soul 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.929
 sanz leaves your own theory in the 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.929
 comments 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.260
 do not forget that this is a personal top 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.450
 if you liked the video share it a 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.540
 huge hug we are game facts below
