00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.999 
the air aerial you but in any case it's
important<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.810> an<00:01:52.049> idea<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:52.860> your

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
important to have an idea of what your

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679 
important to have an idea of what your
trees<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.399> especially<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:54.030> you've<00:01:54.149> got<00:01:54.360> trees

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
trees are especially if you've got trees

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.340 
trees are especially if you've got trees
that<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.520> pollinators<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.820> other<00:01:56.939> trees<00:01:57.350> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that are pollinators for other trees you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.690 
that are pollinators for other trees you
know<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.560> you've<00:01:58.680> got<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> small<00:01:59.189> small<00:01:59.430> yard

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
know if you've got a small small yard

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
know if you've got a small small yard
yeah<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.270> only<00:02:00.360> paint<00:02:00.630> lady<00:02:00.869> three<00:02:01.200> or

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
yeah if you can only paint lady three or

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.780 
yeah if you can only paint lady three or
four<00:02:01.439> trees<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> plant<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
four trees just to plant these just to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.160 
four trees just to plant these just to
plant<00:02:03.030> things<00:02:03.240> they're<00:02:03.420> self<00:02:03.659> pollinating

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
plant things they're self pollinating

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.270 
plant things they're self pollinating
and<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.409> don't<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> worry<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and you don't have to worry with that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.270 
and you don't have to worry with that
and<00:02:06.170> that's<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.380> did<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.920> planted

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and that's what we did we planted

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
and that's what we did we planted
self-pollinating<00:02:09.090> trees<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:09.660> happens

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
self-pollinating trees but what happens

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.710 
self-pollinating trees but what happens
is<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.560> eventually<00:02:10.800> run<00:02:11.360> out<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.420> self

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
is you eventually run out of self

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820 
is you eventually run out of self
pollinating<00:02:13.230> trees<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
pollinating trees you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.050 
pollinating trees you
want<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> plant<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> same<00:02:14.490> thing<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.000> you

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
want to plant the same thing so you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.700 
want to plant the same thing so you
start<00:02:15.330> planting<00:02:15.660> trees<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.620> need

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
start planting trees that need

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.270 
start planting trees that need
pollinators<00:02:17.210> now<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.270> tags<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.100> come

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
pollinators now the tags have to come

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.280 
pollinators now the tags have to come
off<00:02:20.490> eventually<00:02:20.690> if<00:02:21.690> you're<00:02:21.900> thinking<00:02:22.080> that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
off eventually if you're thinking that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.710 
off eventually if you're thinking that
the<00:02:23.160> solution<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:23.790> never<00:02:24.150> take<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> tags

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the solution is just never take the tags

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.760 
the solution is just never take the tags
off<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.170> not<00:02:25.260> going<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.590> work<00:02:25.620> because

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
off that's not going to work because

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.920 
off that's not going to work because
those<00:02:26.250> tags<00:02:26.580> will<00:02:26.910> eventually<00:02:27.360> cut<00:02:27.570> into<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
those tags will eventually cut into the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.270 
those tags will eventually cut into the
tree<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.320> kill<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.710> or<00:02:28.830> at<00:02:28.890> least<00:02:28.950> kill

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
tree and kill it or at least kill

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.640 
tree and kill it or at least kill
everything<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:29.930> above<00:02:30.930> where<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.170> tag<00:02:31.440> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
everything that's above where the tag is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.180 
everything that's above where the tag is
tied<00:02:31.860> on<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:33.090> goes<00:02:33.330> doubly<00:02:34.170> true<00:02:34.470> for

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
tied on and that goes doubly true for

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
tied on and that goes doubly true for
these<00:02:35.310> stakes<00:02:35.930> when<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.050> buy<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> fruit<00:02:37.440> tree

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
these stakes when you buy a fruit tree

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.740 
these stakes when you buy a fruit tree
it's<00:02:37.800> usually<00:02:38.130> staked<00:02:38.430> up<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.880> those<00:02:39.510> little

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's usually staked up and those little

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.010 
it's usually staked up and those little
straps<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.380> really<00:02:41.040> hard<00:02:41.280> plastic<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.720> i

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
straps are really hard plastic and i

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.140 
straps are really hard plastic and i
have<00:02:43.230> seen<00:02:43.470> trees<00:02:43.710> killed<00:02:44.070> by<00:02:44.640> stakes<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
have seen trees killed by stakes that

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.120 
have seen trees killed by stakes that
were<00:02:45.270> not<00:02:45.420> removed<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.930> time<00:02:45.960> see<00:02:46.920> there's<00:02:47.070> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
were not removed in time see there's a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.000 
were not removed in time see there's a
bunch<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.400> these<00:02:47.490> little<00:02:48.260> metal<00:02:49.260> rods<00:02:49.560> and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
bunch of these little metal rods and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.320 
bunch of these little metal rods and
don't<00:02:50.190> throw<00:02:50.370> any<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.640> away<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.060> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
don't throw any of this away because you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.699 
don't throw any of this away because you
can<00:02:51.480> use<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.690> when<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:51.930> propagate<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.590> own

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
can use it when you propagate your own

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.800 
can use it when you propagate your own
trees<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.120> don't<00:02:54.300> want<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.570> leave<00:02:54.660> them

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
trees but you don't want to leave them

here<00:03:27.920> this<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:29.160> tree<00:03:29.430> here<00:03:30.800> that's<00:03:31.800> a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
here this little tree here that's a

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.060 
here this little tree here that's a
jelly<00:03:32.220> palm<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:33.780> tree<00:03:34.050> would<00:03:34.380> be<00:03:34.530> stomped<00:03:34.980> in

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
jelly palm that tree would be stomped in

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.040 
jelly palm that tree would be stomped in
about<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.340> day<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.060> didn't<00:03:36.269> have<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.390> flag<00:03:36.690> here

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
about a day if I didn't have a flag here

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.290 
about a day if I didn't have a flag here
and<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:38.100> only<00:03:38.190> take<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.519> couple<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.910> weeks<00:03:39.030> for

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
and it only take a couple of weeks for

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.699 
and it only take a couple of weeks for
it<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.420> get<00:03:39.510> run<00:03:39.690> over<00:03:39.720> by<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:40.019> lawn<00:03:40.320> mower<00:03:40.350> so

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
it to get run over by a lawn mower so

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.199 
it to get run over by a lawn mower so
you<00:03:40.800> got<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.100> have<00:03:41.220> things<00:03:41.580> like<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.940> tag

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
you got to have things like this tag

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.479 
you got to have things like this tag
normally<00:03:42.660> if<00:03:42.780> they<00:03:42.900> get<00:03:43.080> tall<00:03:43.890> enough<00:03:44.280> to

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
normally if they get tall enough to

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.509 
normally if they get tall enough to
where<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.880> know<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.420> tree<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:46.320> actually<00:03:47.280> taller

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
where I know the tree is actually taller

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.100 
where I know the tree is actually taller
than<00:03:47.820> what<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.030> ground<00:03:48.269> cover<00:03:48.510> normally<00:03:48.900> gets

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
than what the ground cover normally gets

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.949 
than what the ground cover normally gets
