will Pemble here is where we're at with

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.220 
will Pemble here is where we're at with
the<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> steel<00:00:14.160> cart<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:15.139> when<00:00:16.139> we

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the with the steel cart I just when we

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
the with the steel cart I just when we
left<00:00:16.410> off<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.740> hadn't<00:00:17.010> gotten<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.460> part

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
left off I hadn't gotten this part

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.620 
left off I hadn't gotten this part
connected<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:20.400> whole<00:00:20.580> thing<00:00:20.910> yet<00:00:21.359> this

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
connected to the whole thing yet this

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.210 
connected to the whole thing yet this
front<00:00:21.930> part<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> wheel<00:00:22.470> assembly<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
front part of the wheel assembly and the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.650 
front part of the wheel assembly and the
interesting<00:00:23.820> thing<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.269> front<00:00:24.510> wheel

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
interesting thing about the front wheel

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.650 
interesting thing about the front wheel
assembly<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.470> quick<00:00:25.650> review<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.210> that<00:00:27.210> it

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
assembly just a quick review is that it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.189 
assembly just a quick review is that it
turns<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:29.160> yaws<00:00:29.490> right<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:30.929> around

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
turns it yaws right so it can go around

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.209 
turns it yaws right so it can go around
turns<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> then<00:00:32.369> each<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.620> wheels<00:00:34.620> also

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
turns and then each of the wheels also

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.420 
turns and then each of the wheels also
pitch<00:00:36.170> right<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.800> goes<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
pitch right so that when it goes on to a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.720 
pitch right so that when it goes on to a
hill<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.780> will<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.160> wheel<00:00:41.309> assemblies

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
hill it will the the wheel assemblies

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.310 
hill it will the the wheel assemblies
will<00:00:41.879> react<00:00:42.120> when<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.360> when<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.690> gets<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.170> hill

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
will react when it when it gets a hill

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.540 
will react when it when it gets a hill
and<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> wheels<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.399> stay

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and then that all the wheels will stay

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.279 
and then that all the wheels will stay
connected<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> track<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.780> nicely<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
connected to the track really nicely and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.630 
connected to the track really nicely and
then<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:46.950> cool<00:00:47.160> thing<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
then the really cool thing about the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.920 
then the really cool thing about the
front<00:00:47.910> which<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.210> different<00:00:48.539> from<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> back

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
front which is different from the back

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.580 
front which is different from the back
is<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.710> also<00:00:50.270> rolls<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.379> will

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
is that it also rolls right so this will

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.180 
is that it also rolls right so this will
pitch<00:00:52.920> yaw<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.789> roll<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.230> it'll<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.039> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
pitch yaw and roll so that it'll so that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340 
pitch yaw and roll so that it'll so that
the<00:00:56.309> front<00:00:56.550> wheel<00:00:56.850> has<00:00:57.510> freedom<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.170> movement

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the front wheel has freedom of movement

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.910 
the front wheel has freedom of movement
on<00:00:58.649> all<00:00:58.920> three<00:00:59.430> axes<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> 3d<00:01:01.320> turning

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
on all three axes so it's a 3d turning

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
on all three axes so it's a 3d turning
thing<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.520> crucially<00:01:02.910> important<00:01:03.359> when

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
thing which is crucially important when

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.329 
thing which is crucially important when
you're<00:01:03.690> when<00:01:04.110> you're<00:01:04.260> having<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.159> roller

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you're when you're having a roller

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.380 
you're when you're having a roller
coaster<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.820> where<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> stay

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
coaster thing where it's got to stay

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
coaster thing where it's got to stay
connected<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.290> track<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.799> at<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> same

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
connected to the track and at the same

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.440 
connected to the track and at the same
time<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> has<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.850> super<00:01:09.119> freedom<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
time it has to have super freedom of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.000 
time it has to have super freedom of
movement<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.930> here's<00:01:10.530> where<00:01:10.650> Rhett<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
movement so here's where Rhett I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
movement so here's where Rhett I
connected<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.700> thing<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.479> put

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
connected this thing I just I just put

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
connected this thing I just I just put
it<00:01:12.960> through<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> temporary<00:01:14.130> measure

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it through here as a temporary measure

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
it through here as a temporary measure
and<00:01:15.450> where<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.490> ended<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.860> finding

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and where I ended up with is finding

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
and where I ended up with is finding
that<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:21.060> needs<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.439> lower

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that this needs to be a little bit lower

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
that this needs to be a little bit lower
and<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.250> frame<00:01:23.520> needs<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.150> higher

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and so this frame needs to be up higher

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.149 
and so this frame needs to be up higher
than<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.740> I'm<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
than it was and so I'm going to do a

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310 
than it was and so I'm going to do a
little<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.840> modifications<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.170> my

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
little bit of modifications this was my

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.399 
little bit of modifications this was my
first<00:01:28.729> crack<00:01:29.729> at<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.600> quite<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.290> as

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
first crack at it not quite as good as

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
first crack at it not quite as good as
what<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.799> hope<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.030> gonna<00:01:33.180> build

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
what I would hope and so I'm gonna build

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.399 
what I would hope and so I'm gonna build
a<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:33.930> assembly<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:35.340> out<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:36.380> Steel

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
a little assembly here out of Steel

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.620 
a little assembly here out of Steel
that'll<00:01:38.220> move<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.850> wheels<00:01:39.030> down<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> little

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that'll move the wheels down a little

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.090 
that'll move the wheels down a little
bit<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> frame<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:40.950> bit

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
bit and get the frame up a little bit

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.330 
bit and get the frame up a little bit
higher<00:01:41.280> off<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> track<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> here's<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:47.250> I've

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
higher off the track so here's what I've

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.210 
higher off the track so here's what I've
ended<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> going

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
ended up with for what I think is going

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.249 
ended up with for what I think is going
to<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.460> very<00:01:50.909> nearly<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.540> final<00:01:51.840> version<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to be very nearly the final version of

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.780 
to be very nearly the final version of
the<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.810> bogey<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.790> particular

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the of the the bogey for this particular

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.749 
coaster here's what's going on I've got
my<00:02:03.170> disassembly<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.590> I've<00:02:04.740> built<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
my disassembly that I've built and

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.819 
my disassembly that I've built and
tested<00:02:05.969> its<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.320> strong<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
tested its it's really really strong and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.990 
tested its it's really really strong and
I'm<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:07.979> happy<00:02:08.160> with<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.580> gonna<00:02:08.670> change

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
I'm very happy with it I'm gonna change

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
I'm very happy with it I'm gonna change
that<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.479> with<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> hardened<00:02:10.110> steel<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.679> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
that out with a hardened steel with a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.280 
that out with a hardened steel with a
grade<00:02:10.979> eight<00:02:11.330> bolt<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.840> these<00:02:13.020> kind<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
grade eight bolt see these kind of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.680 
grade eight bolt see these kind of
orange

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
orange

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.000 
orange
one<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.020> these<00:02:14.140> goldish<00:02:14.560> ones<00:02:14.770> those<00:02:14.980> are

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
one of these goldish ones those are

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.340 
one of these goldish ones those are
hardened<00:02:15.370> steel<00:02:15.520> way<00:02:16.000> stronger<00:02:16.390> than<00:02:16.720> these

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
hardened steel way stronger than these

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.260 
hardened steel way stronger than these
just<00:02:17.620> regular<00:02:17.950> steel<00:02:18.160> ones<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.120> I'm<00:02:19.180> gonna

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
just regular steel ones so I'm gonna

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.770 
just regular steel ones so I'm gonna
change<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.750> out<00:02:20.820> but<00:02:21.820> that's<00:02:21.940> pretty<00:02:22.510> strong

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
change that out but that's pretty strong

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.910 
change that out but that's pretty strong
and<00:02:23.020> works<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:24.190> I've<00:02:24.310> got<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:26.320> little

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
and works and then I've got this little

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.790 
and works and then I've got this little
system<00:02:27.340> here<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.870> pretty<00:02:28.870> darn<00:02:29.140> strong<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.650> may

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
system here is pretty darn strong I may

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.010 
system here is pretty darn strong I may
I<00:02:30.040> may<00:02:30.310> run<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.880> bead<00:02:31.090> across<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:31.870> that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
I may run a bead across that so that

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.020 
I may run a bead across that so that
it's<00:02:32.140> even<00:02:32.500> tighter<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.070> then<00:02:33.700> I've<00:02:33.850> got

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
it's even tighter and then I've got

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.910 
it's even tighter and then I've got
these<00:02:34.180> these<00:02:34.870> bronze<00:02:35.310> flange<00:02:37.710> bushings<00:02:38.710> in

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
these these bronze flange bushings in

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.870 
these these bronze flange bushings in
there<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.300> allows<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.400> turn<00:02:42.400> you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
there so that it allows it to turn you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.260 
there so that it allows it to turn you
see<00:02:43.060> how<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.620> turns<00:02:45.810> rolls<00:02:46.810> nicely<00:02:47.680> so

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
see how it it turns rolls nicely so

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.460 
see how it it turns rolls nicely so
that's<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.390> way<00:02:49.480> that's<00:02:49.660> gonna<00:02:49.840> go<00:02:50.020> obviously

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
that's the way that's gonna go obviously

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.780 
that's the way that's gonna go obviously
we'll<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.650> two<00:02:50.950> bolts<00:02:51.280> there<00:02:51.460> we'll<00:02:51.640> have<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
we'll have two bolts there we'll have a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.600 
we'll have two bolts there we'll have a
bolt<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.390> then<00:02:52.660> we'll<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.650> an<00:02:53.740> i<00:02:54.190> lock<00:02:54.430> or<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
bolt and then we'll have an i lock or a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.010 
bolt and then we'll have an i lock or a
locking<00:02:55.030> nut<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.420> then<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.630> top<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.870> that

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
locking nut and then on top of that

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.300 
locking nut and then on top of that
we'll<00:02:56.200> have<00:02:56.290> another<00:02:56.560> nut<00:02:56.740> little<00:02:57.010> will

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
we'll have another nut little will

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.470 
we'll have another nut little will
tighten<00:02:57.610> those<00:02:57.670> things<00:02:57.910> together<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.360> that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
tighten those things together so that

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.080 
tighten those things together so that
that<00:02:58.630> thing<00:02:58.780> won't<00:02:58.900> come<00:02:59.050> loose<00:02:59.320> and<00:03:00.310> that's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that thing won't come loose and that's

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.620 
that thing won't come loose and that's
kind<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.600> that's<00:03:02.560> kind<00:03:02.710> of<00:03:02.920> what<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.220> looks

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
kind of that's kind of what it looks

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.380 
kind of that's kind of what it looks
like<00:03:04.630> I'm<00:03:05.140> gonna<00:03:05.320> see<00:03:05.560> if<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.830> can<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.270> to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
like I'm gonna see if I can get it to

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.910 
like I'm gonna see if I can get it to
