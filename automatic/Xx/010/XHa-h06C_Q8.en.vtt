question the oftentimes will equate fat

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.319

falls<00:02:07.020> back<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.920> major<00:02:08.280> hormone<00:02:08.880> called

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
falls back on one major hormone called

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.440 
falls back on one major hormone called
insulin<00:02:09.680> so<00:02:10.680> when<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.340> take<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.820> fact<00:02:12.150> for

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
insulin so when we take in fact for

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.750 
insulin so when we take in fact for
example<00:02:12.930> endure

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
example endure

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.300 
example endure
there's<00:02:14.299> very<00:02:14.629> little<00:02:14.900> influence<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.739> insulin

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
there's very little influence on insulin

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.729 
there's very little influence on insulin
so<00:02:16.730> our<00:02:16.909> insulin<00:02:17.360> level<00:02:17.659> stays<00:02:17.930> very<00:02:18.230> level

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
so our insulin level stays very level

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.770 
so our insulin level stays very level
and<00:02:18.920> flat<00:02:19.099> which<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.610> what<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:19.939> want<00:02:20.180> when

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
and flat which is what we want when

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.500 
and flat which is what we want when
insulin<00:02:21.230> levels<00:02:21.650> get<00:02:21.860> very<00:02:22.189> very<00:02:22.579> high<00:02:22.849> life

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
insulin levels get very very high life

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.949 
insulin levels get very very high life
with<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:24.110> high<00:02:24.439> carb<00:02:24.799> low<00:02:25.099> fat<00:02:25.129> diet<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.930> body

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
with a high carb low fat diet the body

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.460 
with a high carb low fat diet the body
is<00:02:27.439> told<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:28.010> store<00:02:28.370> fat<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.569> that's<00:02:30.200> what

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
is told to store fat and that's what

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.130 
is told to store fat and that's what
makes<00:02:30.709> us<00:02:30.920> fat<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:32.060> dynamics<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.930> which

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
makes us fat and the dynamics of which

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.229 
makes us fat and the dynamics of which
we're<00:02:33.560> really<00:02:33.769> not<00:02:33.980> understood<00:02:34.519> until<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
we're really not understood until the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.720 
we're really not understood until the
last<00:02:35.450> five<00:02:35.870> or<00:02:36.170> eight<00:02:36.290> years<00:02:36.730> more

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
last five or eight years more

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.750 
last five or eight years more
appreciated<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.079> by<00:02:39.470> eating<00:02:39.680> fat<00:02:40.129> we<00:02:40.370> keep<00:02:40.579> our

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
appreciated so by eating fat we keep our

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.789 
appreciated so by eating fat we keep our
insulin<00:02:41.239> low<00:02:41.420> when<00:02:41.690> insulin<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.170> low<00:02:42.349> it<00:02:42.590> tells

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
insulin low when insulin is low it tells

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.940 
insulin low when insulin is low it tells
the<00:02:43.010> body<00:02:43.189> to<00:02:43.459> burn<00:02:43.640> fat<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.109> dynamic<00:02:45.799> if

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
the body to burn fat so that dynamic if

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.490 
the body to burn fat so that dynamic if
we<00:02:46.129> can<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.340> remember<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.510> important

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
we can just remember that important

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.930 
we can just remember that important
dynamic<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:49.250> our<00:02:49.819> bodies<00:02:50.409> endocrine<00:02:51.409> system

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
dynamic in our bodies endocrine system

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.300 
dynamic in our bodies endocrine system
that's<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.420> way<00:02:53.629> our<00:02:53.959> bodies<00:02:54.349> will<00:02:54.500> stay<00:02:54.799> fit

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
that's the way our bodies will stay fit

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.390 
that's the way our bodies will stay fit
and<00:02:55.510> free<00:02:56.510> from<00:02:56.690> fat<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.290> fat<00:02:57.319> has<00:02:57.829> nothing<00:02:58.250> to

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
and free from fat so fat has nothing to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.879 
and free from fat so fat has nothing to
do<00:02:58.549> with<00:02:58.760> making<00:02:58.940> us<00:02:59.299> fat<00:02:59.540> right<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.349> how

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
do with making us fat right and how

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.680 
do with making us fat right and how
about<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.220> terms<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.670> heart<00:03:01.879> disease<00:03:02.239> people

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
about in terms of heart disease people

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.660 
about in terms of heart disease people
say<00:03:02.930> saturated<00:03:03.650> fat<00:03:03.889> is<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.190> main<00:03:04.400> cause<00:03:04.609> of

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
say saturated fat is the main cause of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.789 
say saturated fat is the main cause of
heart<00:03:05.060> disease<00:03:05.450> yeah<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.319> know<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:06.620> funny

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
heart disease yeah you know it's funny

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.710 
heart disease yeah you know it's funny
when<00:03:07.040> we<00:03:07.190> did<00:03:07.370> research<00:03:07.730> for<00:03:07.790> my<00:03:08.150> book<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.629> we

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
when we did research for my book and we

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.199 
when we did research for my book and we
looked<00:03:08.930> at<00:03:09.139> for<00:03:09.379> example<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.950> Inuit<00:03:10.400> Indians

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
looked at for example the Inuit Indians

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.920 
looked at for example the Inuit Indians
up<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.930> Greenland<00:03:12.709> they<00:03:13.639> blubber<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:14.690> well

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
up in Greenland they blubber and well

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.830 
up in Greenland they blubber and well
and<00:03:15.290> have<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.709> highest<00:03:16.069> saturated<00:03:17.000> fat<00:03:17.480> diet

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
and have the highest saturated fat diet

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.439 
and have the highest saturated fat diet
of<00:03:18.139> almost<00:03:18.829> all<00:03:19.010> peoples<00:03:19.609> in<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:19.910> world<00:03:20.120> and

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
of almost all peoples in the world and

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.839 
of almost all peoples in the world and
had<00:03:20.989> zero<00:03:21.019> incidence<00:03:21.949> of<00:03:22.099> heart<00:03:22.340> disease<00:03:22.819> or

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
had zero incidence of heart disease or

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.390 
had zero incidence of heart disease or
stroke<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.810> then<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.620> took<00:03:24.829> it<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.069> little<00:03:25.220> bit

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
stroke and then we took it a little bit

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.129 
stroke and then we took it a little bit
of<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.579> step<00:03:25.819> further<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.359> looked<00:03:26.629> at<00:03:26.750> animals

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
of a step further we looked at animals

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.050 
of a step further we looked at animals
in<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.379> wild<00:03:27.530> like<00:03:27.859> lions<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:28.489> tigers<00:03:28.519> they

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
in the wild like lions and tigers they

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.479 
in the wild like lions and tigers they
eat<00:03:29.239> saturated<00:03:29.930> fats<00:03:30.220> continually<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.340> there

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
eat saturated fats continually and there

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.990 
eat saturated fats continually and there
are<00:03:31.639> relatively<00:03:32.629> close<00:03:32.959> genetic<00:03:33.790> mammal<00:03:34.790> to

are relatively close genetic mammal to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.129 
are relatively close genetic mammal to

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
to humans they never get heart disease

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.170 
to humans they never get heart disease
it's<00:03:39.139> since<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.799> industrial<00:03:40.370> revolution<00:03:40.489> in

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
it's since the industrial revolution in

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.199 
it's since the industrial revolution in
the<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:42.349> beginnings<00:03:42.769> of<00:03:42.949> the<00:03:43.010> wheats<00:03:43.699> and<00:03:44.090> the

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
the the beginnings of the wheats and the

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.110 
the the beginnings of the wheats and the
flour<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.049> then<00:03:45.139> hence<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.769> sugars<00:03:46.250> that

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
flour and then hence the sugars that

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.650 
flour and then hence the sugars that
really<00:03:47.650> approached<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.980> diet<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.660> peoples

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
really approached the diet of peoples

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.140 
really approached the diet of peoples
where<00:03:51.290> we<00:03:51.470> started<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:52.069> see<00:03:52.099> heart<00:03:52.549> disease<00:03:52.879> so

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
where we started to see heart disease so

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.240 
where we started to see heart disease so
again<00:03:53.449> if<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:53.660> cascade<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.620> events<00:03:54.739> where

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
again if that cascade of events where

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.199 
again if that cascade of events where
starches<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:55.849> sugars<00:03:56.480> play<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.349> major<00:03:57.769> role<00:03:57.980> in

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
starches and sugars play a major role in

it's like aggravating to the blood
vessels<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.760> stirring<00:04:08.150> up<00:04:08.269> inflammation<00:04:08.900> and

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
vessels and stirring up inflammation and

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.379 
vessels and stirring up inflammation and
so<00:04:09.230> for<00:04:09.470> exactly<00:04:09.949> again<00:04:10.549> when<00:04:10.729> insulin<00:04:11.150> is

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
so for exactly again when insulin is

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.899 
so for exactly again when insulin is
high<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.720> other<00:04:12.159> dynamic<00:04:13.159> of<00:04:13.310> insulin<00:04:13.760> is

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
high the other dynamic of insulin is

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.300 
high the other dynamic of insulin is
that<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.239> will<00:04:14.389> allow<00:04:15.079> for<00:04:15.560> increased<00:04:15.769> plaque

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
that it will allow for increased plaque

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.399 
that it will allow for increased plaque
buildup<00:04:16.760> through<00:04:17.120> inflammatory<00:04:17.870> processes

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
buildup through inflammatory processes

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.920 
buildup through inflammatory processes
as<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.889> said<00:04:19.159> through<00:04:19.909> the<00:04:20.060> accumulation<00:04:20.780> of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
as you said through the accumulation of

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.379 
as you said through the accumulation of
fatty<00:04:21.260> particles<00:04:22.039> like<00:04:22.219> triglycerides<00:04:23.090> and

fatty particles like triglycerides and
the<00:04:23.990> l

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
the l

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.050 
the l
which<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.219> detrimental<00:04:26.219> fat<00:04:26.520> right

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
which is the detrimental fat right

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.740 
which is the detrimental fat right
ladies<00:04:27.389> that<00:04:27.870> will<00:04:28.080> allow<00:04:28.349> the<00:04:28.639> these

it's okay to cook in lard I mean what

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.950 
it's okay to cook in lard I mean what
are<00:04:46.889> good<00:04:47.250> sources<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.819> fat<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.509> in<00:04:48.840> addition

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
are good sources of fat and in addition

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.450 
are good sources of fat and in addition
to<00:04:49.229> those<00:04:49.379> that<00:04:49.590> she<00:04:49.770> would<00:04:49.889> recommend<00:04:50.280> a

to those that she would recommend a
great<00:04:50.759> point<00:04:51.030> you're<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.629> issue<00:04:52.080> that<00:04:52.349> we

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
great point you're the issue that we

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.339 
great point you're the issue that we
like<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:53.009> bring<00:04:53.430> up<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:53.789> though<00:04:53.969> and<00:04:54.719> what<00:04:55.169> my

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
like to bring up is though and what my

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.559 
like to bring up is though and what my
book<00:04:55.620> talks<00:04:56.430> about<00:04:56.550> often<00:04:57.029> is<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.180> we<00:04:57.419> want

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
book talks about often is that we want

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.839 
book talks about often is that we want
foods<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.139> be<00:04:58.259> organic<00:04:58.590> we<00:04:58.949> won<00:04:59.129> meats<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.699> be

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
foods to be organic we won meats to be

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.240 
foods to be organic we won meats to be
grass-fed<00:05:00.479> that's<00:05:00.930> very<00:05:01.199> very<00:05:01.469> important<00:05:02.069> yes

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
grass-fed that's very very important yes

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.990 
grass-fed that's very very important yes
so<00:05:02.789> that<00:05:03.150> we<00:05:03.659> don't<00:05:03.779> have<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.110> worry<00:05:04.349> about

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
so that we don't have to worry about

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
so that we don't have to worry about
pesticides<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.300> we<00:05:06.360> don't<00:05:06.449> have<00:05:06.629> to<00:05:06.810> worry

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
pesticides and we don't have to worry

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.499 
pesticides and we don't have to worry
about<00:05:07.250> some<00:05:08.250> of<00:05:08.340> these<00:05:08.430> other<00:05:08.669> chemicals<00:05:09.270> that

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
about some of these other chemicals that

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.719 
about some of these other chemicals that
are<00:05:09.539> really<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> culprit<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.800> causing<00:05:11.580> other

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
are really a culprit to causing other

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.969 
are really a culprit to causing other
issues<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:12.840> if<00:05:12.930> we<00:05:13.080> keep<00:05:13.259> our<00:05:13.500> foods<00:05:13.770> organic

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
issues so if we keep our foods organic

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.369 
issues so if we keep our foods organic
grass-fed<00:05:14.669> meats<00:05:15.300> they're<00:05:15.840> perfectly

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:16.379 
grass-fed meats they're perfectly

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.529 
grass-fed meats they're perfectly
healthy<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:17.219> perfectly<00:05:17.729> natural<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.419> the

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
healthy and perfectly natural and the

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.240 
healthy and perfectly natural and the
body<00:05:18.779> knows<00:05:19.050> how<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.289> assimilate<00:05:19.620> them<00:05:20.039> they

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
body knows how to assimilate them they

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.800 
body knows how to assimilate them they
don't<00:05:20.430> affect<00:05:20.550> insulin<00:05:21.240> they<00:05:21.389> don't<00:05:21.569> raise

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
don't affect insulin they don't raise

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.619

blood<00:05:22.139> sugars<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:23.250> butter<00:05:23.639> for<00:05:23.969> example<00:05:24.479> when

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
blood sugars so butter for example when

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.619 
blood sugars so butter for example when
we<00:05:24.659> did<00:05:24.930> research<00:05:25.289> for<00:05:25.349> my<00:05:25.710> book<00:05:26.389> we<00:05:27.389> found

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
we did research for my book we found

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.619 
we did research for my book we found
that<00:05:27.810> butter<00:05:28.199> actually<00:05:28.979> has<00:05:29.279> a<00:05:29.580> property<00:05:30.539> that

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
that butter actually has a property that

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.140 
that butter actually has a property that
turns<00:05:31.169> off<00:05:31.409> cancer<00:05:31.949> genes<00:05:32.190> that<00:05:32.430> called<00:05:32.669> uncle

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
turns off cancer genes that called uncle

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.469 
turns off cancer genes that called uncle
gene's<00:05:33.419> interesting<00:05:34.379> so<00:05:34.940> we<00:05:35.940> looked<00:05:36.180> into

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
gene's interesting so we looked into

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.740 
gene's interesting so we looked into
that<00:05:36.509> it's<00:05:36.810> quote<00:05:37.020> butyric<00:05:37.500> acid<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:38.550> the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
that it's quote butyric acid and the

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.180 
that it's quote butyric acid and the
fascination<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.289> we<00:05:40.529> were<00:05:40.680> told<00:05:40.919> to

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
fascination of that is we were told to

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.659 
fascination of that is we were told to
use<00:05:41.400> margarine<00:05:42.029> and<00:05:43.400> synthetic<00:05:44.400> button

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
use margarine and synthetic button

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.480 
use margarine and synthetic button
plastic<00:05:45.060> fast<00:05:45.330> years<00:05:46.259> which<00:05:46.620> actually<00:05:47.009> a<00:05:47.250> much

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
plastic fast years which actually a much

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.850 
plastic fast years which actually a much
more<00:05:47.729> detrimental<00:05:48.000> their<00:05:48.629> hydrogenated<00:05:49.529> fats

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
more detrimental their hydrogenated fats

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.760 
more detrimental their hydrogenated fats
trans<00:05:50.099> fats<00:05:50.699> it<00:05:51.389> clearly<00:05:51.750> cause<00:05:51.900> plaque<00:05:52.440> build

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
trans fats it clearly cause plaque build

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.999 
trans fats it clearly cause plaque build
up<00:05:52.919> and<00:05:53.159> cause<00:05:53.330> cancers<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.569> we<00:05:55.349> were<00:05:55.469> told<00:05:55.710> to

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
up and cause cancers and we were told to

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.429 
up and cause cancers and we were told to
avoid<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:57.029> product<00:05:57.629> that<00:05:57.779> actually<00:05:57.960> can

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439 
avoid the product that actually can

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.709 
avoid the product that actually can
prevent<00:05:58.889> cancers<00:05:59.460> in<00:05:59.759> certain<00:06:00.150> cancers<00:06:00.509> so

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
prevent cancers in certain cancers so

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:03.409 
prevent cancers in certain cancers so
gotten<00:06:01.589> so<00:06:01.770> silly<00:06:02.039> over<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> last<00:06:02.759> 30<00:06:03.089> 40

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
gotten so silly over the last 30 40

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.749 
gotten so silly over the last 30 40
years<00:06:03.719> but<00:06:03.779> thankfully<00:06:04.620> science<00:06:05.129> is<00:06:05.279> starting

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
years but thankfully science is starting

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.719 
years but thankfully science is starting
to<00:06:05.909> evolve<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.449> starting<00:06:06.990> to<00:06:07.139> see<00:06:07.379> the

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
to evolve and starting to see the

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.279 
to evolve and starting to see the
importance<00:06:08.729> of<00:06:08.879> fats<00:06:09.180> well<00:06:09.900> thank<00:06:10.169> goodness

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
importance of fats well thank goodness

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.290 
importance of fats well thank goodness
for<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:10.710> but<00:06:11.009> I<00:06:11.039> think<00:06:11.310> another<00:06:11.520> problem<00:06:12.060> too

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
for that but I think another problem too

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.059 
for that but I think another problem too
is<00:06:12.539> that<00:06:12.779> a<00:06:13.050> lot<00:06:13.409> of<00:06:13.500> times<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.889> food

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 
is that a lot of times the food

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.219 
is that a lot of times the food
companies<00:06:14.520> will<00:06:14.819> market<00:06:15.300> their<00:06:15.539> products<00:06:16.110> in

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
companies will market their products in

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.019 
companies will market their products in
a<00:06:16.620> certain<00:06:16.860> way<00:06:17.009> to<00:06:17.189> make<00:06:17.520> them<00:06:17.669> appear

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:18.029 
a certain way to make them appear

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.749 
a certain way to make them appear
healthy<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.830> people<00:06:19.830> really<00:06:20.430> don't

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
healthy and people really don't

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.760 
healthy and people really don't
understand<00:06:21.360> what<00:06:21.509> to<00:06:21.629> buy<00:06:21.779> anymore<00:06:22.080> they<00:06:22.710> see

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
understand what to buy anymore they see

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.679 
understand what to buy anymore they see
your<00:06:23.250> heart<00:06:23.580> healthy<00:06:24.000> on<00:06:24.150> a<00:06:24.180> package<00:06:24.449> of

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:24.689 
your heart healthy on a package of

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.110 
your heart healthy on a package of
margarine<00:06:25.080> and<00:06:25.319> they<00:06:26.250> believe<00:06:26.819> what<00:06:26.969> they<00:06:27.060> see

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
margarine and they believe what they see

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.450 
margarine and they believe what they see
on<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.479> label<00:06:27.779> right<00:06:28.139> you<00:06:28.349> know<00:06:28.500> so<00:06:28.740> I'm<00:06:28.979> glad

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
on the label right you know so I'm glad

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.980 
on the label right you know so I'm glad
the<00:06:29.610> science<00:06:29.939> is<00:06:30.060> catching<00:06:30.449> up<00:06:30.539> and<00:06:30.750> I<00:06:30.779> think

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
the science is catching up and I think

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.480 
the science is catching up and I think
we<00:06:31.110> need<00:06:31.229> really<00:06:31.770> need<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:32.039> get<00:06:32.129> out<00:06:32.279> there<00:06:32.430> and

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
we need really need to get out there and

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.329 
we need really need to get out there and
educate<00:06:32.909> the<00:06:33.029> people<00:06:33.149> more<00:06:33.539> and<00:06:33.659> more<00:06:34.159> as<00:06:35.159> you

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:35.339 
educate the people more and more as you

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.490 
educate the people more and more as you
mentioned<00:06:35.940> they'll<00:06:36.060> have<00:06:36.300> heart-healthy<00:06:37.020> on

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.320 

I<00:06:40.500> mean<00:06:40.710> the<00:06:41.010> whole<00:06:41.160> system<00:06:41.460> really<00:06:41.850> has<00:06:42.030> to<00:06:42.060> be

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
I mean the whole system really has to be

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.480 
I mean the whole system really has to be
revamp<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:42.990> science<00:06:43.410> behind<00:06:43.590> it<00:06:43.980> really<00:06:44.310> is

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
revamp the science behind it really is

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.700 
revamp the science behind it really is
there<00:06:45.030> you're<00:06:45.630> right<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.080> problem<00:06:46.500> is<00:06:46.560> the

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
there you're right the problem is the

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.950 
there you're right the problem is the
major<00:06:46.950> food<00:06:47.250> industries<00:06:47.820> will<00:06:48.420> not<00:06:48.660> back<00:06:48.930> down

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
major food industries will not back down

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.230 
major food industries will not back down
they<00:06:49.530> sell<00:06:49.800> too<00:06:50.010> many<00:06:50.160> products<00:06:50.670> because<00:06:51.030> of

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
they sell too many products because of

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.330 
they sell too many products because of
that<00:06:51.390> heart-healthy<00:06:51.930> Sam<00:06:52.230> right<00:06:52.800> and<00:06:53.070> they're

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
that heart-healthy Sam right and they're

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.790 
that heart-healthy Sam right and they're
also<00:06:53.520> ingredients<00:06:54.300> in<00:06:54.420> foods<00:06:54.660> that<00:06:54.930> make<00:06:55.560> them

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
also ingredients in foods that make them

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.310 
also ingredients in foods that make them
addictive<00:06:56.490> so<00:06:56.880> that<00:06:57.120> you<00:06:57.720> continually

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
addictive so that you continually

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.140 
addictive so that you continually
craving<00:06:58.890> these<00:06:59.040> foods<00:06:59.370> but<00:06:59.580> it's<00:06:59.820> wise

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
craving these foods but it's wise

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.960 
craving these foods but it's wise
society's<00:07:00.900> gotten<00:07:01.230> so<00:07:01.410> heavy<00:07:01.620> so<00:07:02.370> sick<00:07:02.730> over

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
society's gotten so heavy so sick over

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.000 
society's gotten so heavy so sick over
the<00:07:03.150> last<00:07:03.330> 40<00:07:03.720> years<00:07:03.890> absolutely<00:07:04.890> absolutely

mint in a little while ago that you know

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.770 
mint in a little while ago that you know
these<00:07:08.370> these<00:07:08.430> carbs<00:07:09.150> and<00:07:09.300> so<00:07:09.420> forth<00:07:09.660> are

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
these these carbs and so forth are

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.480 
these these carbs and so forth are
addictive<00:07:10.230> but<00:07:10.320> at<00:07:10.440> the<00:07:10.530> same<00:07:10.740> time<00:07:11.010> the<00:07:11.250> fans

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
addictive but at the same time the fans

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.200 
addictive but at the same time the fans
also<00:07:11.850> help<00:07:12.510> increase<00:07:13.500> say<00:07:13.830> shitty<00:07:14.190> so<00:07:14.820> you

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
also help increase say shitty so you

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.790 
also help increase say shitty so you
know<00:07:15.300> not<00:07:15.420> only<00:07:15.480> do<00:07:15.810> they<00:07:15.930> not<00:07:15.960> pack<00:07:16.380> the<00:07:16.590> fat

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
know not only do they not pack the fat

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.320 
know not only do they not pack the fat
on<00:07:16.980> you<00:07:17.160> but<00:07:17.310> they<00:07:17.430> also<00:07:17.580> make<00:07:17.970> you<00:07:18.090> feel

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
on you but they also make you feel

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.420 
on you but they also make you feel
fuller<00:07:18.690> faster<00:07:19.320> and<00:07:19.500> you<00:07:19.890> actually<00:07:20.220> stay

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
fuller faster and you actually stay

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.860 
fuller faster and you actually stay
fuller<00:07:20.670> is<00:07:20.790> that<00:07:20.940> that's<00:07:21.150> exactly<00:07:21.750> correct

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
fuller is that that's exactly correct

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.200 
fuller is that that's exactly correct
right<00:07:22.410> so<00:07:22.740> you<00:07:23.070> know<00:07:23.190> in<00:07:23.340> my<00:07:23.520> fight<00:07:23.850> back<00:07:24.060> with

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
right so you know in my fight back with

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.330 
right so you know in my fight back with
that<00:07:24.360> but<00:07:24.570> we<00:07:24.780> advocate<00:07:25.350> having<00:07:25.740> for<00:07:25.890> example

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
that but we advocate having for example

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.460 
that but we advocate having for example
eggs<00:07:26.580> and<00:07:26.970> cheese<00:07:27.270> or<00:07:27.570> nice<00:07:27.750> egg<00:07:28.080> and<00:07:28.290> cheese

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
eggs and cheese or nice egg and cheese

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.590 
eggs and cheese or nice egg and cheese
omelet<00:07:28.920> and<00:07:29.100> by<00:07:29.580> having<00:07:29.820> that<00:07:29.970> in<00:07:30.150> the<00:07:30.210> morning

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.600 
omelet and by having that in the morning

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.480 
omelet and by having that in the morning
as<00:07:30.780> for<00:07:31.110> breakfast<00:07:31.590> you'll<00:07:31.770> feel<00:07:32.160> so

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
as for breakfast you'll feel so

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.850 
as for breakfast you'll feel so
satisfied<00:07:32.940> that<00:07:33.780> you'll<00:07:33.930> tend<00:07:34.260> not<00:07:34.320> to<00:07:34.620> have<00:07:34.830> a

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
satisfied that you'll tend not to have a

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.550 
satisfied that you'll tend not to have a
big<00:07:35.220> lunch<00:07:35.520> your<00:07:36.180> lunch<00:07:36.210> will<00:07:36.690> be<00:07:36.810> also<00:07:37.020> laden

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
big lunch your lunch will be also laden

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.090 
big lunch your lunch will be also laden
with<00:07:37.740> good<00:07:38.070> fats<00:07:38.310> and<00:07:39.350> proteins<00:07:40.350> and<00:07:40.680> your

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.100 
with good fats and proteins and your

with good fats and proteins and your
leet<00:07:41.280> lighter<00:07:41.550> and<00:07:41.820> the<00:07:41.910> same<00:07:42.120> thing<00:07:42.330> for

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:42.510 
leet lighter and the same thing for

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.510 
leet lighter and the same thing for
dinner<00:07:42.660> and<00:07:43.350> and<00:07:43.650> you're<00:07:43.920> absolutely<00:07:44.070> right

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 
dinner and and you're absolutely right

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.330 
dinner and and you're absolutely right
that's<00:07:44.820> the<00:07:45.000> other<00:07:45.240> major<00:07:45.680> plus<00:07:46.680> to<00:07:46.980> having<00:07:47.310> a

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 
that's the other major plus to having a

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:55.950
