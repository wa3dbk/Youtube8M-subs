00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
do little stuff like I play with those

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.050 
do little stuff like I play with those
yes<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.299> did<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:43.290> wanted<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> easy<00:01:44.490> bake<00:01:44.850> oven

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
yes you did I wanted the easy bake oven

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.520 
yes you did I wanted the easy bake oven
but<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> course<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.170> childhood

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
but of course if you have a childhood

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.350 
but of course if you have a childhood
data<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.250> doesn't<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.549> means<00:01:47.820> they're<00:01:48.090> gay

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
data that doesn't that means they're gay

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.499 
data that doesn't that means they're gay
but<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> definitely<00:01:50.579> fits<00:01:51.210> them

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
but I think that it definitely fits them

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.520 
but I think that it definitely fits them
in<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.170> mould<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.770> outside<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.530> gender

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
in a mould it's outside of the gender

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.450 
in a mould it's outside of the gender
norms<00:01:55.860> for

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
norms for

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.710 
norms for
if<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:57.000> girl<00:01:57.090> who<00:01:57.360> likes<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
if you have a little girl who likes to

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.149 
if you have a little girl who likes to
play<00:01:57.900> with<00:01:57.930> truck<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.680> doesn't<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.979> mean

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
play with truck that doesn't that mean

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.469 
play with truck that doesn't that mean
this<00:01:59.310> year's<00:01:59.549> game<00:01:59.790> but<00:01:59.970> that's<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.240> outside

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
this year's game but that's just outside

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.060 
this year's game but that's just outside
of<00:02:00.690> agenda<00:02:01.140> knowing<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.530> can't<00:02:01.830> judge

engage<00:03:36.150> else<00:03:36.450> well<00:03:37.350> i<00:03:37.380> was<00:03:37.829> thinking<00:03:37.890> about

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
engage else well i was thinking about

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.160 
engage else well i was thinking about
this<00:03:38.730> when<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.180> asked<00:03:39.390> me<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> question<00:03:39.870> I

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
this when you asked me a question I

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.349 
this when you asked me a question I
guess<00:03:40.380> it's<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> parent<00:03:41.519> they<00:03:41.700> have

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
guess it's just like a parent they have

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.449 
guess it's just like a parent they have
triplets<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:43.290> quite<00:03:43.709> ruthless<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.310> then

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
triplets are quite ruthless and then

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.280 
triplets are quite ruthless and then
that<00:03:44.640> prepare<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.209> many<00:03:45.450> kids<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.170> they
