00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
shot goes in then I'm always going to be

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.479 
shot goes in then I'm always going to be
skeptical<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.530> question<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.159> guys<00:01:05.280> is

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
skeptical but my question to you guys is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.950 
skeptical but my question to you guys is
this<00:01:05.850> why<00:01:06.720> would<00:01:07.080> David<00:01:07.439> Stern<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> NBA

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
this why would David Stern and the NBA

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.710 
this why would David Stern and the NBA
lower<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.350> salary<00:01:10.830> cap<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.950> how<00:01:14.820> much<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
lower the salary cap to how much is it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.719 
lower the salary cap to how much is it
5050<00:01:16.530> seven<00:01:16.890> mil<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:20.400> next

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
5050 seven mil I think for the next

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.810 
5050 seven mil I think for the next
upcoming<00:01:20.909> years<00:01:21.509> starting<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.400> what

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
upcoming years starting on and so what

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.390 
upcoming years starting on and so what
is<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.770> 2010<00:01:25.770> 2011<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.360> much<00:01:28.400> next

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
is it 2010 2011 so pretty much next

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
is it 2010 2011 so pretty much next
season<00:01:29.610> why<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.930> lowering<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
season why would they be lowering the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.100 
season why would they be lowering the
salary<00:01:32.009> cap<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.490> anything<00:01:33.390> shouldn't<00:01:33.930> they

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
salary cap if anything shouldn't they

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.649 
salary cap if anything shouldn't they
increase<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.890> wouldn't<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.790> allow<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> good

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
increase it wouldn't that allow the good

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
increase it wouldn't that allow the good
teams<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.950> they<00:01:38.250> can

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
teams to get better because they can

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
teams to get better because they can
stop<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.299> stockpile<00:01:40.110> talent<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
stop a stockpile talent and not have to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.460 
stop a stockpile talent and not have to
necessarily<00:01:43.170> worry<00:01:43.829> about<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.369> luxury<00:01:44.790> tax

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
necessarily worry about the luxury tax

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.050 
necessarily worry about the luxury tax
but<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:47.130> down<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.700> I'll<00:01:47.790> tell<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
but it's going down and I'll tell you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.000 
but it's going down and I'll tell you
why<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.810> down<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.860> down

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
why it's going down it's going down

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.400 
why it's going down it's going down
because<00:01:51.400> David<00:01:51.910> Stern<00:01:52.180> does<00:01:52.540> not<00:01:52.750> want<00:01:53.050> any

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
because David Stern does not want any

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.040 
because David Stern does not want any
team<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.190> go<00:01:54.310> under<00:01:54.700> he<00:01:55.240> doesn't<00:01:55.600> want<00:01:55.750> teams

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
team to go under he doesn't want teams

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.050 
team to go under he doesn't want teams
to<00:01:56.290> operate<00:01:56.710> in<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.950> red<00:01:57.160> I<00:01:57.430> don't<00:01:57.880> know<00:01:57.970> if

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
to operate in the red I don't know if

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.420 
to operate in the red I don't know if
you<00:01:58.120> guys<00:01:58.240> have<00:01:58.450> heard<00:01:58.540> but<00:01:59.190> I've<00:02:00.190> heard

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
you guys have heard but I've heard

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.230 
you guys have heard but I've heard
reports<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.360> Utah<00:02:01.870> Jazz<00:02:01.900> are

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
reports that the Utah Jazz are

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.490 
reports that the Utah Jazz are
supposedly<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.900> have<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.140> take<00:02:05.290> out<00:02:05.470> a

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
supposedly going to have to take out a

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.280 
supposedly going to have to take out a
loan<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:06.420> pretty<00:02:07.420> much<00:02:07.570> finance<00:02:08.080> their

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
loan to pretty much finance their

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.710 
loan to pretty much finance their
payroll<00:02:08.790> which<00:02:09.790> you<00:02:10.030> know<00:02:10.119> I've<00:02:10.270> never<00:02:10.450> heard

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
payroll which you know I've never heard

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.180 
payroll which you know I've never heard
of<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.690> have<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.900> lot<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.170> smaller<00:02:14.680> market

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
of so you have a lot of smaller market

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.940 
of so you have a lot of smaller market
teams<00:02:15.490> who<00:02:16.420> are<00:02:16.450> hit<00:02:16.810> hard<00:02:17.170> by<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.680> recession

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
teams who are hit hard by the recession
