it's too close line sitting right about
in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> middle<00:00:44.160> where<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
in the middle where we want it but to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.520 
in the middle where we want it but to
move<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> away<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:48.210> actually<00:00:48.450> tighten<00:00:49.200> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
sprocket tension it's going to be a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
sprocket tension it's going to be a
little<00:01:08.460> hard<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> show<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.750> essentially

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
little hard to show you but essentially

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.420 
little hard to show you but essentially
what<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> want<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> spin<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.369> wheels

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
what you want to do is spin your wheels

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.080 
what you want to do is spin your wheels
in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.880> highest<00:01:12.119> gear<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.860> see<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.850> chain

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
in the highest gear and see if the chain

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.609 
in the highest gear and see if the chain
looks<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> wants<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.810> slip<00:01:16.110> off<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
looks like it wants to slip off into the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.330 
looks like it wants to slip off into the
axle<00:01:17.060> if<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.740> you'll<00:01:19.740> want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> tighten

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
axle if it does you'll want to tighten

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
axle if it does you'll want to tighten
the<00:01:20.909> h<00:01:21.030> screw<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> looks<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.890> it's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the h screw and if it looks like it's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.249 
the h screw and if it looks like it's
trying<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.580> slip<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> higher<00:01:24.780> gear<00:01:24.810> or

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
trying to slip up into a higher gear or

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.870 
trying to slip up into a higher gear or
rubbing<00:01:25.770> against<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> different<00:01:26.430> sprocket

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
rubbing against the different sprocket

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.370 
rubbing against the different sprocket
you'll<00:01:27.689> loosen<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.029 

so<00:01:31.960> now<00:01:32.960> we've<00:01:33.170> got<00:01:33.320> our<00:01:33.350> age<00:01:33.590> screw<00:01:33.860> under

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
so now we've got our age screw under

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.690 
so now we've got our age screw under
control<00:01:35.320> move<00:01:36.320> on<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.710> else<00:01:36.829> group<00:01:37.159> when

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
control move on to the else group when

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.670 
control move on to the else group when
you're<00:01:37.850> looking<00:01:37.939> at<00:01:38.180> your<00:01:38.329> high<00:01:38.450> gear<00:01:38.689> it

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
you're looking at your high gear it

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.460 
you're looking at your high gear it
looks<00:01:39.890> like<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.939> wants<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.299> move<00:01:41.539> up<00:01:41.810> into<00:01:42.079> the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
looks like it wants to move up into the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.100 
looks like it wants to move up into the
spokes<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.970> want<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.210> tighten<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.689> L<00:01:44.810> screw

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
spokes you want to tighten the L screw

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.800 
spokes you want to tighten the L screw
and<00:01:45.729> if<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.850> looks<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.270> wants<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.570> slip

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
and if it looks like it wants to slip

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.929 
and if it looks like it wants to slip
down<00:01:47.840> into<00:01:48.259> another<00:01:48.530> gear<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:49.610> want<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.819> go

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
down into another gear you want to go

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.649 
down into another gear you want to go
ahead<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.270> loosen<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:51.729> well<00:01:52.729> that's<00:01:53.360> about<00:01:53.509> it

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
ahead and loosen it well that's about it
