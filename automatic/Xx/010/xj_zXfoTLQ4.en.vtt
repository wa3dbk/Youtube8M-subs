00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.660
 regular show or use more in Latin America 

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.640
 it's a cleverly fun 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.350
 where a couple of crazy friends a 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.269
 raccoon named ricky and a blue bird 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.890
 burning mordecai seek to solve the 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.510
 most absurd way and with very good humor 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.039
 the problems and situations that are 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.780
 present in your job as gardeners 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.670
 in a park with a great animation 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.529
 excellent character designs and a 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.820
 pretty sincere and incoherent humor the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.680
 became an excellent series of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.090
 humor so today I bring you 12 data 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.090
 curious that maybe you did not know 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.660
 even though the series has elapsed 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.700
 between 2008 and the current year 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.230
 the movies are usually seen in vhs and the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 video games in cassettes or cartridges 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.810
 this tells us that maybe the series 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.510
 It takes place in the 80s 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.100
 the creator of the series jake winter was 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.870
 very fond of video games is for 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.130
 what rick vi mordecai appear 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.960
 playing in several episodes of the series 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.700
 in addition the video console that appears 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.680
 it is often similar to sega 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.450
 master system and in the episode I 'll go 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.620
 against the TV the game seems 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.620
 be a double dragon parody 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.700
 in the episode that there is governor when 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.350
 Ricky gets up after his nightmare 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.909
 Ortega and he says he dreams you're tough 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.650
 like rocky in reference to rocky balboa 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.479
 in Spain that change the dialogue 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.640
 probably because of the high cost I buy 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 Wright in Spain and Mordecai said he dreams 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 that you are a macho or something similar 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.929
 to celebrate having obtained a 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.090
 million fans on facebook page 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.219
 has been uploaded promotional in format 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.659
 live action with eighties touches where 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.280
 you sing the song of bite and rick 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.390
 tonight beach party with all the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.369
 characters of the show in general 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.600
 starred by real actors this 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.710
 is another clue that the series is 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.710
 develops in the 80s 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.369
 aylin is the animal character of all 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.320
 regular show with more human similarities 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.280
 what makes you think that one of your parents 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.659
 It was human and the other a love mole 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.310
 initially it was thought that 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.110
 margaret would go naked like ricky and 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.030
 mordecai but since she is a girl she 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.860
 discarded the idea why margaret 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.960
 always wearing clothes 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.240
 mordecai is much bigger than rick vi 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.890
 even though a blue lease is from 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.740
 size of a cup of coffee and a raccoon 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.300
 it's little more than the size of a cat many 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.040
 of the situations expressed in the series 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.370
 are inspired by experiences of one's own 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.440
 Author 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.880
 gates and clinton both of their times 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.190
 as a student as in some stages 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.590
 of his works that as he said no 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.150
 They were very nice if the video liked you 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.930
 I like it and share it in your networks 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.550
