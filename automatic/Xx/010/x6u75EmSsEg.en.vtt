00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.040 
been an inspiration to me just because
of<00:01:34.410> his<00:01:34.590> quickness<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.759> tried<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.149> I<00:01:36.479> tried

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
of his quickness and I tried to I tried

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.109 
of his quickness and I tried to I tried
a<00:01:37.080> lot<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.470> game<00:01:37.649> off<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.160> just<00:01:38.580> how

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
a lot of my game off of is just how

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
a lot of my game off of is just how
explosive<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.750> than<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.440> definitely

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
explosive is than that I definitely

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.529 
explosive is than that I definitely
think<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.550> balance<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.119> training<00:01:42.300> is

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
think the balance in your training is

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.060 
think the balance in your training is
very<00:01:42.720> important<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.410> you're<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> gym

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
very important if you're just in the gym

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
very important if you're just in the gym
everyday<00:01:44.399> work<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.690> going<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
everyday work you know it's not going to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.270 
everyday work you know it's not going to
get<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.170> very<00:01:46.200> far<00:01:46.410> because<00:01:46.800> you're<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.190> on

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
get you very far because you're all on

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.800 
get you very far because you're all on
ice<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.789> going<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.090> downhill<00:01:48.330> you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
ice is just going to go downhill you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.999 
ice is just going to go downhill you
need<00:01:48.929> to<00:01:49.020> balance<00:01:49.200> those<00:01:49.470> things<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.890> your

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
need to balance those things in your

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
need to balance those things in your
game<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.789> believe<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.450> getting<00:01:51.690> into

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
game so I believe that getting into

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.570 
game so I believe that getting into
world<00:01:52.259> throw<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.440> couple<00:01:52.679> times<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.070> week<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
world throw a couple times a week and

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.430

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
working out a couple times a week as

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.929 
working out a couple times a week as
well<00:01:55.470> as<00:01:55.649> working<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:56.039> your<00:01:56.190> flexibility<00:01:56.820> and

well as working out your flexibility and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.910 
well as working out your flexibility and
your<00:01:57.090> mental<00:01:57.509> game<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.770> those

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
your mental game if you have all those

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
your mental game if you have all those
balanced<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.549> then<00:01:59.850> you're<00:02:00.180> gonna<00:02:00.270> be
