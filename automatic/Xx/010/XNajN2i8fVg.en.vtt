00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
of the equipment you get the gameplay is

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.029 
of the equipment you get the gameplay is
the<00:01:39.479> same<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.840> macro<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.350> vengeance<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:40.920> with

the same as macro for vengeance but with

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.410 
the same as macro for vengeance but with
alterations<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.609> the<00:01:41.729> strategic<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
alterations to the strategic and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
alterations to the strategic and
logistical<00:01:42.899> side<00:01:43.079> namely<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.219> don't<00:01:44.429> need<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
logistical side namely you don't need to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.010 
logistical side namely you don't need to
rely<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.850> Salvage<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.479> by<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.780> mean

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
rely on Salvage and by that I mean

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.480 
rely on Salvage and by that I mean
random<00:01:46.350> dice<00:01:46.530> rolls<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.950> summon<00:01:47.219> what<00:01:47.340> stuff

you<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.670> after<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.969> mission<00:01:48.149> since<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.960> can

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you get after a mission since you can

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.349 
you get after a mission since you can
now<00:01:49.140> buy<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> sell<00:01:49.950> gear<00:01:50.249> plus<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.999> also<00:01:51.179> need

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
now buy and sell gear plus you also need

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.330 
now buy and sell gear plus you also need
to<00:01:51.390> manage<00:01:51.570> finances<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.499> that<00:01:52.679> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

on<00:01:53.520> its<00:01:53.640> own<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.119> helps<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.600> game<00:01:54.840> but

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
on its own really helps the game but

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660 
on its own really helps the game but
your<00:01:55.140> new<00:01:55.259> more<00:01:55.499> options<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.859> customize<00:01:56.009> while

issues aside from that you also have a

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.249 
issues aside from that you also have a
choice<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.179> which<00:02:06.299> operations<00:02:06.810> are<00:02:06.899> take<00:02:07.079> of

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460
