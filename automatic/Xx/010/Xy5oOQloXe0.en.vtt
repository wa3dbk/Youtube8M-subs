00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.560
 the first of October 1908 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.550
 and thanks to the vision of sherry board appeared the forum model t 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.249
 the car that put the world on wheels 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.769
 efficiency achieved through a revolutionary production system 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.579
 allowed the model to be sold at such a low price that no other 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.339
 vehicle could reach 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.550
 this mass production process 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.239
 achieved through the mobile assembly line 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.349
 created an industrial revolution 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.440
 allowing for motor campaign 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.610
 produce year after year the sale price of tea 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.980
 in 1908 the first model that sold $ 825 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.100
 in 1925 he sold it only 260 2 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.910
 also 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.360
 the model ted responsible for establishing in the ford plant 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.410
 a revolutionary minimum wage for the time 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.410
 and the work day of eight hours daily 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.910
 the five dollars for a day of work in the Ford factory 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.680
 in 1914 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.070
 practice that then was influencing the other industries 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.659
 they meant for many the origin 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.830
 of the middle class north america 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.050
 This was the first global car in the industry 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.820
 in 1921 almost 57% of the world automotive production 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.410
 it corresponded to the cut 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.039
 that was manufactured in several countries and sold 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.609
 in the five continents 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.609
 in different versions and alternatives of euros 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.990
 the chassis of the model t was simple strong and light 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.040
 with a suspension of three points 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.320
 came the platform and the engine 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 of road variations under heavy load conditions 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 its original and simple engine contributed 20 horsepower with a speed 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.410
 maximum around 65 to 70 kilometers per hour 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.070
 located frontally 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.570
 the 2-point motor 9 liters 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.660
 It had four cylinders and it was the first with a one piece block 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.870
 and while those who exchange 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.780
 and still today 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.210
 at the base of most modern engines 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.830
 this engine could be mounted on any of the nine types of 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.179
 eric body west 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.179
 all on the same chassis 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.249
 that allowed to travel 10 kilometers with a liter of gasoline 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:18.989
 the transmission was these genocides 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.239
 even though the model t had three pedals on the floor 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.729
 none of them was the accelerator 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.909
 from left to right the clutch the reverse gear and the brake 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.089
 the accelerator on a lever to the right of the steering column 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:38.840
 in October of 1913 began the mass production of the model t in the 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.529
 plant of jaén lampard michelle 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.789
 the mobile assembly line quickly improved the assembly speed 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:46.999
 whistles and hours 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.539
 to an hour and a half 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.359
 in 1914 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.490
 by produced 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.789
 304 thousand 160 and the cars 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.909
 more than all the other automakers together 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.999
 by the time they had built a tec-9 100 million model 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:02.989
 9 of 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.099
 praise abortions around the world 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.709
 field 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.509
 It was also in 1914 that to further optimize the production 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.169
 brindisi 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.999
 as it was known colloquially- to model t 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:19.739
 ceased to be available in red blue greenguer hills 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.930
 from that moment 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.139
 you could get it in any color as long as necessary 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.299
 as the risk said 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.699
 80% of the historical production corresponded 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.379
 to that color 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.379
 few things besides the price change model t 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.159
 electric lights debuted in 1915 the cover around bronze step to 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.800
 black 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.789
 in 1916 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.160
 has electric ignition was offered as optional starting 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.249
 of 1919 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:55.829
 These were the only modifications until the mid-20s when 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.340
 reinforce gave for pensions to modernize before 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.629
 and they started a series 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.049
 but nevertheless 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.779
 the changes were not enough to keep the t model competitive 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:08.949
 to his rivals 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.109
 ford tiger 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.059
 decided it was time to finish production 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:17.840
 After producing more than 15 million units the assembly line stopped 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.970
 on May 26, 1927 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.409
 the first pike manufactured by ford by model h below 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.550
 which also offered alhaji capón model tt 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.199
 for such purposes 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.229
 the model t 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.300
 it was until 1972 the best selling car in history when Alfonso 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.029
 pay virtue he got over it 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:44.169
 in the same way that it happened in other parts of the world he formed what 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.520
 put Argentina on wheels 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.889
 from 1914 to 1927 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.370
 when it was replaced by season 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.780
 this was the car that transformed the physiognomy of the city of the countryside 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.280
 changing habits 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.819
 of thousands of Argentines 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.259
 eight out of ten cars that circulated in the mid-20s were forums 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:06.439
 model t 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.169
 the popular Chinese portal 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.210
 also called mustache 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.810
 formed in different forge workshops located in the barracks district and 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.700
 from 1922 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.469
 on the floor of the mouth the most modern 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.219
 From South America 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.949
 The Ford Model T product line has been composed of the following 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.039
 Models 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.520
 double miss a read cuplé will be four doors 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.680
 4d 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.480
 will be two-door chassis boy 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.439
 tractor forson chips and change 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.849
 at the end of 1924 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.180
 came out of the mouth plant the 100 thousand unit starting a few days later 

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:46.779
 a tour around the country traveling more than six thousand kilometers 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.339
 1925 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.409
 occurred in expansion of production capacity 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.900
 from atlanta to 45 thousand units per year 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.900
 and the endowment was increased to 1,500 employees 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.689
 the concessionaire network for 340 points 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.650
 and 2,500 that were the workshops 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.900
 mechanical service 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.210
 the same advantage that led to the model becoming 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.940
 in a worldwide phenomenon they made it the most popular car in the beginning 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.940
 of the automotive history of the Argentine 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:22.159
