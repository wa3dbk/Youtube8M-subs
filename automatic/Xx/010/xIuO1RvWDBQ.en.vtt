00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
I'm using a PDW with the sounder grip

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.960 
I'm using a PDW with the sounder grip
and<00:01:03.660> laser<00:01:04.559> sight<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.760> find

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and laser sight and I just really find

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
and laser sight and I just really find
this<00:01:06.119> effective<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.110> definitely<00:01:07.500> suggest

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
this effective and I definitely suggest

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230 
this effective and I definitely suggest
a<00:01:07.950> grip<00:01:08.159> attachment<00:01:08.460> especially<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:09.210> because

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
a grip attachment especially now because

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
a grip attachment especially now because
if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:09.900> know<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.830> patch<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
if you don't know there was a patch I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.250 
if you don't know there was a patch I
think<00:01:11.520> yesterday<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.270> both<00:01:12.510> consoles<00:01:12.990> where

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
think yesterday for both consoles where

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.460 
think yesterday for both consoles where
the<00:01:13.920> PDW<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.729> um<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.900> recall<00:01:16.320> was

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the PDW it's um it's recall was

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
the PDW it's um it's recall was
increased<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.130> that's<00:01:17.729> definitely<00:01:18.030> gonna

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
increased so that's definitely gonna

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.210 
increased so that's definitely gonna
hurt<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
hurt it but you know when you have the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
hurt it but you know when you have the

this<00:02:43.600> game<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.020> um<00:02:44.170> as<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.920> said<00:02:45.160> before<00:02:45.340> I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
this game but um as I said before I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.730 
this game but um as I said before I
always<00:02:45.910> brought<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.420> when<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.260> take<00:02:47.530> what

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
always brought and when you take what

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.320 
always brought and when you take what
they<00:02:47.860> did<00:02:48.010> was<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:48.400> all<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.580> SMGs<00:02:49.030> they

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
they did was for all the SMGs they

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.960 
they did was for all the SMGs they
increase<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.810> hipfire<00:02:50.290> accuracy<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:51.280> mean

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
increase the hipfire accuracy I mean

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.760 
increase the hipfire accuracy I mean
thinking<00:02:52.270> increase<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.960> they<00:02:53.110> all<00:02:53.380> made<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
thinking increase it they all made the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.950 
thinking increase it they all made the
hipfire<00:02:54.160> spread<00:02:54.190> wider<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.240> they<00:02:55.750> also

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
hipfire spread wider and they also

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.620 
hipfire spread wider and they also
increase<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.740> recoil<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.640> SMGs<00:02:58.270> which<00:02:58.450> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
increase the recoil on this SMGs which I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.300 
increase the recoil on this SMGs which I
don't<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.990> just<00:02:59.020> don't<00:02:59.230> understand<00:02:59.890> they're

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
don't I just don't understand they're

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.400 
don't I just don't understand they're
just<00:03:00.550> doing<00:03:00.700> everything<00:03:01.090> we<00:03:01.360> think<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.690> SMGs

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
just doing everything we think of SMGs

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.590 
just doing everything we think of SMGs
lurking<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.190> SMGs<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.880> everything<00:03:04.210> hipfire

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
lurking the SMGs and everything hipfire

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.660 
lurking the SMGs and everything hipfire
what<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.870> think<00:03:05.050> of<00:03:05.200> obviously<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.370> think

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
what do you think of obviously you think

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.780 
what do you think of obviously you think
of<00:03:06.820> rushers<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:08.500> know<00:03:08.760> they're<00:03:09.760> just

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
of rushers and you know they're just

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.580 
of rushers and you know they're just
trying<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.390> promote<00:03:10.690> camping<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.500> it's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
trying to promote camping and it's

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.320 
trying to promote camping and it's
probably<00:03:11.830> some<00:03:11.980> 12<00:03:12.280> year<00:03:12.430> old<00:03:12.580> kid<00:03:12.820> who<00:03:13.150> sits

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
probably some 12 year old kid who sits

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.520 
probably some 12 year old kid who sits
in<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.540> corner<00:03:13.810> with<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.020> target<00:03:14.350> finder

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
in a corner with the target finder

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.620 
in a corner with the target finder
probably<00:03:14.950> cried<00:03:15.220> because<00:03:15.460> he's<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.150> aw<00:03:16.270> man

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
probably cried because he's like aw man

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.270 
probably cried because he's like aw man
I<00:03:16.870> wait<00:03:17.110> in<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.320> corner<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:17.739> guy<00:03:17.890> comes<00:03:18.160> with

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
I wait in the corner this guy comes with

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.310 
I wait in the corner this guy comes with
an<00:03:18.370> SMG<00:03:18.640> running<00:03:19.090> around<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.660> then<00:03:19.989> he<00:03:20.080> kills

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
an SMG running around and then he kills

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.560 
an SMG running around and then he kills
me<00:03:20.470> something<00:03:20.770> oh<00:03:21.040> I'm<00:03:21.520> sorry<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.239> then<00:03:22.390> they

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
me something oh I'm sorry and then they

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.090 
me something oh I'm sorry and then they
nerfed<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.050> some<00:03:23.230> peas<00:03:23.380> like<00:03:23.560> that's<00:03:23.830> really

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
nerfed that some peas like that's really

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.740 
nerfed that some peas like that's really
probably<00:03:24.489> what<00:03:24.790> happened<00:03:25.180> is<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:25.360> complete

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
probably what happened is this complete

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.140 
probably what happened is this complete
bullshit<00:03:26.170> but<00:03:26.410> yeah<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.430> know<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.940> round

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
bullshit but yeah you know the round

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.970

sticking and I want you know if you
don't<00:03:30.160> want<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> use<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> kill<00:03:30.700> streaks<00:03:30.940> you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
don't want to use the kill streaks you

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.520 
don't want to use the kill streaks you
wanna<00:03:31.270> don't<00:03:31.540> want<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.840> use<00:03:31.989> them<00:03:32.170> at<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> end

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
wanna don't want to use them at the end

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.680 
wanna don't want to use them at the end
of<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.709> round<00:03:32.830> save<00:03:33.250> them<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.209> can<00:03:34.450> use

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
of the round save them so you can use

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.600 
of the round save them so you can use
them<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.140> just<00:03:35.500> usually<00:03:35.860> go<00:03:36.010> ham<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.489> when

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
them and just usually go ham and when

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.590 
them and just usually go ham and when
you<00:03:36.730> going<00:03:36.880> for<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.090> high<00:03:37.239> scoring<00:03:37.510> game

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
you going for the high scoring game

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.030 
you going for the high scoring game
place<00:03:37.930> when<00:03:38.560> you're<00:03:38.680> going<00:03:38.770> for<00:03:38.920> those

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
place when you're going for those

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.590 
place when you're going for those
hundred<00:03:39.310> pluses<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:39.910> know<00:03:40.030> everyone's<00:03:40.450> all

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
hundred pluses you know everyone's all

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.940 
hundred pluses you know everyone's all
like<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.959> should<00:03:41.110> have<00:03:41.140> 50<00:03:41.500> kills<00:03:41.680> at<00:03:41.800> half

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
like you should have 50 kills at half

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.050 
like you should have 50 kills at half
you<00:03:42.100> know<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.280> don't<00:03:42.430> really<00:03:42.519> think<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:42.940> this

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
you know I don't really think so this

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.170 
you know I don't really think so this
game<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.300> didn't<00:03:43.840> um<00:03:44.190> kind<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.370> should<00:03:45.610> but<00:03:45.940> you

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
game I didn't um kind of should but you

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.640 
game I didn't um kind of should but you
don't<00:03:46.510> really<00:03:46.660> need<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.110> because<00:03:47.320> if<00:03:47.470> you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
don't really need to it because if you

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.350 
don't really need to it because if you
had<00:03:47.830> like<00:03:48.010> around<00:03:48.250> 40<00:03:48.610> kills<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.090> cassette

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
had like around 40 kills and a cassette

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.970 
had like around 40 kills and a cassette
of<00:03:49.420> kill<00:03:49.660> streaks<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.050> waiting<00:03:50.470> or<00:03:50.650> really

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
of kill streaks just waiting or really

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.949 
of kill streaks just waiting or really
close<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.459> then<00:03:52.120> they'll<00:03:52.420> get<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.810> the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
close to then they'll get you the

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.600 
close to then they'll get you the
additional<00:03:53.440> 10<00:03:53.620> kills<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.190> miss<00:03:54.400> for

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
additional 10 kills that you miss for

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.030 
additional 10 kills that you miss for
that<00:03:54.730> half<00:03:54.970> but<00:03:55.300> who<00:03:56.260> knows<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.620> first<00:03:56.860> half

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
that half but who knows the first half

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.500 
that half but who knows the first half
and<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> lot<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.519> times<00:03:57.730> I'll<00:03:58.120> be<00:03:58.150> running

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
and a lot of times I'll be running

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.300 
and a lot of times I'll be running
around<00:03:58.630> in<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.959> end<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.380> first<00:03:59.650> half<00:03:59.769> and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
around in the end the first half and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.100 
around in the end the first half and
that's<00:04:00.730> really<00:04:01.000> not<00:04:01.300> what<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.690> want<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.930> do

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
that's really not what you want to do

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.690 
that's really not what you want to do
just<00:04:02.410> because<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.010> many<00:04:03.130> times<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.550> get

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
just because so many times you get

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.520 
just because so many times you get
killed<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.180> just<00:04:04.330> destroys<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.780> momentum<00:04:05.260> so

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
killed and just destroys you momentum so

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.560
