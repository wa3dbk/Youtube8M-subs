the<00:00:42.870> camera<00:00:43.260> going<00:00:44.129> rocker<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.840> believe<00:00:45.840> that's

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the camera going rocker I believe that's

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200 
the camera going rocker I believe that's
the<00:00:46.110> power<00:00:46.320> switch<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.309> sure<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.149> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the power switch I'm not sure if this is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
the power switch I'm not sure if this is
to<00:00:48.510> speak<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> kickstand<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:50.010> does

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to speak for a kickstand or not does

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.400 
to speak for a kickstand or not does
that<00:00:50.789> phone<00:00:51.000> kinda<00:00:51.239> kicks<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.809> don't<00:00:52.199> recall

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
that phone kinda kicks in I don't recall

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.619 
that phone kinda kicks in I don't recall
but<00:00:55.410> since<00:00:55.710> stand<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> name<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.210> assume

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
but since stand is in the name I assume

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
but since stand is in the name I assume
it<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:59.120> position<00:01:00.120> me<00:01:01.670> face<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it is and you can position me face to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
it is and you can position me face to
face<00:01:02.940> either<00:01:03.600> inwards<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.140> outwards<00:01:04.199> again

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
face either inwards or outwards again

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
face either inwards or outwards again
it's<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.430> hard<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.180> camera

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it's really hard to see on camera

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
it's really hard to see on camera
because<00:01:07.470> uh<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.510> why<00:01:09.780> he<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.380> black

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
which is nice because sometimes it's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
which is nice because sometimes it's
plastic<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.720> doesn't<00:01:43.049> feel<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.320> nice<00:01:43.470> oh

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
flips all the way up and there is a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.620 
flips all the way up and there is a
little<00:02:01.469> metal<00:02:01.740> stand<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.360> use<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
little metal stand that you can use to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.380 
little metal stand that you can use to
adjust<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.350> different<00:02:04.710> sizes<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.790> different

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
adjust to different sizes or different

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.889 
adjust to different sizes or different
lengths<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.409> are<00:02:07.879> etched<00:02:08.879> into<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.660> click

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
lengths that are etched into the click

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
lengths that are etched into the click
it<00:02:10.430> that's<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.610> cool<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.060> always<00:02:12.599> think

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it that's really cool I always think

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.640 
it that's really cool I always think
it's<00:02:12.870> weird

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's weird

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.210 
it's weird
um<00:02:14.129> thumbs<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:15.120> stands<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.019> um<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.799> guess<00:02:17.040> it's

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
um thumbs it stands but um I guess it's

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.830 
um thumbs it stands but um I guess it's
a<00:02:17.310> cool<00:02:17.489> application<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.360> because<00:02:18.659> it's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
a cool application of it because it's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.059 
a cool application of it because it's
not<00:02:19.049> you<00:02:19.799> know<00:02:19.829> obvious<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.299> way
