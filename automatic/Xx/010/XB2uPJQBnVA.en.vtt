this house for that purpose the approach
for<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> main<00:00:36.870> floor<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.590> bit

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
for the main floor here was a little bit

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
for the main floor here was a little bit
different<00:00:38.129> than<00:00:38.309> typical<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:39.629> was

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
different than typical it really was

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.310 
different than typical it really was
about<00:00:40.140> double<00:00:40.590> function<00:00:40.890> family<00:00:41.700> use

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
about double function family use

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
about double function family use
lounging<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.649> well<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.129> big<00:00:44.309> dinner<00:00:44.489> parties

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
lounging as well as big dinner parties

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.400 
lounging as well as big dinner parties
so<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.329> didn't<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> dining<00:00:46.350> room

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so we actually didn't do a dining room

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.010 
so we actually didn't do a dining room
but<00:00:46.500> rather<00:00:46.879> more<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> breakfast<00:00:48.510> banquette

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
but rather more of a breakfast banquette

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
but rather more of a breakfast banquette
nook<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.620> what's<00:00:50.489> interesting<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> size

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
nook and what's interesting is the size

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
nook and what's interesting is the size
of<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.690> table<00:00:51.899> matches<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.100> size<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
of this table matches the size of that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
of this table matches the size of that
credenza<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:54.840> they<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.110> big<00:00:55.379> dinner

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
credenza so when they have big dinner

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.889 
credenza so when they have big dinner
parties<00:00:56.219> they<00:00:56.670> pull<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.030> table<00:00:57.539> over<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

paintings and the house I think is a
great<00:03:31.060> reflection<00:03:31.599> of<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:32.200> wasn't<00:03:32.890> my

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
great reflection of that it wasn't my

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.930 
great reflection of that it wasn't my
job<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.400> come<00:03:33.549> in<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.790> make<00:03:33.910> it

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
job to come in and make it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.059 
job to come in and make it
picture-perfect<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:35.230> was<00:03:35.440> really<00:03:35.739> supposed

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
picture-perfect it was really supposed

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.860 
picture-perfect it was really supposed
to<00:03:36.160> represent<00:03:36.670> them<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.269> their<00:03:37.720> journey

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
to represent them and their journey

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.720 
to represent them and their journey
together<00:03:38.290> as<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.500> couple<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.130> where<00:03:39.579> they're

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
together as a couple and where they're

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.920 
together as a couple and where they're
going<00:03:39.910> in<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.060> future<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.599> think<00:03:40.780> we've

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
going in the future and I think we've

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.199 
going in the future and I think we've
done<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.489> every<00:03:42.489> piece<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:43.030> really

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
done that every piece is really

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.360 
done that every piece is really
something<00:03:43.690> they've<00:03:43.840> selected<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.620> there's<00:03:45.280> a

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
something they've selected and there's a

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.309 
something they've selected and there's a
lot<00:03:45.609> of<00:03:45.760> stuff<00:03:46.030> but<00:03:46.389> it's<00:03:46.510> all<00:03:46.630> very<00:03:46.840> personal

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
lot of stuff but it's all very personal
