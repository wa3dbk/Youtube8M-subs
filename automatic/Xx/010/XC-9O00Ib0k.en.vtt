a<00:00:45.390> day<00:00:45.510> which<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.780> pretty<00:00:45.960> awesome<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.559> then

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
a day which is pretty awesome and then

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.940 
a day which is pretty awesome and then
we<00:00:46.920> upgraded<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.489> feed<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> beast<00:00:48.420> unleashed

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
we upgraded to feed the beast unleashed

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.610 
we upgraded to feed the beast unleashed
now<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.219> unleased<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.750> doesn't<00:00:52.530> have

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
now what unleased is is it doesn't have

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.260 
now what unleased is is it doesn't have
great<00:00:52.739> tech<00:00:53.039> which<00:00:53.340> kind<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.699> sucks<00:00:54.000> which

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
great tech which kind of sucks which

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.569 
great tech which kind of sucks which
makes<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.780> easy<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.590> reach<00:00:56.160> endgame

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
makes it really easy to reach endgame

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.430 
makes it really easy to reach endgame
within<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.750> know<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> short<00:00:58.140> amount<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> time

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
within you know a short amount of time

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.900 
within you know a short amount of time
the<00:00:58.920> players<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.399> had<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the players that we had with the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.510 
the players that we had with the
donation<00:01:00.300> packages<00:01:00.809> they<00:01:00.960> would<00:01:01.520> reach

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
donation packages they would reach

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.609 
donation packages they would reach
endgame<00:01:02.940> within<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.320> two<00:01:04.439> days

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
endgame within you know one or two days

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
endgame within you know one or two days
which<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.189> simple<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.700> people<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:06.299> we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
which is really simple for people if we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
which is really simple for people if we
thought<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.930> too<00:01:07.110> easy<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.490> close<00:01:08.790> on

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
thought it was too easy so we close on

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.640 
thought it was too easy so we close on
that<00:01:09.090> server<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.720> started<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.229> hexxit

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that server and we started up a hexxit

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.420 
that server and we started up a hexxit
server<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:12.270> exit<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:14.010> guess

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
server and what exit is it is I guess

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
server and what exit is it is I guess
it's<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> branch<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.509> our<00:01:16.049> branch

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it's kind of like a branch of our branch

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
it's kind of like a branch of our branch
off<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> Tekkit<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.360> exactly<00:01:18.659> sure

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
off of Tekkit but I'm not exactly sure

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
off of Tekkit but I'm not exactly sure
because<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.500> didn't<00:01:20.250> plan<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> server<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.939> all

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
because I didn't plan the server at all

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020 
because I didn't plan the server at all
but<00:01:21.930> um<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> wasn't<00:01:23.700> bringing<00:01:23.850> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
but um you know it wasn't bringing in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.570 
but um you know it wasn't bringing in
that<00:01:24.180> many<00:01:24.360> players<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.040> decided<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> close

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that many players so we decided to close

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.130 
that many players so we decided to close
that<00:01:26.790> server<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.180> open<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.509> ultimate<00:01:27.990> back

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that server and open up ultimate back

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140 
that server and open up ultimate back
