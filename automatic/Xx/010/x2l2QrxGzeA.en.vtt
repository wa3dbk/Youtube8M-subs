00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
ABEC 3 bearing z'

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.670 
ABEC 3 bearing z'
flip<00:00:45.120> sorry<00:00:45.420> maybe<00:00:46.050> he'll<00:00:46.860> give<00:00:47.129> ik<00:00:48.469> give<00:00:49.469> it

you do first you it's really simple

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540 
you do first you it's really simple
actually<00:00:57.750> doesn't<00:00:58.559> require<00:00:58.620> much<00:00:59.039> effort<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
actually doesn't require much effort you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
actually doesn't require much effort you
just<00:00:59.789> put<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> then<00:01:03.589> just<00:01:04.589> apply<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just put it on and then just apply a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
just put it on and then just apply a
little<00:01:05.670> bit<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> pressure<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> side<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
little bit of pressure on the side and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.960 
little bit of pressure on the side and
just<00:01:07.860> slip<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:10.490> that's<00:01:11.490> basically

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
just slip right out and that's basically

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.920 
just slip right out and that's basically
how<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.560> remove<00:01:13.560> your<00:01:13.830> bearings<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.930> as

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
how you remove your bearings and then as

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.260 
how you remove your bearings and then as
you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> bearings<00:01:17.220> right<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.850 

okay<00:01:25.270> now<00:01:25.930> this<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.320> how<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:26.500> put<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
okay now this is how you put the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.650 
okay now this is how you put the
bearings<00:01:27.130> back<00:01:27.400> on<00:01:29.400> okay<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:30.790> turn<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
bearings back on okay so you turn to the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.930 
bearings back on okay so you turn to the
side<00:01:31.840> you<00:01:32.560> actually<00:01:32.740> want<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.340> bearing<00:01:33.730> done

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
side you actually want the bearing done

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.470 
side you actually want the bearing done
and<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:37.780> push<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.170> back<00:01:38.200> on<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:39.330> that's<00:01:40.330> how

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
you put the bearings back on so if you

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.800 
you put the bearings back on so if you
need<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.520> like<00:01:42.700> can<00:01:42.940> you<00:01:43.030> reel<00:01:43.210> anything<00:01:43.690> I

would<00:01:43.930> take<00:01:44.110> out<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.440> bearings<00:01:44.740> first<00:01:44.979> and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
would take out the bearings first and

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.400 
would take out the bearings first and
put<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:45.940> back<00:01:46.000> on<00:01:46.150> now<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.990> put<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.229> wheel<00:01:47.380> back

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
put it back on now to put the wheel back

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.780 
put it back on now to put the wheel back
on<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:49.200> slide<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.380> thing<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:51.010> know<00:01:51.430> mine
