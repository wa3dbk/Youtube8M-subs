00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
without you having to spawn them that'd

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.410 
without you having to spawn them that'd
be<00:02:48.070> really<00:02:48.220> cool<00:02:48.340> if<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.000> could<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.150> walk

with<00:02:54.640> however<00:02:55.330> they<00:02:55.810> they<00:02:56.050> code<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.710> thing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
with however they they code the thing

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.900 
with however they they code the thing
that's<00:02:57.370> not<00:02:57.580> my<00:02:57.790> department<00:02:57.930> um<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.910> anyway

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
that's not my department um but anyway

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.880 
that's not my department um but anyway
we'll<00:03:01.270> see<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:02.380> supposed<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.770> pretty

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
we'll see I it's supposed to be pretty

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.470 
we'll see I it's supposed to be pretty
difficult<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.610> it's<00:03:03.760> it's<00:03:03.940> sort<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.210> an<00:03:04.300> end

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
difficult so it's it's sort of an end

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.360 
difficult so it's it's sort of an end
game<00:03:04.720> type<00:03:05.260> thing<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.740> I<00:03:05.770> probably<00:03:06.130> don't

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
game type thing that I probably don't

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.120 
game type thing that I probably don't
have<00:03:06.520> the<00:03:06.730> items<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.390> handle<00:03:08.380> successfully<00:03:08.980> as

have the items to handle successfully as
of<00:03:09.280> yet<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:09.460> it's<00:03:09.730> something<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.240> work

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
of yet but it's something we can work

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.080 
of yet but it's something we can work
towards<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:12.040> looks<00:03:12.220> pretty<00:03:12.490> pretty

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090
