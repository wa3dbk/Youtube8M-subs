00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 without graduating the new technology 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.339
 revolution assemble the 10 years of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.629
 everyone as on the internet is 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.519
 incredible things that can us 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.200
 find and good just one of the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.750
 branches of all this that I am 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.420
 speaking in the electronics and I tell them 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.520
 that electronics has come to help us 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.650
 to protect the environment first 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.500
 electric car built by the guys 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.109
 of the faculty of technology is already 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.029
 done and is here in bolivia hipólito it 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.689
 finds his public work as he gives 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.000
 good morning good morning friends 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 all over the country like this we are with a great 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 novelty and it is very important that all 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.879
 bolivia finds out about this the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.760
 special features that it has 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 this electric car the first one that has 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.890
 been built and obviously by student 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 of the computer technology faculty 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 Valley University Electronics 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.050
 we are with special guests but I 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.600
 I wanted to have the honor of being in 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.850
 this car that is beautiful and is 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.859
 important not that we can take care also 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.649
 our environment is what most 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.049
 we need in this opportunity not in 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.190
 these years already to be able to take care and enjoy 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.720
 also in good health we are going to 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.670
 welcome to the people who have been 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.410
 the creators of this car that is so 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.570
 spectacular as is the architect 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.970
 nelson rye one of the creators at 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.260
 like the engineer raúl gómez and 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.090
 Obviously, we are also accompanied by 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.070
 engineer Gonzalo Ruiz the rector of the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.500
 valley university who are going to us 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.440
 tell a little please about the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.440
 Engineer construction 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.060
 this is a university endeavor 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.630
 which is ecological is totally ecological 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.939
 generates noise at least 10 is important 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.490
 that for food the components 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.490
 they are generic that can be used 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.990
 I do not understand for a little bit about 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.580
 how long could it have been built 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.190
 difficult is how complicated it has been 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.550
 be true that it has grown since 2 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.550
 years 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.630
 universal exhibitions deceived take 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.430
 a 4-speed mechanical box 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.380
 to see if we can make changes please 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.030
 to the car and you tell us in detail to 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.120
 detail the characteristics for example 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.830
 so we can appreciate the most of 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.960
 close then the body is what 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.240
 it would be with composite materials 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.530
 fiberglass composite materials 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:33.510
 and coal is very light and very resistant 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:38.120
 to anatomical conditions of two 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.120
 people and the operation is 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.120
 universal 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:53.780
 dimensions of the vehicle 2 meters 60 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.830
 long 1 60 wide and 145 given 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.830
 very much then the only 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.900
 they are already building more is in 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.260
 steps and more or less as soon as 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.260
 evaluated 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.040
 let's talk to the engineer 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.020
 Gonzalo Ruiz the rector of the university 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.900
 and I imagine that for the university it is 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.730
 it's an honor to have this kind of car and 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.350
 have built it within what it is 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.180
 the university by people who form 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.820
 a very important process that they have 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.500
 participated research engineers of 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.870
 electronic mechatronics 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.520
 computing in architecture design 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.200
 and for us a satisfaction 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.630
 presented at the main pole of 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.810
 development of the country that santa cruz is 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.270
 auto really is a development by 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.020
 supposedly a great job of 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.330
 investigation and until October 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.370
 next year we will manufacture about 20 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.140
 specimens of the jump I was wondering 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.060
 about as it is valued more or 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.740
 less 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.570
 the prototype costs a lot of time 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.340
 cost several tens of thousands of 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.770
 dollars because they have tried different 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.960
 different engines different cookies 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.330
 converting the electrical systems 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.190
 prototype but we hope the car 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.950
 then of course it has been commercialized 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.500
 at a price not compatible what is important 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.790
 of this car that one comes to your home 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.710
 job to work after passing what 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.170
 plug in and the next day is the car 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.340
 recharged with the battery and the other by 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.190
 so much that it does not generate any noise 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.560
 then it's ecology and it 's acoustic 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.400
 good andrés had any questions ask 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.530
 respect 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.680
 the construction of this beautiful car 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.220
 I want to know if that connects to 220 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.750
 basic lara states that are 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.210
 really spectacular the car 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.229
 I would have loved that not that we already have 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:53.990
 a price because this obviously goes to 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:56.220
 save us the cost of living and also 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.199
 will help everything he will do in the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.900
 environment here in Santa Cruz has 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.300
 some name of the prototype the car that 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.430
 of some brand has some name has 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.210
 some brand the own type of calculates 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:13.740
 the psuv guanaco men that is merit of 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:19.470
 the keyboards that the precise what spoken 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:22.430
 many western but it's a pronounced 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.740
 Header is the world is 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.620
 deserving to finish is asked how much 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.860
 for now run and second if they have it 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.030
 rolled a quarter for now runs and if 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.030
 there are a variety of colors 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:49.750
 and if it can be a special pink then 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.750
 are lists can be 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.850
 a trend fought many thanks 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.250
 to benito are the orders can go 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.070
 doing business the first laying of 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.380
 decides to last in pink in seconds 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.760
 already to see you the second in which the 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.680
 color what was first we go and 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.960
 I tell you that I am very touched by the 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.440
 fuchsia this and that's why I'm not doing it 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.479
 I want in black 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.490
 the combination of black black whole 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.000
 black that was with a white shape at 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.000
 beautiful but 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.080
 movement to the room that has requested so 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.360
 that I stay in my last vehicle on 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.220
 what a spectacular very beautiful and 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.600
 spectacular connected we'll see you 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.110
 go well bayern is an orchard and 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.630
 try it later for villa ok 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.890
 really spectacular what is 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.460
 park then that is of the 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.460
 technology
