00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:52.830

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and I just about have it there's a

he's a little crystallized

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:18.530 
he's a little crystallized
that's<00:02:05.110> okay<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.130> your<00:02:09.310> marinade<00:02:09.790> just

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.580 

let's<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:19.630> all<00:02:19.900> together

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
let's just all together

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.130 
let's just all together
this<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.190> good<00:02:21.460> enough<00:02:21.490> for<00:02:22.150> two<00:02:22.450> pounds<00:02:22.720> of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
this is it good enough for two pounds of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.390 
this is it good enough for two pounds of
beef<00:02:23.490> I'm<00:02:24.490> all<00:02:24.760> am<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.030> using<00:02:25.240> one<00:02:25.660> pound<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
beef I'm all am I using one pound and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.730 
beef I'm all am I using one pound and
let<00:02:30.400> me<00:02:30.490> get<00:02:30.640> my<00:02:30.790> beef<00:02:33.930> my<00:02:34.930> beef<00:02:35.140> has<00:02:35.320> changed

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
let me get my beef my beef has changed

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860 
let me get my beef my beef has changed
colors<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.459> reason<00:02:36.820> is<00:02:37.030> because<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.660> put

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
colors and the reason is because I put

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.830 
colors and the reason is because I put
it<00:02:37.990> in<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.230> sink<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.740> soaked<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.490> water<00:02:39.840> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
it in the sink and soaked it in water to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.780 
it in the sink and soaked it in water to
try<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.440> get<00:02:42.450> most<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> blood<00:02:44.080> out<00:02:44.110> a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
try and get most of the blood out a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.750 
try and get most of the blood out a
month<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.090> dry<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.480> off<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.930> my<00:02:47.470> theory<00:02:47.740> is<00:02:48.190> if

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
month and dry it off and my theory is if

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.940 
month and dry it off and my theory is if
you<00:02:48.910> do<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.930> will<00:02:53.080> soak<00:02:53.350> up<00:02:53.560> more<00:02:53.920> of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
you do that and it will soak up more of

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.890 
you do that and it will soak up more of
the<00:02:54.250> marinade<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.820> put<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> marinade

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the marinade to put that in the marinade

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.490 
the marinade to put that in the marinade
and<00:02:59.290> we'll<00:02:59.920> cook<00:03:00.070> this<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.489> tomorrow

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
and we'll cook this up tomorrow

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.070 
and we'll cook this up tomorrow
well<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.709> marinated<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.760> I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.200 

kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.680> went<00:03:07.830> like<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.550> took<00:03:08.730> most<00:03:09.030> of

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
kind of went like this and took most of

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.960 
kind of went like this and took most of
the<00:03:09.390> marinade<00:03:10.140> off<00:03:10.440> there's<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.340> my

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
the marinade off there's a little bit my

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.990 
the marinade off there's a little bit my
hand<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:13.380> I'm<00:03:13.680> drying<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> off<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.580> little<00:03:14.790> bit

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
hand and I'm drying it off a little bit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.390 
hand and I'm drying it off a little bit
and<00:03:15.840> my<00:03:16.020> theory<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.800> makes<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.190> little

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
and my theory is it makes it a little

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.540 
and my theory is it makes it a little
bit<00:03:17.610> more<00:03:17.850> crispy<00:03:18.480> when<00:03:19.380> we<00:03:19.500> go<00:03:19.650> outside<00:03:19.860> and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
bit more crispy when we go outside and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.440 
bit more crispy when we go outside and
I'm<00:03:21.540> also<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.200> take<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:23.090> little<00:03:24.090> bit<00:03:24.300> of

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
I'm also going to take a little bit of

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.510 
I'm also going to take a little bit of
vegetable<00:03:25.080> oil<00:03:25.880> here<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:26.970> my<00:03:27.090> pan<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:29.280> I'm

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
vegetable oil here on my pan and I'm

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.010 
vegetable oil here on my pan and I'm
