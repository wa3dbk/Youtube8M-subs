the<00:02:25.630> only<00:02:25.780> threats<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> cutthroat

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the only threats to the cutthroat

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.880 
the only threats to the cutthroat
survival<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:28.360> also<00:02:28.540> faces<00:02:29.140> competition<00:02:29.350> from

survival it also faces competition from

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.450

non-native spawn earlier than cutthroat

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.980

so<00:02:36.310> their<00:02:36.460> offspring<00:02:36.970> are<00:02:37.090> bigger<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.630> better

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
so their offspring are bigger and better

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.170 
so their offspring are bigger and better
able<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.470> compete<00:02:38.830> for<00:02:39.070> food<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.490> habitat<00:02:39.970> and
