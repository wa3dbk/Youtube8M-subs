00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
all right so as I said in the last video

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.760 
all right so as I said in the last video
we<00:00:02.669> decided<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.179> do<00:00:03.270> it<00:00:03.389> next<00:00:03.540> year<00:00:03.720> with<00:00:04.110> minis

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
we decided to do it next year with minis

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.800 
we decided to do it next year with minis
in<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.950> book<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.250> procurement<00:00:06.000> unbolts

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
in the book in the procurement unbolts

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.780 
in the book in the procurement unbolts
so<00:00:07.379> obviously<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.919> had<00:00:08.040> no<00:00:08.189> idea<00:00:08.220> how<00:00:08.580> good

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
so obviously we had no idea how good

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.810 
so obviously we had no idea how good
they<00:00:08.940> were<00:00:09.030> gonna<00:00:09.179> be<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.099> we<00:00:11.099> okay<00:00:11.250> brought

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
they were gonna be so we okay brought

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.539 
they were gonna be so we okay brought
rubies<00:00:12.179> too<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.980> as<00:00:13.980> you'll<00:00:14.160> see<00:00:14.190> later<00:00:14.309> in

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
rubies too and as you'll see later in

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.829 
rubies too and as you'll see later in
the<00:00:14.610> video<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.849> had<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.150> easel<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> blood

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the video I had the easel to the blood

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.450 
the video I had the easel to the blood
face<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.830> see<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> diptych

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
face but as you can see the diptych

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.010 
face but as you can see the diptych
pretty<00:00:17.789> good<00:00:18.090> then<00:00:18.359> they're<00:00:18.720> not<00:00:18.840> hitting

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
pretty good then they're not hitting

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.630 
pretty good then they're not hitting
just<00:00:19.289> zeros<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:19.920> obviously<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> specials

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
just zeros but obviously the specials

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.890 
just zeros but obviously the specials
don't<00:00:20.820> work<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> specials<00:00:21.810> were

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
don't work because the specials were

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.870 
don't work because the specials were
made<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.109> like<00:00:22.260> head<00:00:22.590> torso<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.160> legs<00:00:23.369> but

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
made for like head torso and legs but

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.820 
made for like head torso and legs but
obviously<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.300> can't<00:00:24.510> really<00:00:24.720> identify<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
obviously you can't really identify that

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
obviously you can't really identify that
on<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> munch<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> most<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.760> time<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.119> lot<00:00:27.390> of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
on a munch the most of the time a lot of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.759 
on a munch the most of the time a lot of
the<00:00:27.660> months<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.930> obviously<00:00:28.199> don't<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.439> like

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the months is obviously don't have like

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.410 
the months is obviously don't have like
some<00:00:29.070> build<00:00:29.369> some<00:00:29.760> don't<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.000> heads

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
some build some don't have heads

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
some build some don't have heads
well<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> probably<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.529> heads<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.859> don't

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
well the probably all have heads I don't

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160 
well the probably all have heads I don't
know<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.700> know<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.940> mean<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
know but you know what I mean so the

know but you know what I mean so the
dill<00:00:34.380> hit<00:00:34.590> pretty<00:00:34.829> good<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> have<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> say

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
dill hit pretty good now I have to say

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
dill hit pretty good now I have to say
they<00:00:36.390> hit<00:00:36.540> better<00:00:36.719> than<00:00:36.840> bit<00:00:37.410> better<00:00:37.649> than

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
they hit better than bit better than

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
they hit better than bit better than
diamond<00:00:38.129> books<00:00:38.370> no<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.570> don't<00:00:39.750> hit<00:00:39.960> better<00:00:40.170> in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
diamond books no the don't hit better in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930 
diamond books no the don't hit better in
rubies<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:40.950> that's<00:00:41.219> only<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
rubies but that's only because of the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
rubies but that's only because of the
special<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.620> like<00:00:43.620> blue<00:00:43.800> criminal<00:00:44.100> brutes<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
special if like blue criminal brutes and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
special if like blue criminal brutes and
both<00:00:44.700> had<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> special<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.629> monsters<00:00:46.050> as

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
both had a special for like monsters as

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.170 
both had a special for like monsters as
well<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.590> possibly<00:00:47.160> could<00:00:47.399> beat<00:00:47.610> rubies<00:00:48.000> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
well it possibly could beat rubies I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
well it possibly could beat rubies I
mean<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> Ruby<00:00:49.200> spec<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> damn<00:00:50.010> good<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
mean the Ruby spec is so damn good that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000 
mean the Ruby spec is so damn good that
it's<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.930> matter<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.770> for

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it's just no matter what they do for

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's just no matter what they do for
bulbs<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.670> rarely<00:00:54.360> gonna<00:00:54.690> beat

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
bulbs it's rarely gonna beat

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
bulbs it's rarely gonna beat
Ruby<00:00:55.980> boards<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> fat<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.730> can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
Ruby boards because of the fat that can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.150 
Ruby boards because of the fat that can
hit<00:00:57.030> 500<00:00:57.629> every<00:00:57.930> special<00:00:58.410> guarantee<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> hit

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
hit 500 every special guarantee you hit

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.450 
hit 500 every special guarantee you hit
it's<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.000> impossible<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:02.100> everything

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it's just impossible but as everything

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.270 
getting quite see quite good damage it's
not<00:01:06.240> too<00:01:06.390> slow<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.869> they're<00:01:07.530> only<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.770> Umbra

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

the<00:01:28.590> same<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:28.950> casting<00:01:29.250> spells<00:01:29.579> unless

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the same as like casting spells unless

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
the same as like casting spells unless
he<00:01:30.000> using<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.630> staff<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.020> light<00:01:31.170> said<00:01:31.799> about

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
he using like a staff a light said about

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.730 
he using like a staff a light said about
the<00:01:32.100> bull<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.049> blood<00:01:34.049> face<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the bull and blood face now the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499 
the bull and blood face now the
permanent<00:01:35.130> bullets<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.939> didn't<00:01:36.150> hit<00:01:36.270> good

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
permanent bullets really didn't hit good

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.109 
permanent bullets really didn't hit good
on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> Reavers<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.009> next<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.820> wasn't

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
on the Reavers so on next it just wasn't

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.350 
on the Reavers so on next it just wasn't
good<00:01:39.299> enough<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> dps<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> can

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
good enough to do the dps so as you can

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120 
good enough to do the dps so as you can
see<00:01:42.570> now<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.079> we're<00:01:43.229> struggling<00:01:43.530> it's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
see now it's like we're struggling it's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.530 
see now it's like we're struggling it's
not<00:01:44.340> doing<00:01:44.610> enough<00:01:44.790> damage<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.360> just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
not doing enough damage and it's just

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.389 
not doing enough damage and it's just
next<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.259> healing<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> type<00:01:46.979> higher

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
next is just healing up a type higher

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
next is just healing up a type higher
and<00:01:47.640> higher<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.420> decided<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> start<00:01:48.930> using

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and higher so we decided to start using

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
and higher so we decided to start using
Ruby's<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.649> necks<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.070> usual<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.579> let's<00:01:51.149> did

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
Ruby's on necks as usual and let's did

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
Ruby's on necks as usual and let's did
get<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.570> down<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.770> brew<00:01:52.890> criminal<00:01:53.189> both

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
get it down so the brew criminal both

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.770 
get it down so the brew criminal both
however<00:01:53.579> we're<00:01:53.970> switching<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> kill<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
however we're switching the kill the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
however we're switching the kill the
Reavers<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.610> are

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
Reavers with and as you can see they are

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
Reavers with and as you can see they are
really<00:01:57.329> hit<00:01:57.750> good<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> Reavers<00:01:58.469> he<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.040> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
really hit good on the Reavers he can to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.280 
really hit good on the Reavers he can to
a<00:01:59.460> free<00:01:59.729> hit<00:01:59.850> mode<00:02:00.060> making<00:02:00.420> generally<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
a free hit mode making generally get the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.260 
a free hit mode making generally get the
river<00:02:01.469> down<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.860> fast<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:02.880> helps

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
river down so fast and that really helps

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
river down so fast and that really helps
the<00:02:03.390> blood<00:02:03.479> phase<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:05.040> took<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:05.340> quite

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the blood phase and we we took for quite

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.770 
the blood phase and we we took for quite
a<00:02:05.520> while<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> split<00:02:06.210> phase<00:02:06.390> because<00:02:06.689> of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
a while in the split phase because of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.600 
a while in the split phase because of
the<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.680> let<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.920> heal<00:02:08.069> quite<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.399> bit

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the we let it heal quite a bit

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.590 
the we let it heal quite a bit
first

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
first

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.110 
first
and<00:02:09.740> after<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.770> while<00:02:10.950> we're<00:02:11.700> doing<00:02:11.790> pretty

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and after a while we're doing pretty

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.700 
and after a while we're doing pretty
good<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.900> got<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.110> down<00:02:13.230> pretty<00:02:13.440> fast

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
good now like we got it down pretty fast

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.500 
good now like we got it down pretty fast
and<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.550> randomly<00:02:14.730> stop<00:02:15.120> hitting

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and then we just randomly stop hitting

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.690 
and then we just randomly stop hitting
but<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.290> ruby<00:02:16.560> specs<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.010> make<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
but the ruby specs just make it so a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.240 
but the ruby specs just make it so a
damn<00:02:17.910> good<00:02:18.150> that's<00:02:19.020> it's<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.560> impossible<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
damn good that's it's just impossible to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.860 
damn good that's it's just impossible to
beat<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.610> unless<00:02:21.030> them<00:02:21.240> really<00:02:21.720> said

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
beat that unless them really said

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.930 
beat that unless them really said
difficult<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.740> doesn't<00:02:23.010> bet<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.340> same<00:02:23.490> spec

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
difficult and doesn't bet the same spec

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.910 
difficult and doesn't bet the same spec
but<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.870> highest<00:02:25.170> friends<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.650> not<00:02:25.710> gonna

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
but with highest friends it's not gonna

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.010 
but with highest friends it's not gonna
happen<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.430> because<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.660> fact<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
happen but because of the fact that the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.980 
happen but because of the fact that the
criminal<00:02:28.290> bullet<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.620> made<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:28.980> pvp

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
criminal bullet is made for pvp

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
criminal bullet is made for pvp
obviously<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> special<00:02:31.440> doesn't<00:02:31.590> work<00:02:31.830> here

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
obviously the special doesn't work here

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.100 
obviously the special doesn't work here
and<00:02:32.400> however<00:02:33.270> they<00:02:33.450> still<00:02:33.510> have<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> great

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
and however they still have the great

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.950 
and however they still have the great
stats<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.150> beats<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> down<00:02:36.750> ball

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
stats and this that beats the down ball

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.220 
stats and this that beats the down ball
by<00:02:37.110> quite<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> mile<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.570> that's<00:02:39.570> why<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.930> can

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
by quite a mile and that's why it can

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.450 
by quite a mile and that's why it can
pretty<00:02:40.410> much<00:02:40.590> match<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.130> beat<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
pretty much match it and beat it

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.100 
pretty much match it and beat it
obviously<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.180> diamonds<00:02:42.450> got<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.600> spec<00:02:42.900> but

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
obviously the diamonds got a spec but

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.720 
obviously the diamonds got a spec but
pretty<00:02:43.350> much<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.620> diamond<00:02:43.890> has<00:02:44.070> suspected

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
pretty much the diamond has suspected

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.550 
pretty much the diamond has suspected
much<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.180> become<00:02:45.480> noble<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.170> diamond<00:02:46.440> will

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
much the become noble the diamond will

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.770 
much the become noble the diamond will
only<00:02:46.710> hit<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.010> four<00:02:47.220> hundred-plus<00:02:47.550> on<00:02:48.060> spec

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
only hit like four hundred-plus on spec

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.660 
only hit like four hundred-plus on spec
know<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:49.020> most<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.350> time<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:49.710> as<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.550> see

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
know of most the time but as you can see

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.070 
know of most the time but as you can see
we<00:02:50.790> were<00:02:50.880> eventually<00:02:51.090> getting<00:02:51.540> next<00:02:51.870> first

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
we were eventually getting next first

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.780 
we were eventually getting next first
you<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.380> say<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.680> about<00:02:52.890> almost<00:02:53.250> there<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
you can say it's about almost there to

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.480 
you can say it's about almost there to
the<00:02:53.880> next<00:02:53.970> place<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.130> carried<00:02:56.370> on

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
the next place but so we carried on

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.950 
the next place but so we carried on
we're<00:02:56.640> using<00:02:56.790> nips<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.450> Reavers<00:02:57.750> to

see eventually did it cost back I did a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.190 
see eventually did it cost back I did a
here<00:03:11.730> across<00:03:11.940> like<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.270> garlic<00:03:12.420> throw<00:03:12.720> but

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
here across like the garlic throw but

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.710 
here across like the garlic throw but
then<00:03:13.380> guess<00:03:13.710> what<00:03:13.800> my<00:03:14.460> friend<00:03:14.610> DC's<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.630> am

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
then guess what my friend DC's and I am

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.130 
then guess what my friend DC's and I am
stinking<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> soloing<00:03:16.710> and<00:03:16.970> yeah<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.840> wasn't

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
stinking a soloing and yeah that wasn't

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.040 
stinking a soloing and yeah that wasn't
fun<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:20.970> taking<00:03:21.360> about<00:03:21.510> damage

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
fun so I I was taking about damage

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.870 
fun so I I was taking about damage
eventually<00:03:23.040> managed<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.370> kill<00:03:23.550> crew<00:03:23.730> all

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
eventually managed to kill crew all

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.340 
eventually managed to kill crew all
using<00:03:24.150> Rabia<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.960> thought<00:03:25.050> we<00:03:25.170> should<00:03:25.290> I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
using Rabia and I thought we should I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.480 
using Rabia and I thought we should I
get<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.500> nice<00:03:25.740> ways<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.190> thought<00:03:26.280> yeah

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
get on nice ways and I thought yeah

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.790 
get on nice ways and I thought yeah
let's<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:26.850> do<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.470> basically<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.680> had<00:03:28.770> a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
let's just do it and basically I had a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.320 
let's just do it and basically I had a
tank<00:03:29.310> all<00:03:29.430> these<00:03:29.550> prisons<00:03:29.850> because<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.150> can't

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
tank all these prisons because you can't

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.970 
tank all these prisons because you can't
let<00:03:30.480> yourself<00:03:30.540> out<00:03:30.960> so<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.530> had<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.740> sit<00:03:31.950> there

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
let yourself out so I had to sit there

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.430 
let yourself out so I had to sit there
taking<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.820> damage<00:03:33.180> but<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.690> did<00:03:34.080> do<00:03:34.230> some

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
taking the damage but I did do some

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.830 
taking the damage but I did do some
decent<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:35.130> was<00:03:35.820> using<00:03:36.000> for<00:03:36.120> criminal<00:03:36.540> bullets

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
decent I was using for criminal bullets

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.510 
decent I was using for criminal bullets
before<00:03:36.960> I'm<00:03:37.320> gonna<00:03:37.440> be<00:03:37.530> brewed<00:03:37.860> down<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.340> bet

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
before I'm gonna be brewed down I bet

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.640 
before I'm gonna be brewed down I bet
these<00:03:38.850> rubies<00:03:39.270> because<00:03:39.570> even<00:03:40.470> though<00:03:40.560> you

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
these rubies because even though you

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.170 
these rubies because even though you
brewed<00:03:40.860> down<00:03:41.070> your<00:03:41.280> stuff<00:03:41.520> Ruby<00:03:41.760> expect<00:03:42.000> every

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
brewed down your stuff Ruby expect every

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.060 
brewed down your stuff Ruby expect every
so<00:03:42.300> often<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.600> hit<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> decent<00:03:43.230> hit<00:03:43.380> so

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
so often it hit a decent hit so

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.310 
so often it hit a decent hit so
therefore<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.760> seemed<00:03:45.060> better<00:03:45.240> and<00:03:45.990> that<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.140> I

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
therefore I seemed better and that is I

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.870 
therefore I seemed better and that is I
everyone<00:03:46.560> over<00:03:46.830> here<00:03:46.980> just<00:03:47.160> cuz<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.550> mean<00:03:47.790> we

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
everyone over here just cuz I mean we

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.310 
everyone over here just cuz I mean we
friended<00:03:48.210> DC's<00:03:48.510> somewhere<00:03:48.870> over<00:03:48.990> here

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
friended DC's somewhere over here

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.260 
friended DC's somewhere over here
and<00:03:49.530> then<00:03:50.010> he<00:03:50.070> eventually<00:03:50.490> managed<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.120> log

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
and then he eventually managed to log

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.140 
and then he eventually managed to log
back<00:03:51.450> in<00:03:51.600> which<00:03:52.020> is<00:03:52.050> very<00:03:52.410> annoying<00:03:52.710> of<00:03:52.920> him

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
back in which is very annoying of him

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.580 
back in which is very annoying of him
can<00:03:54.150> ruin<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.600> killer<00:03:54.780> bit<00:03:54.990> but<00:03:55.170> then<00:03:55.320> went

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
can ruin the killer bit but then went

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.020 
can ruin the killer bit but then went
back<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.830> brew<00:03:55.950> criminal<00:03:56.250> Bulls<00:03:56.460> and<00:03:56.610> as<00:03:56.940> you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
back to brew criminal Bulls and as you

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.610 
back to brew criminal Bulls and as you
can<00:03:57.180> see<00:03:57.300> they<00:03:57.420> do<00:03:57.570> hit<00:03:57.780> they<00:03:58.230> are<00:03:58.350> pretty

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
can see they do hit they are pretty

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.110 
can see they do hit they are pretty
accurate<00:03:58.830> because<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.580> fact<00:03:59.790> they're<00:03:59.970> so

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
accurate because of the fact they're so

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.960 
accurate because of the fact they're so
good<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.540> stats<00:04:00.870> wise<00:04:01.490> like<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.670> strength

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
good in stats wise like the strength

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.640 
good in stats wise like the strength
means<00:04:03.240> they<00:04:03.420> do<00:04:03.480> hit<00:04:03.780> pretty<00:04:04.080> good<00:04:04.170> hits<00:04:04.470> it's

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
means they do hit pretty good hits it's

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.620 
means they do hit pretty good hits it's
generally<00:04:05.180> 300-400<00:04:06.180> as<00:04:06.270> under<00:04:06.420> stuff

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
generally 300-400 as under stuff

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.870 
generally 300-400 as under stuff
eventually<00:04:07.500> we're<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.010> space<00:04:08.250> down<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.790> then

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
eventually we're I space down and then

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.900 
eventually we're I space down and then
go<00:04:09.000> under<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.360> glacis<00:04:09.680> but<00:04:10.680> now<00:04:11.370> obviously<00:04:11.850> on

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
go under the glacis but now obviously on

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.550 
go under the glacis but now obviously on
the<00:04:12.000> sours<00:04:12.300> face<00:04:12.480> giving<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.870> next<00:04:13.170> kill<00:04:13.350> you

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the sours face giving a next kill you

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.470 
the sours face giving a next kill you
use<00:04:13.770> diamonds<00:04:14.100> normally<00:04:14.730> instead<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.180> rubies

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
use diamonds normally instead of rubies

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.630 
use diamonds normally instead of rubies
now<00:04:16.170> this<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.500> because<00:04:16.770> Ruby<00:04:17.130> spec<00:04:17.310> starts

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
now this is because Ruby spec starts

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.360 
now this is because Ruby spec starts
hitting<00:04:17.880> below<00:04:18.030> five<00:04:18.359> hundreds<00:04:18.810> because<00:04:19.020> of

hitting below five hundreds because of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.039 
hitting below five hundreds because of

kept messing it up but Julie sees is
easily<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.240> hardest<00:04:29.389> they<00:04:29.600> need<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.840> take

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
easily the hardest they need to take

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.050 
easily the hardest they need to take
down<00:04:30.199> with<00:04:30.380> her<00:04:30.500> like<00:04:31.250> getting<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:31.669> tap<00:04:31.850> it's

down with her like getting a tap it's
such<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.270> nuisance<00:04:32.570> but<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:34.760> real<00:04:34.910> criminal

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
such a nuisance but the real criminal

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.909 
such a nuisance but the real criminal
bolts<00:04:35.510> because<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.320> fact<00:04:36.530> we<00:04:36.650> don't<00:04:36.770> you

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
bolts because the fact we don't you

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.200 
bolts because the fact we don't you
you're<00:04:37.130> not<00:04:37.190> meant<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.430> use<00:04:37.580> rubies<00:04:37.880> are

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
you're not meant to use rubies are

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.790 
you're not meant to use rubies are
spheres<00:04:38.540> when<00:04:39.139> you're<00:04:39.260> good<00:04:39.350> when<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.530> brew

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
spheres when you're good when you brew

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.960 
spheres when you're good when you brew
down<00:04:40.040> because<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.460> fact<00:04:40.610> you<00:04:40.669> can<00:04:40.760> still

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
down because of the fact you can still

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.450 
down because of the fact you can still
speck<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:42.020> we'll<00:04:42.620> use<00:04:42.770> for<00:04:42.979> criminal<00:04:43.280> books

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
speck so we'll use for criminal books

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.280 
speck so we'll use for criminal books
and<00:04:43.699> we<00:04:44.090> expected<00:04:44.660> them<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.810> be<00:04:44.930> better<00:04:45.169> than

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
and we expected them to be better than

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.200 
and we expected them to be better than
diamonds<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.830> as<00:04:46.520> you'll<00:04:46.699> see<00:04:46.729> now<00:04:47.000> they

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
diamonds and as you'll see now they

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.990 
diamonds and as you'll see now they
really<00:04:47.540> are<00:04:47.690> like<00:04:48.590> we<00:04:49.310> call<00:04:49.520> a<00:04:49.550> spectrum<00:04:49.760> and

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
really are like we call a spectrum and

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.460 
really are like we call a spectrum and
obviously<00:04:50.449> switch<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:50.810> pro<00:04:50.900> criminal<00:04:51.229> bullets

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
obviously switch to pro criminal bullets

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.230 
obviously switch to pro criminal bullets
and<00:04:51.620> as<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:51.979> can<00:04:52.100> see<00:04:52.160> they<00:04:52.820> are<00:04:53.000> hitting

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
and as you can see they are hitting

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.460 
and as you can see they are hitting
pretty<00:04:53.780> damn<00:04:54.020> good

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
pretty damn good

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.950 
pretty damn good
I<00:04:54.500> mean<00:04:54.949> Diamond<00:04:55.460> bolts<00:04:55.789> will<00:04:55.910> generally<00:04:56.389> hit

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
I mean Diamond bolts will generally hit

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.629 
I mean Diamond bolts will generally hit
sometimes<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.680> hit<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.830> lot<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.070> zeros<00:04:58.430> and

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
sometimes and hit a lot of zeros and

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.120 
sometimes and hit a lot of zeros and
then<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.240> specs<00:04:59.600> all<00:04:59.810> hit<00:04:59.990> decent<00:05:00.320> but<00:05:00.590> these

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
then the specs all hit decent but these

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.129 
then the specs all hit decent but these
bolts<00:05:01.400> up<00:05:01.669> these<00:05:02.150> things<00:05:02.600> are<00:05:02.690> hit<00:05:02.840> really

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
bolts up these things are hit really

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.890 
bolts up these things are hit really
good<00:05:03.440> on<00:05:03.560> this<00:05:03.680> face<00:05:03.949> I<00:05:04.160> honestly<00:05:04.910> hit<00:05:05.270> good<00:05:05.479> no

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
good on this face I honestly hit good no

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.180 
good on this face I honestly hit good no
your<00:05:06.050> friend<00:05:06.260> asked<00:05:06.380> for<00:05:06.500> a<00:05:06.530> bruise<00:05:06.740> there<00:05:07.010> cuz

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
your friend asked for a bruise there cuz

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.439 
your friend asked for a bruise there cuz
he<00:05:07.280> tanked<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.550> full-blood<00:05:08.000> face<00:05:08.180> pretty

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
he tanked the full-blood face pretty

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.990 
he tanked the full-blood face pretty
much<00:05:08.630> dropped<00:05:09.530> some<00:05:09.710> but<00:05:09.919> they<00:05:10.580> did<00:05:10.789> work

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
much dropped some but they did work

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.610 
much dropped some but they did work
really<00:05:11.030> well<00:05:11.389> serving<00:05:11.870> as<00:05:12.050> a<00:05:12.110> conclusion

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
really well serving as a conclusion

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.040 
really well serving as a conclusion
really<00:05:13.190> that<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.970> bolts<00:05:14.300> are<00:05:14.510> better<00:05:14.780> for<00:05:14.960> the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
really that the bolts are better for the

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.170 
really that the bolts are better for the
Reavers<00:05:15.500> because<00:05:16.070> they<00:05:16.220> really<00:05:16.580> hit<00:05:16.699> hard<00:05:16.970> on

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
Reavers because they really hit hard on

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.909 
Reavers because they really hit hard on
the<00:05:17.240> Reavers<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.780> they<00:05:18.350> can<00:05:18.500> help<00:05:18.650> you

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
the Reavers and they can help you

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.250 
the Reavers and they can help you
especially<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.729> small<00:05:20.000> teams<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.419> on<00:05:20.930> xerus

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
especially in small teams and on xerus

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.469 
especially in small teams and on xerus
face<00:05:21.440> however<00:05:21.710> obviously<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.850> disadvantages

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
face however obviously the disadvantages

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.850 
face however obviously the disadvantages
the<00:05:23.660> cost<00:05:23.870> at<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.139> minute<00:05:24.380> that<00:05:24.470> obviously

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
the cost at the minute that obviously

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.800 
the cost at the minute that obviously
the<00:05:24.979> custom<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.430> 5k<00:05:25.910> energy<00:05:26.240> at<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.479> moment

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
the custom like 5k energy at the moment

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.050 
the custom like 5k energy at the moment
but<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.680> assume<00:05:28.130> they'll<00:05:28.280> be<00:05:28.370> coming<00:05:28.610> down<00:05:28.760> and

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
but I assume they'll be coming down and

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.610 
but I assume they'll be coming down and
hopefully<00:05:29.750> there<00:05:29.900> might<00:05:30.020> be<00:05:30.050> fat<00:05:30.289> and<00:05:30.410> I'm

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
hopefully there might be fat and I'm

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.379 
hopefully there might be fat and I'm
bolt<00:05:30.889> now<00:05:31.310> obviously<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.639> can't<00:05:32.000> pick<00:05:32.180> them<00:05:32.300> up

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
bolt now obviously a can't pick them up

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.969 
bolt now obviously a can't pick them up
so<00:05:32.599> that's<00:05:32.750> another<00:05:32.930> disadvantage<00:05:33.500> but<00:05:33.860> there

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
so that's another disadvantage but there

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.670 
so that's another disadvantage but there
should<00:05:34.099> be<00:05:34.220> good<00:05:34.400> in<00:05:34.520> duo's<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.240> trios<00:05:35.680> so

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
should be good in duo's and trios so

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.870 
should be good in duo's and trios so
thanks<00:05:37.070> for<00:05:37.130> watching<00:05:37.400> guys<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.580> I'll<00:05:37.849> see
