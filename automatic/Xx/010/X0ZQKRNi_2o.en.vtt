00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.299
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.350
 proposes to make a cake shaped 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.050
 Easter lamb 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.230
 for that we need 160 g of flour 1 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.380
 sachet of baking powder 120 g of 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.840
 soft butter 110 g of sugar mixed with 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.210
 10 g vanilla sugar from big games and 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.210
 a pinch of salt and of course he's us 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.800
 will need a lamb-shaped mold 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.220
 for a start let's separate the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.220
 yellow whites 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.809
 we will beat the whites with snow 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.940
 roughly half the sugar one is 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.559
 not have to measure so we start 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.989
 a little bit to beat is like that 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.649
 start to lather we add we pull 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.649
 half of the sugar 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.409
 we get snow whites that get 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.899
 hold well that they are well shining 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.110
 its shape a little bird's beak as one 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.000
 can see it here we'll let the man 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.890
 white side and we will take care of 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 yellow now in another bowl 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.590
 we will mix the yellows with the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.009
 remaining sugar we will do quickly 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 a little whiten with a fork 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.700
 then we will add another small 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.310
 pinch of salt still very important 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.580
 in the same sugar cakes and then the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.890
 Butter 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.159
 so we check clubeurs is very soft 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.380
 possibly need is the password 10 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.810
 one second in the microwave 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.420
 we then add our butter 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.729
 ointment with two mixed yellows 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.030
 little by little so as al butter 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.030
 molten 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.560
 it will help a little time and 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.270
 well incorporate butter and yolks 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.850
 of eggs to avoid having pieces 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.500
 of butter they banana or of course if 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.560
 we want we can also do it with a whip 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.560
 electric 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.470
 once you have a nice cream like 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.090
 we will add flour and yeast 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.680
 chemical so to make it easier 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.980
 will put the baking powder in the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.980
 flour 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.160
 we have a very thick leg we go 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.370
 incorporate the whites in so already 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.680
 to start we will take a small 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.860
 part of white 2 that we will mix a 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.030
 little bit vigorously between 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:56.240
 quotes to relax a little paw 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:58.040
 here and hop we continue to incorporate 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.400
 delicately story of not breaking too much 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.400
 whites 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.540
 now we will pour the dough into the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.340
 mold so less well buttered and poured 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.340
 the dough in directly 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.280
 then we read a little bit of that hop on 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.440
 support a little bit like that it helps a 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.830
 looters entered everywhere in the recesses 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.870
 mold does not go until it's normal 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.670
 it will swell when I bake you 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.209
 advise to put the mold on a 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.000
 slap 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.860
 what we normally never know there 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.600
 is not leaking but still 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.570
 avoid having to clean any oven 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:50.239
 then and stuffed for about 45 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:52.940
 minutes in a 180 Â° oven at the exit 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.950
 of the oven we pack our cake in a 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.300
 dish towel and let it rest a 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.620
 fifteen minutes before the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.280
 unmold is very important 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.950
 if he has a little swollen we will cut what 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.430
 goes beyond standing story 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.430
 then 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.040
 so we decorated by sprinkling a 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.040
 little bit of icing sugar 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.940
 and here we get a Easter lamb 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.940
 very cute
