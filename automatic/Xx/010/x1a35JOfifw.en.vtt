00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.360 

six<00:00:47.370> string<00:00:47.640> open<00:00:48.480> twice<00:00:52.070> six<00:00:53.070> string<00:00:53.250> open

six string open twice six string open
twice<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> full<00:00:56.219> band

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.619 
twice and if you do it's not a full band
but<00:00:56.760> happened<00:00:58.250> on<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.969> second<00:01:00.270> fret<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
but happened on the second fret on the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.969 
but happened on the second fret on the
sixth<00:01:01.170> string<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> half

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
sixth string and then you get a half

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.700 
sixth string and then you get a half
pound<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> second<00:01:05.850> second<00:01:06.510> fret<00:01:06.710> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
pound on the second second fret you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.250 
pound on the second second fret you
carry<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.369> band<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> first<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:12.540> then

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
carry on that band to the first and then

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.149 
carry on that band to the first and then
you<00:01:13.320> open<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> bin<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:20.900> there's<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
you open up to the bin and there's a

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
you open up to the bin and there's a
kind<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.369> verse<00:01:23.960> after<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:27.170> very

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
kind of a verse after that and it's very

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.620 
kind of a verse after that and it's very
very<00:01:28.290> similar<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.659> what<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:31.979> showed<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
very similar to what I just showed you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.249 
very similar to what I just showed you
so<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> only<00:01:35.790> difference<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.840> got<00:01:36.990> two

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so the only difference is it's got two

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
so the only difference is it's got two
power<00:01:37.500> cords<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.460> how<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.790> those

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
power cords and this is how that those

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.200 
power cords and this is how that those
powerful<00:01:42.450> tool<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.729> same<00:01:44.939> for

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
powerful tool so you do that same for

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.969 
powerful tool so you do that same for
you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.189> either<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.220> intro<00:01:48.500> like<00:01:49.500> six

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you know the either the intro like six

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
you know the either the intro like six
seven<00:01:50.340> times<00:01:53.270> these<00:01:54.270> are<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.570> 6<00:01:54.899> 7<00:01:54.990> times

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
seven times these are about 6 7 times

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.810 
seven times these are about 6 7 times
and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.369> goes<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:58.280> verse<00:01:59.280> riff<00:02:01.820> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and then it goes to the verse riff and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
and then it goes to the verse riff and
so<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.229> standard<00:02:04.560> tune<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.130> not

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
so this this is a standard tune it's not

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.260 
so this this is a standard tune it's not
the<00:02:05.990> mmm<00:02:06.990> tune<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.649> supposed<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.920> be

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
the mmm tune it's supposed to be

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
the mmm tune it's supposed to be
standard<00:02:09.270> sham<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> sound<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
standard sham so it's going to sound a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.010 
standard sham so it's going to sound a
little<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.520> no<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> little<00:02:12.540> way<00:02:12.750> off

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
little or no not a little way off

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.699 
little or no not a little way off
consent<00:02:13.680> way<00:02:13.950> off<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.140> do<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.440> same
