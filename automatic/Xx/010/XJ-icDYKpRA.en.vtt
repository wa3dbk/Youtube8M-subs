in this video I'm kind of going to do a
little<00:00:15.469> something<00:00:15.889> different<00:00:16.039> than<00:00:16.730> what<00:00:16.939> I

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
here in the gameplay obviously I was

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.329 
here in the gameplay obviously I was
just<00:00:51.290> messing<00:00:51.559> around<00:00:51.589> I<00:00:51.920> was<00:00:52.040> going<00:00:52.159> to<00:00:52.220> come

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
just messing around I was going to come

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.280 
just messing around I was going to come

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.479 
down here and kind of breed my wolves so
I<00:00:54.320> could<00:00:54.500> get<00:00:54.619> some<00:00:54.830> more<00:00:54.979> because<00:00:55.250> this<00:00:55.339> is

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
I could get some more because this is

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.950 
I could get some more because this is
kind<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.879> let's<00:00:56.119> play<00:00:56.330> world<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.689> I<00:00:56.720> also

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
kind of a let's play world that I also

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.929 
kind of a let's play world that I also
have<00:00:57.320> as<00:00:57.439> well<00:00:57.619> not<00:00:58.189> one<00:00:58.369> where<00:00:58.549> I<00:00:58.580> typically

00:00:58.929 --> 00:00:58.939 
have as well not one where I typically

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:00.520 
have as well not one where I typically
film<00:00:59.239> it<00:00:59.390> however<00:00:59.689> like<00:00:59.900> I<00:00:59.989> said<00:01:00.019> I<00:01:00.260> needed

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
film it however like I said I needed

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.740 
film it however like I said I needed
some<00:01:00.739> gameplay<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:02.000> put<00:01:02.150> in<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.299> background

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
some gameplay to put in the background

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.000 
some gameplay to put in the background
so<00:01:02.960> I<00:01:02.989> was<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:03.290> kind<00:01:03.439> of<00:01:03.500> messing<00:01:03.890> around

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
you hear that it sounded like the door

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.590 
you hear that it sounded like the door
open<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.130> went<00:01:37.400> ahead<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:38.240> was<00:01:38.330> like<00:01:38.479> wait

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
open so I went ahead and I was like wait

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.000

what's<00:01:38.810> going<00:01:39.080> on<00:01:39.170> here<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.650> saw<00:01:39.830> this

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
what's going on here and I saw this

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.680 
what's going on here and I saw this
sheep<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.700> thought<00:01:40.940> that<00:01:41.180> maybe<00:01:41.390> there

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
sheep and I thought that maybe there

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.880 
sheep and I thought that maybe there
might<00:01:41.780> be<00:01:41.840> somebody<00:01:42.110> else<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.530> game<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:42.830> I

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
might be somebody else in the game so I

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.500 
might be somebody else in the game so I
checked<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:43.280> there<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.180> didn't<00:01:44.420> see

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
checked it there and I didn't see

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.120 
checked it there and I didn't see
anybody<00:01:44.690> else<00:01:44.990> but<00:01:45.290> now<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:45.530> can<00:01:45.860> hear<00:01:45.979> that

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
anybody else but now we can hear that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.890 
anybody else but now we can hear that
the<00:01:46.250> dogs<00:01:46.490> are<00:01:46.700> actually<00:01:46.850> crying<00:01:47.390> down<00:01:47.690> here

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
the dogs are actually crying down here

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.840 
the dogs are actually crying down here
so<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.080> came<00:01:48.140> down<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:48.890> can<00:01:49.490> see<00:01:49.670> now

there's no lava no kind of heat source
around<00:01:54.140> here<00:01:54.440> that<00:01:54.560> could<00:01:54.680> have<00:01:54.770> lit<00:01:54.950> this

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
around here that could have lit this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.399 
around here that could have lit this
room<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.460> fire<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.450> can't<00:01:56.870> really<00:01:57.049> figure

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
room on fire so I can't really figure

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.260 
room on fire so I can't really figure
out<00:01:57.440> how<00:01:57.799> exactly<00:01:57.830> at<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.850> point<00:01:59.120> in<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
out how exactly at this point in the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.030 
out how exactly at this point in the
video<00:01:59.510> or<00:01:59.720> at<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:00.560> point<00:02:00.770> when<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> was

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
video or at this point when I was

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.460 
video or at this point when I was
playing<00:02:01.220> rather<00:02:01.549> how<00:02:02.270> how<00:02:02.840> these<00:02:03.049> got<00:02:03.200> lit<00:02:03.380> on

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470

fire<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.950> then<00:02:04.070> right<00:02:04.250> there

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
fire and then right there

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.830 
fire and then right there
I<00:02:04.700> don't<00:02:05.120> know<00:02:05.180> if<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.299> guys<00:02:05.390> heard<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.659> but<00:02:05.780> I

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
I don't know if you guys heard it but I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.630 
I don't know if you guys heard it but I
was<00:02:05.990> talking<00:02:06.260> the<00:02:06.560> door<00:02:06.830> actually<00:02:07.159> open<00:02:07.580> her

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
was talking the door actually open her

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.550 
was talking the door actually open her
it<00:02:07.760> sounded<00:02:08.090> like<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.299> door<00:02:08.420> open<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.289> come

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
it sounded like the door open so I come

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.350 
it sounded like the door open so I come
up<00:02:09.590> here<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.920> look<00:02:10.039> at<00:02:10.220> look<00:02:10.580> around<00:02:10.909> and<00:02:11.120> again

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
up here to look at look around and again

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.580

I<00:02:11.390> see<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.720> Sheep<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:12.110> think<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.379> Sheep

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I see the Sheep so I think the Sheep

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.289 
I see the Sheep so I think the Sheep
might<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:12.860> done<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.069> I<00:02:13.159> see<00:02:13.370> my<00:02:13.489> wolf<00:02:13.700> but

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
might have done it I see my wolf but

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.390 
might have done it I see my wolf but
just<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.930> be<00:02:15.019> sure<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.260> do<00:02:15.409> go<00:02:15.680> outside<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.250> look

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
just to be sure I do go outside to look

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.670 
just to be sure I do go outside to look
around<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.940> right<00:02:17.540> about<00:02:17.810> here<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.230> where<00:02:18.590> it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
around and right about here is where it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.589 
around and right about here is where it
gets<00:02:18.829> really<00:02:19.010> weird<00:02:19.129> so<00:02:19.609> I'm<00:02:19.819> not<00:02:20.239> sure<00:02:20.450> how

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
gets really weird so I'm not sure how

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.119 
gets really weird so I'm not sure how
