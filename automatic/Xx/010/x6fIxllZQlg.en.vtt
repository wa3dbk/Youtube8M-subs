cable<00:01:00.120> will<00:01:00.629> sit<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.010> may<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.280> why

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
cable will sit now you may think why

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.870 
cable will sit now you may think why
would<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.969> ever<00:01:03.000> need<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> these<00:01:03.890> well<00:01:04.890> if

cables that move about or need securing

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.100 
cables that move about or need securing
this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> particularly<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> case<00:01:18.659> with

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110

the<00:01:36.600> cable<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.650> then<00:01:40.650> close<00:01:41.600> round

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
the cable in here and then close round

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.080 
the cable in here and then close round
like<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> cable<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.530> fitted<00:01:47.399> snugly

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
clothing maybe on a jacket pocket or at

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.510 
clothing maybe on a jacket pocket or at
the<00:01:57.119> jacket<00:01:57.540> itself<00:01:57.930> because<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.040> magnets

the jacket itself because it's magnets
they<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.119> actually<00:02:00.270> magnetize<00:02:01.310> through

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
they will actually magnetize through

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.289 
they will actually magnetize through
items<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.710> you're<00:02:04.710> not<00:02:04.829> really<00:02:05.070> limited<00:02:05.640> in

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
terms too much of the thickness in which

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.800 
terms too much of the thickness in which
these<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:10.430> magnetize<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:12.090> each<00:02:12.239> other<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
these will magnetize to each other so
