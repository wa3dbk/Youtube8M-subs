00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
own unique armor style this gives them a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.890 
own unique armor style this gives them a
distinctive<00:03:48.400> look<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.790> battlefield<00:03:49.300> but

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
distinctive look on the battlefield but

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.509 
distinctive look on the battlefield but
it<00:03:49.989> works<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.349> same<00:03:50.379> way<00:03:50.590> as<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.220> rest<00:03:51.400> of

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
it works the same way as the rest of

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.920 
it works the same way as the rest of
ex-cons<00:03:52.000> armor<00:03:52.330> technology

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.839 

so<00:03:58.500> thin<00:03:58.739> man<00:03:58.890> is<00:03:58.980> going<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.159> drop<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.519> behind

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
so thin man is going to drop in behind

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.630 
so thin man is going to drop in behind
us<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.269> worse<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.689> worse<00:04:01.069> but<00:04:02.069> our<00:04:02.280> met<00:04:02.489> can

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.369 
us so worse and worse but our met can
still<00:04:02.849> use<00:04:02.969> this<00:04:03.090> kinetic<00:04:03.420> strike<00:04:03.780> module<00:04:04.200> and

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
still use this kinetic strike module and

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.309 
still use this kinetic strike module and
tshirts<00:04:05.069> berserker<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.609> lesson

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.009 

alright<00:04:12.319> so<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.470> berserker<00:04:12.799> is<00:04:12.950> down<00:04:13.220> but<00:04:14.019> the

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
alright so the berserker is down but the

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.289 
alright so the berserker is down but the
thin<00:04:15.200> man<00:04:15.379> is<00:04:15.500> still<00:04:15.680> there<00:04:15.890> now<00:04:16.820> our<00:04:17.000> sniper

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
thin man is still there now our sniper

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.330 
thin man is still there now our sniper
however<00:04:17.810> has<00:04:18.109> one<00:04:18.410> of<00:04:18.530> dr.<00:04:18.799> shen's<00:04:19.100> new

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
however has one of dr. shen's new

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.189 
however has one of dr. shen's new
inventions<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.239> that's<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.539> needle<00:04:20.900> grenade

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
inventions and that's the needle grenade

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.499 
inventions and that's the needle grenade
so<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.769> needle<00:04:22.009> grenade<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.550> like<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> regular

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
so the needle grenade is like a regular

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.189 
so the needle grenade is like a regular
grenade<00:04:23.930> but<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.889> has<00:04:25.009> a<00:04:25.039> huge<00:04:25.400> blast<00:04:25.669> radius

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
grenade but it has a huge blast radius

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.290 
grenade but it has a huge blast radius
however<00:04:27.199> it<00:04:27.530> also<00:04:27.590> obeys<00:04:28.009> cover<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.030> thin

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
however it also obeys cover so the thin

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.320 
however it also obeys cover so the thin
man<00:04:29.449> will<00:04:29.600> be<00:04:29.690> hurt<00:04:29.930> but<00:04:30.350> our<00:04:30.470> soldier<00:04:30.800> is<00:04:30.919> safe

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330
