teach you another origami thing how to
make<00:00:07.919> an<00:00:08.069> origami<00:00:08.340> spine<00:00:09.530> you<00:00:10.530> need<00:00:10.800> several

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
make an origami spine you need several

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.379 
make an origami spine you need several
pieces<00:00:11.730> similar<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.080> size<00:00:14.179> well<00:00:15.179> it

pieces similar to this size well it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.060 
pieces similar to this size well it
depends<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> size<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.590> want<00:00:16.619> your

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
depends on the size that you want your

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.760 
depends on the size that you want your
thing<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.420> yeah<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:19.320> need<00:00:19.470> several

thing to be but yeah you need several

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.540 
thing to be but yeah you need several
pieces<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.310> paper<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.710> they<00:00:22.710> should<00:00:23.039> be<00:00:23.279> about

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
pieces of paper and they should be about

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.429 
pieces of paper and they should be about
this<00:00:23.880> shape<00:00:24.300> okay

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this shape okay

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.509 
this shape okay
like<00:00:26.010> probably<00:00:26.279> a4<00:00:26.970> size<00:00:27.630> down<00:00:28.230> or<00:00:28.710> whatever

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
like probably a4 size down or whatever

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.229 
like probably a4 size down or whatever
and<00:00:30.260> what<00:00:31.260> you're<00:00:31.439> gonna<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.309> well<00:00:33.030> it's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and what you're gonna do is well it's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.560 
and what you're gonna do is well it's
quite<00:00:33.480> quite<00:00:34.320> simple<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.890> basic<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.730> what

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
quite quite simple and basic really what

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.880 
quite quite simple and basic really what
you're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.500> fold

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you're going to do is you can just fold

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.180 
you're going to do is you can just fold
it<00:00:38.070> across<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.590> goes<00:00:40.800> into<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it across so that it goes into a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.000 
it across so that it goes into a
triangle<00:00:41.579> thing<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.989> if<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.440> held<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> against

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
triangle thing so if I held it against

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.760 
triangle thing so if I held it against
the<00:00:44.070> light<00:00:44.160> you'd<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> triangle<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
the light you'd see the triangle and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.319 
the light you'd see the triangle and
then<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.190> unfold<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.120> then

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
then you're gonna unfold it and then

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.770 
then you're gonna unfold it and then
fold<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> across<00:00:48.870> again<00:00:50.239> but<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> other<00:00:51.510> way

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
fold it across again but the other way

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.400 
fold it across again but the other way
and<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:53.629> way<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:56.660> fold<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and that way you can fold this into a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.779 
and that way you can fold this into a
triangle<00:00:59.780> not<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> triangle<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.670> get

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
triangle not a triangle so that you get

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.920 
triangle not a triangle so that you get
this<00:01:02.969> X<00:01:03.239> shape<00:01:04.549> like<00:01:05.549> The<00:01:05.880> X<00:01:06.119> Factor<00:01:06.659> or

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this X shape like The X Factor or

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.399 
this X shape like The X Factor or
whatever<00:01:07.729> yeah<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> xtreme

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
whatever yeah so you get the xtreme

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
whatever yeah so you get the xtreme
you've<00:01:11.369> got<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.970> house<00:01:12.659> shape<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:15.390> fold

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you've got this house shape and you fold

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:36.639 
you've got this house shape and you fold
these<00:01:16.619> flaps<00:01:16.680> bits<00:01:17.750> down<00:01:23.240> like<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.880 

once<00:01:37.280> you've<00:01:37.490> done<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:38.649> you're<00:01:39.649> going<00:01:39.679> to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
once you've done that you're going to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.069 
once you've done that you're going to
fold<00:01:40.130> these<00:01:40.460> bits<00:01:43.780> roughly<00:01:44.780> into<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.229> middle

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
fold these bits roughly into the middle

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:54.340 
fold these bits roughly into the middle
so<00:01:48.079> it's<00:01:48.259> gonna<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:50.979> see<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:53.350> then

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
so it's gonna be like that see and then

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:06.070 
so it's gonna be like that see and then
like<00:01:58.929> that

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.920 

okay<00:02:06.770> unfold<00:02:07.250> them<00:02:07.430> halfway<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:09.940> if<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.300> you

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
okay unfold them halfway and if and you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.900 
okay unfold them halfway and if and you
have<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.230> make<00:02:12.380> several<00:02:12.680> more<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:13.190> these<00:02:13.370> for

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
have to make several more of these for

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.860 
have to make several more of these for
it<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.150> be<00:02:14.330> be<00:02:14.930> able<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.320> be<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> spine<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.870> they

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
it to be be able to be a spine and they

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.170 
it to be be able to be a spine and they
all<00:02:18.140> interlock<00:02:18.680> into<00:02:19.430> each<00:02:19.580> other<00:02:19.850> like<00:02:20.690> so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
all interlock into each other like so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.480 
all interlock into each other like so
okay<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.750> there's<00:02:23.990> your<00:02:24.230> spine<00:02:24.590> I'll<00:02:24.980> just<00:02:25.250> add

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
okay so there's your spine I'll just add

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.040 
okay so there's your spine I'll just add
this<00:02:25.730> last<00:02:26.090> bit<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.510> be<00:02:29.750> tricky

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
this last bit to it it can be tricky

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.510 
this last bit to it it can be tricky
sometimes<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.620> make<00:02:33.830> absolutely

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
sometimes you have to make absolutely

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.430 
sometimes you have to make absolutely
sure<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:35.000> all<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> folds<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.020> you've<00:02:36.200> done

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
sure that all the folds that you've done

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.980 
sure that all the folds that you've done
are<00:02:36.830> very<00:02:37.550> clear<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.320> press<00:02:39.560> down<00:02:39.890> and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
are very clear so you press down and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.710 
are very clear so you press down and
then<00:02:41.990> you<00:02:42.200> let<00:02:42.470> go<00:02:42.500> press<00:02:43.400> down<00:02:43.640> on<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:44.000> thing

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
then you let go press down on this thing

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.760 
then you let go press down on this thing
squeeze<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.350> make<00:02:45.650> sure<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.100> it's<00:02:46.880> okay<00:02:47.360> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
squeeze it make sure that it's okay and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.000 
squeeze it make sure that it's okay and
then<00:02:49.900> let's<00:02:50.900> see<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.260> can<00:02:51.470> get<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.830> better

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
then let's see if I can get a better

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:06.130 
then let's see if I can get a better
angle<00:02:52.520> on<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:57.340> slot<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.610> in<00:03:00.940> there<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.930> it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
angle on this you slot it in there so it

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:22.300 
angle on this you slot it in there so it
goes<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:15.190> like<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:21.680> paper<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.130> too

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
goes in like like that this paper is too

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.110 
goes in like like that this paper is too
flimsy<00:03:22.610> for<00:03:22.970> me<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.239> do<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.510> properly<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:25.120> I'll

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
flimsy for me to do it properly but I'll

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:40.120 
flimsy for me to do it properly but I'll
give<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.570> try<00:03:26.780> again<00:03:29.140> like<00:03:36.310> like<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:39.130> no

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
give it a try again like like that no

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.660 
give it a try again like like that no
wait<00:03:40.340> ah<00:03:40.520> damn<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.770> it's<00:03:42.770> it's<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.190> bit<00:03:43.340> tricky
