00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
hi everyone today we're going to learn

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.900 
hi everyone today we're going to learn
how<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> make<00:00:06.450> spiral<00:00:07.020> flowers<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:08.280> we're

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
how to make spiral flowers so we're

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.070 
how to make spiral flowers so we're
going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.120> make<00:00:09.240> flowers<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.780> look<00:00:09.809> like

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
going to make flowers that look like

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.549 
going to make flowers that look like
this<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:11.509> all<00:00:12.509> we're<00:00:12.660> going<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> need<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
this and all we're going to need is a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.150 
this and all we're going to need is a
circle<00:00:13.950> punch<00:00:14.160> scissors<00:00:15.120> paper<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.379> glue<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
circle punch scissors paper and glue and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.470 
circle punch scissors paper and glue and
we're<00:00:17.279> actually<00:00:17.430> Annie's<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> tape<00:00:18.210> runner

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
we're actually Annie's a tape runner

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.240 
we're actually Annie's a tape runner
because<00:00:18.900> if<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.529> away<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.890> using<00:00:20.039> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
because if I can get away with using a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.279 
because if I can get away with using a
tape<00:00:20.430> runner<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.910> will<00:00:21.390> rather<00:00:21.840> than<00:00:22.109> use

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
tape runner I will rather than use

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.590 
tape runner I will rather than use
liquid<00:00:22.560> glue<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:24.210> you're<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> do

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
liquid glue so what you're going to do

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.820 
liquid glue so what you're going to do
is<00:00:24.720> you're<00:00:24.840> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> cut<00:00:25.619> your

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
is you're going to want to cut your

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
is you're going to want to cut your
circle<00:00:26.279> into<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> spiral<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.599> way<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> did<00:00:28.080> this

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
circle into a spiral the way I did this

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.269 
circle into a spiral the way I did this
as<00:00:28.550> I've<00:00:29.550> taken<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.359> circle<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.250> I've<00:00:32.250> just

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
as I've taken a circle and I've just

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.950 
as I've taken a circle and I've just
started<00:00:33.530> cutting<00:00:34.530> around<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.950> circle<00:00:35.960> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
started cutting around the circle you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
started cutting around the circle you
don't<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.620> too<00:00:37.980> thin<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
don't want to make it too thin of a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.130 
don't want to make it too thin of a
spiral<00:00:38.760> because<00:00:39.090> then<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> won't<00:00:39.719> work<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
spiral because then it won't work and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
spiral because then it won't work and
you'll<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.530> frustrated<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> it'll<00:00:44.489> take

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you'll just get frustrated so it'll take

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.130 
you'll just get frustrated so it'll take
a<00:00:44.670> little<00:00:44.850> practice<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.110> right

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
a little practice to get just the right

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.940 
a little practice to get just the right
thickness<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:47.370> i<00:00:48.289> bet<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.379> guys<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.860> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
thickness but i bet you guys can do it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.870 
thickness but i bet you guys can do it
on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> first<00:00:50.280> try

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880 

and<00:00:57.970> this<00:00:58.630> is<00:00:58.810> the<00:00:58.930> first<00:00:58.960> time<00:00:59.440> i've<00:00:59.680> used

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
and this is the first time i've used

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.010 
and this is the first time i've used
this<00:01:00.310> thin<00:01:00.580> of<00:01:00.670> paper<00:01:00.940> so<00:01:01.390> we're<00:01:01.630> going<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.840> see

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
this thin of paper so we're going to see

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.950 
this thin of paper so we're going to see
if<00:01:02.140> how<00:01:02.320> this<00:01:02.560> works<00:01:03.330> okay<00:01:04.330> so<00:01:04.390> then<00:01:04.660> once<00:01:04.780> we

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
if how this works okay so then once we

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.920 
if how this works okay so then once we
have<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.170> spiral<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:07.210> we're<00:01:07.360> going<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.540> do<00:01:07.720> is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
have a spiral what we're going to do is

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.370 
have a spiral what we're going to do is
this<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.770> way<00:01:08.830> I<00:01:08.860> do<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.990> take<00:01:10.990> my<00:01:11.170> tape

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
this is the way I do it I take my tape

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380 
this is the way I do it I take my tape
runner<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.950> I'm<00:01:12.190> going<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.640> want<00:01:12.790> to<00:01:12.880> curl<00:01:13.240> it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
runner and I'm going to want to curl it

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.690 
runner and I'm going to want to curl it
up<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:13.990> I'm<00:01:14.170> taking<00:01:14.380> my<00:01:14.710> tape<00:01:14.950> runner<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.430> I'm

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
up so I'm taking my tape runner and I'm

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.870 
up so I'm taking my tape runner and I'm
just<00:01:15.910> going<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:18.120> put<00:01:19.120> tape<00:01:19.540> all<00:01:19.840> along<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
just going to put tape all along the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.630 
just going to put tape all along the
circle<00:01:22.270> okay<00:01:23.140> it's<00:01:24.100> going<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.280> be<00:01:24.340> kind<00:01:24.490> of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
circle okay it's going to be kind of

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.740 
circle okay it's going to be kind of
sticky<00:01:24.910> so<00:01:25.060> if<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.210> don't<00:01:25.390> want<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.570> do<00:01:25.660> it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
sticky so if you don't want to do it

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.150 
sticky so if you don't want to do it
this<00:01:25.840> way<00:01:26.020> just<00:01:26.229> add<00:01:26.380> glue<00:01:26.620> when<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.860> need<00:01:27.010> it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
this way just add glue when you need it

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.820 
this way just add glue when you need it
and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:28.570> I'm<00:01:28.720> going<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.960> start<00:01:29.260> at<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.530> end

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
and then I'm going to start at the end

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.680 
and then I'm going to start at the end
and<00:01:30.160> i'm<00:01:30.369> going<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.550> start<00:01:30.760> curling<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.330> up<00:01:33.690> it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
and i'm going to start curling it up it

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.469 
and i'm going to start curling it up it
takes<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.080> while<00:01:35.229> just<00:01:35.619> a<00:01:35.800> bit<00:01:36.729> of<00:01:36.759> patience<00:01:37.300> to

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
takes a while just a bit of patience to

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.900 
takes a while just a bit of patience to
get<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.900> circle<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.890> get<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.160> flour<00:01:39.340> started

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
get the circle to get the flour started

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.700 
get the circle to get the flour started
but<00:01:40.210> then<00:01:40.330> once<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.690> started<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:41.200> rolls<00:01:41.410> pretty

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
but then once it started it rolls pretty

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.820 
but then once it started it rolls pretty
easily<00:01:42.009> if<00:01:42.869> you're<00:01:43.869> using<00:01:44.050> regular<00:01:44.590> glue

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
easily if you're using regular glue

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.930 
easily if you're using regular glue
you'll<00:01:45.100> just<00:01:45.250> want<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.460> put<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.580> dot<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.820> glue

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
you'll just want to put a dot of glue

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.730 
you'll just want to put a dot of glue
every<00:01:46.390> few<00:01:47.020> every<00:01:47.890> turn<00:01:49.229> okay<00:01:50.229> but<00:01:50.320> since<00:01:50.619> I

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
every few every turn okay but since I

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.230 
every few every turn okay but since I
have<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.009> tape<00:01:51.340> runner<00:01:51.610> I'm<00:01:51.880> just<00:01:52.090> going<00:01:52.210> to

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
have the tape runner I'm just going to

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.969 
have the tape runner I'm just going to
go<00:01:52.300> ahead<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:53.729> keep<00:01:54.729> rolling<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.740> want<00:01:56.890> to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
go ahead and keep rolling it you want to

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.620 
go ahead and keep rolling it you want to
keep<00:01:57.190> that<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.880> want<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.150> keep<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.390> tight

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
keep that you want to keep it tight

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.029 
keep that you want to keep it tight
feeling<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.860> want<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:02.020> center<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.770> stay

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
feeling and you want the center to stay

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.330 
feeling and you want the center to stay
down<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.720> petals<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.500> come<00:02:05.649> up<00:02:05.770> around<00:02:05.920> it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
down and the petals to come up around it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.400 
down and the petals to come up around it
if<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:06.729> makes<00:02:06.789> sense<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.960> new<00:02:08.170> paper

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
if that makes sense so the new paper

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.870 
if that makes sense so the new paper
that<00:02:08.679> I'm<00:02:08.770> rolling<00:02:09.009> up<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.369> actually<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.819> to

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
that I'm rolling up is actually going to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.230 
that I'm rolling up is actually going to
be<00:02:09.940> higher<00:02:10.210> than<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.750> middle<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:13.060> you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
be higher than the middle but if you

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.020 
be higher than the middle but if you
don't<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.600> perfect<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:15.640> going<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.970> make

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
don't have it perfect you going to make

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.250 
don't have it perfect you going to make
a<00:02:16.090> new<00:02:16.240> one<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.630> you're<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:19.810> going<00:02:19.960> to<00:02:20.050> roll

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
a new one so you're just going to roll

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.140 
a new one so you're just going to roll
it<00:02:20.470> keep<00:02:20.680> rolling<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.190> all<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:22.000> around

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
it keep rolling it all the way around

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.980 
it keep rolling it all the way around
until<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.730> get<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.030> end<00:02:25.210> when<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:25.690> get<00:02:25.870> to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
until you get to the end when you get to

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.170 
until you get to the end when you get to
this<00:02:26.110> middle<00:02:26.740> part<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.100> end<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.819> can<00:02:27.970> wait

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
this middle part at the end you can wait

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.280 
this middle part at the end you can wait
you<00:02:28.240> want<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.420> add<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> little<00:02:28.690> bit<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.020> glue

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
you want to add a little bit of glue

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.170 
you want to add a little bit of glue
especially<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.280> are<00:02:30.310> using<00:02:30.640> gluten<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.150> a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
especially if you are using gluten on a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.670 
especially if you are using gluten on a
tape<00:02:31.420> runner<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.840> that's<00:02:32.200> going<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
tape runner and that's going to be the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.809 
tape runner and that's going to be the
bottom<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.130> your<00:02:33.160> flower<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.640> you're<00:02:33.730> just

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
bottom of your flower and you're just

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.750 
bottom of your flower and you're just
going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.060> smash<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.600> kind<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.900> around<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
going to smash it kind of around the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000 
going to smash it kind of around the
bottom<00:02:37.180> part<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.540> your<00:02:37.660> flower<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.920> it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
bottom part of your flower so that it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.230 
bottom part of your flower so that it
goes<00:02:39.720> all<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.780> way<00:02:41.230> around<00:02:41.350> okay<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.430> then

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
goes all the way around okay and then

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.270 
goes all the way around okay and then
kind<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.080> push<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> center<00:02:44.770> towards<00:02:45.130> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
kind of push the center towards the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.130 
kind of push the center towards the
middle<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:47.490> there's<00:02:48.490> your<00:02:48.700> flower<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.990> we

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
middle and there's your flower so we

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.070 
middle and there's your flower so we
have<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.730> red<00:02:51.730> one<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.270> brown<00:02:52.480> one<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.870> far

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
have a red one and a brown one so far

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.030 
have a red one and a brown one so far
and<00:02:53.319> then<00:02:53.470> we'll<00:02:53.590> do<00:02:53.709> one<00:02:53.890> more<00:02:54.069> for<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.459> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and then we'll do one more for you and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.620 
and then we'll do one more for you and
then<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.430> think<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.940> should<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.209> able<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.450> try

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
then I think you should be able to try

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.730 
then I think you should be able to try
it<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:59.470> here's<00:02:59.680> our<00:02:59.800> spiral<00:03:01.380> like<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.410> said

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
it so here's our spiral like I said

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.530 
it so here's our spiral like I said
depending<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.459> what<00:03:03.580> side<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.209> want<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.450> roll

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
depending on what side you want to roll

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.820 
depending on what side you want to roll
I<00:03:04.690> think<00:03:04.900> I'm<00:03:04.990> going<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.170> roll<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.440> up<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:05.650> this

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
I think I'm going to roll it up in this

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.780 
I think I'm going to roll it up in this
way<00:03:06.130> with<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.680> black<00:03:08.920> flowers

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
way with so that the the black flowers

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.550 
way with so that the the black flowers
are<00:03:10.000> showing

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
are showing

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.539 
are showing
so<00:03:12.560> I'm<00:03:12.650> just<00:03:12.799> go<00:03:12.980> ahead<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.220> tape<00:03:13.760> run<00:03:14.000> this

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
so I'm just go ahead and tape run this

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.119 
so I'm just go ahead and tape run this
don't<00:03:16.549> know<00:03:16.670> about<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.000> word<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:18.010> edited<00:03:19.010> a

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
don't know about the word but edited a

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.720 
don't know about the word but edited a
tape<00:03:19.790> run<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:21.310> then<00:03:22.310> I'm<00:03:22.370> going<00:03:22.519> to<00:03:22.549> start

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
tape run and then I'm going to start

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.309 
tape run and then I'm going to start
curling<00:03:22.909> up<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.360> actually<00:03:23.689> might<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.870> easier

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
curling up it actually might be easier

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.979 
curling up it actually might be easier
with<00:03:24.500> thinner<00:03:24.709> paper<00:03:25.510> I've<00:03:26.510> always<00:03:26.720> use

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
with thinner paper I've always use

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.690 
with thinner paper I've always use
thicker<00:03:27.260> cardstock<00:03:27.799> because<00:03:28.129> it<00:03:28.280> seemed<00:03:28.549> that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
thicker cardstock because it seemed that

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.229 
thicker cardstock because it seemed that
that's<00:03:29.060> what<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.299> had<00:03:29.480> scraps<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:31.150> then<00:03:32.150> I'm

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
that's what I had scraps in and then I'm

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.890 
that's what I had scraps in and then I'm
just<00:03:32.329> going<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.569> start<00:03:32.780> curling<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.470> up<00:03:37.900> it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
just going to start curling it up it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.030 
just going to start curling it up it
seems<00:03:39.319> like<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.530> long<00:03:39.739> process<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.250> actually

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
seems like a long process but actually

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.020 
seems like a long process but actually
doesn't<00:03:43.040> take<00:03:43.190> as<00:03:43.370> long<00:03:43.400> as<00:03:43.700> some<00:03:43.879> other

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
doesn't take as long as some other

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.780 
doesn't take as long as some other
flower<00:03:44.329> techniques<00:03:48.159> you<00:03:49.159> can<00:03:49.190> use<00:03:49.370> these<00:03:49.609> on

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
flower techniques you can use these on

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.849 
flower techniques you can use these on
cards<00:03:50.269> on<00:03:50.450> layouts<00:03:50.840> or<00:03:53.200> just<00:03:54.200> have<00:03:54.379> kids<00:03:54.650> make

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
cards on layouts or just have kids make

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.220 
cards on layouts or just have kids make
them<00:03:55.069> with<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:56.510> an<00:03:56.599> activity<00:03:56.870> in<00:03:57.139> the

could<00:04:07.250> also<00:04:07.370> ink<00:04:07.639> your<00:04:07.819> paper<00:04:08.030> before<00:04:08.299> getting

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
could also ink your paper before getting
