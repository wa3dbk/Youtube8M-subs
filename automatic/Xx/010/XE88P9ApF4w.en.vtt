map<00:01:36.479> even<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.409> have<00:01:37.560> long<00:01:37.740> barrel

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
map even if you don't have long barrel

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.960 
map even if you don't have long barrel
on<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:38.850> on

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
on as you can see right here on

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
on as you can see right here on
aftermath<00:01:39.689> or<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:39.990> aftermath<00:01:40.320> turbine<00:01:40.680> which

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
aftermath or not aftermath turbine which

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.950 
aftermath or not aftermath turbine which
is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> biggest<00:01:41.820> map<00:01:42.000> overall<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.689> still

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
is the biggest map overall I can still

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.050 
is the biggest map overall I can still
shoot<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.409> guy<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> longest<00:01:44.729> line<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
shoot the guy with the longest line of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
shoot the guy with the longest line of
sight<00:01:45.240> inside<00:01:45.780> black<00:01:46.020> ops<00:01:46.229> 2<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.649> now<00:01:46.799> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
sight inside black ops 2 right now so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.190 
sight inside black ops 2 right now so
really<00:01:48.090> overall<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> does<00:01:48.659> nothing<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.049> does

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
really overall it does nothing it does

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810 
really overall it does nothing it does
not<00:01:49.350> increase<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:49.860> damage<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.399> said<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
not increase your damage like I said I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.050 
not increase your damage like I said I
tested<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> 3<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.490> 4<00:01:53.700> shot

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
tested it out it has like a 3 to 4 shot

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.870 
tested it out it has like a 3 to 4 shot
with<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> SMG<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> short<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> medium<00:01:56.399> range

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
with the SMG at a short to medium range

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.630 
with the SMG at a short to medium range
to<00:01:57.420> kill<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> 6<00:01:58.469> shots<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> long<00:01:59.189> range<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
to kill and 6 shots at a long range to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.149 
to kill and 6 shots at a long range to
kill<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.719> LMG<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.320> was<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.560> 3<00:02:01.770> shots<00:02:01.979> out

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
kill and for LMG it was like 3 shots out

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.609 
kill and for LMG it was like 3 shots out
of<00:02:02.189> close<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.729> medium<00:02:03.060> range<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.659> 3<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.079> 4<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
of close to medium range in 3 to 4 for a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
of close to medium range in 3 to 4 for a
long<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.310> overall<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:06.030> does<00:02:06.180> no<00:02:06.390> damage

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
long so overall it really does no damage

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.809 
long so overall it really does no damage
at<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:06.930> those<00:02:07.140> were<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> same<00:02:07.710> outcomes<00:02:08.640> for

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
at all those were the same outcomes for

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.410 
at all those were the same outcomes for
actually<00:02:09.149> FMJ<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.730> raw<00:02:12.030> gun<00:02:12.270> with

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
actually FMJ and the like raw gun with

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
actually FMJ and the like raw gun with
no<00:02:12.450> attachments<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
no attachments on it so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.280 
no attachments on it so
that's<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:14.970> long<00:02:15.690> barrel<00:02:15.930> overall<00:02:16.260> I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that's that but long barrel overall I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.589 
that's that but long barrel overall I
wouldn't<00:02:16.739> use<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.310> doesn't<00:02:17.610> increase<00:02:18.420> your

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
wouldn't use it it doesn't increase your

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.390 
wouldn't use it it doesn't increase your
range<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.080> much<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.650> don't<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.069> need<00:02:20.250> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
range that much and don't really need it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.009 
range that much and don't really need it
since<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.849> shoot<00:02:21.090> people<00:02:21.120> all<00:02:21.690> across

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
since you can shoot people all across

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.020 
since you can shoot people all across
the<00:02:22.230> map<00:02:22.379> without<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.730> big<00:02:24.000> thing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
the map without it but the big thing

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.699 
the map without it but the big thing
that<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.420> would<00:02:24.480> use<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.349> shotguns

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that I would use it on is for shotguns

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.130 
that I would use it on is for shotguns
because<00:02:26.129> shotguns<00:02:26.580> are<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.390> only<00:02:27.569> weapon<00:02:28.019> in

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
because shotguns are the only weapon in

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.390 
because shotguns are the only weapon in
black<00:02:28.319> ops<00:02:28.500> 2<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.860> actually<00:02:29.040> can't

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
black ops 2 that you actually can't

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
black ops 2 that you actually can't
shoot<00:02:29.610> people<00:02:29.940> across<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> map<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.690> because

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
shoot people across the map with because

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.259 
shoot people across the map with because
it<00:02:31.440> has<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.920> limited<00:02:32.459> range<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.239> you

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
it has a limited range on it so as you

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.350 
it has a limited range on it so as you
can<00:02:33.420> see<00:02:33.540> right<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:34.290> using<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.360> 870mcs

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
can see right here I'm using the 870mcs

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.699 
can see right here I'm using the 870mcs
or<00:02:36.599> whatever<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:36.959> called<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.349> shotgun

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
or whatever it's called that shotgun

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.470 
or whatever it's called that shotgun
with<00:02:38.160> long<00:02:38.430> barrel<00:02:38.730> attachment<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.209> right<00:02:39.360> now

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
with long barrel attachment on right now

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
with long barrel attachment on right now
and<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.630> can<00:02:39.720> see<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.989> got<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> pretty<00:02:40.440> decent

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
and you can see you got a pretty decent

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.410 
and you can see you got a pretty decent
range<00:02:41.069> on<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.519> isn't<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.970> maximum

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
range on it this isn't like the maximum

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.820 
range on it this isn't like the maximum
hit<00:02:42.540> marker<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:42.959> get<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.319> people<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
hit marker you can get on people and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.770 
hit marker you can get on people and
right<00:02:44.099> here<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.580> take<00:02:44.819> off<00:02:45.030> long<00:02:45.239> barrel<00:02:45.569> it's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
right here I take off long barrel it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.990 
right here I take off long barrel it's
totally<00:02:46.560> wrong<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> move<00:02:47.430> up<00:02:47.610> to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
totally wrong on and I move up to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.660 
totally wrong on and I move up to
however<00:02:48.390> far<00:02:48.989> away<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.430> still

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
however far away I can get and you still

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.009 
however far away I can get and you still
get<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.819> hitmarker<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.390> decent<00:02:51.690> range<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
get a hitmarker in a decent range and

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:52.910 
get a hitmarker in a decent range and
that's<00:02:52.140> right<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:52.590> as<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.769> can<00:02:52.860> see

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
that's right here so as you can see

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.039 
that's right here so as you can see
right<00:02:53.670> here<00:02:53.700> we<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.150> decent<00:02:54.780> range

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
right here we get a decent range

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.589 
right here we get a decent range
difference<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.730> much<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.360> screen

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
difference of that much on the screen

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.509 
difference of that much on the screen
right<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:57.780> that's<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.590> pretty<00:02:58.799> big<00:02:59.040> deal<00:02:59.220> for

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
right now that's a pretty big deal for

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.370 
right now that's a pretty big deal for
shotguns<00:02:59.730> because<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.780> always<00:03:00.930> want<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> get

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
shotguns because you always want to get

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.319 
shotguns because you always want to get
a<00:03:01.410> one<00:03:01.620> kill<00:03:01.860> or<00:03:02.099> one-hit<00:03:02.430> kill<00:03:02.610> with<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.000> by

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
a one kill or one-hit kill with it in by

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.490 
a one kill or one-hit kill with it in by
increasing<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> range<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> better

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
increasing the range you have a better

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.420 
increasing the range you have a better
chance<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.860> doing<00:03:04.980> so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
chance of doing so

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.539 
chance of doing so
so<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.120> freakin<00:03:06.840> KSG<00:03:07.650> with<00:03:07.860> insane<00:03:08.220> range

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
so the freakin KSG with insane range

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.280 
so the freakin KSG with insane range
right<00:03:08.819> here<00:03:08.849> as<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.239> can<00:03:09.329> see<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.200> how

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
right here as you can see this is how

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020 
right here as you can see this is how
far<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.650> goes<00:03:10.769> with<00:03:11.160> long<00:03:11.459> barrel<00:03:11.880> which<00:03:12.000> is

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
far it goes with long barrel which is

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.180 
far it goes with long barrel which is
pretty<00:03:12.569> freakin<00:03:13.290> crazy

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
pretty freakin crazy

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.100 
pretty freakin crazy
and<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.970> still<00:03:15.239> almost<00:03:15.390> killed<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.750> guy<00:03:15.780> in<00:03:15.900> one

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and you still almost killed a guy in one

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.050 
and you still almost killed a guy in one
hit<00:03:16.319> it's<00:03:16.470> definitely<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> two-shot<00:03:17.310> kill<00:03:17.340> but

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
hit it's definitely a two-shot kill but

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.699 
hit it's definitely a two-shot kill but
if<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:18.329> take<00:03:18.510> off<00:03:18.690> long<00:03:18.930> barrel<00:03:19.200> move<00:03:19.380> up<00:03:19.530> here

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
if we take off long barrel move up here

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.740 
if we take off long barrel move up here
we<00:03:19.799> get<00:03:19.889> a<00:03:19.950> range<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.940> far<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.630> that's

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
we get a range of this far and that's

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.039 
we get a range of this far and that's
still<00:03:22.230> pretty<00:03:22.500> freakin<00:03:23.010> crazy<00:03:23.190> for<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> shotgun

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
still pretty freakin crazy for a shotgun

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.050 
still pretty freakin crazy for a shotgun
so<00:03:25.049> overall<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.560> get<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.739> difference<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.790> that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
so overall you get a difference of that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.640 
so overall you get a difference of that
much<00:03:27.359> with<00:03:27.569> long<00:03:27.870> barrel<00:03:28.230> on<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.350> screen

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
much with long barrel on the screen

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.440 
much with long barrel on the screen
right<00:03:28.739> now<00:03:28.799> which<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.549> pretty<00:03:29.790> insane<00:03:30.239> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
right now which is pretty insane and

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.970 
right now which is pretty insane and
actually<00:03:30.750> pretty<00:03:31.019> freakin<00:03:31.440> amazing<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
actually pretty freakin amazing for the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.710 
actually pretty freakin amazing for the
KSG<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.609> thing<00:03:32.790> has<00:03:32.910> insane<00:03:33.209> range<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.600> it's

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
KSG that thing has insane range and it's

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.150 
KSG that thing has insane range and it's
pretty<00:03:33.959> good<00:03:34.109> mash<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.590> might<00:03:34.769> just<00:03:34.889> do<00:03:35.040> it

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
pretty good mash you might just do it

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.280 
pretty good mash you might just do it
weapon<00:03:35.459> analysis<00:03:36.000> on<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.239> for<00:03:37.049> one<00:03:37.079> video

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
like to see that but yeah that's about

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.430 
like to see that but yeah that's about
it<00:03:41.340> for<00:03:41.430> long<00:03:41.670> barrel<00:03:41.970> um<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.989> really<00:03:43.200> doesn't

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
it for long barrel um it really doesn't

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.990 
it for long barrel um it really doesn't
do<00:03:43.530> anything<00:03:43.799> damage<00:03:44.130> wise<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.639> really

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
do anything damage wise and really

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.940 
do anything damage wise and really
doesn't<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:45.750> does<00:03:45.959> increase<00:03:46.170> your<00:03:46.350> range<00:03:46.530> but

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
doesn't it does increase your range but

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.680 
doesn't it does increase your range but
isn't<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.430> useful<00:03:47.760> unless<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.359> use<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.600> for

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
isn't that useful unless you use it for

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.550 
isn't that useful unless you use it for
shotguns<00:03:48.900> that's<00:03:49.230> what<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.410> would<00:03:49.530> recommend

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
shotguns that's what I would recommend

and all that I said earlier well what it
does<00:04:29.470> do<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:30.400> increases<00:04:31.000> your<00:04:31.120> bullet

does do is increases your bullet

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.820 
does do is increases your bullet
penetration<00:04:31.780> which<00:04:32.020> lets<00:04:32.229> you<00:04:32.379> while<00:04:32.650> been

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
penetration which lets you while been

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.189 
penetration which lets you while been
people<00:04:33.159> more<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.610> do<00:04:34.539> all<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:34.810> good<00:04:34.960> stuff<00:04:35.020> I

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
people more and do all that good stuff I

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.629 
people more and do all that good stuff I
didn't<00:04:35.379> really<00:04:35.530> test<00:04:35.740> how<00:04:35.860> much<00:04:35.919> it<00:04:36.340> does

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
didn't really test how much it does

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.010 
didn't really test how much it does
increase<00:04:36.970> your<00:04:37.150> bullet<00:04:37.389> penetration<00:04:37.720> because

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
increase your bullet penetration because

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.379 
increase your bullet penetration because
you<00:04:38.500> know<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.889> don't<00:04:39.370> really<00:04:39.460> do<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.150> lot

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
you know I don't really do that a lot

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.540 
you know I don't really do that a lot
and<00:04:40.599> it's<00:04:40.690> not<00:04:40.750> very<00:04:41.199> helpful<00:04:41.770> for<00:04:42.190> me<00:04:42.250> unless

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
and it's not very helpful for me unless

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.399 
and it's not very helpful for me unless

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
don't know it's not really helpful

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.730 
don't know it's not really helpful

unless you wanna use wall or wall bang
people<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.400> does<00:04:48.520> not<00:04:48.759> increase<00:04:49.030> your<00:04:49.240> gun

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
people and it does not increase your gun

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.080 
people and it does not increase your gun
damage<00:04:49.720> but<00:04:49.840> what<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.080> does<00:04:50.289> do<00:04:50.639> is<00:04:51.639> increase

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
damage but what it does do is increase

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.879 
damage but what it does do is increase
your<00:04:52.300> damage<00:04:52.449> dealt<00:04:52.900> on<00:04:53.050> enemy<00:04:53.440> killstreaks

like load stars in all those types are

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.629 
like load stars in all those types are
hard<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.770> shoot<00:04:56.919> down<00:04:57.009> but<00:04:57.220> like<00:04:57.310> stealth

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
hard to shoot down but like stealth

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.610

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:03.749 
called escort drones and in black ops 1
it<00:05:02.409> was<00:05:02.500> really<00:05:02.800> hard<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.039> shoot<00:05:03.219> killstreaks

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
it was really hard to shoot killstreaks

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.700 
it was really hard to shoot killstreaks
down<00:05:04.000> modern<00:05:04.629> warfare<00:05:04.719> 3<00:05:04.960> they<00:05:05.409> made<00:05:05.560> it<00:05:05.650> a

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
down modern warfare 3 they made it a

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.990 
down modern warfare 3 they made it a
little<00:05:05.740> easier<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.340> shoot<00:05:06.460> kill<00:05:06.669> streaks<00:05:06.879> down

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
little easier to shoot kill streaks down

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.430 
little easier to shoot kill streaks down
with<00:05:07.120> their<00:05:07.210> gun<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.569> as<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.139> can<00:05:08.199> see<00:05:08.259> right

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
with their gun and as you can see right

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.869 
with their gun and as you can see right
here<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.740> takes<00:05:08.949> about<00:05:09.099> like<00:05:09.639> four<00:05:10.509> mags<00:05:11.229> of

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
here it takes about like four mags of

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.600 
here it takes about like four mags of
tar21<00:05:12.879> or<00:05:13.060> not<00:05:13.180> tar21<00:05:13.719> mtar<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.800> take<00:05:15.129> down<00:05:15.340> the

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
tar21 or not tar21 mtar to take down the

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.550 
tar21 or not tar21 mtar to take down the
stealth<00:05:16.300> chopper<00:05:16.479> plus<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.960> little<00:05:17.110> vector<00:05:17.440> i

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
stealth chopper plus a little vector i

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.959 
stealth chopper plus a little vector i
didn't<00:05:17.800> miss<00:05:17.889> a<00:05:17.949> couple<00:05:18.129> shots<00:05:18.430> with<00:05:18.639> the<00:05:18.759> tar

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
didn't miss a couple shots with the tar

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.730 
didn't miss a couple shots with the tar
but<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.569> know<00:05:19.659> it<00:05:19.750> takes<00:05:19.840> around<00:05:19.990> four<00:05:20.379> mags

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
but you know it takes around four mags

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.670 
but you know it takes around four mags
to<00:05:20.979> take<00:05:21.159> out<00:05:21.360> but<00:05:22.360> if<00:05:22.449> you<00:05:22.539> put<00:05:22.750> on<00:05:22.960> FMJ<00:05:23.349> and

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
to take out but if you put on FMJ and

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.980 
to take out but if you put on FMJ and
shoot<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.919> helicopter<00:05:24.069> down<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.759> takes<00:05:25.330> with

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
shoot the helicopter down it takes with

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.770 
shoot the helicopter down it takes with
the<00:05:26.080> mtar<00:05:26.469> FMJ<00:05:26.979> it<00:05:27.099> takes<00:05:27.340> it<00:05:27.550> down<00:05:27.789> in<00:05:28.210> two<00:05:28.599> and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
the mtar FMJ it takes it down in two and

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.300 
the mtar FMJ it takes it down in two and
a<00:05:28.840> half<00:05:29.020> mags<00:05:29.319> and<00:05:29.860> as<00:05:29.949> you<00:05:30.009> can<00:05:30.099> see<00:05:30.219> right

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
a half mags and as you can see right

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.589 
a half mags and as you can see right
here<00:05:30.370> for<00:05:30.580> using<00:05:30.759> the<00:05:30.849> vector<00:05:31.000> actually<00:05:31.300> takes

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
here for using the vector actually takes

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.360 
here for using the vector actually takes
it<00:05:31.690> down<00:05:31.779> in<00:05:31.930> two<00:05:32.169> mags<00:05:32.409> which<00:05:32.979> is<00:05:33.099> pretty

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
it down in two mags which is pretty

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.070 
it down in two mags which is pretty
awesome<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.819> can<00:05:33.940> gain<00:05:34.090> more<00:05:34.360> XP<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:34.930> way

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
awesome you can gain more XP that way

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.260 
awesome you can gain more XP that way
take<00:05:35.650> down<00:05:35.860> enemy<00:05:36.250> kill<00:05:36.460> streaks<00:05:36.699> faster<00:05:37.120> that

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
take down enemy kill streaks faster that

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.760 
take down enemy kill streaks faster that
way<00:05:37.389> I<00:05:37.419> mean<00:05:37.659> if<00:05:37.840> your<00:05:38.020> whole<00:05:38.169> team<00:05:38.440> is<00:05:38.620> using

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
way I mean if your whole team is using

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.459 
way I mean if your whole team is using
FMJ<00:05:39.490> you<00:05:39.909> can<00:05:40.090> easily<00:05:40.810> take<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.169> thing<00:05:41.349> out

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
FMJ you can easily take that thing out

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.320 
FMJ you can easily take that thing out
in<00:05:41.560> like<00:05:41.710> two<00:05:42.130> seconds<00:05:42.610> flat<00:05:42.789> I<00:05:42.909> mean<00:05:43.090> it'll<00:05:43.240> be

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
in like two seconds flat I mean it'll be

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.749 
in like two seconds flat I mean it'll be
crazy<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:44.770> that's<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:45.130> whole<00:05:45.219> comparison

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
crazy but that's the whole comparison

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.670 
crazy but that's the whole comparison
for<00:05:45.880> this<00:05:45.969> video<00:05:46.210> long<00:05:46.539> barrel<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:47.050> FMJ<00:05:47.409> both

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
for this video long barrel and FMJ both

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.409 
for this video long barrel and FMJ both
do<00:05:47.889> not<00:05:47.919> increase<00:05:48.279> your<00:05:48.490> gun<00:05:48.729> weapon<00:05:49.210> damage

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
do not increase your gun weapon damage

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.510 
do not increase your gun weapon damage
but<00:05:50.229> long<00:05:50.529> barrel<00:05:50.860> does<00:05:51.039> increase<00:05:51.340> your

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
but long barrel does increase your

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.189 
but long barrel does increase your
weapon<00:05:51.789> range<00:05:52.000> not<00:05:52.389> that<00:05:52.630> useful<00:05:52.840> though<00:05:53.169> I

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
weapon range not that useful though I

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.709 
weapon range not that useful though I
would<00:05:53.590> use<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:53.889> for<00:05:53.919> shotguns<00:05:54.400> only<00:05:54.699> and<00:05:54.880> FMJ

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
would use it for shotguns only and FMJ

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.480 
would use it for shotguns only and FMJ
lets<00:05:56.440> you<00:05:56.500> take<00:05:56.680> out<00:05:56.830> enemy<00:05:57.099> kill<00:05:57.250> streaks

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
lets you take out enemy kill streaks

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.309 
lets you take out enemy kill streaks
