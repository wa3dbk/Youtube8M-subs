00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
flip the lever and the melons get

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.810 
flip the lever and the melons get
harvested<00:00:19.260> then<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> water<00:00:20.189> pushes<00:00:20.670> them

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
harvested then the water pushes them

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.480 
harvested then the water pushes them
down<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.619> then<00:00:22.619> once<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.340> all

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
down here and then once they have all

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.210 
down here and then once they have all
been<00:00:23.670> harvested<00:00:24.350> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.500> collect<00:00:25.710> them<00:00:25.980> i'll

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
been harvested you can collect them i'll

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820 
been harvested you can collect them i'll
just<00:00:26.400> let<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> run<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> little<00:00:27.900> bit<00:00:28.109> because

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
just let that run a little bit because

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.460 
just let that run a little bit because
the<00:00:29.429> ones<00:00:29.670> far<00:00:30.480> back<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.019> take<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> little

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the ones far back here take a little

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.450 
the ones far back here take a little
longer<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.189> uh<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:33.090> accumulate<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> wait

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
longer to uh to accumulate and so wait

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.840 
longer to uh to accumulate and so wait
for<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.790> last<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:37.250> alright<00:00:38.250> then<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.640> just

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
for that last one alright then you just

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850 
for that last one alright then you just
simply<00:00:39.030> collect<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.379> get<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> good

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
simply collect them all you get a good

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.979 
simply collect them all you get a good
good<00:00:41.460> harvest<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.510> flip<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.809> again<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.430> water

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
good harvest you flip it again the water

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.260 
good harvest you flip it again the water
runs<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.980> retracts<00:00:47.460> keeping

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
runs out and then it retracts keeping

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
runs out and then it retracts keeping
all<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:48.719> melons<00:00:49.219> melon<00:00:50.219> plants<00:00:50.640> in

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
basically what happens first is the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.469 
basically what happens first is the
Pistons<00:01:17.460> under<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.830> which<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.220> there

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
Pistons under here which are right there

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.620 
Pistons under here which are right there
get<00:01:21.479> activated<00:01:21.960> pushing<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:23.070> which

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
get activated pushing this up which

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.850 
get activated pushing this up which
which<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> push<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
which if you don't know when you push a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.399 
which if you don't know when you push a
melon<00:01:26.280> block<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.689> turns<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> into

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
melon block it actually turns it into

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.700 
melon block it actually turns it into
little<00:01:28.890> melon<00:01:29.340> chunks<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.869> so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
little melon chunks like that and so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.090 
little melon chunks like that and so
then<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> set<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.119> over<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.740> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
then I have it set up over here so that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.120 
then I have it set up over here so that
first<00:01:36.170> let<00:01:37.170> me<00:01:37.200> tell<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> what's<00:01:37.979> happening

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
first let me tell you what's happening

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.719 
first let me tell you what's happening
like<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.590> redstone<00:01:40.590> come<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.040> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
like you have the redstone come on this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.160 
like you have the redstone come on this
one<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.020> gets<00:01:43.170> triggered<00:01:43.680> first

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
one is so that it gets triggered first

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.010 
one is so that it gets triggered first
before<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.909> actual<00:01:48.119> water<00:01:48.630> gets

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
before the the actual water gets

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.510 
before the the actual water gets
released<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.250> when

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
released and then this here it's so when

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
released and then this here it's so when
the<00:01:53.700> red<00:01:54.000> stone<00:01:54.210> gets<00:01:54.479> turned<00:01:54.720> off<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:55.290> so

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the red stone gets turned off that's so

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
the red stone gets turned off that's so
it<00:01:55.710> gets<00:01:55.860> turned<00:01:56.460> off<00:01:56.579> later<00:01:57.390> than<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.200> other

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it gets turned off later than the other

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.789 
it gets turned off later than the other
thing<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.799> got<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.280> 1<00:01:59.579> 2<00:01:59.850> 3<00:01:59.880> 4<00:02:00.570> 5<00:02:00.960> 6<00:02:01.350> 7<00:02:01.530> 8<00:02:01.950> 8<00:02:02.939> delay

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
thing it's got a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 delay

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.219 
thing it's got a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 delay
and<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.920> guess<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> works<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:06.229> max

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and I guess it works like one max

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
and I guess it works like one max
repeater<00:02:08.009> works<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.759> every<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.239> block

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
repeater works for every one block

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.960 
repeater works for every one block
because<00:02:09.840> i<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.470> set<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.709> perfectly<00:02:11.039> so

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
because i have it set up perfectly so

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.790 
because i have it set up perfectly so
that

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.140 
that
soon<00:02:12.950> as<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.250> last<00:02:13.670> bit<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.270> water<00:02:14.630> falls<00:02:15.260> down

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
soon as the last bit of water falls down

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.440 
soon as the last bit of water falls down
that<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.660> things<00:02:17.960> retract<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.820> what's

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
that the things retract and so what's

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.340 
that the things retract and so what's
happening<00:02:20.570> over<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.530> there<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:23.350> one

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
happening over here is there is a one

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.730 
happening over here is there is a one
delay<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:25.040> over<00:02:25.970> here<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.140> allows<00:02:27.320> the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
delay and over here this just allows the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.800 
delay and over here this just allows the
power<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.580> uh<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:29.300> go<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.620> when<00:02:31.690> when<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
power to uh to go and so when when the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.780 
power to uh to go and so when when the
power<00:02:33.050> gets<00:02:33.290> shut<00:02:33.380> off<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:34.010> gets<00:02:34.340> pulled<00:02:34.610> out

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
power gets shut off this gets pulled out

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.930 
power gets shut off this gets pulled out
of<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.000> way<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.450> there<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.740> shuts<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:37.700> off

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
of the way and there it shuts this off

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.850 
of the way and there it shuts this off
immediately<00:02:38.800> causing<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:40.520> here<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.860> flood

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
immediately causing this here to flood

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.240 
immediately causing this here to flood
out<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.700> um<00:02:44.060> I'm<00:02:44.870> just<00:02:45.110> going<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.410> kind<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:45.980> show

days and then this here I'll show you
that<00:03:14.420> see<00:03:15.340> goes<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.090> then<00:03:17.300> once

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
that see goes like that and then once

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.760 
that see goes like that and then once
the<00:03:18.290> water<00:03:18.500> drains<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.670> recedes<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.780> then<00:03:21.440> for

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
the water drains it recedes and then for

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.900 
the water drains it recedes and then for
the<00:03:22.840> for<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.870> other<00:03:24.170> part<00:03:24.440> c<00:03:25.190> pushes<00:03:25.790> that

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
the for the other part c pushes that

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.010 
the for the other part c pushes that
immediately<00:03:26.420> causing<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.380> go<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.980> then

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
immediately causing that to go and then

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.620 
immediately causing that to go and then
yeah<00:03:30.020> so<00:03:30.590> it's<00:03:30.830> it's<00:03:31.220> actually<00:03:31.700> quite<00:03:31.970> simple

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
but it's kind of complicated if you

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.870 
but it's kind of complicated if you
don't<00:03:35.690> know<00:03:35.840> what<00:03:35.989> you're<00:03:36.140> doing<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:36.950> just
