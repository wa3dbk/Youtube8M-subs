how<00:00:00.329> to<00:00:00.390> fold<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:00.780> pop-up<00:00:01.050> background<00:00:01.500> in<00:00:01.680> three

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
how to fold a pop-up background in three

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.759 
how to fold a pop-up background in three
seconds<00:00:02.780> ready<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.020> in<00:00:04.710> two<00:00:05.040> one<00:00:05.970> go<00:00:08.300> and

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
seconds ready and in two one go and

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.129 
seconds ready and in two one go and
that's<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.980> simple<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.150> now<00:00:12.719> I'll<00:00:12.929> show

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
that's it simple as that now I'll show

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.600 
that's it simple as that now I'll show
you<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.290> little<00:00:13.469> bit<00:00:13.620> more<00:00:13.860> slowly<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.580> can

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
you a little bit more slowly so you can

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:24.480 
you a little bit more slowly so you can
see<00:00:14.849> what's<00:00:15.030> really<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.330> on

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.760 

now<00:00:25.180> when<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.359> bought<00:00:25.689> my<00:00:25.869> first<00:00:26.199> screen<00:00:26.560> like

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
now when I bought my first screen like

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.460 
now when I bought my first screen like
this<00:00:27.010> I<00:00:27.250> must<00:00:27.820> have<00:00:27.970> spent<00:00:28.240> probably<00:00:28.599> half<00:00:29.199> an

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
this I must have spent probably half an

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.920 
this I must have spent probably half an
hour<00:00:29.619> or<00:00:29.920> more<00:00:30.189> trying<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.910> work<00:00:31.119> out<00:00:31.420> how<00:00:31.900> to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
hour or more trying to work out how to

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.110 
hour or more trying to work out how to
get<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.439> thing<00:00:32.650> folded<00:00:33.280> up<00:00:33.370> again<00:00:33.670> because

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
get the thing folded up again because

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.940 
get the thing folded up again because
once<00:00:34.480> you've<00:00:34.660> unfolded<00:00:35.290> you<00:00:35.470> don't<00:00:35.680> really

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
once you've unfolded you don't really

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.189 
once you've unfolded you don't really
remember<00:00:36.250> how<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:36.879> goes<00:00:37.059> back<00:00:37.300> together<00:00:37.480> so

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
remember how it goes back together so

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.979 
remember how it goes back together so
but<00:00:38.710> there<00:00:39.010> is<00:00:39.160> really<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.579> simple<00:00:40.150> way<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.540> now

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
but there is really a simple way and now

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.660 
but there is really a simple way and now
I've<00:00:41.170> seen<00:00:41.410> various<00:00:41.830> ways<00:00:42.010> on<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.370> internet

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
I've seen various ways on the internet

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.490 
I've seen various ways on the internet
but<00:00:42.820> no<00:00:43.090> one<00:00:43.269> as<00:00:43.360> far<00:00:43.449> as<00:00:43.629> I<00:00:43.720> know<00:00:43.780> uses<00:00:44.350> this

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
but no one as far as I know uses this

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.310 
but no one as far as I know uses this
particular<00:00:44.680> method<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:46.089> is<00:00:46.120> for<00:00:46.870> me<00:00:47.019> the

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
particular method and it is for me the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.049 
particular method and it is for me the
easiest<00:00:47.559> simplest<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.460> it's<00:00:48.580> also<00:00:48.730> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
easiest simplest and it's also the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.479 
easiest simplest and it's also the
fastest<00:00:49.690> way<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:50.110> folding<00:00:50.589> up<00:00:50.890> one<00:00:51.220> of<00:00:51.339> these

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
fastest way of folding up one of these

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.250 
fastest way of folding up one of these
and<00:00:51.940> also<00:00:52.180> show<00:00:52.480> you<00:00:52.510> how<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.720> fold<00:00:53.019> up<00:00:53.170> a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
and also show you how to fold up a

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.229 
and also show you how to fold up a
reflector<00:00:53.769> as<00:00:53.890> well<00:00:54.070> around<00:00:54.550> reflective<00:00:55.120> is

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
reflector as well around reflective is

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.049 
reflector as well around reflective is
very<00:00:55.540> similar<00:00:55.930> similar<00:00:56.379> technique<00:00:56.860> but<00:00:57.489> this

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
very similar similar technique but this

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.640 
very similar similar technique but this
is<00:00:58.210> it<00:00:58.330> basically<00:00:58.510> all<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.110> need<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.320> do<00:00:59.440> is

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
is it basically all you need to do is

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.829 
is it basically all you need to do is
stand<00:01:00.040> it<00:01:00.190> up<00:01:00.280> straight<00:01:00.610> like<00:01:00.820> this<00:01:01.000> hang<00:01:01.750> on

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
stand it up straight like this hang on

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.689 
stand it up straight like this hang on
to<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.019> top<00:01:02.229> with<00:01:02.409> one<00:01:02.530> hand<00:01:02.799> put<00:01:03.220> your<00:01:03.430> foot

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
to the top with one hand put your foot

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.730 
to the top with one hand put your foot
on<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.150> bottom<00:01:04.510> like<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.199> with<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.530> other

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
on the bottom like that with the other

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.090 
on the bottom like that with the other
then<00:01:06.610> all<00:01:06.880> we<00:01:07.030> do<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.390> literally<00:01:08.080> just<00:01:08.440> twist

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
then all we do is literally just twist

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.359 
then all we do is literally just twist
the<00:01:10.060> top<00:01:10.270> round<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:10.900> as<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.590> top<00:01:11.830> twist<00:01:12.100> round

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
the top round and as the top twist round

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.700 
the top round and as the top twist round
it<00:01:12.549> will<00:01:12.670> naturally<00:01:12.939> fall<00:01:13.750> down<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.530> you'll

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
it will naturally fall down and you'll

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.140 
it will naturally fall down and you'll
come<00:01:14.920> down<00:01:15.159> this<00:01:16.150> tucks<00:01:16.720> in<00:01:17.020> here<00:01:17.790> down<00:01:18.790> there

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
come down this tucks in here down there

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.580 
come down this tucks in here down there
and<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:20.530> like<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:21.939> is<00:01:22.540> it<00:01:22.869> now

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
and up like that and that is it now

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.880 
and up like that and that is it now
literally<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.580> do<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:27.060> few<00:01:28.060> seconds

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
literally I can do this in a few seconds

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.930 
literally I can do this in a few seconds
in<00:01:29.890> fact<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.220> can<00:01:30.310> do<00:01:30.400> it<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.550> a<00:01:30.610> probably<00:01:30.850> about

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
in fact I can do it in a probably about

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.000 
in fact I can do it in a probably about
two<00:01:31.180> seconds<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:32.200> I'll<00:01:32.320> do<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.500> again<00:01:32.650> slowly

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
two seconds but I'll do it again slowly

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.790 
two seconds but I'll do it again slowly
so<00:01:33.400> we<00:01:33.430> can<00:01:33.640> see<00:01:33.790> it<00:01:33.850> again<00:01:34.410> foot<00:01:35.410> on<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.680> floor

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
so we can see it again foot on the floor

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.670 
so we can see it again foot on the floor
holding<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.610> down<00:01:37.140> hold<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.230> down<00:01:38.290> at<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.530> top

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
holding it down hold it down at the top

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
holding it down hold it down at the top
here<00:01:38.860> like<00:01:39.010> this<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.280> twist<00:01:39.880> round<00:01:40.300> like<00:01:41.140> so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
here like this and twist round like so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.750 
here like this and twist round like so
round<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.810> in<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.740> then<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.490> other<00:01:45.610> one

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
round and in and then the other one

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.930 
round and in and then the other one
comes<00:01:46.030> up<00:01:46.180> like<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.720> that's<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.670> job

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
comes up like that and that's it the job

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.800 
comes up like that and that's it the job
is<00:01:49.120> done<00:01:49.360> how<00:01:49.930> simple<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.710> that

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.250 

now<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> show<00:01:55.230> you<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.860> reflector<00:01:56.550> this<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
now to show you on a reflector this is a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.600 
now to show you on a reflector this is a
reflector<00:01:58.260> about<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.980> over<00:01:59.160> a<00:01:59.220> meter<00:01:59.430> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
reflector about just over a meter in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.390 
reflector about just over a meter in
size<00:01:59.850> again<00:02:00.630> very<00:02:01.290> similar<00:02:01.590> method<00:02:01.830> you're

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
size again very similar method you're

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.370 
size again very similar method you're
going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.730> twisting<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.480> you<00:02:04.080> do<00:02:04.200> is

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
going to be twisting it all you do is

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.500 
going to be twisting it all you do is
grab<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.070> side<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.550> hand<00:02:06.330> on<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
grab over one side here hand on the
