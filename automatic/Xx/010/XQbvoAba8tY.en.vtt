00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.740
 hi to all and bello meet again for 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.660
 a new episode in skyrim fashion 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.910
 this time dedicated to yy 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.990
 annie maury place mystic night in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 version 1.1 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.619
 so this mode as its name says goes 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 replace some game animations 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 which will concern especially those who 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 are fighting in the east not a hand or who are 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 war proceedings or matches 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.010
 pure since it will replace like you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.439
 see this list of installation 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.360
 animations dpa hand or 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 spell casting animations when 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.760
 short or when we sprint so it's a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.829
 rather complete mode vis-Ã -vis its 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.239
 uses of weapons and the small 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.770
 feature is that the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.930
 animations are going to be a bit cheap and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.230
 Asian or Japanese to finally see 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.719
 typed manga roughly like pg memories 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.890
 Asian but it's very very light I 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.180
 find it fits pretty well 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.649
 the skyrim universe as far as the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 animations on a very good bill 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.250
 so that's why I propose to you 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 show this mode today 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 so here I start with the screen two 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.650
 facilities of this one via the nexus 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.600
 one manager since you can see 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.520
 select the animations that we 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.710
 wants or not installed so that's why 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 if there are any that seem to you a little 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 little too much abuse compared to skyrim you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.290
 can not install them as per 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.700
 example this one the sprint is going to be 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.439
 characterized by a sword that is going to be 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.729
 behind you and the shield towards 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.860
 the front so here I want all of you 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.799
 show in any case in the gameplay that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.930
 will follow is there I install this very quickly 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.329
 done and we find ourselves immediately in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 game so here we are at stake and we will everything 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.290
 immediately begin looking at 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.570
 animations related to one-handed weapons 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.070
 so with my katana here and who for the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 blow is going to be quite well adapted to the fact 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 that the new animation and very 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.140
 stylized and looks like someone 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.549
 putting a sword in its sheath you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 see he's twirling this one 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.799
 it's the typical manga as I told you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.530
 so you'll find it's a little 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.320
 everywhere especially in the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.760
 running animation and sprinting there with 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.470
 tears behind so it's not very 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.560
 realistic it's stylized but integrates 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.350
 pretty good so for the animations of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.569
 storage of tears and attacks that 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.979
 pretty much give this so I think 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.480
 that it's not changed by all 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.090
 the other attacks are different and 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.160
 it's pretty well done anyway 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.470
 thing to remember is that these animations 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.610
 are only visible at the third 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.530
 nobody since the animation system 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.209
 for attacks on the first pass and 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.489
 are not the same and the mode does not 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.830
 not about this system so it's 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.489
 especially for those who play at the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.760
 third person 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.470
 also knowing that npc use these 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.489
 animations so you'll see it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.060
 still if you are still at the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.000
 first person 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.580
 Turning now to the draw made 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.140
 fate of attac then there at the level of my 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.730
 fireballs I show you a little bit 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.800
 that it gives therefore according to which hands 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.360
 we use the animation is not going to be the 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.880
 even sent here it's a little ninja 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.650
 with the hand in front of the face with the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.720
 two fingers stretched like this and then if 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.870
 we attack with both hands at the same time 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.360
 time it's cheap kamehameha we're going 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.579
 move on after the beef spell so by 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.739
 example the spells that puts that puts me a 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.420
 armor you see for example here with 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.610
 the little snap of fingers on on the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.989
 side of the character pretty stylish and for 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.910
 the other hand is pretty classic for 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.470
 the shot with now the animations 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.890
 of care so I'm going to take everything from 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.470
 after 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.390
 this one then face tilling it's going to be 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.660
 for me and healing hands it's for the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.940
 other 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.200
 so that's the sony pump animation 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.970
 myself therefore also to see 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.829
 the animation on the side is the beef 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.660
 in fact the animation of beef and for 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.340
 to treat the friends it is with this 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.600
 elimination which is rather classical in 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.709
 game it changes a little bit the posture of the 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.019
 character who is a little bit more 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.359
 raised than usual but it's not 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.799
 very very different I showed you 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.000
 now the animations related to the spell 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.980
 master so there it changes a lot for 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.950
 the shot see that our character is going 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.250
 go up in the air with a little 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.650
 levitation and after when we loose that 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.989
 here is 6 p 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.049
 this guy is here too a little manga it's 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.069
 rather nice to the eye 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.319
 again very successful at the level of 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.329
 very fluid animations it fits 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.730
 very well actually at play and as said 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.349
 in the description page it's fluid 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.640
 between the animations of germany has not 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.189
 of jerks so that's what is rather 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.400
 pleasant and then there too the animations 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.419
 to launch the flames 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.799
 it's a little bit different but 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.900
 I think it's the little steps 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.669
 to hunt and all that gives a small side 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.740
 more dynamic to dynamics at the game I 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.570
 find and that's why I 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.220
 present this mode today so 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.800
 if you liked it do not hesitate to 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.080
 share the video to comment to you 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.789
 subscribe to follow the next 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.910
 videos about skyrim modes 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.729
 in any case it was yy annie maury 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.889
 place in version 1.1 and future 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.860
 evolutions of this mode there will concern 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.349
 more type animations and finally monday 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.830
 perverse the genres so does it male 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.720
 or feminine 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.479
 so it's not very differentiated for 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.080
 the moment there is the option in any case 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.760
 but it's pretty much geared towards 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.620
 feminine for now so there will be 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.419
 more animations that level more 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.940
 animations also for use 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.680
 sticks in addition to disarm and so 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.539
 this is constantly evolving and 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.190
 if there is heavy of the very heavy that leaves 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.580
 afterwards I will not miss you 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.699
 show it 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.409
 that was all for today 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.669
 finds himself for a next video and 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.880
 until then, wear your voice well 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.880
 all
