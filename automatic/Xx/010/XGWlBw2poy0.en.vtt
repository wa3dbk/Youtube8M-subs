longer I don't know how I put the lid on
real<00:01:18.530> tight<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.220> still<00:01:19.460> drives<00:01:19.820> them<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.150> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
real tight but it still drives them so I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.330 
real tight but it still drives them so I
get<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.480> really<00:01:21.080> tiny<00:01:21.320> ones<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.770> lot<00:01:22.010> of<00:01:22.040> people

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.520 
get the really tiny ones a lot of people
have<00:01:22.430> suggested<00:01:22.610> various<00:01:23.390> types<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.900> bb's<00:01:24.290> and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
have suggested various types of bb's and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.380 
have suggested various types of bb's and
shot<00:01:24.830> that<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.280> could<00:01:25.460> use<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.880> fill<00:01:26.060> up<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
shot that you could use to fill up the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.090 
shot that you could use to fill up the
head<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.020> those<00:01:27.290> are<00:01:27.440> good<00:01:27.560> ideas<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
head and and those are good ideas the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.030 
head and and those are good ideas the
sand<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:29.110> kind<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.200> light<00:01:30.440> it's<00:01:30.710> not<00:01:30.890> really

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
sand is kind of light it's not really

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.010 
sand is kind of light it's not really
not<00:01:31.280> as<00:01:31.400> heavy<00:01:31.610> as<00:01:31.820> by<00:01:32.030> old<00:01:32.270> Mel<00:01:32.510> although<00:01:32.870> it

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
not as heavy as by old Mel although it

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.440 
not as heavy as by old Mel although it
is<00:01:33.170> kind<00:01:33.440> of<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.590> nice<00:01:33.800> dead<00:01:34.700> blow<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.240> guess

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
is kind of a nice dead blow I guess

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.300 
is kind of a nice dead blow I guess
filling<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.900> with<00:01:35.930> this<00:01:36.500> stuff<00:01:36.770> really<00:01:36.950> helps

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
filling it with this stuff really helps

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.860 
filling it with this stuff really helps
it<00:01:37.430> out<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.700> just<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.060> doesn't<00:01:38.330> bounce<00:01:38.450> when

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
it out to just it doesn't bounce when

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.840 
it out to just it doesn't bounce when
you<00:01:38.900> hit<00:01:39.020> things<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.800> sand<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.280> a<00:01:40.340> little<00:01:40.760> bit

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
you hit things the sand is a little bit

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.440 
you hit things the sand is a little bit
heavier<00:01:41.230> just<00:01:42.230> used<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.680> wood<00:01:43.340> but<00:01:43.700> not<00:01:44.300> that

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
heavier just used the wood but not that
