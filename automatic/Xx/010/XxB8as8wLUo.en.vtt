00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.040
 how about friends how are you welcome to the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.840
 map of today because this time I come 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.259
 with the map that I was doing for 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.619
 I have finished it because this map is 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.300
 based on a pc game called the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.660
 Crystal box is a map of 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.680
 survival and I hope you like it 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.189
 logically some of the challenges that there are 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.110
 to follow here, because they are not equal to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 those of belo so our minecraft 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.800
 it is not updated in this way but 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.530
 I hope you like it anyway 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 first rule I will read the six 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 rules there 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.950
 we must place the crystal that makes 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.340
 missing in the glass box was in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.460
 Established and climbed as follows 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.260
 by means of water 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.260
 we go up with our crystal 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.630
 when we get up there we have to 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.159
 stay first we have to go up 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.020
 first and then put the crystal 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.020
 that's why I left that little space 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.820
 and we put it here 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.190
 ok the second rule is to play in mode 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.850
 normal nothing peaceful we have to 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.340
 play in normal mode do not break even a 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.140
 single block of glass from the box to 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 unless we make one of us one 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.100
 little glass house 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.259
 but 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.840
 from the box we do not have to break one 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.390
 single 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.820
 once in the glass box they can not 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.119
 come down so we have to stay 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.200
 up here we can not go down is one of 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.600
 the rules 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.530
 and not leave the glass box unless 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.570
 let it be to go to the chests and letters 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.760
 floating 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.940
 that's what I mean the chests that are 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.780
 there one is here I do not know if they see it 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.659
 another is there 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.520
 and the letters that are these that are 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.380
 Here he explained to them what they were going 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.870
 those letters 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.410
 in the chests there are things that have to 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.410
 see how to get there and 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.410
 get them 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.400
 here in this chest there are some little things 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.989
 like meat of bone one of meat of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.110
 bone they have to see very well that van 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.170
 to use there is one thing that is very 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.200
 difficult to grow then think very 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.140
 well before using it one of cane 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.240
 one cactus one red stone and one bed 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.240
 now missing 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.540
 everything you build must be inside 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.719
 from the box except one thing that then 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.180
 I'm going to tell you now I'm going to read the 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.180
 challenges that are there are like 25 challenges 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.480
 The first is to create a generator 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.400
 combustion 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.760
 the second gets 150 custom 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.510
 create a tree farm and get 64 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.620
 of refined wood 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.099
 create a cane farm and get 32 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.099
 of them 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.720
 create a wheat farm and get 32 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:29.150
 of wheat and 32 seeds 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.040
 create a cactus farm 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.040
 get 10 iron 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.390
 as five bricks 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.040
 is a music box is a house of two 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.380
 floors 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.770
 and 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.850
 at 10 o'clock glass is a trap 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:55.450
 floating of monsters this if we can 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.650
 build out of the box but not down 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.550
 I guess down here it's going to be 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.490
 infected with monsters and zombies and everything 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:07.400
 but nothing to see that trap we have it 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:12.579
 what to do floating and not down 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.579
 the next is get 32 arrows 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.580
 get 32 gunpowder get 5 wool 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.780
 look for the way to get to the chests and 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.060
 floating letters that is to say they have to search 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.680
 the way to get to the chests to the 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.740
 chests and letters 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.110
 that completes the last letter as 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.169
 can see in the letter says reader evo 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:44.339
 but the voice is incomplete should 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:48.320
 complete it is not just to complete there 

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:50.249
 one reason that they have to see it there 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.099
 what else 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:57.899

00:04:53.099 --> 00:05:00.959

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:02.189
 The leader's chest has to go when they go 

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.629
 the leader have to see very well by 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.919
 all sides up down to feel and 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:10.259
 inside who finds an apple more 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.269
 gold that is in the black too 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.919
 find a gold disc that is also 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:19.589

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:23.069

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:26.039
 get 32 ​​stones of the level and then 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.860
 those are all friends as you see they are not 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:33.460
 many are not so difficult either 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.319
 I hope you like the rules and 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.289
 the challenges are going to be in the download not 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.120
 I wanted to put them here on the little sign 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.740
 because that takes a long time is not how 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.790
 I started that you have the keyboard and you can 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.860
 write everything you want 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.340
 as in the command control of the equipment 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.490
 it is very difficult 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.030
 well 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.949
 in the download link there will be a 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.300
 text file with the rules and 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.979
