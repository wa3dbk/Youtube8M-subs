40<00:03:03.540> years<00:03:03.720> on<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.170> FPS<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.739> yeah<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.700> think<00:03:09.090> this

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
40 years on the FPS so yeah I think this

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.880 
40 years on the FPS so yeah I think this
is<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> really<00:03:09.660> good<00:03:09.870> cqb<00:03:10.320> gun<00:03:10.530> it's<00:03:10.709> real<00:03:10.859> easy

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
is a really good cqb gun it's real easy

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.910 
is a really good cqb gun it's real easy
