00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.970
 hello I'm the first surprised by the environmentalists to shoot that I'm going 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.780
 make a little presentation regarding the use of dental floss wire 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.269
 Dental is the essential complement to the toothbrush because 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.920
 it will reduce the bacterial plaque that is at the level of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.190
 the eu of interdental spaces p its use is very simple 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.310
 the style for the poker game 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.949
 or so we are around two indexes 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.050
 in power perform a split move 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020
 vertical 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.140
 while keeping the compact very close together with 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.130
 the surface of the tooth and the root and we go down 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 so do the dental floss 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.870
 I had more south 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.920
 being careful not to 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.930
 it is easy to gum but it will be done so 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.490
 on each tooth 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.200
 first in the dental space that is to say nantes 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.630
 p these realize 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.260
 on all teeth 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.520
 concerning the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.960
 in later it is sometimes 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.870
 easier to use 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.240
 a next door and in the same way one restricts try to keep the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.650
 contact with doran 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.360
 doing 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.100
 a wax movement that stalls 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 but these 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 parity of the elysea the gum 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.860
 using the film will help avoid 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 the accumulation of reception points in interdental spaces 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.010
 and therefore avoid the development of periodontal disease 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.790
 so be gingivitis 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.200
 it is bone destruction 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.990
 tonight of tooth decay or recession do not forget to use 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.440
 daily follow-up, ie morning and evening 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.909
 on this I leave you and see you soon for more tutorial 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.619
 certainly
