ideas that I've come up with that are

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.600 
ideas that I've come up with that are
based<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:13.230> rhythm<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.650> clapping<00:00:14.160> what

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
based on the rhythm of clapping what

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.029 
based on the rhythm of clapping what

actually<00:00:17.480> but<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:20.670> something<00:00:21.180> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
actually but this is one something I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.570 
actually but this is one something I
came<00:00:21.390> up<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:21.900> walking<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
came up with I was walking to to the

the week and I just came up with this

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.370 
the week and I just came up with this
idea<00:00:30.500> it's<00:00:31.500> their<00:00:31.890> base<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.460> based<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:33.380> based

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
idea it's their base it's based on based

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.590 
idea it's their base it's based on based
on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> clapping<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.880> rhythm<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.300> called

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
on the clapping the rhythm is called

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:48.380 
on the clapping the rhythm is called
rumba<00:00:37.320> globbing<00:00:38.510> that's<00:00:39.510> basically<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:47.789> it's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
rumba globbing that's basically and it's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.340 
rumba globbing that's basically and it's
based<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:50.000> eighth<00:00:51.000> note<00:00:51.480> right<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:51.930> eighth

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
based on eighth note right now eighth

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.479 
based on eighth note right now eighth
note<00:00:52.680> triplets<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:56.399> a

note triplets and is going to be a

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.900 
note triplets and is going to be a
paradiddle<00:01:00.500> followed<00:01:01.500> by<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.949> paradiddle

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

diddle followed by two paradiddles
and<00:01:09.830> another<00:01:10.830> paradiddle<00:01:11.729> diddle<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.229> I'll

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and another paradiddle diddle and I'll

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.320 
and another paradiddle diddle and I'll
write<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.310> you'll<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.820> able<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.150> see

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:27.379 

I<00:03:24.950> need<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.040> practice<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.790> bleeding

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
I need to practice that one bleeding

what<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:47.760> wanted<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.450> learn<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:48.629> sounds<00:03:48.930> like

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
what I wanted to learn it sounds like

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.929 
what I wanted to learn it sounds like
fast<00:03:49.349> right<00:03:50.329> but<00:03:51.329> I'm<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:51.480> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.870> do<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.939> so

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
fast right but I'm not going to do it so

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.420 
fast right but I'm not going to do it so
they're<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:55.190> little<00:03:56.190> faster

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
they're a little faster

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.170 
they're a little faster
