00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
here to turn on the air compressor that

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.819 
here to turn on the air compressor that
air<00:00:55.510> compressor<00:00:55.989> is<00:00:56.020> going<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:56.379> shoot<00:00:56.590> that

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
air compressor is going to shoot that

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.100 
air compressor is going to shoot that
water<00:00:57.190> through<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.699> center<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.300> this<00:00:58.600> fan<00:00:58.900> gun

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
water through the center of this fan gun

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.020 
water through the center of this fan gun
extremely<00:00:59.650> quickly<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.610> creates<00:01:00.910> the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
extremely quickly that creates the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.030 
extremely quickly that creates the
nucleus<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.540> snowflake<00:01:01.960> misting<00:01:02.890> nozzles

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
nucleus of the snowflake misting nozzles

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.070 
nucleus of the snowflake misting nozzles
all<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.610> way<00:01:03.699> around<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.089> rim<00:01:04.300> attached<00:01:04.809> onto

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
all the way around the rim attached onto

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.680 
all the way around the rim attached onto
that<00:01:05.259> nucleus<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:06.400> fan<00:01:06.670> turns<00:01:07.119> on<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.630> it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
that nucleus the fan turns on and it

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.300 
that nucleus the fan turns on and it
throws<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.259> snow<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.619> it<00:01:08.830> mixes<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.220> all

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
throws that snow and it mixes it all

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.550 
throws that snow and it mixes it all
together<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:09.910> we<00:01:10.509> just<00:01:10.660> got<00:01:10.869> out<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.259> field

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
together so we just got out to the field

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.980 
together so we just got out to the field
all<00:01:12.250> our<00:01:12.550> water<00:01:12.820> lines<00:01:13.119> are<00:01:13.360> charged<00:01:13.630> we're
