brush to get it on the brush it it's a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.620 
brush to get it on the brush it it's a
foam<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.739> sort<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.240> collapses<00:01:06.240> and

foam and it just sort of collapses and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
foam and it just sort of collapses and
breaks<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.260> pot<00:01:07.470> into<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> liquid<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
breaks a pot into like a liquid so it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.859 
breaks a pot into like a liquid so it
doesn't<00:01:12.090> stay<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> foam<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.479> when<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.600> blend

doesn't stay a foam and when you blend
it<00:01:16.110> in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.889

completely<00:01:31.399> this<00:01:31.850> appears<00:01:32.479> now<00:01:33.470> let's<00:01:33.920> look

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
completely this appears now let's look

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.020 
completely this appears now let's look
at<00:01:34.399> the<00:01:34.579> premise<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.180> why<00:01:35.479> we<00:01:35.780> wear<00:01:36.079> foundation

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
at the premise of why we wear foundation

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.510 
at the premise of why we wear foundation
most<00:01:38.030> people<00:01:38.360> wear<00:01:38.539> foundation<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:39.649> even<00:01:40.399> out

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
most people wear foundation to even out

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.289 
most people wear foundation to even out
their<00:01:40.759> skin<00:01:41.090> tone<00:01:41.439> maybe<00:01:42.439> even<00:01:42.770> cover<00:01:43.670> up<00:01:43.939> some

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
their skin tone maybe even cover up some

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.490 
their skin tone maybe even cover up some
flaws<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.810> they<00:01:45.380> have<00:01:45.649> in<00:01:45.979> their<00:01:46.189> skin<00:01:46.520> and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
flaws that they have in their skin and

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.760 
flaws that they have in their skin and
if<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:48.649> completely<00:01:49.159> disappears<00:01:50.560> now<00:01:51.560> what

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
if this completely disappears now what

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.910 
if this completely disappears now what
is<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> point<00:01:52.189> of<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:53.439> this<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.619> gimmick

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
is the point of it this is a gimmick

is the point of it this is a gimmick
people<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.509> poor<00:01:57.470> attempt<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.399> sell

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
to try out of curiosity even though I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.000 
have pretty bad uneven skin tone and I
have<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> lot<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> flaws<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> I'm<00:02:33.620> trying<00:02:33.829> to

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
have a lot of flaws that I'm trying to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.430 
have a lot of flaws that I'm trying to
cover<00:02:34.250> up<00:02:34.400> not<00:02:35.150> wearing<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.720> right<00:02:35.989> now<00:02:36.140> by

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
cover up not wearing this right now by

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.380 
cover up not wearing this right now by
the<00:02:36.500> way<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.980> really<00:02:37.549> didn't<00:02:37.820> see<00:02:37.970> any<00:02:38.120> point

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
the way I really didn't see any point

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.229 
the way I really didn't see any point
because<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.560> would<00:02:39.859> have<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.040> looked<00:02:40.579> like<00:02:40.940> I

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
because it would have just looked like I

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.199 
because it would have just looked like I
wasn't<00:02:41.630> wearing<00:02:41.900> makeup<00:02:42.260> if<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.980> had<00:02:43.220> put<00:02:44.030> this

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
wasn't wearing makeup if I had put this

tried<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.430> Revlon<00:04:05.970> one<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:07.020> in<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.440> can

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
tried the Revlon one that is in a can

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.800 
tried the Revlon one that is in a can
that's<00:04:08.100> foam<00:04:08.490> like<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.150> but<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.720> would

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
that's foam like this but I would

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.950 
that's foam like this but I would
imagine<00:04:10.050> it's<00:04:10.710> most<00:04:11.100> likely<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.670> exact<00:04:12.390> same

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
imagine it's most likely the exact same

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.660 
imagine it's most likely the exact same
type<00:04:13.740> of<00:04:13.770> deal<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.980> definitely<00:04:16.980> would<00:04:17.370> not

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
type of deal so I definitely would not

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.479 
type of deal so I definitely would not
recommend<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.810> product<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.830> seems<00:04:20.190> rather

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
recommend this product it seems rather

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.940 
recommend this product it seems rather
pointless<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.299> me<00:04:21.330> as<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:22.260> can<00:04:22.470> see<00:04:22.770> by

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
pointless to me as you can see by

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.280 
pointless to me as you can see by
looking<00:04:22.980> at<00:04:23.460> my<00:04:23.670> hands<00:04:24.240> there<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.990> absolutely

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
looking at my hands there is absolutely

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.000 
looking at my hands there is absolutely
no<00:04:26.190> difference<00:04:26.810> between<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.990> two<00:04:28.200> when<00:04:28.920> you

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
no difference between the two when you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.490 
no difference between the two when you
break<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.490> phone<00:04:29.850> down<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.960> going<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.350> turn

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
break that phone down it's going to turn

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.620 
break that phone down it's going to turn
into<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.860> liquid<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.640> it's<00:04:32.880> going<00:04:33.180> to

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
into a liquid and it's going to

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.400 
into a liquid and it's going to
completely<00:04:34.490> blend<00:04:35.490> into<00:04:35.820> your<00:04:36.180> skin<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:37.380> that

completely blend into your skin so that

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
there is no trace amounts of it left it

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.180 
there is no trace amounts of it left it
just<00:04:41.100> it<00:04:41.850> liquefies<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:43.050> disappears<00:04:43.740> so

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
just it liquefies and disappears so
