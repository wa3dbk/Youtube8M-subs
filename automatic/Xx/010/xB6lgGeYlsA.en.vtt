00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.580
 the 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.430
 he shrugged 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.630
 He had refused just when I was with you 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.009
 recordings are made at the door in the recordings 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.890
 via my pc year old job after the games for the some pictures every app saved on you 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.849
 see the cell phone 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.449
 there I can also see a new one I can actually see the status of home 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.179
 All the lights in the room in the house have a small chance that they can 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.880
 an american and turkey 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.670
 to scare the women that lies on a house eviction site about one 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.400
 are gone 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.580
 for example but you can also say but sit now 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.240
 8 hours in the netherlands it is still the netherlands to watch internationally, I can do that too 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.230
 from any location in the world just do i usually have upstairs and what i have 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.750
 I did said roads school search that just wants to send information 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.450
 and that of coffee and psv once that way I can on my PC 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.490
 and see these graphs that may focus on the set 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.020
 This is an alternative to many people have an automatic dish 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.830
 decided on a big one but I got the headlines for it and the moment it arrived 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.520
 as the top man 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.160
 when she presses a key that the door must open there the door opens like it 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 a bit like they indeed have what you got from your car 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.070
 but what do you want with you 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.670
 I have light sensors I have humidity sensors on brakes 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.350
 For example, a B shift sensors over cameras in the KNMR children's rooms 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.230
 weeks outside of two rooms and I also have the kids room for gamers 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.080
 the young the new playground wherever you are you can check if there is anyone in it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.800
 the nursery 6 is correct 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.600
 that is a nursery and I see that he will be returning to it sometime in the coming days 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.220
 is charged gives 44 percent 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.240
 and the lighting in the house drew lighting in places wherever you are 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.090
 you can always watch all those rooms of the explosion it goes with them 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.380
 that is right 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 Roberto came to say so or to put 10 years with a cheering me 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.710
 am this of course there is freaking and decoding of the combinations to look for 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.040
 and that is the reason that I actually have to do everything about it and always go 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.520
 and also on a cat screen on a PC 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.290
 on the exit that the actually 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.300
 in years it should happen as much as possible automatically what Jan says 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.349
 women of 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.950
 it is necessary to make the led lamp from ezio that it goes out 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.540
 it is necessary that there is a sensor on the fridge, things like that I hear 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.069
 is but if it works well then it is also convenience and then you hear no one 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.359
 about
