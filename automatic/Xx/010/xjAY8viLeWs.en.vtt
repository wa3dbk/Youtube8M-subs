00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 good guys here we are back 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.519
 when finishing playing two games play 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.540
 this and another one for teams plus children 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.830
 how I'm gone, look at her, mate 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.510
 you have to play this game whose two 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.580
 three four or five months a lot of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.519
 time and that we are delivering left like this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.490
 I'm going to play there there's an uncle 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.830
 let's go for the public double and in this 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.929
 game I would say that I am given at the time of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.410
 play better then the one that better me 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.690
 basically because I get up another day 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:42.200
 battlefield 4 but I'm not very good at 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.219
 today with the 100 megabytes that I have and 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 pretty good because I just killed is a 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090
 product but I think I was touched like this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.809
 that I do not want to make illusions 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.870
 for it goes greetings 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 there is about it worth they are three in the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.350
 another team we are winning as I say the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.340
 departure is super short project is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.340
 that leaving more deaf boy 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.339
 there is so much time without playing repercute is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.050
 at the time of aim it is worth going to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.960
 win but as we say otherwise 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.800
 appointment or my god of my life my god of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.050
 my life 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.500
 go maybe cop that takes that damn 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.119
 man god 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.119
 already touch you ask 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.119
 kid 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.670
 this here we are missing two short two 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.670
 bassists two faults 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.259
 it would be very epic metal aircraft site voucher 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.729
 we have won 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.020
 well then tied four sports once 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.399
 that you have seen why, because I have 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.729
 two radios there are a 100 measures because 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.710
 I do not understand why the case is 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.119
 all the time because I started recording 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.500
 diet because the program does not 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.660
 supplied so that's why we have not 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.190
 seen death but it shows that the 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.810
 tree we see counterparts so now 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.490
 see you goodbye ballet and as we are already 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.240
 back in news is concert that 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.040
 this map and we will be preferred and 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.930
 really with the one hand that this is 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.159
 fear I have c4 with the banks that I am 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.290
 on the topic to see what I'm going to think about 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.729
 little bit more but well let's try 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.030
 develop the game as best as possible 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.239
 to be appearing behind 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.959
 gg how funny this was over 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.330
 xavi I shot of me mates for 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.250
 They had been expropriated 6-2 I'm afraid 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.580
 that I think of traction is a fear 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.730
 quite expectantly mind is ahead 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.730
 for her 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.530
 the shooters of people called 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.000
 eye eye that there is between above and others 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.980
 that the left there is a day that the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.129
 left on until later champions we 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.390
 we see in the next video 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.610
 well well I like I like it in like the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.750
 that or it's over, he sees it seriously 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.040
 fastest game in the history of 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.040
 patrick a melanie up here 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.560
 normal is normal as normal I 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.720
 I think that man before he was born 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.690
 was about to become a 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.920
 bedside table of the bedrooms 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.920
 a nightstand 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:25.300
 therefore they have to appear more by 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.300
 here, then, no 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.540
 they gave me a pineapple in my mouth 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.860
 around the groom's mouth 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.980
 They know me and where they come from, my friend 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.040
 my own 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.370
 There is a man who does not even know what else 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.790
 he wants to kill me no sir are 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.659
 the house was already frank from the house 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.659
 the Lord 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.090
 oh my god 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.820

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.820

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.820
 all right 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.960
 I'm a bank and they do not write it at all 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.040
 time without playing obviously impacts on 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.170
 the markers and in the aim 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.170
 to taste it leaves me more red than a tomato 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.390
 but fuck fuck fuck that has rubbed me 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.110
 God 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.970
 and after really 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.280
 I do not know I'm one of those when there's a 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.740
 game worse than when there is not, it 's like 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.409
 something strange and misunderstood 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.420

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.770

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.139

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.189
 the feet 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.189
 touch of the winds 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.230

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.740
