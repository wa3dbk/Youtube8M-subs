00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:15.509
 hello people as usual in minecraft and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.730
 pressure on an oven but that's why it should 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.770
 we may not even go 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.539
 i've announced one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.039
 adventure map to the advent calendar of 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.560
 I'm also here to build herbert 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.480
 The problem is that I last 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.969
 week really had little time for me 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.989
 to take care of it because of private matters 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.149
 and yes I had my big toe 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.190
 sprained it was a little unhappy 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.559
 Accordingly, I had little time and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.930
 was stressful and i could do it too 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.059
 on Wednesday no video noise goggles what 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.810
 You say you are Wednesday I call you 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.090
 That's easy 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.210
 inn Wednesday reported to yes so 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.230
 that I have not done so much yet 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.030
 Nevertheless, you can see what I am doing now 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.090
 I've done that at all 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.790
 lives and I will make an effort that 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.510
 I will definitely be there next week 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.510
 can show more 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.560
 So in the end this is the normal one 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.800
 house here so the web download too 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 Inside is the only thing I already have 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.280
 this is already here 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.030
 this is just a short one 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.460
 dialog 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.820
 you will get a tip here at the beginning 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.330
 still gets out yes that is 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.180
 this waxes effect and then comes 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.030
 it's like herbert too 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.340
 already said in his video this 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.650
 adventskalender that he is one apart 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.630
 drawn story in a lot of small ones 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.210
 parts and I have to somehow 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.010
 try to tell the context 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.840
 that we end up really one 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.120
 Related story have in the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.720
 maybe an adventure map 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.380
 little will deviate from the advent calendar 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.970
 exactly but I need just such a 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.679
 a bit of room to move around 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.720
 To bring in challenges like to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.550
 catch reindeer and stuff like that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.440
 that I can do something like that because 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.150
 otherwise it will be pretty fast now 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.640
 very boring because you actually 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.890
 just walking around and otherwise actually 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.410
 nothing is thundering outside now 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.900
 Great, yes, maybe it would be possible 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.330
 I do not know how it is with you 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.520
 Maybe this text looks like too 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.010
 could still be addressed by you 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.739
 I'll be the worst text 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.140
 try mainly from the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.230
 advent calendar but rausnehmen 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.340
 Wearable that's what I need 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.770
 maybe yours again 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.270
 Support otherwise I will be so 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.620
 pretend text though 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.300
 will entail nothing so then 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.530
 the only thing I still did here 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.850
 I have a bit of the crystal 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.340
 But I want you to fill it now 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.610
 actually not yet times 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.050
 The map will then come out in the 1.8 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.230
 I see you, I'm here too 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.030
 a snapshot because there are so many 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.920
 new features gives us new ones 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.450
 Possibilities allow me to do that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.010
 actually do not want to miss 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.260
 I want to take this step , namely 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.150
 actually let fly over so 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.880
 You can get out and get the sled 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.310
 then see 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.590
 it is actually already in the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.960
 older versions but in the new dem 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.530
 Clown and Phil command are just fine 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.320
 much easier 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.210
 yes that 's it then unfortunately 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.390
 I can not be much more than you 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:49.970
 I promise you 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:52.400
 next week it will continue then hope 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.060
 I insist that then I too 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.300
 hope you can show me a little more 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.820
 you liked it anyway and we see 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.680
 next week or directly from on 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.050
 sunday you want and intervene 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.660
 wanted to my special 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.410

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.370
