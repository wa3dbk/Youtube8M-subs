to understand why these things work you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
to understand why these things work you
need<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> understand<00:00:39.540> what's<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.590> here

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
need to understand what's going on here

need to understand what's going on here
and<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.070> causes<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and what causes them so I'm going to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.560 
and what causes them so I'm going to
explain<00:00:42.960> three<00:00:43.320> different<00:00:43.649> facts<00:00:44.390> first<00:00:45.390> of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
explain three different facts first of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.779 
explain three different facts first of
all<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.289> skin<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> tip<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.370> finger

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
all the skin of the tip of your finger

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.880 
all the skin of the tip of your finger
is<00:00:47.940> very<00:00:48.390> thick<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> skin<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
is very thick just like the skin of the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.319 
is very thick just like the skin of the
palm<00:00:50.690> second<00:00:51.829> anytime<00:00:52.829> fluid<00:00:53.550> comes<00:00:53.820> into

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
palm second anytime fluid comes into

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.810 
palm second anytime fluid comes into
something<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.960> gets<00:00:55.140> larger<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.670> when

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
something it gets larger just like when

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180 
something it gets larger just like when
you<00:00:56.879> sprain<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.180> ankle<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.840> ankle<00:00:58.530> swells

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you sprain your ankle the ankle swells

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.709 
you sprain your ankle the ankle swells
up<00:00:59.399> because<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.760> all<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> fluid<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.510> comes

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
up because of all the fluid that comes

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.229 
up because of all the fluid that comes
in<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.500> help<00:01:01.530> heal<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:02.940> hand

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
in to help heal it and on the other hand

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
in to help heal it and on the other hand
when<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.809> lose<00:01:04.140> fluid<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.769> something<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
when you lose fluid from something it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.030 
when you lose fluid from something it
shrinks<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.820> shrivels<00:01:06.299> that's<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.530> grape

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
shrinks and shrivels that's how a grape

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.359 
shrinks and shrivels that's how a grape
goes<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> raisin<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.720> third<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
goes to a raisin and third in the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.700 
goes to a raisin and third in the
wintertime<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.420> temperature<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.020> lower<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
wintertime the temperature is lower the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
wintertime the temperature is lower the
humidity<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.280> lower<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.700> there's<00:01:15.090> much<00:01:15.330> more

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
humidity is lower and there's much more

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
humidity is lower and there's much more
evaporation<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.500> water<00:01:16.560> from<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:17.340> parts<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
evaporation of water from all parts of

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.200 
evaporation of water from all parts of
our<00:01:18.150> skin<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> let's<00:01:20.130> start<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:21.060> this

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
our skin so let's start with this

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
our skin so let's start with this
representing<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.500> curve<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> tip<00:01:23.340> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
representing the curve of the tip of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.940 
representing the curve of the tip of
your<00:01:23.490> finger<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.540> thickened<00:01:24.869> skin<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
your finger and the thickened skin and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.270 
your finger and the thickened skin and
you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.580> little<00:01:26.759> line<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.780> line

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
you can see this little line this line

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
you can see this little line this line
represents<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.460> crack<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.840> crack<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.350> come

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
represents a crack that crack can come

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.819 
represents a crack that crack can come
from<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.950> simple<00:01:32.340> scratch<00:01:32.930> just<00:01:33.930> over<00:01:34.500> drying

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
from a simple scratch just over drying

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.160 
from a simple scratch just over drying
of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> skin<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:36.119> any<00:01:36.360> other<00:01:36.600> trauma<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
of the skin or any other trauma that

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.460 
of the skin or any other trauma that
happens<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> skin<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.939> crack

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
happens to the skin but you get a crack

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
happens to the skin but you get a crack
the<00:01:40.470> surface<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.070> crack<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.939> loses

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the surface of that crack then loses

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.469 
the surface of that crack then loses
some<00:01:42.930> water<00:01:43.170> by<00:01:43.500> evaporation<00:01:44.210> because<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
some water by evaporation because the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
some water by evaporation because the
skin<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.899> thick<00:01:46.170> there's<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.920> water

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
skin is so thick there's more water

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
skin is so thick there's more water
being<00:01:47.610> lost<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> top<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> bottom

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
being lost at the top then at the bottom

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.300 
being lost at the top then at the bottom
as<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:50.130> result<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.060> crack<00:01:51.329> starts<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.110> open

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
as a result the crack starts to open

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
as a result the crack starts to open
well<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.030> inner<00:01:54.210> part<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.020> skin<00:01:55.259> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
well now the inner part of the skin is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
well now the inner part of the skin is
exposed<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.549> fluid<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
exposed so the fluid because of the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330 
exposed so the fluid because of the
lower<00:01:57.600> temperature<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.170> humidity<00:01:58.649> can

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
lower temperature and humidity can

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.039 
lower temperature and humidity can
evaporate<00:01:59.610> from<00:02:00.060> there<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
evaporate from there and as it

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.190 
evaporate from there and as it
evaporates<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:02.250> pulls<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.909> raisin<00:02:03.630> deal<00:02:03.780> honest

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
evaporates it pulls a raisin deal honest

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649 
evaporates it pulls a raisin deal honest
it<00:02:04.380> shrivels<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> inner<00:02:06.000> parts<00:02:06.479> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it shrivels up so the inner parts of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.240 
it shrivels up so the inner parts of
this<00:02:06.840> crack<00:02:07.110> shrivel<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> pull<00:02:08.129> apart

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
this crack shrivel up and pull apart

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
this crack shrivel up and pull apart
from<00:02:08.700> each<00:02:08.819> other<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:09.690> keep<00:02:09.899> pulling

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
from each other and they keep pulling

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.680 
from each other and they keep pulling
further<00:02:10.739> apart<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.610> more<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.090> more<00:02:12.150> water<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
further apart as more and more water is

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.610 
further apart as more and more water is
lost

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
lost

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960 
lost
it's<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> little<00:02:14.220> bit<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> positive

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
it's a little bit like a positive

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.089 
it's a little bit like a positive
feedback<00:02:15.180> cycle<00:02:15.629> because<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.680> lose<00:02:16.860> more

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
feedback cycle because as you lose more

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.160 
feedback cycle because as you lose more
water<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.580> opens<00:02:17.879> up<00:02:18.030> more<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.420> exposes<00:02:18.810> more

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
water it opens up more it exposes more

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.380 
water it opens up more it exposes more
of<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.410> inner<00:02:19.709> skin<00:02:20.099> but<00:02:20.940> look<00:02:20.970> what<00:02:21.269> what

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
of that inner skin but look what what

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.210 
of that inner skin but look what what
else<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.720> happening<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.470> getting<00:02:22.830> deeper

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
else is happening it's getting deeper

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
else is happening it's getting deeper
and<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> gets<00:02:24.300> deeper<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.870> starts<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.530> hit

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and as it gets deeper it starts to hit

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.229 
and as it gets deeper it starts to hit
nerve<00:02:25.950> fibers<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.550> that's<00:02:26.730> why<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.090> so

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
nerve fibers and that's why it's so

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.170 
nerve fibers and that's why it's so
painful<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> how<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.890> fix<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.910> stop

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
painful so how do you fix this just stop

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.479 
painful so how do you fix this just stop
the<00:02:30.450> leak<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.379> stop<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.860> leak<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.190> that

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
the leak and we stop the leak of that

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.449 
the leak and we stop the leak of that
inner<00:02:32.700> fluid<00:02:33.120> by<00:02:33.690> putting<00:02:34.049> bacitracin<00:02:34.980> or

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
inner fluid by putting bacitracin or

polysporin or any of those other points

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.589 
polysporin or any of those other points
I<00:02:37.830> mentioned<00:02:38.280> right<00:02:38.760> into<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.120> crack<00:02:39.390> and

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
I mentioned right into the crack and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.080 
I mentioned right into the crack and
then<00:02:40.019> covering<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.739> with<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.370> band-aid

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
then covering it with a band-aid

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.970 
then covering it with a band-aid
the<00:02:42.629> band-aid<00:02:43.049> in<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> ointment<00:02:43.440> prevents

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the band-aid in the ointment prevents

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
the band-aid in the ointment prevents
the<00:02:44.340> natural<00:02:44.790> fluids<00:02:45.209> inside<00:02:45.390> from

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the natural fluids inside from

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.860 
the natural fluids inside from
evaporating<00:02:46.410> as<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:47.340> result<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.540> fluid

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
evaporating as a result the fluid

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
evaporating as a result the fluid
accumulates<00:02:49.470> inside<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.430> accumulates

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
accumulates inside and as it accumulates

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.960 
accumulates inside and as it accumulates
it<00:02:51.269> causes<00:02:51.900> swelling<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.190> inner<00:02:53.370> walls<00:02:53.730> of

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
it causes swelling of the inner walls of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.000 
it causes swelling of the inner walls of
the<00:02:54.060> crack<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.599> as<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:55.349> swell<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.860> move

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
the crack and as they swell they move

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.220 
the crack and as they swell they move
closer<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.519> closer<00:02:56.880> together<00:02:57.180> until<00:02:57.630> they

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
closer and closer together until they

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.500 
closer and closer together until they
touch<00:02:58.440> each<00:02:58.500> other<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.280> becomes<00:02:59.819> less<00:03:00.239> deep

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
touch each other it becomes less deep

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.559 
touch each other it becomes less deep
less<00:03:01.319> painful<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.040> as<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.459> result<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.420> two

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
less painful and as a result of the two

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.930 
less painful and as a result of the two
sides<00:03:03.840> coming<00:03:04.230> together<00:03:04.379> it<00:03:04.799> actually<00:03:05.280> heals

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
sides coming together it actually heals

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.990 
sides coming together it actually heals
this<00:03:06.930> process<00:03:07.379> only<00:03:07.620> takes<00:03:08.010> two<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.760> four<00:03:08.970> days

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
this process only takes two to four days

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.280 
this process only takes two to four days
