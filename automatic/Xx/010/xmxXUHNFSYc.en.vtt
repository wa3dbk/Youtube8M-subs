00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.960
 hello guys my family dear 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.880
 who do sports and don't do 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.499
 sports you on the white channel you with you 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.150
 Vladimir 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.950
 Today my video is a review of my purchases 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.129
 that is, I acquired a sports 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.019
 food and also my company reviews 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.519
 pirates and because a lot of guys asked 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.759
 make a rose minus say your 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.880
 subjective opinion about this firm in 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.509
 general my personal opinion about this 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.589
 the company went guys I took myself 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.360
 took the vitamin and mineral complex 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:38.219
 animal pak is complex vitamins and 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.809
 minerals and took creatine monohydrate 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.300
 Why these two products because 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.030
 that when you practice strength when 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.710
 you are a strength you need to lift weights that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.690
 have your task task 1 task to raise 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.559
 you need very vitamins yes that is 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.210
 you must load the body with vitamins 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.579
 immediately for beginners who just started 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.100
 deal with someone not so voluminous 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.259
 who are not as energy-intensive exercise that 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.240
 these vitamins do not suit you 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.860
 fairly simple natural food but 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.680
 when you have a workout like mine 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.650
 let's say you yourself for 100 kilograms 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.829
 weight I now over 100 kilograms you 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.530
 squat for 200 pounds of 10-15 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.590
 approaches also presses presses allow 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.579
 belly 150 ohm too 200 that's all 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.009
 a lot of volume becomes hard for you 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.710
 workouts are energy-intensive therefore need 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.200
 help from such products as 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.950
 sports nutrition and I chose for myself 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.800
 it is also complex vitamins 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.020
 creatine monohydrad 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.000
 now let's move on a little bit moments 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.770
 let's clarify two cakes that animal pak is here 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.060
 such bags may be who does not know 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.399
 but I probably already know 7 products 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.830
 for one simple reason that companies do not 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.720
 alsina virus promoted this products 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.970
 so that the bill and advertising can not be called 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.860
 maybe the product is known to the whole world and 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.289
 don't exactly need my humble francs 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.179
 so what's the catch here is something written 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.320
 out of two packages but then out of two 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.209
 packages it is rather on 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.150
 for those people who are sitting and pharmacology 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.800
 because so much shock doses 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.620
 vitamins they have you simply not 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.110
 I personally agree to use one package 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.800
 the day before training or in the morning after 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.970
 food intake on the tank can be crushed 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.410
 these this sachet low tricks on if 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.420
 maybe that was even better 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.060
 digestibility is not doing it because I'm in 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.250
 principle major heavy workouts i'm 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.250
 I think that here from this package everything 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.280
 vitamins digest go where you want 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.110
 will perform its function also not 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.780
 it is necessary to wait from these vitamins great 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.970
 gain muscle mass that I am here early 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.799
 pain just swing it waited a pity 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.010
 same vitamins are only good 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.049
 feeling good immunity good 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.420
 good performance 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.060
 performance and desire of mood 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.980
 immunity is the key to building up 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.269
 your muscle fibers and strength 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.750
 indicators like I will explain why 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.200
 vitamin and mineral complex 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.200
 also 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.920
 creatine monohydrad old man favorite 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:24.870
 all quacks he hold back a little 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.829
 some water boosts your power especially he 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.269
 lifter lifters in demand yes 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.370
 so I bought it myself that is 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.799
 increase performance again 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.340
 recovery and power that I 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.640
 you need truly by the worker 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.739
 huge product line of all firms 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.359
 sports nutrition monohydrad worker 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.590
 the most proven work product 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:52.650
 sun companies here guys why not 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.599
 amino acids pots why not gainer not 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.170
 protein because I repeat that is 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.390
 I am now saturated with carbohydrates 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.190
 carbohydrate this energy and no 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.920
 catabolic and the movie won't be mine 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.709
 there are processes that have a lot of energy, I do not 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.319
 I eat a lot now almost all my kalorazh of 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.209
 carbohydrates for myself decided that I would 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.760
 now I need more carbohydrates 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.030
 raise strength 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.250
 that's why I think no fighter 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.440
 needs as well as board and day or 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.610
 because food is carbon so and 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.580
 much meat is expressed enough plus 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.060
 such supplement vitamin and mineral 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.169
 complex 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.490
 and creatine enough I can then 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.590
 be in time sometime 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.050
 pre-training complex but this 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.910
 their layer maybe i will scan because 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.340
 that he is nutritious from predrill 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.110
 chose exactly nutritional but there already 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.330
 Separately, let's talk about pretraining 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.770
 another video but everything seems to be about my 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.110
 shopping and recreation kuropatkin shorter 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.389
 guys this is my subjective opinion i am not 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.090
 I say so and not a superstar I am not there 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.020
 Super Humble Strongman Athlete 0 More

 I will never take it again 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.849
 believe that as you know this proverb 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.029
 on 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.679
 maybe someone knows maybe doesn't know 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:13.110
 cheap fish tasteless yushka that is to 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:15.929
 it may be more accessible it may not be 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.729
 so expensive but yes and sorry for thousands 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:21.330
 rubles to give something for what I think is not 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.610
 works with time checking not 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.659
 I personally work according to my feelings 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.219
 I say this way you guys have it even 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.749
 decide to buy these products not 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.759
 buy maybe he doesn't 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:35.459
 working for someone else will work 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:38.749
 this is my personal opinion we will not trade 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:41.789
 bad good i won't clean myself 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:43.769

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.899
 food doesn't work without good 

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:47.729

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:50.159
 correct mode and training ie 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.649
 it's just an active biological 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:55.860
 supplement this bad biologically active 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:57.869
 supplement that with full 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.909
 high-quality ration and full
