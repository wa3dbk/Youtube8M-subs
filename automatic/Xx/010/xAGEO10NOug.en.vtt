00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
this was the last act we see I think

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.790 
this was the last act we see I think
that<00:04:37.800> performance<00:04:38.640> would<00:04:38.940> win<00:04:39.210> the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
that performance would win the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.050 
that performance would win the
$1,000,000<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:41.010> really<00:04:41.430> believe

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.330 

you<00:04:47.060> know<00:04:47.259> people<00:04:48.259> can<00:04:48.410> argue<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:48.830> maybe

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
you know people can argue that maybe

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.580 
you know people can argue that maybe
maybe<00:04:50.150> you're<00:04:50.389> not<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.720> best<00:04:50.990> singer<00:04:51.259> they've

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
maybe you're not the best singer they've

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.680 
maybe you're not the best singer they've
ever<00:04:51.740> heard<00:04:51.979> maybe<00:04:52.340> not<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.910> best<00:04:53.090> performer

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690

some<00:05:38.419> charisma<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.199> had<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.470> unfortunate

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
some charisma you had the unfortunate

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.370 
some charisma you had the unfortunate
experience<00:05:40.160> of<00:05:40.669> following<00:05:41.090> Emily<00:05:41.389> West<00:05:41.630> who

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
experience of following Emily West who

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.400 
experience of following Emily West who
sometimes<00:05:43.310> can<00:05:43.580> turn<00:05:43.820> a<00:05:43.849> song<00:05:44.270> on<00:05:44.509> like<00:05:44.870> that<00:05:45.110> I

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
sometimes can turn a song on like that I

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.740 
sometimes can turn a song on like that I
think<00:05:45.949> I<00:05:46.550> think<00:05:46.639> you<00:05:47.030> might<00:05:47.270> go<00:05:47.479> through

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
think I think you might go through

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.930 
think I think you might go through
because<00:05:47.990> of<00:05:48.560> your<00:05:48.740> charisma<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.460> your<00:05:49.669> looks
