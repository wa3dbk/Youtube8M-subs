00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello people in the course of my diet and also 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.810
 otherwise I have to confess honestly 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.809
 many of you have joined 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.580
 second futur ii of me wanted that 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.690
 first is a bit older that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.519
 but I can still do it in the end 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.310
 link again otherwise you will find 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.390
 It's easy on my channel 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.130
 and that's why I thought it was on 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 the time I make you a second 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.260
 futur ii and although the hcg diet 500 bis 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.090
 800 calories a day version 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.500
 It's not that classic because of me 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.300
 not every day from morning to evening 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.360
 Filmed what I eat 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 but honestly it's because that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.940
 Only one meal a day really 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.710
 Exciting is the breakfast I eat 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 always the same I show you 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.920
 also definitely in the video but it is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.670
 every morning the same thing 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.440
 I do not need each time again 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 film and for lunch 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 or dinner so one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 meal of the day it's always that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 from the day before is left because only one 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.969
 cooking is not worth it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 or salad salad I can 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.890
 you also have two variations 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.510
 demonstrate 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.329
 but it's all about the one 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.470
 meal i stop cooking and which ingredient 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.049
 not the user and how I use it 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.140
 make it so mega low in calories 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 are so mega low calorie yes I have to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 just look that it is 200 to 250 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 kilocalories per serving and me 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 must admit to not count it 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 but it is already the definitely 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 otherwise you can go because of hate 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 please leave at home I had 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.909
 like last time under my last football 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.650
 enough 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.220
 otherwise wish you much fun and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.180
 Have you been well 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.610
 that's the breakfast that i do 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.140
 actually every morning to take me and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 Although we have once in the bowl 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.450
 a large spoon of lean quark diluted 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.899
 with water make it a little bit more 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.970
 yogurt-like consistency gets and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.590
 with my flealy shells I 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.899
 take the ladies in a bit 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.799
 to hold and clean and then 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.659
 I always do a handful 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.700
 berries pure supplier become blue or 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.570
 strawberries or a mixture of both 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.579
 and there is my cup with it 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.860
 Vitamin tablets brink and my msm 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.209
 Msm is an organic one 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.989
 sulfur compound which is to detoxify 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.940
 Well 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.150
 today's dinner is one 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.970
 vegetable pan 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.819
 with zucchini peppers and mushrooms 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.849
 to chicken and spice is the whole 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.829
 with soy sauce and leek onions that it is 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.780
 incredibly tasty i could do it every one 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.519
 I eat and I have so much 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.720
 cooked that it will reach again tomorrow 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.120
 and the day after tomorrow if I get too 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.799
 again today there is salad with the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.439
 remaining fried chicken from 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.420
 yesterday or the remaining chicken that 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.709
 I bought it yesterday then I did 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.189
 still seared along with 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.159
 mushrooms and tomatoes and have got 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:49.090
 I made a mustard lemons sauce and 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.950
 the next is my dessert os there 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.569
 dessert I was totally upset 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.120
 cake and that's why I have me so 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.930
 a low carb cheesecake is trying that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.239
 is actually just quark and sweetened 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.349
 I do it all with stevia and then 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.599
 a little vanilla and cinnamon rhine 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.489
 given and fresh blueberries on top 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.129
 I'm curious if there has become something 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.930
 I'm afraid I have too little in it 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.689
 and the degree says must be together 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.280
 and that's what cheesecake does anyway 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.659
 I'm afraid it's still a bit 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.280
 less inside and he is not stuck 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.919
 Enough, but you can do that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.739
 somehow still expand these attempts 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:26.919
 Today is on the menu 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.169
 Salmon filet with spinach and tomatoes and 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.400
 onions and the remaining mushrooms 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.030
 I know it does not look very appetizing 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.159
 from somehow so far why cut short 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.810
 you do not look so nice 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.730
 but I hope it tastes good 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.620
 Incidentally, I have the fish in aluminum foil 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.239
 in the oven, of course, the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.400
 avoid use of grease 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.959
 that has the consequence that that's nice 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.859
 is juicy and I have herbs 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.030
 a little bit of lemon on top 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.739
 dessert, there's another one 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.280
 cheese cake what I did yesterday 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.169
 have 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.150
 the taste test has however 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.609
 result that they are not yet perfect, the 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.500
 could have a bit of sweetness i have 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.479
 Incidentally, sweetened with stevia I have that 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.579
 I think I already said that and I 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:11.260
 believe for the mass could do even more 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:13.269
 I have now an egg on so 200 bis 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.459
 Was 250 grams curd I do believe this 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.840
 too little so i try it 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.000
 probably next week still x times 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.459
 look what that is then today there are 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.719
 with me zucchini bolognese if you 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.430
 ask you for some reason 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.540
 should what that is that is how 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.950
 spaghetti bolognese 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.080
 that I take place in spaghetti, of course 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.610
 zucchini took to the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.830
 to prevent carbohydrates I may yes 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.600
 No carbohydrates like you know 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.100
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:43.210
 but it was already so delicious 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:44.680
 tasted it is super yummy it ham 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.980
 if you like the mincemeat 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.130
 friendly famous with intention that 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.840
 the light weighted quite lean 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.640
 beef this evening is 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.990
 Temperatures accordingly something completely 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.990
 easy and easy 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.220
 tomato salad with a bit of Munich 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.980
 tomato salad simply consists of 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.490
 two big tomatoes and a half 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.810
 Onion of a raw onion at the dom and 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.920
 I have the chicken with a bit 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.860
 herbal salt and with Italian 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.180
 spiced herbs and yes I believe 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.500
 I do not really get it 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.310
 Looking down , I even have the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.200
 helping it is too hot so hot 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.940
 the breakfast is basically that 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.680
 same yesterday, however, I have myself 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.510
 made raspberry and I think that 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.050
 deserves a special mention because 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.430
 raspberries are simply great manager 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.040
 That's not what I'm starting with 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.320
 water in the mouth together 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.210
 if you said no did you today 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.950

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.900
 my zucchini polonaise i have the 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.070
 Yesterday also eaten because it is real 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.330
 has become much but that's what I wanted 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.330
 then do not show you that too 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.400
 boring twice the same and to 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.520
 a salad with tomatoes and such 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.140
 compact balsamic social delicious 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.150
 our fresh in the weather 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.530
 hopefully it's a bit too little 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.450
 I should actually contain protein 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.310
 At least 100 grams for each meal 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.720
 take protein or what is called 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.730
 At least you should be 100 grams of protein 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.410
 to take me and that was there to the 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.640
 little rest not in there but there 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.630
 I have to stop a bit tonight 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.520

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.490
 no mashed potatoes but no office 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.039
 mashed potatoes but the low carb 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.500
 Replacement it is cauliflower leek

 you do not notice that a bit 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.080
 big differences
