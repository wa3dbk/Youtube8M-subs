00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
it's like this is the top one so that's

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.000 
it's like this is the top one so that's
why<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.730> put<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.209> one<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.480> there<00:03:28.599> this<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.440> the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
why I put that one in there this is the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.100 
why I put that one in there this is the
right<00:03:30.670> one<00:03:30.879> so<00:03:31.120> that's<00:03:31.269> why<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.510> put<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.810> in

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
right one so that's why I put that in

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.630 
right one so that's why I put that in
there<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.379> this<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.799> left<00:03:32.980> one<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.459> that's

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
there and this is the left one so that's

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.729 
there and this is the left one so that's
why<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:33.849> put<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.120> left<00:03:34.420> one<00:03:34.659> there<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:37.739> because

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
why I put the left one there so because

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.339 
why I put the left one there so because
if<00:03:39.099> you<00:03:39.340> don't<00:03:39.459> keep<00:03:39.730> them<00:03:39.940> in<00:03:40.090> order<00:03:40.360> when<00:03:41.200> you
