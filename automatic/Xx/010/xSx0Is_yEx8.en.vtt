I'm going to show you three different
ways<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.519> model<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:30.000> gonna<00:00:30.179> move<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
ways to model I'm gonna move on if you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.889 
ways to model I'm gonna move on if you
need<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> pause<00:00:31.439> go<00:00:31.710> ahead<00:00:32.009> otherwise<00:00:32.899> I'm

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
need to pause go ahead otherwise I'm

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.370 
need to pause go ahead otherwise I'm
gonna<00:00:34.079> move<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.850> in<00:00:35.850> our<00:00:36.480> first<00:00:36.750> example<00:00:36.930> we

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
gonna move on in our first example we

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
gonna move on in our first example we
will<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.010> using<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.460> model<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.059> fraction

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
will be using the model the fraction

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720 
will be using the model the fraction
strip<00:00:39.629> model<00:00:39.809> okay<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.340> say<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> give<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
strip model okay so let's say I give you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.729 
strip model okay so let's say I give you
the<00:00:41.910> example<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.510> number<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.379> fifths

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the example in number one two fifths

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.080 
the example in number one two fifths
divided<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.160> eight<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.520> you're<00:00:44.670> using<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
divided by eight if you're using the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
divided by eight if you're using the
notes<00:00:45.300> make<00:00:45.539> sure<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> write<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.200> down<00:00:46.440> so

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
notes make sure you write that down so

sections<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.119> I'm<00:01:06.180> gonna<00:01:06.270> shade<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.630> two<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
sections and I'm gonna shade in two of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.859 
sections and I'm gonna shade in two of
them<00:01:08.780> that<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> two-fifths<00:01:10.820> okay<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:12.720> I'm

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
them that is two-fifths okay now I'm

going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> show<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.260> divided<00:01:13.830> by<00:01:13.920> eight<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.369> I'm

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
going to show my divided by eight so I'm

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.249 
going to show my divided by eight so I'm
going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> quickly<00:01:14.939> change<00:01:15.330> my<00:01:15.630> color<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> my

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
going to quickly change my color of my

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.469 
going to quickly change my color of my
pen<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.450> to

seven<00:01:41.189> eight<00:01:41.369> sections<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.200> okay<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.500> how

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
seven eight sections now okay that's how

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.899 
seven eight sections now okay that's how
I<00:01:43.710> shaded<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.399> now<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I shaded that in now I'm going to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.539 
I shaded that in now I'm going to
continue<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.630> pattern<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.979> did<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
continue the pattern of what I did so I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.240 
continue the pattern of what I did so I
had<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> break<00:01:48.060> each<00:01:48.270> section<00:01:48.780> boy

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
had to break each section boy

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.180 
had to break each section boy
sorry<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.330> Bell<00:01:51.510> one<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.440> three<00:01:52.950> so

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
sorry about the Bell one two three so

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.560 
sorry about the Bell one two three so
there's<00:01:53.370> four<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> broke<00:01:53.910> into<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.480> I'm

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
there's four I broke into that and I'm

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
there's four I broke into that and I'm
gonna<00:01:54.660> continue<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.440> pattern<00:01:55.740> even<00:01:56.220> for<00:01:56.730> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
gonna continue this pattern even for the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.510 
gonna continue this pattern even for the
strips<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.330> aren't<00:01:57.570> shaded<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.130> okay<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.280> have

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
strips that aren't shaded in okay I have

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.790 
strips that aren't shaded in okay I have
to<00:01:59.700> continue<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.540> key<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.200> answering<00:02:01.560> my

many I have okay I have one okay there's
20<00:02:36.720> sections<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.440> want<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> know<00:02:37.740> what<00:02:37.830> one

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
20 sections I just want to know what one

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.030 
20 sections I just want to know what one
of<00:02:38.070> them<00:02:38.250> represents<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.630> one<00:02:39.870> xx<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.860> my

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
of them represents so one xx is my

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.630 
of them represents so one xx is my
answer<00:02:41.450> okay<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> shaded<00:02:43.530> area<00:02:43.950> was<00:02:44.190> used

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
answer okay and the shaded area was used

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.270 
answer okay and the shaded area was used
when<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.150> divided<00:02:45.750> by<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:46.140> 8<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.740> there<00:02:46.950> after

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
when I divided by my 8 in there after

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.949 
when I divided by my 8 in there after
that<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.700> don't<00:02:47.850> care<00:02:48.150> about<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.420> shaded<00:02:48.840> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that I don't care about the shaded I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.140 
that I don't care about the shaded I
just<00:02:49.140> see<00:02:49.290> how<00:02:49.410> many<00:02:49.470> sections<00:02:49.920> are<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.490> it's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
just see how many sections are and it's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.740 
just see how many sections are and it's
one<00:02:51.390> out<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.600> xx<00:02:52.110> okay<00:02:52.740> 20<00:02:53.250> sections<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.360> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
one out of xx okay 20 sections so that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.720 
one out of xx okay 20 sections so that
means<00:02:54.989> 2/5<00:02:55.650> divided<00:02:55.950> by<00:02:56.100> 8<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.459> 1<00:02:56.970> xx<00:02:57.470> okay

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
means 2/5 divided by 8 is 1 xx okay

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.130 
means 2/5 divided by 8 is 1 xx okay
all<00:02:59.730> right<00:02:59.910> if<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.269> need<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.510> finish<00:03:00.690> capping

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
all right if you need to finish capping

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.990 
all right if you need to finish capping
that<00:03:01.170> down<00:03:01.440> go<00:03:01.709> ahead<00:03:02.010> otherwise<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:02.910> going

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
that down go ahead otherwise I'm going

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.170 
that down go ahead otherwise I'm going
to<00:03:03.090> move<00:03:03.209> on<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> next<00:03:03.660> screen

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
to move on to the next screen

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.610 
to move on to the next screen
okay<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.630> next<00:03:06.959> screen<00:03:07.170> I'm<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.470> use

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
okay in the next screen I'm going to use

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.199 
okay in the next screen I'm going to use
a<00:03:07.650> number<00:03:08.100> line<00:03:08.130> model<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.090> gonna

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
a number line model so this is gonna

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.320 
a number line model so this is gonna
look<00:03:09.420> very<00:03:09.480> similar<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.650> my<00:03:11.150> fraction<00:03:12.150> strip

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
look very similar to my fraction strip

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.240 
look very similar to my fraction strip
model<00:03:12.690> first<00:03:13.320> thing<00:03:13.500> I'm<00:03:13.560> gonna<00:03:13.680> do<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:13.980> I'm

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
model first thing I'm gonna do is I'm

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.790 
model first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:03:14.340> do<00:03:14.580> 1/3<00:03:15.090> divided<00:03:15.720> by<00:03:15.870> 5<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:16.500> gonna<00:03:16.650> make

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
gonna do 1/3 divided by 5 I'm gonna make

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.830 
gonna do 1/3 divided by 5 I'm gonna make
my<00:03:16.950> number<00:03:17.250> line<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:18.350> go<00:03:19.350> 0<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.830> 1<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.660> is

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
my number line so go 0 to 1 and this is

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.009 
my number line so go 0 to 1 and this is
gonna<00:03:22.019> be<00:03:22.080> 1/3<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.120> gonna<00:03:24.269> be<00:03:24.420> 2/3

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
gonna be 1/3 and this is gonna be 2/3

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.740 
gonna be 1/3 and this is gonna be 2/3
and<00:03:25.950> then<00:03:26.160> I'm<00:03:26.340> just<00:03:26.459> gonna<00:03:26.610> kind<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.120> shade<00:03:27.420> in

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
and then I'm just gonna kind of shade in

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.740 
and then I'm just gonna kind of shade in
a<00:03:28.100> solid<00:03:29.100> line<00:03:29.280> here<00:03:29.310> because<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.269> 1/3

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
a solid line here because I have 1/3

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.160 
a solid line here because I have 1/3
represented<00:03:31.459> okay<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:32.519> like<00:03:32.850> 1/3<00:03:33.420> there's<00:03:34.049> my

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
represented okay so like 1/3 there's my

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.229 
represented okay so like 1/3 there's my
number<00:03:34.320> line<00:03:34.560> oh<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.920> would<00:03:35.070> be<00:03:35.130> 3/3<00:03:35.670> or<00:03:35.910> 1

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
number line oh this would be 3/3 or 1

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.400 
number line oh this would be 3/3 or 1
over<00:03:36.269> here<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:36.780> 0<00:03:36.930> 1/3<00:03:37.650> 2/3<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.370> then<00:03:38.519> 1<00:03:39.140> okay

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
over here so 0 1/3 2/3 and then 1 okay

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.920 
over here so 0 1/3 2/3 and then 1 okay
so<00:03:41.010> that's<00:03:41.190> my<00:03:41.370> 1/3<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.150> I've<00:03:42.269> known<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.570> number

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
so that's my 1/3 so I've known a number

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.979 
so that's my 1/3 so I've known a number
line<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.140> represent<00:03:43.709> my<00:03:43.739> 1/3<00:03:44.330> now<00:03:45.330> I'm<00:03:45.840> gonna

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
line and represent my 1/3 now I'm gonna

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.440 
line and represent my 1/3 now I'm gonna
switch<00:03:46.170> my<00:03:46.410> pen<00:03:46.620> color<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.190> I'm<00:03:47.850> gonna<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.299> my

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
switch my pen color and I'm gonna do my

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.990 
switch my pen color and I'm gonna do my
divided<00:03:48.959> by<00:03:49.049> 5<00:03:49.350> part<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.459> what<00:03:50.580> I'm<00:03:50.670> gonna<00:03:50.790> do

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
divided by 5 part so what I'm gonna do

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.180 
divided by 5 part so what I'm gonna do
is<00:03:51.090> I'm<00:03:51.180> going<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.360> take<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.690> my<00:03:51.870> marked<00:03:52.680> area

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
is I'm going to take in my marked area

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.970 
is I'm going to take in my marked area
okay<00:03:53.910> my<00:03:54.120> shaded<00:03:54.540> an<00:03:54.600> area<00:03:54.930> here<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.260> between<00:03:55.709> 0

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
okay my shaded an area here so between 0

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.860 
okay my shaded an area here so between 0
&amp;<00:03:56.160> 1<00:03:56.190> third<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.730> I'm<00:03:57.090> gonna<00:03:57.239> break<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.540> into

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
&amp; 1 third and I'm gonna break it into

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.260 
&amp; 1 third and I'm gonna break it into
five<00:03:58.200> pieces<00:03:58.980> because<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.700> have<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.940> take<00:04:00.090> my

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
five pieces because I have to take my

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.510 
five pieces because I have to take my
shaded<00:04:00.720> area<00:04:01.020> and<00:04:01.590> break<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:01.980> into<00:04:02.160> however

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
shaded area and break it into however

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.440 
shaded area and break it into however
many<00:04:02.880> I'm<00:04:03.000> dividing

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
many I'm dividing

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.490 
many I'm dividing
my<00:04:03.540> pieces<00:04:03.810> in<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:04.620> case<00:04:04.890> 5<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.180> 1<00:04:06.569> 2<00:04:06.959> 3<00:04:06.989> 4

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
my pieces in this case 5 so 1 2 3 4

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.650 
my pieces in this case 5 so 1 2 3 4
marks<00:04:08.190> because<00:04:08.430> that's<00:04:08.610> gonna<00:04:08.730> give<00:04:08.849> me<00:04:08.940> 1<00:04:09.120> 2<00:04:09.330> 3

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
marks because that's gonna give me 1 2 3

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.949 
marks because that's gonna give me 1 2 3
4<00:04:10.050> 5<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.680> broke<00:04:10.950> my<00:04:11.099> shaded<00:04:11.550> area<00:04:11.849> into<00:04:12.720> five

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
4 5 I broke my shaded area into five

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.500 
4 5 I broke my shaded area into five
pieces<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.099> continue<00:04:14.819> that<00:04:15.000> for<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.300> rest

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
pieces and continue that for the rest

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.099 
pieces and continue that for the rest
until<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.079> get<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.350> 1<00:04:16.530> okay<00:04:17.400> 1<00:04:17.730> 2<00:04:17.880> 3<00:04:18.000> 1<00:04:18.690> 2<00:04:18.989> 3<00:04:19.470> 4<00:04:20.340> ok

until I get to 1 okay 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 ok

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.540 
until I get to 1 okay 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 ok
just<00:04:22.109> like<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.500> last<00:04:22.590> problem<00:04:22.770> I'm<00:04:23.220> gonna<00:04:23.370> see

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
just like the last problem I'm gonna see

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.370 
just like the last problem I'm gonna see
how<00:04:23.790> many<00:04:23.850> total<00:04:24.210> sections<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:24.840> have<00:04:25.020> I'm<00:04:25.229> now

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
how many total sections I have I'm now

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.320 
how many total sections I have I'm now
done<00:04:25.440> with<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.830> shaded<00:04:26.220> area<00:04:26.520> I'm<00:04:27.000> just<00:04:27.240> gonna

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
done with the shaded area I'm just gonna

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.219 
done with the shaded area I'm just gonna
count<00:04:27.600> my<00:04:27.810> total<00:04:28.169> sections<00:04:28.650> 1<00:04:29.310> 2<00:04:29.430> 3<00:04:29.580> 4<00:04:29.820> 5<00:04:30.030> 6<00:04:30.570> 7<00:04:31.050> 8

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
count my total sections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.290 
count my total sections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:04:31.560> 10<00:04:31.919> 11<00:04:32.220> 12<00:04:32.880> 13<00:04:33.030> 14<00:04:33.419> 15<00:04:34.320> total<00:04:35.040> sections<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.180> my

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 total sections so my

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.120 
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 total sections so my
answer<00:04:36.690> is<00:04:37.700> 115<00:04:39.470> that's<00:04:40.470> how<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.770> do<00:04:40.919> that

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
answer is 115 that's how you do that

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.980 
answer is 115 that's how you do that
okay<00:04:41.729> so<00:04:41.790> again<00:04:42.150> you're<00:04:42.330> using<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.660> shaded

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
okay so again you're using the shaded

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.810 
okay so again you're using the shaded
region<00:04:43.380> early<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.979> then<00:04:44.190> at<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.490> end<00:04:44.520> you're

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
region early and then at the end you're

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.680 
region early and then at the end you're
just<00:04:44.880> counting<00:04:45.419> your<00:04:45.540> total<00:04:45.930> spots<00:04:47.150> okay<00:04:48.150> I'm

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
just counting your total spots okay I'm

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.360 
just counting your total spots okay I'm
done<00:04:48.870> with<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.169> example<00:04:49.440> I'm<00:04:50.040> gonna<00:04:50.160> go<00:04:50.280> on

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
done with this example I'm gonna go on

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.900 
done with this example I'm gonna go on
example<00:04:50.790> 3<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.210> need<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.419> pause<00:04:51.630> go<00:04:51.900> ahead

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
example 3 if you need to pause go ahead

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.030 
example 3 if you need to pause go ahead
in<00:04:53.910> example<00:04:54.900> 3<00:04:55.139> we're<00:04:55.260> gonna<00:04:55.320> use<00:04:55.530> an<00:04:55.620> area

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
in example 3 we're gonna use an area

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.710 
in example 3 we're gonna use an area
model<00:04:56.190> now<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.790> is<00:04:56.970> going<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.180> look<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.479> little

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
model now this is going to look a little

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
model now this is going to look a little
bit<00:04:57.990> different<00:04:58.440> than<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.680> other<00:04:58.800> one<00:04:59.070> okay<00:04:59.520> so

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
bit different than the other one okay so

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.180 
bit different than the other one okay so
the<00:05:00.300> area<00:05:00.660> model<00:05:00.840> first<00:05:01.260> I'm<00:05:01.470> going<00:05:01.590> to<00:05:01.680> do<00:05:02.040> the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
the area model first I'm going to do the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.379 
the area model first I'm going to do the
era<00:05:02.370> I'm<00:05:03.090> going<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.660> model<00:05:04.530> 3/4<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.970> area

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
era I'm going to model 3/4 this area

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.360 
era I'm going to model 3/4 this area
model<00:05:06.720> we<00:05:06.780> make<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:06.990> rectangle<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.830> then<00:05:08.220> I'm

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
model we make a rectangle and then I'm

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.670 
model we make a rectangle and then I'm
gonna<00:05:08.490> break<00:05:08.700> it<00:05:08.729> into<00:05:08.970> three<00:05:09.060> fourths

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
gonna break it into three fourths

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.170 
gonna break it into three fourths
there's<00:05:10.680> my<00:05:10.889> four<00:05:10.950> sections<00:05:11.639> I'm<00:05:11.820> gonna<00:05:12.000> shade

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
there's my four sections I'm gonna shade

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.879 
there's my four sections I'm gonna shade
in<00:05:12.330> three<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.600> them<00:05:15.169> okay<00:05:16.200> three<00:05:16.620> fourths

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
in three of them okay three fourths

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.640 
in three of them okay three fourths
there's<00:05:17.310> my<00:05:17.460> three<00:05:17.669> fourths<00:05:18.030> now<00:05:18.840> I'm<00:05:19.470> going

there's my three fourths now I'm going

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.159 
there's my three fourths now I'm going
to<00:05:19.710> switch<00:05:19.800> my<00:05:19.889> pen<00:05:20.220> color<00:05:20.490> so<00:05:20.700> you<00:05:20.789> can<00:05:20.820> see

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
to switch my pen color so you can see

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.080 
to switch my pen color so you can see
for<00:05:22.169> my<00:05:22.650> divided<00:05:23.250> by<00:05:23.400> two<00:05:23.460> part

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
for my divided by two part

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.190 
for my divided by two part
all<00:05:24.240> I'm<00:05:24.330> gonna<00:05:24.450> do<00:05:24.750> is<00:05:24.780> take<00:05:25.289> this<00:05:25.440> entire

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
all I'm gonna do is take this entire

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.050 
all I'm gonna do is take this entire
model<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.410> I'm<00:05:28.560> gonna<00:05:28.770> divide<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.130> by<00:05:29.400> 2<00:05:29.460> which

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
model and I'm gonna divide it by 2 which

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.450 
model and I'm gonna divide it by 2 which
means<00:05:30.270> cut<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:30.810> half<00:05:31.050> two<00:05:31.380> pieces<00:05:31.919> I'm<00:05:32.070> okay

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
means cut it in half two pieces I'm okay

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.890 
means cut it in half two pieces I'm okay
this<00:05:32.669> tells<00:05:32.910> me<00:05:32.970> how<00:05:33.120> many<00:05:33.300> pieces<00:05:33.510> I'm<00:05:33.750> gonna

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
this tells me how many pieces I'm gonna

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.779 
this tells me how many pieces I'm gonna
break<00:05:34.080> this<00:05:34.229> into<00:05:34.590> so<00:05:35.160> I'm<00:05:35.220> gonna<00:05:35.310> draw<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.520> big

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
break this into so I'm gonna draw a big

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.600 
break this into so I'm gonna draw a big
line<00:05:36.229> okay<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:37.800> go<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.070> opposite<00:05:38.550> direction

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
line okay and go the opposite direction

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.810 
line okay and go the opposite direction
so<00:05:39.330> perpendicular<00:05:39.780> to<00:05:40.410> my<00:05:40.950> original<00:05:41.130> line<00:05:41.430> I'm

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
so perpendicular to my original line I'm

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.409 
so perpendicular to my original line I'm
gonna<00:05:42.000> break<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.389> into<00:05:42.510> two<00:05:42.750> pieces<00:05:43.310> okay<00:05:44.419> now

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
gonna break it into two pieces okay now

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.529 
gonna break it into two pieces okay now
what<00:05:45.690> I'm<00:05:45.780> going<00:05:46.080> to<00:05:46.110> do<00:05:46.410> is<00:05:46.680> my<00:05:47.460> numerator<00:05:47.820> is

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
what I'm going to do is my numerator is

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.290 
what I'm going to do is my numerator is
going<00:05:49.139> to<00:05:49.200> be<00:05:49.289> made<00:05:49.530> up<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.950> how<00:05:50.849> many<00:05:51.120> are

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
going to be made up of how many are

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.370 
going to be made up of how many are
shaded<00:05:51.780> in<00:05:52.880> one<00:05:53.880> of<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.510> sections<00:05:54.780> okay<00:05:55.349> I

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
shaded in one of the sections okay I

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.650 
shaded in one of the sections okay I
broke<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.740> into<00:05:55.889> one<00:05:56.099> two<00:05:56.400> sections<00:05:56.940> so<00:05:57.570> I'm

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
broke it into one two sections so I'm

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.240 
broke it into one two sections so I'm
gonna<00:05:57.750> see<00:05:57.960> how<00:05:58.139> many<00:05:58.200> are<00:05:58.470> shaded<00:05:58.889> in<00:05:58.979> just

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
gonna see how many are shaded in just

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.659 
gonna see how many are shaded in just
one<00:05:59.669> of<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.210> sections<00:06:00.479> 1<00:06:01.349> 2<00:06:01.889> 3

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
one of the sections 1 2 3

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.219 
one of the sections 1 2 3
that's<00:06:03.180> my<00:06:03.450> numerator<00:06:05.240> my<00:06:06.240> denominator<00:06:06.990> is

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
that's my numerator my denominator is

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.140 
that's my numerator my denominator is
made<00:06:07.440> up<00:06:07.620> of<00:06:07.740> how<00:06:08.010> many<00:06:08.220> total<00:06:08.550> there<00:06:08.849> are<00:06:08.970> in

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
made up of how many total there are in

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.420 
made up of how many total there are in
the<00:06:09.240> entire<00:06:09.510> area<00:06:09.810> model<00:06:10.260> 1<00:06:10.500> 2<00:06:10.979> 3<00:06:11.340> 4<00:06:11.880> 5<00:06:12.720> 6<00:06:13.200> 7<00:06:13.620> 8

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
the entire area model 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.360 
the entire area model 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
so<00:06:14.940> 3

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
so 3

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.900 
so 3
is<00:06:15.880> my<00:06:16.090> answer<00:06:16.720> okay<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:18.160> when<00:06:18.400> you<00:06:18.520> divide<00:06:18.850> by

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
is my answer okay so when you divide by

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.460 
is my answer okay so when you divide by
Stewie<00:06:19.389> that<00:06:19.630> means<00:06:19.780> you<00:06:19.870> break<00:06:20.050> into<00:06:20.260> two

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
Stewie that means you break into two

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.830 
Stewie that means you break into two
sections<00:06:20.940> and<00:06:21.940> then<00:06:22.180> you<00:06:22.240> see<00:06:22.389> how<00:06:22.570> many<00:06:22.630> are

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
sections and then you see how many are

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.439 
sections and then you see how many are
shaded<00:06:23.229> in<00:06:23.380> one<00:06:23.680> section<00:06:24.240> that's<00:06:25.240> your

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
shaded in one section that's your

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.090 
shaded in one section that's your
numerator<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:26.080> then<00:06:26.199> your<00:06:26.380> denominator<00:06:26.949> is

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
numerator and then your denominator is

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.640 
numerator and then your denominator is
the<00:06:27.220> total<00:06:27.550> number<00:06:27.660> okay<00:06:28.660> so<00:06:29.169> that's<00:06:29.350> similar

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
the total number okay so that's similar

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.510 
the total number okay so that's similar
to<00:06:29.949> our<00:06:30.070> multiplying<00:06:30.729> area<00:06:31.720> model<00:06:32.080> actually

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
to our multiplying area model actually

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.180 
to our multiplying area model actually
okay<00:06:33.810> that's<00:06:34.810> how<00:06:35.020> we<00:06:35.080> do<00:06:35.320> this<00:06:35.470> that's<00:06:35.919> our

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
okay that's how we do this that's our

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.219 
okay that's how we do this that's our
last<00:06:36.340> example<00:06:36.580> if<00:06:37.180> you<00:06:37.360> have<00:06:37.479> any<00:06:37.660> questions

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
last example if you have any questions

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.320 
last example if you have any questions
make<00:06:38.410> sure<00:06:38.470> you<00:06:38.710> write<00:06:38.860> them<00:06:39.100> down<00:06:39.310> and<00:06:39.639> you

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
make sure you write them down and you

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.879 
make sure you write them down and you
can<00:06:40.449> ask<00:06:40.660> me<00:06:40.900> tomorrow<00:06:41.169> in<00:06:41.320> class<00:06:41.470> have<00:06:41.860> a
