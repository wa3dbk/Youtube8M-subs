00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
times till we get to the edge can be as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
times till we get to the edge can be as
neat<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.220> possible

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.010 

once<00:01:22.900> you're<00:01:23.050> done<00:01:23.290> just<00:01:23.530> slide<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.100> ruler<00:01:24.430> up

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
once you're done just slide the ruler up

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.650 
once you're done just slide the ruler up
and<00:01:26.020> there<00:01:27.010> you've<00:01:27.340> got<00:01:27.370> that<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.420> now<00:01:28.600> you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
and there you've got that so now you

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.810 
and there you've got that so now you
bring<00:01:29.050> one<00:01:29.320> side<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.770> bottom<00:01:30.010> edges<00:01:30.220> and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
bring one side of the bottom edges and

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
bring one side of the bottom edges and
bring<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.660> up<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:32.200> make<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.410> strong<00:01:32.920> handle<00:01:33.840> then

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
bring it up to make a strong handle then

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.910 
bring it up to make a strong handle then
grab<00:01:35.200> up<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.680> up<00:01:35.800> sticky<00:01:36.190> tape<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.920> wrap

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
grab up it up sticky tape and just wrap

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.420 
grab up it up sticky tape and just wrap
it<00:01:38.950> around<00:01:39.160> it<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.810> get<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.080> strong<00:01:41.380> handle

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.420 

wrap<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.670> around<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:47.980> get<00:01:48.160> some<00:01:48.490> handled

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
wrap it around so you get some handled

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.040 
wrap it around so you get some handled
so<00:01:51.430> then<00:01:51.700> you've<00:01:51.880> got<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.180> handle<00:01:52.600> now<00:01:52.990> you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
so then you've got the handle now you

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.570 
so then you've got the handle now you
can<00:01:53.380> just<00:01:53.640> spread<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.700> down<00:01:55.510> out<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:56.020> bit

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
can just spread it down out a bit

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.630 
can just spread it down out a bit
something<00:01:57.580> like<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:59.190> so<00:02:00.190> that's<00:02:00.400> how<00:02:00.580> to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
something like that so that's how to

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
something like that so that's how to
make<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.540> paper

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
make a paper

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.020 
make a paper
