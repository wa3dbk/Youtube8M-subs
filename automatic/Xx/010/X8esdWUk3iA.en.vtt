00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello hessian comes to my first 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:17.070
 Bake plugin show today i show 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.340
 the plug-in klop this is one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.400
 plug-in where you get a world or 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.910
 So many lots of it are 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.859
 First we introduce this world 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:35.789
 then 1 nv create the name world 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:39.899
 then normal 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:42.899
 then go for generator then curl up 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.629
 I have already done the plug-in 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.629
 So usually twice as the vdp 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.559
 Here we see how on this world 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.559
 you see a lot of land 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 so could you should also command 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.390
 want to buy a house he is on 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.689
 this lot go that they buy 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.350
 want and specify a chat claim or 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.659
 you do it differently 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.520
 in the chat a car then you will 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.590
 automatically on a plot 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.700
 assigned 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.039
 you should not now your property 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.039
 He finds more simply in the chat 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.439
 he automatically logs on to the 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:44.770
 land teleported then there is 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.039
 Of course , others like for example 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:53.420
 where you can see her as verona 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.799
 is whether protect is protected 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.670
 is actually worse 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.619
 So you do not have to do that 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:05.829
 why build almost for a short time 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:08.299
 also just point something out 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.530
 Of course, it should be a big one right now 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:19.510
 house that they no longer lawyer 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:19.510
 you just do it then it's gone though 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.069
 it is still rich should you 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.840
 now another player 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:35.250
 Just add and then add that 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.670
 Names should want to have people 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.930
 the player with it the name 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.080
 Of course there are other commands 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.410
 but they were the stories that it 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.549
 Actually we are coming to 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.390
 installations of this plug in to 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.769
 We'll be back soon 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.110
 come back to the installation of this 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.110
 plugin to a google open 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.980
 then give this first multivan there 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:16.540
 already the first chick we are on 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.750
 download and then I keep it 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.860
 proud me again we can again 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.860
 specify on google 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.480
 and then go out empty 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.060
 that rest then here on download and 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.170
 then stay here again 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.819
 I have already and then go 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.819
 We first in four counter 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.370
 plugins told these two in here 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.810
 us corps and offered me a priest 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.700
 expensive server after that would have a folder 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.410
 with multi us corps and plates 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.610
 appear 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:08.010
 You do not have to do anything more multitasker 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:11.410
 a dashing conficker opens it 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.950
 sweetmeats stand here all things 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.870
 separate 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:21.609
 but the most important thing is that we are down 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.229
 from line 44 claim price here you can 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.260
 shut rates determine how much it 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.840
 should you should want to that 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:35.830
 user like 500 buy a plot 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:39.690
 should then ever 500,000 price that's it 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.569
 plot clean up new player would have 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.080
 then on the 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:50.929
 may work with the may build the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:56.419
 player we never talk there home that yes 

00:04:50.929 --> 00:05:00.610
 on the one hand the most important ones I recommend 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:06.349
 also for this plug in the 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:09.349
 money system michael - to use because that 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.689
 is a bullet simplest I think 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.800
 Of course you can also use others 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:18.199
 but that's up to you 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.619
 should you want to save it the 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.749
 take here and then just yourself 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:27.319
 start at and then he should as 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:29.029
 So that 's it 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.349
 your suggestions or something just write 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:34.330
 in the comments 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.330
 bye until next time
