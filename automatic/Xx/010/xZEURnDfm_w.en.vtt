asteroids and comets the solar system is

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.720 
asteroids and comets the solar system is
short<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.890> main<00:00:18.010> idea<00:00:18.220> is<00:00:18.279> to<00:00:18.310> explain

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
short the main idea is to explain

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.640 
short the main idea is to explain
complicated<00:00:19.180> things<00:00:19.599> in<00:00:19.930> a<00:00:20.199> way<00:00:20.320> that<00:00:20.470> anybody

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
complicated things in a way that anybody

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:29.340 
complicated things in a way that anybody
can<00:00:20.830> understand<00:00:21.250> them<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:28.330> right<00:00:28.570> I'm<00:00:28.900> here

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
can understand them all right I'm here

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.779 
can understand them all right I'm here
at<00:00:29.680> Airbus<00:00:30.180> there<00:00:35.039> you<00:00:36.039> need<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.609> come<00:00:36.760> over

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
at Airbus there you need to come over

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.939 
at Airbus there you need to come over
here<00:00:36.999> and<00:00:37.239> look<00:00:37.359> edge-on<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:38.589> see<00:00:38.739> how<00:00:38.890> it

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
here and look edge-on to see how it

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.829 
here and look edge-on to see how it
really<00:00:39.219> helped<00:00:39.429> in<00:00:39.519> this<00:00:39.670> thing<00:00:39.879> is<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.749> this

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
really helped in this thing is so this

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:42.989 
really helped in this thing is so this
is<00:00:41.019> the<00:00:41.050> carbon<00:00:41.949> fiber<00:00:42.249> just<00:00:42.550> for<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.819> D<00:00:42.909> I'm

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
is the carbon fiber just for the D I'm

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.869 
is the carbon fiber just for the D I'm
sorry<00:00:43.269> get<00:00:43.839> into<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.199> egg<00:00:44.319> drop<00:00:44.499> look<00:00:45.219> if<00:00:45.729> you

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
sorry get into the egg drop look if you

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.180 
sorry get into the egg drop look if you
enter<00:00:46.269> through<00:00:46.479> the<00:00:46.629> candy<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:47.350> have<00:00:47.469> your

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
enter through the candy you have your

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.529 
enter through the candy you have your
living<00:00:48.429> only<00:00:49.269> black<00:00:49.569> out

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
living only black out

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.439 
living only black out
I<00:00:51.859> really<00:00:52.859> like<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.059> Aeronautics<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I really like that Aeronautics this is a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
I really like that Aeronautics this is a
really<00:00:54.929> really<00:00:55.109> fun<00:00:55.260> application<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.430> physics

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
really really fun application of physics

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
really really fun application of physics
it's<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.350> learning<00:00:58.589> new

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it's not you know I like learning new

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.889 
it's not you know I like learning new
fundamental<00:00:59.550> physics<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> play

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
fundamental physics but you get to play

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.410 
fundamental physics but you get to play
around<00:01:01.019> with<00:01:01.789> play<00:01:02.789> around<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.149> these

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
around with play around with these

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
around with play around with these
things<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.009> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
things that you know so when you get to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
things that you know so when you get to
the<00:01:05.280> junction<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> end<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the junction at the end you get the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.609 
the junction at the end you get the
vortex<00:01:07.590> flow<00:01:07.830> coming<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.759> inspiring<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
vortex flow coming it's inspiring you

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.779 
vortex flow coming it's inspiring you
allows<00:01:10.619> us<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:11.009> places<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.460> we've<00:01:11.640> never

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
allows us to go places that we've never

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.539 
allows us to go places that we've never
gone<00:01:12.000> before

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
gone before

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.920 
gone before
everything<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.090> colored<00:01:15.479> orange

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
everything you see that's colored orange

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
everything you see that's colored orange
is<00:01:16.770> flight<00:01:17.130> test<00:01:17.399> installation<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.420> what

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is flight test installation this is what

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.370 
is flight test installation this is what
we're<00:01:18.600> talking<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.170> saying

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
we're talking about how you're saying

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
we're talking about how you're saying
hole<00:01:19.560> holes<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.369> heavy<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.049> exactly

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
hole holes are heavy this is exactly

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:22.999 
hole holes are heavy this is exactly
right

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
right

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.130 
right

an<00:01:32.650> airplane<00:01:33.100> tonight<00:01:33.280> obtained<00:01:33.580> away<00:01:33.820> my

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
an airplane tonight obtained away my

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.730 
an airplane tonight obtained away my
fault<00:01:34.270> excuse<00:01:34.630> me

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
fault excuse me

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.280 
fault excuse me
so<00:01:36.160> this<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.580> carbon<00:01:36.790> fiber<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.080> tape

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
so this is carbon fiber this is the tape

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.530 
so this is carbon fiber this is the tape
matter<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.070> fiber<00:01:39.250> yeah<00:01:39.550> correct<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.360> is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
matter in a fiber yeah correct this is

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.360 
matter in a fiber yeah correct this is
carbon<00:01:40.750> fiber<00:01:41.020> tape<00:01:41.320> they've<00:01:41.950> laid<00:01:42.190> the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
carbon fiber tape they've laid the

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.520 
carbon fiber tape they've laid the
layers<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.730> carbon<00:01:42.940> fiber<00:01:43.060> tape<00:01:43.660> to<00:01:44.260> on<00:01:44.500> a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
layers of carbon fiber tape to on a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.770 
layers of carbon fiber tape to on a
frame<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.100> build<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.760> build<00:01:45.970> up<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.360> surface

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
frame to build to build up the surface

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.900 
frame to build to build up the surface
and<00:01:46.900> they<00:01:47.070> pressure<00:01:48.070> cook<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.820> it

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
and they pressure cook it so that it

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.210 
and they pressure cook it so that it
becomes<00:01:49.180> hard<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:50.170> is<00:01:50.740> going<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.070> be<00:01:51.160> an

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
becomes hard that is going to be an

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.490 
becomes hard that is going to be an
airplane<00:01:51.370> wing<00:01:51.760> it's<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.780> really<00:01:52.990> cool<00:01:53.200> example

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
airplane wing it's a really cool example

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.110 
airplane wing it's a really cool example
of<00:01:53.979> how<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.130> technology<00:01:54.640> works<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:54.940> it's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
of how the technology works and it's

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.340 
of how the technology works and it's
something<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.330> you<00:01:55.479> wouldn't<00:01:55.720> necessarily

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
something that you wouldn't necessarily

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.460 
something that you wouldn't necessarily
think<00:01:56.770> about<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:58.240> our<00:01:58.390> toys<00:01:58.630> yeah<00:02:01.470> the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
think about like our toys yeah the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.320 
think about like our toys yeah the
flight<00:02:02.650> test<00:02:02.800> engineer<00:02:03.040> oh<00:02:03.520> he's<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.150> guy<00:02:04.270> who

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
flight test engineer oh he's the guy who

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.359 
flight test engineer oh he's the guy who

seems<00:03:09.510> amazingly<00:03:10.170> complicated<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.920> build<00:03:11.099> an

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
seems amazingly complicated to build an

seems amazingly complicated to build an
air<00:03:11.340> flame<00:03:11.580> I'm<00:03:11.940> super<00:03:12.480> impressed<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.870> it

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
air flame I'm super impressed that it

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.080 
air flame I'm super impressed that it
even<00:03:13.260> happens<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.670> flash<00:03:14.879> this

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
even happens this is just the flash this

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.280 
even happens this is just the flash this
is<00:03:15.150> not<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> wing<00:03:15.629> that's<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.019> thing<00:03:16.200> that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
is not the wing that's the thing that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.660 
is not the wing that's the thing that
boggles<00:03:16.560> my<00:03:16.650> mind<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.920> most<00:03:17.099> is<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.519> is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
boggles my mind the most is that this is

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.640 
boggles my mind the most is that this is
just<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.780> flap<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.200> backside<00:03:19.620> of
