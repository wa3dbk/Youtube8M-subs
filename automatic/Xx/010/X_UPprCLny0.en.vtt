00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello welcome here at Panasonic 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.680
 you place 2015 and we'll see you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.550
 times the g7 announced that the chamber 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.550
 that you will experience as now 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.020
 bfs a pretty special camera in 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.029
 to have some special colors on 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.040
 among other things here is something 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.779
 female version maybe and then 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.439
 on her completely classic black silver 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.509
 to have 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.220
 what is special about the camera she is 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.989
 specially optimized for self 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.090
 accordingly, among others, a 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.690
 swiveling 180 degrees upwards 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.670
 display 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.769
 there you can look in and have for 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.540
 different from solution model for 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.070
 example could be here then the whole 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.600
 side in it does not work unfortunately always 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.730
 because there are currently a lot of damn people 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.769
 but can stand around , for example 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.630
 a mode in which the camera triggers 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.430
 when two faces come closer together 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.700
 you can see that here and as soon as that 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.660
 happened is the camera then triggers 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.920
 We've also tried her before 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.149
 if the philipp for example to me 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.530
 you are coming see 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.479
 It automatically starts to take pictures 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.890
 make and states that are a few 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.690
 very nice features the camera has 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.130
 just for self it can of course 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.630
 Great use in the moment you get them 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.910
 just and we on a tripod or 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.030
 something like that you have alternative 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.899
 of course also here the possibility 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.850
 skin smooth and such stories 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.170
 Of course we can also turn off if we 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.580
 because it is not on it but is straight 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.380
 Here in the Asian market a very very 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.060
 important functions are not entirely ours 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.140
 so extreme but here you like it 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.930
 if really almost like an oil painting 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.580
 Otherwise, your own skin looks natural 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.320
 by default you have the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.790
 possibility to change objective so 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.310
 clearly is just Micro Four Thirds 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.009
 Objectives that you can grow here here 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.439
 in the case of just the 12 to 32 mm 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.450
 are very compact kit lens with the 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.890
 advantage that it is so nice retract 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 if you need it on the way 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.640
 as I said in principle all micro four 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.960
 thirds compatible compatible of course 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.610
 also with the gf 7 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.140
 pretty much in terms of weight 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.840
 nice so how do you say the combination 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.720
 here weighs about 300 now 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.759
 gram I would guess 350 and is 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.140
 still quite suitable for bags 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.640
 So you at least get into something 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.430
 larger jackets actually loose 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.690
 still purely for the pants but pretty tight 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.160
 maybe a little bit bigger 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.959
 trouser pockets has barely yet 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.459
 since I just think for whole 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 normal jacket pockets so functional 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.040
 also feels great by the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.120
 processing here actually already 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.110
 pretty good 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.700
 A lot of metal wheels are also available 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.290
 So one has me they like actually 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.400
 Alright, as a compact camera 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.200
 I would maybe something 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.670
 get another color there you have to 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 but also like to look again 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.060
 your opinion below in the comments 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.270
 I 'm looking forward to writing 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.270
 soon
