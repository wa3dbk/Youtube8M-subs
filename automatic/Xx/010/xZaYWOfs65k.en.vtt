00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello welcome on how do I do 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.790
 am happy to meet you for a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.490
 new recipe 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.920
 today we are going to realize a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 beef in daube you'll see it's 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 very easy to make 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.570
 you have to do it a little bit 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 advance to marinate the beef 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.510
 but it's really very very simple 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.920
 I'll explain all that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.769
 now 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.660
 first step we degrease the plane the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.030
 more possible you can ask 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.600
 your butcher who does it and or to the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.700
 chopped off 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.140
 you see in pieces enough big tits 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.550
 you can now record sales 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.989
 be a little bigger me I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 find that when it's already not bad 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.670
 so I have 500 g of meat cutting them 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.719
 about ten pieces 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 I put in my club I will add it 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.129
 a bouquet garni so I took some time 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.149
 a small bay leaf and 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.220
 simply will not last but with 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.900
 the string that poses no problem we will 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 add a shallot victims with I 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.780
 was looking for the word with a clove 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.000
 we also put in the dish as well as 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.520
 2 onions then you can the trails 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.119
 I decided to cut them out 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 in cat 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.579
 so we also add the onions 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.130
 in the marinade 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.750
 that's it and we only have 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.520
 resume 40 before me I have four 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.619
 small carrots normally 7.2 if you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.509
 have big 2 that's enough I have 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.210
 stopped my carrots from my garden and are 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.619
 a little small so just 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 take the carrot and cut into 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.939
 small washers 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.299
 in this way I will make one and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.719
 I'll let you do it afterwards 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:01.530
 see small washers of a 10 cm 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.360
 about and did the same with the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.340
 four others 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.820
 once the carrots are cut 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.330
 we only have to take 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:21.380
 coarse salt and we will come this is it 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:26.000
 together as well as weight then me 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.150
 I'm gaining weight in grains like that and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.709
 then we can put a little 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.780
 little classic pepper on top 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.120
 the weight the peppercorns we get 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.810
 will serve you will see thereafter for 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.310
 to make our sauce but that will be that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.270
 tomorrow since it will have to have its 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.230
 marine 12 hours cool so everything and 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.020
 salt pepper 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.870
 all we have to do is add the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:00.800
 wine it takes about half a liter of wine 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.260
 and if we ever do not have enough, see 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.280
 it must happen that the whole plane 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.100
 be well impregnated if we have not 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.890
 enough wine we add a little 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.040
 good water so well it's well after 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.450
 deny your going down a little bit 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.360
 it is especially the meat that must 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.180
 you say marine apprentices 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.940
 we will find laughter all of a 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.340
 film paper and let's go for 12 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.760
 minimum hours in the fridge you can 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.600
 leave 24 hours it will be perfect at 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.480
 fridge and we will finish the recipe so for 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.829
 it will be tomorrow morning we will finish the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.470
 recipe by adding the last 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.970
 ingredients and we will put in the bottom and 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.110
 it's the same the bottom is a little bit 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.709
 long but I'll explain this to you 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.860
 a little later twelve boher were 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.480
 past is therefore the time to move to 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.970
 intuition 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.980
 we will obviously remove the skater 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.630
 friends to protect we will add the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.560
 last elements so just before you 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.959
 preheat your oven to 200 Â° after 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.590
 two hours you can once sam 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:15.590
 that it starts to shudder you can 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.639
 go down to 180 know it so you have to 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.459
 the meat is good 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.930
 it must be baked about four 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.520
 hours know that you can also the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.800
 do it directly on fire like a 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.800
 gut it will work just as well 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.499
 it's in the oven that I'm going to put it to 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.550
 to cook so we will add the foot of 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:39.379
 veal that has been cut into pieces 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.409
 so I have everything for a piece then 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.270
 why a little calf is just going 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.610
 bring him the gelatinous side 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.830
 allow the forest sauce will reduce 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.639
 to have a little gelatinous side 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.800
 she will stand 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.569
 naniwa it's going to be super good besides the 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.789
 club rise and that's something 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.919
 of enough words and to give to see a 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.979
 little bit of taste a piece of bark 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.779
 of orange that obviously we take the 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.330
 untreated oranges a bio of 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:08.240
 preferably we larvae anyway and 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.000
 we head him directly into the 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.449
 preparation for cooking since that 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.719
 must be covered and that I do not have a 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.419
 special cover it's just planned 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.620
 to put another dish on top 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.589
 leaving a little air anyway 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.289
 so that it can escape a 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:29.180
 little bit and I'm going to cook 5 like this at 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.430
 oven directly obviously if you have 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.599
 a casserole that goes to the oven is perfect 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.009
 anti social plan it will be for my 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.169
 next acquisitions 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.750
 that's it, let's go for four 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.539
 baked hours and especially his four 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.909
 hours when we do not touch it we leave 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.659
 cook quietly and will be and here 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.129
 the result 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:57.889
 after about four hours of cooking at 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.399
 reduce then you see the judge has well 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.060
 reduced 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:03.500
 he became a little thicker 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.439
 know if you want even thicker 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.199
 you can just before ten minutes 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:11.289
 before serving take a little bit of 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.250
 juice put it in a saucepan 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.099
 possibly take a little bit of 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.270
 cornflour and thicken it this way 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.379
 you're going to see it's going to give some 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.870
 something a little bit thicker or 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.439
 to actually let it reduce to 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.919
 maximum 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:28.029
 I like the sauce like that 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.949
 mix well with the rest of the food 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:33.080
 whether it is a puree for example or that 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.919
 be it patous or any other 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.810
 vegetables you have chosen 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.129
 the judge that he is politicized is not 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.169
 thick it is between the two is 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.589
 really perfect so just before 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.839
 serve 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:48.500
 obviously we remove the bouquet garni 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:52.729
 we also remove the piece 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.219
 orange peel can be removed 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.680
 peace pieces of vaud now he 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:00.050
 there are people like that so if you are 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.479
 like that wanted to leave if you do not like 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.789
 not that eventually you remove them 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.469
 but know that you can 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:07.580
 reuse for to make others 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:10.339
 other things 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.649
 his luck and it's very serious that can 

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:14.029
 serve in a soup for example you 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:16.750
 boil them and eat you the 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:19.219
 soup after it's super nice short and 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.539
 now with the rest I'm going to you 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.900
 set a little plate for you 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:27.490
 show what it can give 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.650
 at home alone after a 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.090
 presentation like another you see 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.759
 we have small carrots 

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:36.729
 onions sauce meat 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.690
 so obviously this is a plate 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.490
 well stocked 1 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.500
 the recipe I made is for 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.660
 about four people who eat 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.380
 normally it pleads for two big 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:50.970
 eater so after everyone to see the 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:53.850
 quantities that he needs when I say them 

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.860
 it can be accompanied obviously by 

00:07:53.850 --> 00:08:00.400
 carrot potatoes still a 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:04.090
 little more but also pasta 

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.479
 rice - or other vegetables 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.039
 according to your desires and your tastes 

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:12.460
