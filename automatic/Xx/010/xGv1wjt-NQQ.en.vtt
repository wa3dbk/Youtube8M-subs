00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
recommends after 50 some-odd episodes I

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.560 
recommends after 50 some-odd episodes I
think<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.849> finally<00:00:12.059> figured<00:00:12.360> out<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:12.540> I

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
think I finally figured out what I

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.020 
think I finally figured out what I
should<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.840> doing<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.380> show<00:00:14.030> every

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
should be doing with this show every

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.029 
should be doing with this show every
time<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.269> bring<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.630> these<00:00:15.870> games<00:00:16.470> it's

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
time I bring up one of these games it's

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.740 
time I bring up one of these games it's
usually<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.670> there's<00:00:18.060> some<00:00:18.420> very

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
usually because there's some very

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.929 
usually because there's some very
specific<00:00:19.170> aspect<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.130> design<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
specific aspect of the design that I

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.609 
specific aspect of the design that I
think<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.660> interesting<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.500> some

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
think is interesting or that in some

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.490 
think is interesting or that in some
ways<00:00:22.769> I've<00:00:22.980> learned<00:00:23.279> from<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.720> trying<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
ways I've learned from but in trying to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.759 
ways I've learned from but in trying to
talk<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.310> generally<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:27.029> these<00:00:27.240> games<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
talk so generally about these games I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.470 
talk so generally about these games I
usually<00:00:28.769> can't<00:00:29.010> dive<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.300> instead

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
usually can't dive into that so instead

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.690 
usually can't dive into that so instead
I'm<00:00:31.109> gonna<00:00:31.410> very<00:00:31.679> briefly<00:00:32.099> start<00:00:32.520> talking

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
I'm gonna very briefly start talking

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.069 
I'm gonna very briefly start talking
about<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:32.940> games<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.390> one<00:00:33.780> minute

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
about these games like one minute

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.540 
about these games like one minute
because<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.469> don't<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:35.040> need<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> know

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
because you don't really need to know

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.060 
because you don't really need to know
much<00:00:36.329> more<00:00:36.360> than<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> pictures<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
much more than what the pictures on the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.420 
much more than what the pictures on the
screen<00:00:38.399> show<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:40.020> general<00:00:40.649> genre<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
screen show and what general genre and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830 
screen show and what general genre and
why<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.910> interesting<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.690> going

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
why it's interesting and then I'm going

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
why it's interesting and then I'm going
to<00:00:42.870> dive<00:00:43.020> into<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> design<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.489> why<00:00:44.879> I'm

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to dive into the design and why I'm

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.510 
to dive into the design and why I'm
bringing<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> show<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.530> in

and computer only option of having

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.240 
and computer only option of having
instead<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.750> mana<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.970> turn<00:01:14.970> counter

is a fascinating aspect but you've seen
this<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> plenty<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> games<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.930> actually

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
this in plenty of games it's actually

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.140 
this in plenty of games it's actually
not<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> talk<00:01:22.860> about

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
not what I want to talk about

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.190 
not what I want to talk about
fundamentally<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> short<00:01:24.540> version<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:24.990> if

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
fundamentally the short version is if

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.100 
fundamentally the short version is if
you<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.530> CCGs<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.790> more<00:01:27.240> rich<00:01:27.479> CCGs

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
you like CCGs you want a more rich CCGs

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.440 
you like CCGs you want a more rich CCGs
CCG<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.430> compare<00:01:30.030> number<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
CCG that's not just a compare number to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
CCG that's not just a compare number to
other<00:01:30.630> number<00:01:30.930> bigger<00:01:31.140> number<00:01:31.530> wins<00:01:31.799> whoever

deck can only hold so many cards and you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.970 
deck can only hold so many cards and you
just<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.080> start<00:02:28.230> moving<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.860> those

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
just have to start moving out so those

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.530 
just have to start moving out so those
cards<00:02:29.250> are<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.400> work<00:02:29.580> hard<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
cards are you work hard on and you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.450 
cards are you work hard on and you
leveled<00:02:30.960> on<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.770> what<00:02:32.070> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> your

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
leveled on and that what kind of your

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.740 
leveled on and that what kind of your
early<00:02:32.790> cards<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.240> don't<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:33.540> want<00:02:33.720> to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
early cards you don't really want to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.780 
early cards you don't really want to
give<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.100> have<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.460> mean<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.640> feel

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
give up on but you have to mean you feel

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.880 
give up on but you have to mean you feel
like<00:02:36.000> well<00:02:36.720> now<00:02:36.900> those<00:02:37.080> are<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> worthless<00:02:37.500> all

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
like well now those are a worthless all

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.740 
like well now those are a worthless all
those<00:02:38.070> hours<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.340> put<00:02:38.370> into<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.750> are

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
those hours I put into that are

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.550 
those hours I put into that are
meaningless<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.290> me<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.820> as<00:02:42.530> such<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:45.560> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
meaningless to me and so as such it it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.160 
meaningless to me and so as such it it
sort<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.130> lowers<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.510> engagement<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
sort of lowers the engagement of the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.620 
sort of lowers the engagement of the
game<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.650> especially<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.610> has<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.150> rate<00:02:51.390> at

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
game and especially it has the rate at

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.470 
game and especially it has the rate at
which<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:52.020> get<00:02:52.170> new<00:02:52.380> cards<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:53.240> have<00:02:54.240> new

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
which you get new cards and have new

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.510 
which you get new cards and have new
useful<00:02:54.690> cards<00:02:55.110> decreases<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.830> then<00:02:56.310> each

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
useful cards decreases and then each

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.920 
useful cards decreases and then each
time<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.880> are<00:02:57.030> you're<00:02:57.210> also<00:02:57.390> kicking<00:02:57.750> out

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
time you are you're also kicking out

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.270 
time you are you're also kicking out
cards<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.410> spent<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.650> lot<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.830> time<00:02:59.070> on

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
cards that you spent a lot of time on

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.520 
cards that you spent a lot of time on
and<00:02:59.520> so<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.090> kind<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.750> highlight<00:03:01.350> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
and so you kind of highlight the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.800 
and so you kind of highlight the
triviality<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.940> thing<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.390> very<00:03:03.510> thing

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
triviality of the thing the very thing

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.600 
triviality of the thing the very thing
you're<00:03:03.900> doing<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.350> working<00:03:04.710> so<00:03:04.890> hard<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.400> do

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
you're doing and working so hard to do

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.500 
you're doing and working so hard to do
in<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.180> game<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:07.830> lose<00:03:08.010> players<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.580> so<00:03:09.300> what

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
in the game you lose players and so what

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.730 
in the game you lose players and so what
they<00:03:09.690> did<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.050> was<00:03:10.140> really<00:03:10.410> interesting

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
they did that was really interesting

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.250 
they did that was really interesting
answer<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.490> they<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.750> aspect<00:03:13.170> called

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
answer is they have this aspect called

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.340 
answer is they have this aspect called
the<00:03:13.410> gauntlet<00:03:13.850> well<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> goal<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.750> you

your cards and periodically come to

really long run how to keep them

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.500 
really long run how to keep them
interesting<00:04:43.590> how<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.040> force<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.940> player<00:04:45.120> to

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
interesting how to force the player to

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.030 
interesting how to force the player to
change<00:04:45.870> up<00:04:45.990> their<00:04:46.080> deck<00:04:46.260> type<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.560> try<00:04:46.800> new

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.070 
change up their deck type and try new
things<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.580> that's<00:04:48.030> that's<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.630> powerful

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
things and that's that's a powerful

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.060 
things and that's that's a powerful
thing<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.620> bring<00:04:49.830> into<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:51.080> digital<00:04:52.080> CCG<00:04:52.830> and

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
thing to bring into a digital CCG and

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.650 
thing to bring into a digital CCG and
something<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.670> can<00:04:53.820> kind<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.090> only<00:04:54.300> do

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
something that you can kind of only do

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.740 
something that you can kind of only do
in<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.080> digital<00:04:55.410> space<00:04:55.700> but<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:57.090> think<00:04:57.630> it

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
in the digital space but I think it

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.020 
in the digital space but I think it
shows<00:04:58.230> us<00:04:58.530> points<00:04:58.950> us<00:04:59.070> towards<00:04:59.460> something

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
shows us points us towards something

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.550 
shows us points us towards something
that<00:05:00.180> we<00:05:00.240> should<00:05:00.390> be<00:05:00.420> bringing<00:05:00.840> into<00:05:01.050> any<00:05:01.320> of
