Vegas<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.769> think<00:02:08.769> Vegas<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.280> slow<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.610> make

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
Vegas I think Vegas is slow to make

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.059 
Vegas I think Vegas is slow to make
adjustments<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:11.319> know<00:02:11.440> whenever<00:02:11.650> there's

adjustments you know whenever there's

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.630 
adjustments you know whenever there's
such

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
such

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.600 
such
changelings<00:02:13.090> because<00:02:13.800> Vegas<00:02:14.800> looks<00:02:15.400> at

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
changelings because Vegas looks at

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.980 
changelings because Vegas looks at
things<00:02:15.790> they<00:02:16.030> look<00:02:16.180> at<00:02:16.300> mean<00:02:16.569> they<00:02:16.660> have<00:02:16.810> their

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
things they look at mean they have their

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.110 
things they look at mean they have their
set<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.470> power<00:02:17.650> ratings<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.340> everything<00:02:18.970> but

set of power ratings and everything but
I<00:02:19.330> don't<00:02:19.959> think<00:02:20.080> they<00:02:20.170> go<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.650> next<00:02:20.860> level

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.050 
it's been in the past the offense has
been<00:03:29.739> held<00:03:29.950> down<00:03:30.010> because<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.640> teams<00:03:30.850> they

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
been held down because the teams they

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.539 
been held down because the teams they
have<00:03:31.180> played<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.810> Georgia<00:03:32.739> as<00:03:33.010> we've<00:03:33.190> seen

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
have played and Georgia as we've seen

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.590 
have played and Georgia as we've seen
they<00:03:33.760> could<00:03:33.910> put<00:03:34.030> some<00:03:34.150> points<00:03:34.390> on<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.510> board

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
they could put some points on the board

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.300 
they could put some points on the board
so<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:34.959> think<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.650> really<00:03:35.860> good<00:03:36.070> spot

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
so I think this is a really good spot

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.100
