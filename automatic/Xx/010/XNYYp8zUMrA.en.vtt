hole and this way you could insert a nut

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.910 
hole and this way you could insert a nut
if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.860> wish<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.670> we're<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.470> it

if you wish but we're not going to so it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.480 
if you wish but we're not going to so it
