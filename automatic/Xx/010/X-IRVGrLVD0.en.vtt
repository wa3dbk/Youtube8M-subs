Street<00:06:04.440> charger<00:06:04.860> kit<00:06:05.069> from<00:06:05.250> NPC<00:06:05.880> I<00:06:06.090> really

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
Street charger kit from NPC I really

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.080 
Street charger kit from NPC I really
like<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:06.990> kid<00:06:07.199> I<00:06:07.470> do<00:06:07.830> recommend<00:06:08.280> it<00:06:08.610> however

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
like the kid I do recommend it however

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.420 
like the kid I do recommend it however
it<00:06:09.690> is<00:06:09.840> a<00:06:09.870> larger<00:06:10.289> scale<00:06:10.560> 1/16<00:06:11.400> scale

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
it is a larger scale 1/16 scale

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.640 
it is a larger scale 1/16 scale
obviously<00:06:12.000> so<00:06:12.660> it's<00:06:12.900> going<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.110> cost<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.530> little

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
obviously so it's going to cost a little

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.680 
obviously so it's going to cost a little
bit<00:06:13.770> more<00:06:13.889> gonna<00:06:14.699> take<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.000> little<00:06:15.240> bit<00:06:15.330> more<00:06:15.419> to

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
bit more gonna take a little bit more to

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.960 
bit more gonna take a little bit more to
put<00:06:15.870> together<00:06:16.020> and<00:06:16.470> paint<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.340> it's<00:06:17.789> going<00:06:17.880> to

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
put together and paint and it's going to

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.939 
put together and paint and it's going to
take<00:06:18.120> up<00:06:18.270> more<00:06:18.449> space<00:06:18.750> on<00:06:18.990> your<00:06:19.229> you<00:06:19.830> know

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
take up more space on your you know

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:22.070 
take up more space on your you know
shelf<00:06:20.759> area<00:06:21.000> or<00:06:21.240> wherever<00:06:21.419> that<00:06:21.659> you<00:06:21.780> put<00:06:21.930> your

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
shelf area or wherever that you put your

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.809 
shelf area or wherever that you put your
models<00:06:22.409> so<00:06:22.889> that's<00:06:23.009> one<00:06:23.190> thing<00:06:23.340> to<00:06:23.400> consider

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
models so that's one thing to consider

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.129 
models so that's one thing to consider
there<00:06:24.000> isn't<00:06:24.240> a<00:06:24.270> whole<00:06:24.479> lot<00:06:24.509> of<00:06:24.780> things<00:06:24.990> in

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
there isn't a whole lot of things in

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:26.540 
there isn't a whole lot of things in
this<00:06:25.289> scale<00:06:25.560> that<00:06:25.590> are<00:06:25.860> out<00:06:25.979> there<00:06:26.009> so<00:06:26.400> it's

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
this scale that are out there so it's

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.029 
this scale that are out there so it's
going<00:06:26.669> to<00:06:26.759> kind<00:06:27.000> of<00:06:27.090> be<00:06:27.240> alone<00:06:27.509> if<00:06:28.020> you<00:06:28.770> have<00:06:28.919> it

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
going to kind of be alone if you have it

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.320 
going to kind of be alone if you have it
in<00:06:29.159> a<00:06:29.250> collection<00:06:29.669> if<00:06:29.849> you're<00:06:29.909> gonna<00:06:30.060> build<00:06:30.240> a

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
in a collection if you're gonna build a

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.820 
in a collection if you're gonna build a
diorama<00:06:30.509> it's<00:06:30.990> gonna<00:06:31.080> be<00:06:31.259> quite<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.620> large

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
diorama it's gonna be quite a large

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.040 
diorama it's gonna be quite a large
diorama<00:06:32.400> however<00:06:33.120> don't<00:06:33.360> let<00:06:33.569> that<00:06:33.690> sway<00:06:33.870> you

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
diorama however don't let that sway you

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.180 
diorama however don't let that sway you
if<00:06:34.289> you<00:06:34.380> want<00:06:34.560> something<00:06:34.889> a<00:06:34.919> little<00:06:35.099> bit

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
if you want something a little bit

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.730 
if you want something a little bit
different<00:06:35.639> it's<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.180> very<00:06:36.360> detailed<00:06:36.569> kit<00:06:37.050> like

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
different it's a very detailed kit like

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.950 
different it's a very detailed kit like
I<00:06:37.860> said<00:06:38.069> it's<00:06:38.250> gonna<00:06:38.370> run<00:06:38.639> you<00:06:38.720> regular<00:06:39.720> price

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
I said it's gonna run you regular price

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.830 
I said it's gonna run you regular price
for<00:06:39.990> this<00:06:40.319> goes<00:06:40.530> almost<00:06:41.099> about<00:06:41.310> $40<00:06:42.090> before

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
for this goes almost about $40 before

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.450 
for this goes almost about $40 before
shipping<00:06:43.110> so<00:06:43.620> it<00:06:43.770> is<00:06:43.889> a<00:06:43.919> little<00:06:44.190> bit<00:06:44.310> more

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
shipping so it is a little bit more

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.730 
shipping so it is a little bit more
costly<00:06:44.909> however<00:06:45.360> I<00:06:45.720> believe<00:06:46.139> it<00:06:46.530> to<00:06:46.620> be<00:06:46.710> a

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
costly however I believe it to be a

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.920 
costly however I believe it to be a
limited<00:06:47.130> edition<00:06:47.250> kit<00:06:47.789> and<00:06:48.090> this<00:06:48.210> is<00:06:48.389> the<00:06:48.630> I

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
limited edition kit and this is the I

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.040

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
think it's a 2011 or 2012 reissue of

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.409 
think it's a 2011 or 2012 reissue of
