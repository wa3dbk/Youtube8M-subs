with<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> original<00:00:31.080> animation<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> instead

editing<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.550> character<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
editing this character you can see that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.990 
editing this character you can see that
this<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.050> actually<00:00:40.550> vocab<00:00:41.550> David<00:00:41.820> was

matter how is brought in the point is I
don't<00:00:50.430> want<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.699> work<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:50.850> these<00:00:51.059> terms<00:00:51.500> so

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
don't want to work with these terms so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.660 
don't want to work with these terms so
what<00:00:52.800> i<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.010> do<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> i<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> my

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
what i can do is i can go to my

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.220 
what i can do is i can go to my
animation<00:00:54.150> layers<00:00:55.370> i<00:00:56.480> can<00:00:57.480> basically<00:00:57.660> select

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
animation layers i can basically select

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
animation layers i can basically select
many<00:00:58.589> object<00:00:59.040> hopeful<00:00:59.460> objects<00:00:59.879> create<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.300> new

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
many object hopeful objects create a new

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.210 
many object hopeful objects create a new
layer<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> innovation<00:01:01.230> clothes<00:01:01.440> off<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
layer of innovation clothes off now that

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.490 
layer of innovation clothes off now that
but<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.790> active<00:01:03.150> layer<00:01:03.330> so<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.930> will

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
but that's my active layer so that will

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
but that's my active layer so that will
see<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.710> timeline<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:05.339> clear<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:06.360> on

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
see my timeline is now clear going on

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
see my timeline is now clear going on

the lower leg player all my fees are
still<00:01:08.250> there<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> active<00:01:09.330> layer<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
still there but the active layer the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.980 
still there but the active layer the
layer<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.760> snaps<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.540> find

layer of snaps want to go in and find

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.660 
layer of snaps want to go in and find
sudas<00:01:13.409> animation<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.430> where<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
characters going to jump right about

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
characters going to jump right about
there<00:01:16.200> I'm<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> change<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
there I'm going to go in and change the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
there I'm going to go in and change the
position<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> gardener<00:01:19.440> so<00:01:19.710> move<00:01:20.040> over<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
position of the gardener so move over a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.800 
position of the gardener so move over a
little<00:01:20.549> bit<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> give<00:01:21.720> her<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
little bit and then I want to give her a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
little bit and then I want to give her a
little<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.260> clear<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.860> myself<00:01:23.280> over

little bit more clear that myself over
forward<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.930> key<00:01:25.140> frame<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
forward now just a key frame so that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
forward now just a key frame so that
what<00:01:26.640> key<00:01:26.820> frame<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.150> off-center<00:01:27.840> innovation

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
what key frame is off-center innovation

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.590 
what key frame is off-center innovation
so<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.640> lined<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> by

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
so that it's lined up with the by

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
so that it's lined up with the by
indicates<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> deltoid<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
indicates the deltoid so now I have to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.219 
indicates the deltoid so now I have to
actually<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.510> change<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.900> landing

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
actually go in and change the landing

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.359 
actually go in and change the landing
points<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.649> right<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:35.039> toast

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
points all right there we're toast

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so with two single deep breaths I've

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.160 
so with two single deep breaths I've
changed<00:01:43.619> them<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.509> linear<00:01:45.509> placement<00:01:45.990> I've

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
changed them a linear placement I've

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.989 
changed them a linear placement I've
takes<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.649> launch<00:01:47.009> point<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> jump<00:01:47.820> in

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
takes the launch point of the jump in

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.330 
takes the launch point of the jump in
that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.679 
that
so<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.460> i<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.549> continue<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.270> refine<00:01:51.509> this

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
so now i can continue to refine this

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.260 
so now i can continue to refine this
layer<00:01:51.929> or<00:01:52.590> i<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> composite<00:01:53.969> others

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
layer or i can go in a composite others

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.899 
layer or i can go in a composite others
offset<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> top<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.859> so<00:01:56.070> i<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.429> in<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
offset on top of this so i can go in and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.419 
offset on top of this so i can go in and
create<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.359> clear<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.899> instance<00:02:01.159> now<00:02:02.159> we'll<00:02:02.310> go

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
create a clear for instance now we'll go

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.370 
create a clear for instance now we'll go
in<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.700> we'll<00:02:02.759> create<00:02:02.939> another<00:02:03.719> Austin<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
in and we'll create another Austin so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.389 
in and we'll create another Austin so
now<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> want<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> change<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.219> vertical

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
now I want to change the vertical

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
now I want to change the vertical
placement<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.090> right<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.450> where's<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.719> pc

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
placement so right there where's your pc

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.440 
placement so right there where's your pc
is<00:02:07.079> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.289> program<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.789> think

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
is going to program out there I think

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910 
is going to program out there I think
this<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.780> gonna<00:02:09.899> exaggerate<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.619> bullet

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
this I'm gonna exaggerate that bullet

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.039 
this I'm gonna exaggerate that bullet
way<00:02:11.039> up<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.489> maybe<00:02:11.670> pull<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.030> vacaville<00:02:12.450> get<00:02:13.019> a

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
way up and maybe pull in vacaville get a

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.289 
way up and maybe pull in vacaville get a
key<00:02:13.260> now<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.099> entire<00:02:14.400> animation<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:15.120> walks

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
key now the entire animation just walks

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.509 
key now the entire animation just walks
it<00:02:15.569> from<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.900> point<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.530> because<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.220> that

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
it from that point but because of that

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.460 
it from that point but because of that
be<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.030> entire<00:02:18.269> antabuse<00:02:18.599> was<00:02:18.870> offsets<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
be the entire antabuse was offsets of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.949 
be the entire antabuse was offsets of
our<00:02:19.590> other<00:02:19.970> other<00:02:20.970> points<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.540> departure

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
our other other points and departure

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.050 
our other other points and departure
neuro<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.290> point<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.530> landing<00:02:22.890> or<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.880> right

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
neuro the point of landing or so right

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.699 
neuro the point of landing or so right
there<00:02:24.120> where<00:02:24.510> see<00:02:24.690> which<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.380> leaves<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
there where see which in leaves the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.410 
there where see which in leaves the
ground<00:02:25.950> again<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.730> spend<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.090> same<00:02:27.239> place

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
ground again they spend the same place

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.819 
ground again they spend the same place
that<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.019> on<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.200> other<00:02:28.380> layer<00:02:28.560> I

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
that you can just on the other layer I

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.949 
that you can just on the other layer I
want<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.610> create<00:02:29.760> what's<00:02:30.000> going<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.239> 0<00:02:30.480> key<00:02:30.750> so

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
want to create what's going to 0 key so

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.559 
want to create what's going to 0 key so
I'll<00:02:31.170> take<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.470> offset<00:02:31.950> 0<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.450> i'll

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
I'll take that offset 0 it out and i'll

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.839 
I'll take that offset 0 it out and i'll
blend<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.989> down<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.379> base<00:02:34.500> animation<00:02:35.069> that

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
blend it down to the base animation that

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.460 
blend it down to the base animation that
automatically<00:02:36.390> cooperate<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:36.930> also<00:02:37.049> so<00:02:37.349> now

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
automatically cooperate but also so now

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.170 
automatically cooperate but also so now
i<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.709> blend<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> base<00:02:38.519> animation<00:02:39.030> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
i have a blend of the base animation to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.240 
i have a blend of the base animation to
the<00:02:39.269> new<00:02:39.390> offset<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.440> then<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.860> 20

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
the new offset and then I just have 20

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.589 
the new offset and then I just have 20
it<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.549> with<00:02:41.700> some<00:02:41.879> Lance<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.239> right<00:02:42.420> word

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
it out with some Lance the right word

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.240 
it out with some Lance the right word
where<00:02:43.110> he<00:02:43.319> puts<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> ground<00:02:43.890> right<00:02:44.099> about

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
where he puts the ground right about

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.860 
where he puts the ground right about
there<00:02:44.519> 20<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.569> out<00:02:46.280> blend<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.400> out<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.750> now

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
there 20 that out blend it out and now

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.720 
there 20 that out blend it out and now
with<00:02:49.049> drink<00:02:49.319> tea<00:02:49.440> brands<00:02:49.860> I've<00:02:50.069> takes<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.579> get

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
with drink tea brands I've takes to get

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.259 
with drink tea brands I've takes to get
lots<00:02:51.450> point<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.019> vertical<00:02:52.379> placement<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:53.269> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
lots point the vertical placement in the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.569 
lots point the vertical placement in the
landing<00:02:54.690> site<00:02:54.900> /<00:02:55.139> find<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.530> further<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:56.100> can

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
landing site / find is further I can

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.710 
landing site / find is further I can
actually<00:02:56.850> go<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.120> change<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.569> rotation

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
actually go in and change the rotation

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.870 
actually go in and change the rotation
so<00:02:58.620> say<00:02:58.889> for<00:02:58.920> instance<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.340> when<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.519> can<00:02:59.670> change

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
so say for instance I when I can change

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.759 
so say for instance I when I can change
the<00:03:00.090> range<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.569> sin<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.079> might<00:03:01.650> actually

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
the range of the sin I might actually

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.319 
the range of the sin I might actually
want<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.160> give<00:03:02.250> her<00:03:02.310> less<00:03:02.549> rotation<00:03:03.120> at<00:03:03.299> the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
want to give her less rotation at the

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.199 
want to give her less rotation at the
beginning<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.230> she's<00:03:04.380> jumping<00:03:04.680> straight<00:03:04.859> up

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
beginning so she's jumping straight up

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.870 
beginning so she's jumping straight up
and<00:03:06.209> then<00:03:06.480> she'll<00:03:06.780> kick<00:03:07.019> back<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.769> read<00:03:08.700> for

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
and then she'll kick back and read for

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.910 
and then she'll kick back and read for
she'll<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.239> start<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.810> accelerate<00:03:10.109> that<00:03:10.560> spin

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
she'll and start to accelerate that spin

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.430 
she'll and start to accelerate that spin
so<00:03:11.220> then<00:03:11.400> she<00:03:11.579> actually<00:03:12.019> pulled<00:03:13.019> us<00:03:13.200> back<00:03:13.230> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
so then she actually pulled us back a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.490 
so then she actually pulled us back a
little<00:03:13.590> bit<00:03:13.859> she<00:03:14.670> actually<00:03:14.819> starts<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.389> land

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
little bit she actually starts to land

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.860 
little bit she actually starts to land
at<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.430> faster<00:03:17.820> rate<00:03:17.850> towards<00:03:18.240> yes<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:18.690> now<00:03:18.810> he

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
at a faster rate towards yes so now he

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.980 
at a faster rate towards yes so now he
brave<00:03:19.230> lad<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.680> I'm<00:03:19.740> accelerated<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.490> spend

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
brave lad so I'm accelerated to spend

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.210 
brave lad so I'm accelerated to spend
change<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.140> rate<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.500> entire<00:03:22.860> animation

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
change the rate of the entire animation

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.130 
change the rate of the entire animation
from<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.820> point<00:03:24.060> without<00:03:24.360> really<00:03:24.690> having<00:03:24.870> to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
from that point without really having to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.810 
from that point without really having to
worry<00:03:25.350> about<00:03:25.410> what's<00:03:25.860> underneath<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:26.640> other

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
worry about what's underneath in other

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.010 
worry about what's underneath in other
words<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.240> having<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.510> worry<00:03:27.660> about<00:03:27.720> all

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
words of that having to worry about all

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.140

this<00:03:28.160> animation<00:03:29.160> purse<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.760> created<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
this animation purse that created the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.280 
this animation purse that created the
original<00:03:30.240> animation

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
original animation

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.470 
original animation
and<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.890> can<00:03:33.069> turn<00:03:33.219> those<00:03:33.370> lawyers<00:03:33.579> are<00:03:33.939> to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
and you can turn those lawyers are to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.600 
and you can turn those lawyers are to
see<00:03:34.659> the<00:03:34.900> original

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
see the original

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.790 
see the original
but<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:37.020> disable<00:03:37.320> those<00:03:37.620> lawyers

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
but that you can disable those lawyers

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.100 
but that you can disable those lawyers
right<00:03:38.490> so<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.940> layers<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.360> isolated<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.050> if

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
right so the layers are isolated so if

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.540 
right so the layers are isolated so if
you<00:03:40.230> look<00:03:40.380> over<00:03:40.500> here<00:03:40.590> I'm<00:03:40.800> get<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.130> low<00:03:41.310> in

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
you look over here I'm get so low in

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.220 
you look over here I'm get so low in
muting<00:03:41.910> bucks<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.330> like<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.570> would<00:03:42.750> with<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.960> 2d

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
muting bucks just like I would with a 2d

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.570 
muting bucks just like I would with a 2d
compositor<00:03:43.770> or<00:03:43.890> just<00:03:44.130> like<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.370> would<00:03:44.550> with

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
compositor or just like I would with

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.520 
compositor or just like I would with
something<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.270> mud<00:03:45.450> box<00:03:45.660> or<00:03:45.900> photoshop<00:03:46.320> i

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
something like mud box or photoshop i

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.750 
something like mud box or photoshop i
can<00:03:46.680> go<00:03:46.770> in<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.040> turn<00:03:47.130> off<00:03:47.340> any<00:03:47.460> one<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.670> these

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
can go in and turn off any one of these

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.310 
can go in and turn off any one of these
layers<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.300> right<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.140> vertical

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
layers so right here in a vertical

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.900 
layers so right here in a vertical
placement<00:03:49.710> I<00:03:49.950> want<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.190> compare<00:03:50.490> that<00:03:50.520> to<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
placement I want to compare that to the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.610 
placement I want to compare that to the
original<00:03:51.180> animation<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:52.200> actually<00:03:52.470> just

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
original animation I can actually just

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.530 
original animation I can actually just
turn<00:03:52.860> off<00:03:52.890> in<00:03:53.370> those<00:03:53.580> other<00:03:53.760> layers<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.420> now<00:03:54.510> I

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
turn off in those other layers and now I

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.360 
turn off in those other layers and now I
can<00:03:54.780> see<00:03:55.020> where<00:03:55.230> her<00:03:55.440> original<00:03:55.770> animation<00:03:56.070> was

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
can see where her original animation was

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.880 
can see where her original animation was
poor<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.120> could<00:03:57.330> beat<00:03:58.200> up<00:03:58.320> side<00:03:58.500> by<00:03:58.530> side<00:03:58.860> by

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
poor I could beat up side by side by

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.680 
poor I could beat up side by side by
ghosting<00:03:59.490> these<00:03:59.640> buttons<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:00.060> layin<00:04:00.480> set

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
ghosting these buttons here layin set

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.570 
ghosting these buttons here layin set
ghosts<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:01.890> can<00:04:02.070> actually<00:04:02.190> turn<00:04:02.430> on

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
ghosts so I can actually turn on

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.820 
ghosts so I can actually turn on
ghosting<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.240> when<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:03.959> scrub<00:04:04.290> through<00:04:04.500> I'll

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
ghosting and when I scrub through I'll

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.010 
ghosting and when I scrub through I'll
see<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.160> original<00:04:05.340> animation<00:04:05.850> in<00:04:06.450> line<00:04:06.750> and

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
see the original animation in line and

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.500 
see the original animation in line and
right<00:04:07.200> next<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.560> my<00:04:07.950> current<00:04:08.730> animation<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.450> I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
right next to my current animation so I

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.000 
right next to my current animation so I
can<00:04:09.630> get<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.750> clear<00:04:09.959> idea<00:04:10.020> okay<00:04:10.650> that's<00:04:10.860> what<00:04:10.980> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
can get a clear idea okay that's what I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.370 
can get a clear idea okay that's what I
started<00:04:11.310> with<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.360> what<00:04:12.480> i<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:12.720> so

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
started with and this is what i have so

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.600 
started with and this is what i have so
i<00:04:13.410> wanted<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.860> go<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.310> make<00:04:14.400> some

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
i wanted to go in and make some

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.550 
i wanted to go in and make some
fine-tuning<00:04:14.790> investment<00:04:15.570> stayed<00:04:15.810> beside<00:04:16.260> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
fine-tuning investment stayed beside the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.620 
fine-tuning investment stayed beside the
vertical<00:04:16.890> placement<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.340> all<00:04:17.430> too<00:04:17.640> high<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:18.180> can

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
vertical placement is all too high I can

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.720 
vertical placement is all too high I can
grab<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.049> channel<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.459> edit<00:04:20.609> that

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
grab that channel and I can edit that

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.250 
grab that channel and I can edit that
key<00:04:21.120> at<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.419> channel<00:04:21.720> or<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.930> can<00:04:22.140> actually

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
key at that channel or I can actually

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.600 
key at that channel or I can actually
take<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.620> slider<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.310> can<00:04:23.460> actually

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
take the slider and I can actually

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.370 
take the slider and I can actually
interactively<00:04:24.540> adjust<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.080> weight<00:04:25.260> of<00:04:25.350> my

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
interactively adjust the weight of my

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.960 
interactively adjust the weight of my
layer<00:04:25.680> so<00:04:25.919> i<00:04:25.950> can<00:04:26.100> say<00:04:26.250> i<00:04:26.310> want<00:04:26.520> about<00:04:26.669> half

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
layer so i can say i want about half

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.940 
layer so i can say i want about half
that<00:04:27.000> much<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.630> layer<00:04:27.870> blend<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.710> down<00:04:28.919> a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
that much of the layer blend that down a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.409 
that much of the layer blend that down a
little<00:04:29.010> bit<00:04:29.310> say<00:04:29.580> ok<00:04:29.790> that's<00:04:29.910> really<00:04:30.210> about

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
little bit say ok that's really about

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.150 
little bit say ok that's really about
what<00:04:30.720> i<00:04:30.780> want<00:04:31.020> something<00:04:31.380> like<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:31.950> once

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
what i want something like that and once

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.190 
what i want something like that and once
looks<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.210> little<00:04:33.330> more<00:04:33.510> natural<00:04:33.870> or<00:04:34.080> i<00:04:34.110> can

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
looks a little more natural or i can

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.020 
looks a little more natural or i can
actually<00:04:34.440> exaggeration<00:04:35.280> as<00:04:35.370> i<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.700> pump<00:04:35.910> it

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
actually exaggeration as i can pump it

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.629 
actually exaggeration as i can pump it
out

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.270 

right<00:04:41.270> if<00:04:41.419> you<00:04:41.509> go<00:04:41.599> into<00:04:41.749> the<00:04:41.870> graph<00:04:42.050> editor

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
right if you go into the graph editor

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.990 
right if you go into the graph editor
it'll<00:04:43.280> filter<00:04:43.550> your<00:04:43.759> DS<00:04:43.999> so<00:04:44.360> like

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
it'll filter your DS so like

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.950 
it'll filter your DS so like
explosives<00:04:48.000> curves<00:04:48.330> if<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.569> look<00:04:48.690> at<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.810> base

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
explosives curves if you look at a base

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.430 
explosives curves if you look at a base
innovation<00:04:49.580> there's<00:04:50.580> my<00:04:50.729> base<00:04:50.910> curves

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
innovation there's my base curves

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.439 
innovation there's my base curves
there's<00:04:52.440> layer<00:04:52.620> 1<00:04:52.919> there's<00:04:53.759> layer<00:04:53.940> 2<00:04:54.240> now

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449

another<00:04:54.629> thing<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:54.960> can<00:04:55.080> do<00:04:55.229> is<00:04:55.379> one<00:04:55.590> side<00:04:55.830> as

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
another thing you can do is one side as

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.770 
another thing you can do is one side as
I'm<00:04:56.789> working<00:04:56.940> I<00:04:57.210> probably<00:04:57.389> want<00:04:57.599> to<00:04:57.629> keep

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
I'm working I probably want to keep

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.600 
I'm working I probably want to keep
things<00:04:58.020> fairly<00:04:58.289> popular<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.009> I<00:04:59.039> make<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.310> change

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
things fairly popular so I make a change

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.850 
things fairly popular so I make a change
in<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.479> layer<00:05:00.690> maybe<00:05:01.110> some<00:05:01.319> kills<00:05:01.500> in<00:05:01.650> another

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
in a layer maybe some kills in another

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.200 
in a layer maybe some kills in another
layer<00:05:02.129> at<00:05:02.280> some<00:05:02.460> point<00:05:02.669> I'm<00:05:02.729> going<00:05:02.819> to<00:05:02.909> be<00:05:03.030> kind

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
layer at some point I'm going to be kind

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.969 
layer at some point I'm going to be kind
of<00:05:03.330> happy<00:05:03.539> with<00:05:03.750> what<00:05:03.870> I<00:05:03.900> have<00:05:04.139> so<00:05:04.740> now<00:05:04.889> i<00:05:04.919> can

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
of happy with what I have so now i can

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.439 
of happy with what I have so now i can
take<00:05:05.280> these<00:05:05.430> two<00:05:05.580> layers<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.090> can<00:05:06.240> blend

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
take these two layers and I can blend

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.629 
take these two layers and I can blend
them<00:05:06.629> together<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:07.110> can<00:05:07.979> just<00:05:08.099> go<00:05:08.190> into<00:05:08.310> members

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
them together I can just go into members

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.920 
them together I can just go into members
just<00:05:08.970> like<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.210> would<00:05:09.300> merge<00:05:09.479> layers<00:05:09.780> in

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
just like you would merge layers in

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.379 
just like you would merge layers in
Photoshop<00:05:10.379> and<00:05:10.590> find<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.639> call<00:05:11.879> when<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.120> merge

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
Photoshop and find a call when I merge

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.730 
Photoshop and find a call when I merge
that<00:05:12.659> I'm<00:05:12.750> going<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:12.930> do<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> plot<00:05:13.409> they'll

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
that I'm going to do a plot they'll

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.999 
that I'm going to do a plot they'll
actually<00:05:13.949> do<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> really<00:05:14.699> accurate<00:05:16.009> accurate

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
actually do a really accurate accurate

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.100 
actually do a really accurate accurate
lot<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.639> all<00:05:17.909> the<00:05:18.180> frames<00:05:18.479> which<00:05:18.870> is<00:05:18.960> not

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
lot of all the frames which is not

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.510 
lot of all the frames which is not
necessarily<00:05:19.259> what<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.650> want<00:05:19.919> because<00:05:20.069> now<00:05:20.370> I'm

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
necessarily what I want because now I'm

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.059 
necessarily what I want because now I'm
since<00:05:21.030> curves<00:05:21.330> again<00:05:21.659> so<00:05:22.050> promotion<00:05:22.770> building

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
since curves again so promotion building

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.790 
since curves again so promotion building
we<00:05:23.159> brought<00:05:23.340> over<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:23.729> do<00:05:24.440> making<00:05:25.440> process

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
we brought over this do making process

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.159 
we brought over this do making process
called<00:05:25.949> smart<00:05:26.280> big<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.789> smart<00:05:26.970> big<00:05:27.240> basically

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
called smart big and smart big basically

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.749 
called smart big and smart big basically
allows<00:05:28.470> you<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.710> merge<00:05:28.949> current<00:05:29.430> keyframe

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
allows you to merge current keyframe

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.439 
allows you to merge current keyframe
data<00:05:30.000> without<00:05:30.349> having<00:05:31.349> to<00:05:31.620> plot<00:05:32.460> your<00:05:32.490> data<00:05:32.819> so

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
data without having to plot your data so

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:34.909 
data without having to plot your data so
now<00:05:33.569> I<00:05:33.630> actually<00:05:33.840> have<00:05:34.199> a<00:05:34.229> nice<00:05:34.470> clean

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
now I actually have a nice clean

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.309 
now I actually have a nice clean
composite<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.759> all<00:05:36.060> my<00:05:36.330> curves<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.960> only

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
composite of all my curves and only

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.980 
composite of all my curves and only
insert<00:05:37.560> students<00:05:38.159> kind<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.729> where<00:05:39.599> it<00:05:39.780> needed

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
insert students kind of where it needed

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.689 
insert students kind of where it needed
them<00:05:40.199> to<00:05:40.289> in<00:05:40.469> an<00:05:40.560> intelligent<00:05:40.830> way<00:05:41.099> so<00:05:41.250> now<00:05:41.550> can

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
them to in an intelligent way so now can

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.209 
them to in an intelligent way so now can
still<00:05:41.940> go<00:05:42.120> in<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.740> specifically<00:05:43.740> ran<00:05:43.979> at<00:05:44.190> the

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
still go in and specifically ran at the

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.730 
still go in and specifically ran at the
school<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.819> I<00:05:45.000> can<00:05:45.150> retreat<00:05:45.690> at<00:05:45.840> her<00:05:46.050> without

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
school and I can retreat at her without

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.640 
school and I can retreat at her without
having<00:05:47.159> to<00:05:47.810> experts

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.280 

yes<00:05:53.310> yeah<00:05:53.910> motion<00:05:54.360> capture<00:05:54.509> or<00:05:54.990> if<00:05:55.080> you<00:05:55.199> have

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
yes yeah motion capture or if you have

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.990 
yes yeah motion capture or if you have
an<00:05:55.380> animated<00:05:55.800> character<00:05:55.949> rig<00:05:56.250> like<00:05:56.400> one

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
an animated character rig like one

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.360 
an animated character rig like one
person<00:05:57.150> animated<00:05:57.780> at<00:05:57.930> a<00:05:57.960> rig<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:58.650> then<00:05:59.250> you

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
person animated at a rig and then you

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.249 
person animated at a rig and then you
just<00:05:59.520> need<00:05:59.699> another<00:05:59.970> like<00:06:00.389> secondary<00:06:00.840> artists

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
just need another like secondary artists

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.779 
just need another like secondary artists
to<00:06:01.350> make<00:06:01.500> fine<00:06:01.710> tuning<00:06:02.039> investments<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:02.729> they

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
to make fine tuning investments and they

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.900 
to make fine tuning investments and they
can<00:06:02.940> pass<00:06:03.090> them<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.720> character<00:06:04.259> in<00:06:04.380> it<00:06:04.470> and

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
can pass them to the character in it and

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:14.050 
can pass them to the character in it and
positive<00:06:05.910> data<00:06:06.419> or<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:07.530> can<00:06:07.650> make<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.979> out
