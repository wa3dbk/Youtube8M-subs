00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.519
 Last night also track 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 complication I decided not to run but 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.280
 comes this morning like I paid for 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.620
 for my qualifications bases when 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.290
 I went to the line I was denied entry and 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.390
 today I do not feel sorry for putting fanatics 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.760
 they come and they did not want to see me so much that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.960
 have waited but it was for nothing 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.940
 because one can come to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.590
 buy a shirt and see the cars pp 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.360
 crazy a long time ago he was 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.130
 speaking that you come here and 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.009
 precisely I am very many 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.740
 people in the blazers when they came 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.720
 especially to see you run in 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.300
 this track good this what is 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.590
 happening right now is that says it 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.409
 this track does not open more nothing only 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.659
 now better do not mind understand and for 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.270
 bad luck and not when I went there 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.679
 up I said hear this was that I all 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.530
 the same ones that give a motel next to 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.350
 turned side to an hour I left here to 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.630
 all morning they understand or they did not have 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.020
 consideration of letting me run and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.119
 also preferably in that I am 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.310
 runner I that I have for 15 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.409
 years running that 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.780
 what you know about qualifications and your 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.270
 Goya stamp have no obligation 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.130
 understand they are handled in all help with 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.369
 this car I'm testing is not that 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.829
 I was going to be that a record and nothing of 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.200
 that but this machine has a pass 18 1 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.509
 and how they put the 7 does not know that 7 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.640
 the second pass and we will continue to improve 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.910
 but there I do not know that what is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.519
 happening that I spoke to that form and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.890
 me and the best I can do that already 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.590
 this track close because here I do not 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.840
 I return only what I apologize to 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.180
 all my fanatics doubling so I 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.140
 is happening but so sometimes not 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.709
 they have to put pressure to 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.830
 to get it 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:34.480
 the union makes strength understand and I know 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.220
 that when davydenko does not matter because 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.080
 I come to run and he has to see 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.840
 as I feel right now he understands 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.910
 then that they know right now but the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.330
 owner of the car also stayed halfway 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.830
 on the road that has spent a lot 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.830
 money to get here 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.040
 to this car here 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.860
 because I said that I arrived late but 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.900
 Maybe if you turned off you already understand 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.030
 those who were there 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.920
 I am a runner I know console laws if 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.990
 the expensive ones lower us I can I can at 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.930
 understand now there is a law here in 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.570
 orlando good if it comes out and this is not bread 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.120
 I do not come back for this understands and for 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.400
 Unfortunately, yes, but it gives me 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.200
 predicted grief and I feel sorry for the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.810
 people who came to see me that honestly 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.700
 if they are going to stay with the desire but if 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.280
 someday makes an event in west palm 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.040
 beach or rating to which I return 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.709
 You understand 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.190
 the possibility of selling events and others 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:39.000
 cars we go to what happens but 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.470
 that you can go to a sun and not the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 Vitamin I do not care for me now 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.780
 same nothing and if the one who is running the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.400
 event this makes another event that wait 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.930
 that I do not return with your event because 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.420
 it is a man the opposite respecting 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.420
