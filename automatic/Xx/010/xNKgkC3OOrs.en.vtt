00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.580
 I do not believe advertising too much 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.049
 sincerely for me it is an act 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.969
 everyday you buy the exhaust what 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.760
 first and there's the label I just think 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.280
 what I see what what stops for this 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.260
 since before money seems to me that no 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.539
 it is logical but it removed manda labels 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.730
 and if I'm going to try 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.740
 I think I'm in the hype and have a 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.119
 opportunity that can be mine yes yes 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.339
 this guy has won but he knows the 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.650
 boss of nescafÃ© is the brother- in- law from the 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.930
 cousin told me you believe it, not the 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.050
 that more is planted and this I do not believe 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.030
 but I do not believe anything 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.520
 Y 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.030
 i 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 Y 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.879
 good morning everyone welcome to the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 draw of the coffee buttons this year 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 of the year 2013 to us a way to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
 reward the loyalty of our 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.090
 consumers because horta participated in the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.860
 58 percent and on the internet the 42 in the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.110
 100 balls we will draw one and that 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.730
 will determine if the one who is going to win is going to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.030
 belong to those who have participated 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.580
 letter or online the truth in return 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.899
 I seem to see the process now here in 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.070
 live and live direct 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.840
 I'm 98.2 less skeptical than 44 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.509
 We already know that the winner 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.009
 export now as saint tomÃ¡s if you 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.420
 I see what I believe and now I have seen him 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.520
 touched the last video this pile of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.039
 Let's see it and I have passed a stage 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.119
 staff that is this to see a single 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:33.899
 live and well the balls the weight 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.119
 balanced I have seen and therefore you 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.190
 is going to say so he's here now 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.850
 I really know it's not from the cousin and the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.920
 brother in law 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.659
 next year I could send a letter 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.950
 and see if it touches me 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.500
 it sounds 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.200
 as the time for 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.000
 stirring of cards gives a rush about 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.670
 Nerves has been picked up by the letter in the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.670
 air and it's going to take you to lebron 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.300

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.600
 you know what is the first thing that the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.720
 winner when it's your turn I can not 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.720
