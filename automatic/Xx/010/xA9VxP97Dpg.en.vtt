00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
to show you how to create camera shake

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.290 
to show you how to create camera shake
to<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.240> C<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.350> after<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:19.980> created<00:00:20.730> all

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
to your C so after you have created all

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880 
to your C so after you have created all
your<00:00:21.510> animation<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.050> want<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.710> happen

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
your animation you want it to happen

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.620 
your animation you want it to happen
this<00:00:23.189> thing<00:00:23.840> then<00:00:25.640> then<00:00:26.640> select<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.390> camera

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
this thing then then select your camera

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.150 
this thing then then select your camera
um<00:00:28.820> your<00:00:29.820> first<00:00:30.150> go<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.570> first<00:00:30.990> frame<00:00:31.199> kid<00:00:31.859> why

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
um your first go to first frame kid why

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
um your first go to first frame kid why
I<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:34.100> location<00:00:35.100> rotation<00:00:36.469> now<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
I and location rotation now we have a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
I and location rotation now we have a
keyframe<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.640> location<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.450> rotation<00:00:39.510> on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
keyframe for location and rotation on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
keyframe for location and rotation on
our<00:00:40.020> camera<00:00:40.410> then<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.640> graph

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
our camera then we go to the graph

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.209 
our camera then we go to the graph
editor<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.660> because<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.829> lots<00:00:44.100> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
editor and because there are lots of

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
editor and because there are lots of
APIs<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.910> object<00:00:45.420> which<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.899> don't<00:00:45.960> form<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.649> add

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
APIs of object which I don't form to add

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.630 
APIs of object which I don't form to add
it<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.789> click<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:49.050> cross<00:00:49.950> yeah

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it we click this little on cross yeah

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360 
it we click this little on cross yeah
this<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.420> arrow<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:53.190> will

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this little arrow here and this will

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.569 
this little arrow here and this will
only<00:00:53.760> show<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.020> pose<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.710> selected

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
only show on the I pose of selected

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.119 
only show on the I pose of selected
objects<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.559> deselect<00:00:59.250> any<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
objects so I deselect any of these and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.080 
objects so I deselect any of these and
make<00:01:02.129> sure<00:01:02.340> only<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.480> selected<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
make sure only this one is selected I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
make sure only this one is selected I
open<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.180> 3d<00:01:06.780> view<00:01:06.990> over<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.070> makes

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
open this 3d view over here so it makes

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.890 
open this 3d view over here so it makes
me<00:01:08.400> easier<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.000> check<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.340> if<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.909> shake

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
me easier to check if the if the shake

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.560 
me easier to check if the if the shake
is<00:01:12.930> too<00:01:13.290> much<00:01:13.500> or<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.520> select<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> curve

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
is too much or not so select the curve

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.789 
is too much or not so select the curve
now<00:01:15.930> add<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> noise<00:01:16.680> modifier<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:18.350> scale<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.380> up

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
now add a noise modifier I scale it up

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.120 
now add a noise modifier I scale it up
in<00:01:20.189> time<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.990> under<00:01:21.990> no<00:01:23.509> seven<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.630> such<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.909> I

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
in time to under no seven or such and I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.200 
in time to under no seven or such and I
scale<00:01:29.130> also<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.030> mount<00:01:30.299> down<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:32.210> yeah

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
scale also it's a mount down so the yeah

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.109 
scale also it's a mount down so the yeah
how<00:01:33.479> far<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.259> much<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.250> rotated<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
how far or how much it is rotated to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.499 
how far or how much it is rotated to
point<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:37.220> let's<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:38.850> like<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
point to let's see how it looks like and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.240 
point to let's see how it looks like and
this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.340> love<00:01:41.820> -<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.100> maybe<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
this is actually in love - then maybe I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.960 
this is actually in love - then maybe I
are<00:01:44.759> scaled<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.450> Mountain<00:01:46.079> times<00:01:46.350> down<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.070> 225

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
are scaled at Mountain times down to 225

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.130 
are scaled at Mountain times down to 225
and<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> effecting<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:52.640> 2.1<00:01:53.640> nothing<00:01:54.140> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and the effecting to I 2.1 nothing so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.719 
and the effecting to I 2.1 nothing so
now<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.600> nod<00:01:57.600> still<00:01:58.140> too<00:01:58.290> much<00:01:58.729> point

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
now we have a nod still too much point

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.709 
now we have a nod still too much point
zero<00:02:00.119> five<00:02:00.600> let's<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.619> how<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.219> look<00:02:02.719> it's

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
zero five let's see how that look it's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.039 
zero five let's see how that look it's
just<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.439> bit<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.040> shake<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.810> actually<00:02:06.810> I'm

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
just a bit of shake and actually I'm

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.390 
just a bit of shake and actually I'm
going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.469> going<00:02:08.129> through<00:02:08.429> any<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:09.030> these<00:02:10.400> yeah

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
going to going through any of these yeah

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.260 
going to going through any of these yeah
I<00:02:11.819> pose

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
I pose

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.400 
I pose
and<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.900> noise<00:02:14.740> modifier<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.550> each<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.910> them<00:02:16.410> by

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
and in noise modifier to each of them by

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.190 
and in noise modifier to each of them by
the<00:02:17.470> way<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.640> panel<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.630> your<00:02:19.960> noise

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the way if the panel for your noise

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.370 
the way if the panel for your noise
modifier<00:02:20.530> isn't<00:02:21.160> over<00:02:21.820> here<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.930> you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
modifier isn't over here like this you

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.770 
modifier isn't over here like this you
can<00:02:23.590> either<00:02:23.800> click<00:02:24.160> on<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.460> little<00:02:24.640> plus<00:02:24.940> or

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
can either click on this little plus or

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.370 
can either click on this little plus or
just<00:02:26.380> hit<00:02:26.650> n<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.220> your<00:02:27.460> keyboard<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.840> again

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
just hit n on your keyboard so again

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.040 
just hit n on your keyboard so again
let's<00:02:30.100> see<00:02:30.280> how<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.550> looks<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.480> way<00:02:31.990> too

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
let's see how it looks like it's way too

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.400 
let's see how it looks like it's way too
much<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.700> crank<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.570> up<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:36.090> 12.25

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
much so crank that up to to this 12.25

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.060 
much so crank that up to to this 12.25
let's<00:02:38.410> see<00:02:38.650> how<00:02:38.740> it<00:02:38.800> looks<00:02:39.190> ah<00:02:39.600> still<00:02:40.600> too<00:02:40.810> much

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
let's see how it looks ah still too much

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.240 
let's see how it looks ah still too much
so<00:02:42.070> we're<00:02:42.250> going<00:02:42.460> to<00:02:42.700> three<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.990> two<00:02:44.680> point

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
so we're going to three and two point

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.450 
so we're going to three and two point
zero<00:02:45.490> zero<00:02:45.760> one<00:02:47.070> let's<00:02:48.070> see<00:02:49.200> bring<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.950> two

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
zero zero one let's see bring it to two

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.930 
zero zero one let's see bring it to two
left<00:02:51.730> point<00:02:52.510> zero<00:02:52.810> one<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:55.140> ya<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:57.010> it'd<00:02:57.880> be

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
left point zero one see ya think it'd be

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.480 
left point zero one see ya think it'd be
nice<00:02:58.390> one<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.350> two<00:02:59.740> maybe

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
nice one to two maybe

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.680 
nice one to two maybe
so<00:03:01.300> it's<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:01.840> like<00:03:02.110> playing<00:03:02.680> around<00:03:02.860> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
so it's just like playing around and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.160 
so it's just like playing around and
trying<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.810> figure<00:03:05.230> out<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.770> a<00:03:06.130> nice<00:03:06.550> amount

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
trying to figure out in a nice amount

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.280 
trying to figure out in a nice amount
now<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.490> X<00:03:11.100> rotation<00:03:12.300> same<00:03:13.300> thing<00:03:13.600> key

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
now on the X rotation same thing key

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.270 
now on the X rotation same thing key
point<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.860> define<00:03:15.010> on<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:16.180> reduce<00:03:16.540> free<00:03:17.280> but

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
point to define on a reduce free but

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.650 
point to define on a reduce free but
actually<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.480> can<00:03:19.510> see<00:03:20.020> um<00:03:20.790> yeah<00:03:21.790> if<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.330> would

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
actually you can see um yeah if I would

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.150 
actually you can see um yeah if I would
scale<00:03:23.140> them<00:03:23.320> up<00:03:23.500> then<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.700> tops<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.840> those<00:03:26.770> of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
scale them up then the tops and those of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.650 
scale them up then the tops and those of
this<00:03:28.650> those<00:03:29.650> curves<00:03:30.040> actually<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:31.030> same<00:03:31.360> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
this those curves actually the same the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.530 
this those curves actually the same the
mountains<00:03:32.350> are<00:03:32.620> same<00:03:32.980> as<00:03:33.280> are<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.850> lower<00:03:34.180> one

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
mountains are same as are the lower one

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.060 
mountains are same as are the lower one
so<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.410> change<00:03:35.860> that<00:03:36.550> we<00:03:36.940> just<00:03:37.950> change<00:03:38.950> the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
so to change that we just change the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.760 
so to change that we just change the
face<00:03:39.900> which<00:03:40.900> will<00:03:41.459> ya<00:03:42.459> add<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.870> seed<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.350> the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
face which will ya add a seed to the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.220 
face which will ya add a seed to the
randomness<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:46.320> see<00:03:47.970> thing<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.600> this

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
randomness and see thing this this

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.710 
randomness and see thing this this
actually<00:03:50.530> looks<00:03:51.070> like<00:03:51.400> almost<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:52.240> handheld

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
actually looks like almost a handheld

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.280 
actually looks like almost a handheld
camera

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
camera

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.670 
camera
so<00:03:54.010> actually<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.480> handheld<00:03:56.020> camera<00:03:56.320> it's

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
so actually in a handheld camera it's

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.550 
so actually in a handheld camera it's
not<00:03:56.800> only<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.910> rotation<00:03:58.630> which<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:58.870> affected

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
not only the rotation which is affected

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.310 
not only the rotation which is affected
but<00:03:59.740> also<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.340> location<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.690> we<00:04:01.870> are<00:04:01.930> going<00:04:02.200> to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
but also the location so we are going to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.840 
but also the location so we are going to
add<00:04:02.470> when<00:04:02.770> always<00:04:02.980> notifies<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.880> those<00:04:04.390> two

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
add when always notifies to those two

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.370 
add when always notifies to those two
points<00:04:06.850> or<00:04:06.970> one<00:04:10.350> so<00:04:11.350> it's<00:04:11.530> always<00:04:11.800> keepeth<00:04:12.760> no

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
points or one so it's always keepeth no

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.159 
points or one so it's always keepeth no
so<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:15.310> don't<00:04:15.880> actually<00:04:17.010> happen<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.430> high

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
so you don't actually happen to high

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.180 
so you don't actually happen to high
amount<00:04:20.880> like<00:04:21.880> this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
amount like this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.420 
amount like this
point<00:04:24.090> zero<00:04:24.420> one<00:04:25.730> because<00:04:26.730> too<00:04:27.120> strong<00:04:27.480> like

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
point zero one because too strong like

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.090 
point zero one because too strong like
this<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.670> think<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.270> are<00:04:30.780> too<00:04:31.260> much<00:04:31.440> but<00:04:31.830> I

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
this I think this is are too much but I

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.490 
this I think this is are too much but I
think<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.580> shows<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.540> purpose<00:04:34.020> all<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
think it shows the purpose all the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.410 
think it shows the purpose all the
possibilities<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.160> do<00:04:35.490> with<00:04:35.670> north<00:04:35.940> modifier

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
possibilities to do with north modifier

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.640 
possibilities to do with north modifier
so<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:37.590> better<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.310> have<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.960> small<00:04:39.960> model

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
so it's better to have a small model

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.330 
so it's better to have a small model
small<00:04:40.770> noise<00:04:41.190> small<00:04:42.060> shakey<00:04:42.360> camera<00:04:42.690> then<00:04:43.500> so

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
small noise small shakey camera then so

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.960 
small noise small shakey camera then so
much<00:04:44.580> shake<00:04:45.470> that<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.920> actually<00:04:47.730> follow

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
much shake that you can actually follow

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.190 
much shake that you can actually follow
what<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.960> happening<00:04:49.730> so<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:51.120> think<00:04:51.480> this<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:51.930> too

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
what is happening so I think this is too

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.220 
what is happening so I think this is too
much<00:04:52.410> so<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.190> think<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.120> could<00:04:54.390> go<00:04:54.570> through<00:04:54.930> those

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
much so I think I could go through those

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.130 
much so I think I could go through those
here<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.950> print<00:04:56.700> them<00:04:56.940> all<00:04:57.240> down

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.280 

actually<00:05:01.140> I'm<00:05:01.230> going<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.830> point<00:05:02.550> zero<00:05:03.030> zero

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
actually I'm going to point zero zero

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.980 
actually I'm going to point zero zero
right<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:05.520> can<00:05:05.730> copy<00:05:06.030> them<00:05:06.330> by<00:05:06.660> hovering

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
right and you can copy them by hovering

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.170 
right and you can copy them by hovering
with<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.620> amounts<00:05:07.950> about<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.370> radio<00:05:08.700> hitting

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
with the amounts about the radio hitting

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.860 
with the amounts about the radio hitting
ctrl<00:05:09.690> C<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.520> then<00:05:11.520> going<00:05:11.790> to<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.090> others<00:05:12.420> just

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
ctrl C and then going to the others just

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.060 
ctrl C and then going to the others just
paste<00:05:13.290> it<00:05:13.560> there<00:05:13.950> listed<00:05:14.850> there<00:05:15.150> then<00:05:16.140> and

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
paste it there listed there then and

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.430 
paste it there listed there then and
there<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.650> find<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.770> last<00:05:20.040> 100<00:05:24.110> last<00:05:25.110> one

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
there and find the last 100 last one

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:38.950 
there and find the last 100 last one
here<00:05:26.600> there<00:05:27.600> we<00:05:27.750> go<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:33.560> is<00:05:35.450> free<00:05:37.130> this<00:05:38.130> one<00:05:38.430> up

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
here there we go so is free this one up

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.860 
here there we go so is free this one up
now<00:05:39.960> we<00:05:40.020> can<00:05:40.530> actually<00:05:41.300> we<00:05:43.550> yeah<00:05:44.580> unhide<00:05:45.270> any

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
now we can actually we yeah unhide any

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.940 
now we can actually we yeah unhide any
of<00:05:46.440> those<00:05:47.220> scripts<00:05:47.960> let's<00:05:48.960> see<00:05:49.380> how<00:05:49.740> this

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
of those scripts let's see how this

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.600 
of those scripts let's see how this
animation<00:05:50.460> looks<00:05:50.910> so<00:05:51.180> far<00:05:51.650> yeah<00:05:52.650> I<00:05:53.070> think<00:05:53.220> this

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
animation looks so far yeah I think this
