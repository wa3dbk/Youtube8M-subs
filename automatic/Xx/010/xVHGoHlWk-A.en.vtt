last tip exercise I've mentioned are too

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.050 
last tip exercise I've mentioned are too
difficult<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.980> perform<00:02:55.160> with<00:02:55.489> your<00:02:55.550> own<00:02:55.760> body

weight then you can use your legs as
leverage<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.489> know<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.700> can<00:02:58.880> have<00:02:59.000> them
