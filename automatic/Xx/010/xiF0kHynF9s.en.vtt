00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
your attack and adds on to your defense

yes you using digging us don't know
that's<00:04:58.710> fine<00:04:58.889> if<00:04:59.160> we're<00:04:59.729> not<00:04:59.819> using<00:04:59.880> dig

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
that's fine if we're not using dig

we're using exports defensive

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.059 
we're using exports defensive
capabilities<00:05:04.949> so<00:05:05.960> what<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:06.990> suggest<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.530> do<00:05:07.830> is

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.330 
capabilities so what I suggest you do is
you<00:05:08.190> train<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:08.910> defense<00:05:09.360> out<00:05:10.139> here<00:05:10.560> max<00:05:11.009> that

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
you train that defense out here max that

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.129 
you train that defense out here max that
defense<00:05:11.729> because<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.270> defense<00:05:12.330> is<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.960> thing

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
defense because the defense is the thing

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.279 
defense because the defense is the thing
that's<00:05:13.370> weak<00:05:14.370> on<00:05:14.610> beforehand<00:05:15.509> right<00:05:15.690> now<00:05:15.840> or<00:05:16.080> I

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
that's weak on beforehand right now or I

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.040 
that's weak on beforehand right now or I
say<00:05:16.889> we<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.400> don't<00:05:17.580> really<00:05:17.940> mean<00:05:18.180> we<00:05:18.419> but<00:05:18.630> it's

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
say we I don't really mean we but it's

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.560 
say we I don't really mean we but it's
less<00:05:19.349> strong<00:05:19.860> than<00:05:20.190> her<00:05:20.610> special<00:05:21.030> events<00:05:21.389> and

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
less strong than her special events and

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.050 
less strong than her special events and
special<00:05:21.750> tech<00:05:22.110> HP<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.400> want<00:05:23.789> to<00:05:23.880> train

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
special tech HP so you want to train

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.640 
special tech HP so you want to train
that<00:05:24.240> defense<00:05:24.570> out<00:05:24.750> so<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.020> should<00:05:25.139> become<00:05:25.620> a

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
that defense out so it should become a

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.950 
that defense out so it should become a
super<00:05:26.130> tank<00:05:26.370> I'd<00:05:26.880> also<00:05:27.060> suggest<00:05:27.449> training

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
super tank I'd also suggest training

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.430 
super tank I'd also suggest training
some<00:05:28.320> into<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.680> special<00:05:29.310> tech<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.990> now<00:05:30.990> the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
some into the special tech and now the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.379 
some into the special tech and now the
special<00:05:31.800> tech<00:05:31.979> doesn't<00:05:32.370> need<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.759> lot<00:05:32.970> trained

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
special tech doesn't need a lot trained

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.060 
special tech doesn't need a lot trained
into<00:05:33.720> it<00:05:33.840> because<00:05:34.110> well<00:05:34.320> special<00:05:34.740> attack<00:05:34.919> is

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
into it because well special attack is

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.189 
into it because well special attack is
already<00:05:35.340> strong<00:05:35.639> local<00:05:35.909> quarry<00:05:36.270> on<00:05:36.360> her<00:05:36.870> speed

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
already strong local quarry on her speed

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.350 
already strong local quarry on her speed
is<00:05:37.349> pretty<00:05:37.530> slow<00:05:38.069> and<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:38.789> what<00:05:38.909> that<00:05:39.030> means<00:05:39.240> is

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
is pretty slow and so what that means is

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.939 
is pretty slow and so what that means is
you're<00:05:39.479> gonna<00:05:39.539> have<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.780> lot<00:05:39.990> of<00:05:40.020> Pokemon<00:05:40.530> going

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
you're gonna have a lot of Pokemon going

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.390 
you're gonna have a lot of Pokemon going
for<00:05:41.430> her<00:05:41.729> and<00:05:42.169> with<00:05:43.169> any<00:05:43.440> case<00:05:43.710> there<00:05:44.159> are<00:05:44.250> some

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
for her and with any case there are some

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.920 
for her and with any case there are some
advantages<00:05:44.759> to<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.389> there<00:05:45.690> are<00:05:45.750> some

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
advantages to that there are some

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.529 
advantages to that there are some
disadvantages<00:05:46.259> to<00:05:46.889> that<00:05:46.919> now<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.729> think

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
disadvantages to that now I think

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.719 
disadvantages to that now I think
generally<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:49.680> want<00:05:49.949> to<00:05:50.070> be<00:05:50.190> going<00:05:50.370> first

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
generally you want to be going first

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.210 
generally you want to be going first
with<00:05:51.030> before<00:05:51.509> and<00:05:51.659> on<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:52.050> so<00:05:52.500> I<00:05:52.530> would<00:05:52.800> try<00:05:53.130> to

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
with before and on and so I would try to

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.560 
with before and on and so I would try to
train<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.520> little<00:05:53.699> bit<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:54.000> speed<00:05:54.180> in<00:05:54.300> there<00:05:54.419> you

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
train a little bit of speed in there you

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.060 
train a little bit of speed in there you
can't<00:05:54.750> expect<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.169> be<00:05:55.199> beating<00:05:55.560> every<00:05:55.770> single

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
can't expect to be beating every single

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.129 
can't expect to be beating every single
Pokemon<00:05:56.460> in<00:05:56.669> a<00:05:56.759> speed<00:05:57.030> race<00:05:57.240> there<00:05:57.810> are<00:05:57.900> going

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
Pokemon in a speed race there are going

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.930 
Pokemon in a speed race there are going
to<00:05:58.229> be<00:05:58.320> ones<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.620> are<00:05:58.800> purely<00:05:59.280> trained<00:05:59.759> to

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
to be ones that are purely trained to

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.810 
to be ones that are purely trained to
just<00:06:00.120> demolish<00:06:00.659> you<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:01.080> speed<00:06:01.770> and<00:06:02.610> there's

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
just demolish you and speed and there's

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.230 
just demolish you and speed and there's
nothing<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.150> can<00:06:03.389> do<00:06:03.509> about<00:06:03.630> that<00:06:03.780> but

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
nothing you can do about that but
