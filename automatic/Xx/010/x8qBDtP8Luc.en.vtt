00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
can see I'm starting to bring it up at

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.720 
can see I'm starting to bring it up at
an<00:05:30.050> angle<00:05:30.230> now<00:05:30.830> my<00:05:30.980> scissors<00:05:31.250> weren't<00:05:31.520> sharp

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
an angle now my scissors weren't sharp

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.250 
an angle now my scissors weren't sharp
at<00:05:31.880> all<00:05:31.970> so<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.330> was<00:05:32.420> giving<00:05:32.690> me<00:05:32.810> a<00:05:32.840> heck<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.080> a

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
at all so it was giving me a heck of a

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.020 
at all so it was giving me a heck of a
time<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.160> we're<00:05:34.370> just<00:05:34.400> going<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.640> take<00:05:34.820> this

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
time so we're just going to take this

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.910 
time so we're just going to take this
and<00:05:35.270> bring<00:05:35.450> this<00:05:35.600> up<00:05:35.780> as<00:05:35.930> an<00:05:36.050> angle<00:05:36.410> and<00:05:36.620> then

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
and bring this up as an angle and then

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.050 
and bring this up as an angle and then
we're<00:05:37.010> gonna<00:05:37.100> do<00:05:37.280> the<00:05:37.400> same<00:05:37.580> thing<00:05:37.640> on<00:05:37.940> the

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
we're gonna do the same thing on the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:06:15.860 
we're gonna do the same thing on the
other<00:05:38.090> side<00:05:45.160> see<00:05:46.160> that<00:05:46.340> is<00:05:46.460> so<00:05:46.790> much<00:05:47.000> better

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.160 

so<00:06:16.870> the<00:06:16.990> Betty<00:06:17.200> bang<00:06:17.470> is<00:06:17.650> coming<00:06:17.920> along<00:06:19.020> so<00:06:20.020> as

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 
so the Betty bang is coming along so as

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.630 
so the Betty bang is coming along so as
you<00:06:20.320> can<00:06:20.440> tell<00:06:20.650> we've<00:06:20.860> cut<00:06:21.100> the<00:06:21.190> Betty<00:06:21.370> bang

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
you can tell we've cut the Betty bang

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.280 
you can tell we've cut the Betty bang
it's<00:06:21.850> shorter<00:06:22.210> on<00:06:22.390> the<00:06:22.420> sides<00:06:22.570> and<00:06:23.080> then<00:06:23.170> it

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
it's shorter on the sides and then it

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.470 
it's shorter on the sides and then it
gets<00:06:23.350> longer<00:06:23.800> in<00:06:23.980> the<00:06:24.100> middle<00:06:24.370> so<00:06:25.120> that's

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
gets longer in the middle so that's

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.330 
gets longer in the middle so that's
exactly<00:06:25.840> what<00:06:26.080> you<00:06:26.530> want<00:06:26.740> to<00:06:26.890> be<00:06:26.980> going<00:06:27.280> on<00:06:29.340> and

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
exactly what you want to be going on and

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.710 
exactly what you want to be going on and
you<00:06:30.400> can<00:06:30.520> see<00:06:30.640> the<00:06:30.760> longest<00:06:31.120> point<00:06:31.300> is<00:06:31.480> in<00:06:31.630> the

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
you can see the longest point is in the

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.970 
you can see the longest point is in the
middle<00:06:31.780> and<00:06:32.080> it<00:06:32.170> gets<00:06:32.320> shorter<00:06:32.680> on<00:06:32.830> either

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
middle and it gets shorter on either

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.740 
middle and it gets shorter on either
sides<00:06:33.340> I'm<00:06:33.760> going<00:06:33.820> to<00:06:33.970> blow-dry<00:06:34.150> this<00:06:34.600> and

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
sides I'm going to blow-dry this and

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.790 
sides I'm going to blow-dry this and
we're<00:06:34.840> gonna<00:06:34.900> style<00:06:35.230> it<00:06:35.440> I'm<00:06:35.560> going<00:06:35.680> to<00:06:35.710> show

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
we're gonna style it I'm going to show
