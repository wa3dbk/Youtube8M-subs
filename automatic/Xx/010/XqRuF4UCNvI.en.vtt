00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
different philosophy when it comes to

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.289 
different philosophy when it comes to
breaking<00:01:32.950> horses<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.490> we<00:01:33.549> start<00:01:34.090> from<00:01:34.180> the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
breaking horses and we start from the

breaking horses and we start from the
ground<00:01:34.390> up<00:01:34.659> but<00:01:34.960> this<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:35.799> a<00:01:36.010> horse<00:01:36.520> that's

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
ground up but this is a horse that's

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.850 
ground up but this is a horse that's
been<00:01:36.790> ridden<00:01:37.240> before<00:01:37.360> he<00:01:37.900> was<00:01:38.020> been<00:01:38.470> attempted

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
been ridden before he was been attempted

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.980 
been ridden before he was been attempted
to<00:01:38.890> be<00:01:38.950> trained<00:01:39.220> many<00:01:39.430> times<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.119> I<00:01:40.360> need<00:01:40.900> to

very beginning and so what we have to do
was<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.989> lot<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.590> have<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.770> undo<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.130> lot<00:02:42.550> of

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
was a lot we have to undo a lot of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.100
