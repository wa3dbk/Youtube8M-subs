00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 good evening then he is perfect 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.440
 the environment is not exactly that 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.769
 of the stadium but I had told you that 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.690
 he would have been a base in the field 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.490
 turned into a frill on the couch for this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.820
 so the tour went anyway 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.050
 television allows you to see 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.789
 matches pretty well though 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.800
 in short, from the field 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.930
 certain details are better understood 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.480
 this my notice however a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.539
 utterly questionable impression beyond 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 what is questionable is not questionable 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.450
 absolutely the victory of juve 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 because I would say that the formation of count 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.410
 he conducted a tactical race 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.450
 perfect against a very big one 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 Florentine because all in all we could 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.219
 also call it a race enough 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.910
 balanced purple match formation 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.850
 very good at the beginning of the first half e 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.800
 then the distance that in the juve came out 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.920
 a question arises among other things 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.080
 because I think very few have escaped 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.790
 serious fact has had a crescendo of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.280
 therefore athletic condition of the two 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.020
 one or are benefits of one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.650
 preparation, however, that was held 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.180
 hidden but also because substantially 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.250
 in short, the coaches will never reveal 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.930
 these secrets then maybe in the end 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 I'm also a bit of a puffin secret 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 or else juve has been able to handle a lot 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.130
 well that hour then a quarter of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 autonomy that has shown to have in the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.780
 last times the managed very well 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.369
 because we say not that he left 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 vent the Florentine because it would be 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.159
 irreverent towards 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.960
 the formation of montella that has 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.799
 conducted a good part of the race 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.840
 especially in the first half but let's face it 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.430
 arrives just manage a little 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.470
 situation 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 checking pretty well though 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.130
 leaving two or three occasions a lot 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 important and very dangerous to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.630
 Florentine and then went out to the distance 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.310
 he probably preferred 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.530
 accelerate in the recovery then also true 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.670
 that the goal comes from a punishment 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.010
 unexceptionable from the inter can not be said 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.420
 that everything was born from the fact that the 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.280
 Florentine had remained in ten why 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.100
 the punishment is a firm kick can 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.870
 also be in 56 and still football 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.510
 from still to standing kick 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.160
 certainly this has conditioned it 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.230
 run of the race later 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.630
 to the goal of pirlo that he realized 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.850
 another of his incredible spells the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.260
 fifth goal in the season the first in 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.710
 europa although against training 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.160
 Italian after the feat of Sunday 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.150
 last against Genoa 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.770
 from then on Juve it was 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.530
 absolutely master of a race 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.500
 anyway he had already started in mine 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.530
 I warn you not to dominate but to hold 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.330
 firmly fisted with with the dribble 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.100
 in short, with the phrasing we have seen one 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.770
 juve very different from the last one 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.210
 performances and then I repeat or am 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.500
 benefits in the preparation that is there 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.180
 been hidden because vinovo really is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.980
 impenetrable or 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.629
 indeed juve has managed well 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.450
 this situation therefore comes that 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.799
 passes the shift of deserved rai 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.299
 against a great opponent not 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.069
 let's forget the only one 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.500
 training at least until now 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.200
 who was able to beat in Italy 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.269
 the juve therefore surely honor to the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.120
 formation of montella which must also 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.620
 play an Italian cup final 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.129
 against the Naples heroes because it continues 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.359
 this journey of his in europe then we will see 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.480
 what will happen 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.040
 obviously in the draw I come to 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.950
 mind a little eve in short these 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.299
 modest tones of antonio count that said 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.680
 our habitat 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.900
 actually the champions league 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.030
 many have lost the emphasis on this 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.579
 I wait on these words, interpreting them 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.120
 maybe with a kind of compliance 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.939
 starting from the count I and maybe someone 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.950
 Another we allowed ourselves to say that the 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.109
 his was also a bit like saying 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.699
 pretactica a bit of irony 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.650
 especially if added to the declaration 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:12.209
 which released after genoa juventus 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.319
 in which it was said we are going to play with it 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.949
 he said court we're going to play it there 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.900
 game 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:20.169
 without forgetting that they already have 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.150
 celebrated the elimination of juve 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.770
 clear that will win this bet want 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.720
 that that uniting these 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.849
 my opinion apparently is 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.690
 in fact the man proved resigned from the 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:34.120
 Eve give the idea of ​​how much in reality 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.340
 count held this particularly 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.800
 I don't change my idea first 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.419
 objective other stated by the company 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.599
 juventus is the league championship kept us 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.200
 particularly at this match because 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.180
 contained freedom 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.980
 the Florentine had been the only team 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.840
 who had beaten the Bianconeri in those 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.460
 15 minutes of madness 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.130
 the Florentine had been great and 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.350
 take advantage of the madness 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.780
 Juventus after a race conducted 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.720
 practically one-way therefore the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.340
 juve goes on continuous double 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.950
 commitment we'll see if these 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.370
 signs of recovery will be resumed on 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:16.120
 physical plane will be confirmed by 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:19.170
 upcoming matches or not and on the field 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.150
 he will give his verdict as always 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.510
 unexceptionable and maybe once 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.070
 questionable but still always verdict 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.480
 seems to have said it is 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.210
 I ask when we have gone further 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.630
 the 5 minutes I know it's not a leap on 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.310
 field as you see is a leap 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.450
 right on the couch in case greens 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.360
 better in a sofa method but le 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.610
 I guarantee that I am sitting and what to say 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.710
 I give you appointment in Catania 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.980
 juventus next edition bounces on the 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.470
 field that is not based on the breast field si 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.740
 closes with the usual greetings we say 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.050
 better 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.630
 hello mac hello to all thanks for having us 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.890
 following you followed him you know you 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.890
 I say next way bye bye
