is<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.920> bigger<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.760> our<00:01:08.909> plates<00:01:10.159> broiler

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.099 
world Pam calls this chicken ginger it's
an<00:04:17.770> average<00:04:18.040> chicken<00:04:18.700> not<00:04:19.000> selectively<00:04:19.750> bred

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
an average chicken not selectively bred

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.280 
an average chicken not selectively bred
and<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.830> normal<00:04:21.250> size<00:04:21.580> of<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.030> five-month-old

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
and the normal size of a five-month-old

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.200 
and the normal size of a five-month-old
so<00:04:23.979> almost<00:04:24.220> 1.6<00:04:25.180> kilos<00:04:25.570> yeah

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
so almost 1.6 kilos yeah

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.900 
so almost 1.6 kilos yeah
this<00:04:26.720> one<00:04:27.020> is<00:04:27.319> selectively<00:04:27.949> bred<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.610> the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
this one is selectively bred and the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.159 
this one is selectively bred and the
same<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.949> 3.6<00:04:30.949> so<00:04:31.160> she's<00:04:31.460> complete<00:04:32.449> two<00:04:32.750> kilos

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
same a 3.6 so she's complete two kilos

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.219 
same a 3.6 so she's complete two kilos
heavier<00:04:33.530> inter<00:04:34.130> petal<00:04:34.610> just<00:04:35.210> five<00:04:35.569> weeks<00:04:35.990> old

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
heavier inter petal just five weeks old

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.640 
heavier inter petal just five weeks old
its<00:04:36.650> ballooned<00:04:37.280> such<00:04:37.940> a<00:04:37.970> rate<00:04:38.389> she<00:04:39.050> can<00:04:39.229> barely

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
its ballooned such a rate she can barely

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.219 
its ballooned such a rate she can barely
stand<00:04:39.949> up<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.699> she's<00:04:40.910> still<00:04:41.120> half<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:42.020> kilo

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
stand up so she's still half a kilo

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.460 
stand up so she's still half a kilo
heavier<00:04:42.710> than<00:04:43.610> write<00:04:43.819> something<00:04:44.630> that's<00:04:44.660> four

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
heavier than write something that's four

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.730

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
months older than it that's right yeah

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.980 
months older than it that's right yeah
no<00:04:48.740> it's<00:04:49.099> not<00:04:49.280> normal<00:04:49.669> it's<00:04:49.789> not<00:04:49.970> natural<00:04:50.210> it's

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
no it's not normal it's not natural it's
