00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
call it a blackbird or the be said my

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.600 
call it a blackbird or the be said my
bad<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.690> my<00:01:50.230> teammates<00:01:50.650> are<00:01:50.860> triple<00:01:51.220> captain

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
bad and my teammates are triple captain

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.610 
bad and my teammates are triple captain
and<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.970> reason<00:01:52.300> why<00:01:52.390> i<00:01:52.420> hate<00:01:52.900> triple<00:01:53.260> capers

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
and the reason why i hate triple capers

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.250 
and the reason why i hate triple capers
is<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:54.100> since<00:01:54.640> i<00:01:54.820> can't<00:01:55.090> get<00:01:55.270> another<00:01:55.570> v<00:01:55.900> set

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
is that since i can't get another v set

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.620 
is that since i can't get another v set
or<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:57.070> know<00:01:57.190> so<00:01:57.400> i<00:01:57.460> can't<00:01:57.730> put<00:01:57.940> any<00:01:58.150> more

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
or you know so i can't put any more

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.300 
or you know so i can't put any more
streaks<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.140> air<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.800> know<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> team
