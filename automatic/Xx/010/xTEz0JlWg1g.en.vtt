damage it can come in handy just spread
out<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.250> ground<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.790> yeah<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.690> does<00:00:15.839> work

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
out the ground and yeah it does work

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
if you're if you're rushing on the young

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.640 
if you're if you're rushing on the young
garden<00:01:02.250> graveyard<00:01:02.820> point<00:01:03.420> you're<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
garden graveyard point you're going to

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.289 
garden graveyard point you're going to
good<00:01:04.979> run<00:01:05.159> jumped<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.549> you're<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
good run jumped on it you're going to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:20.270 
good run jumped on it you're going to
get<00:01:06.360> lucky<00:01:06.570> kills

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.679 

now<00:01:21.280> we<00:01:21.340> have<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.549> mechanic<00:01:21.939> this<00:01:22.119> impact

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
now we have to mechanic this impact

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.630 
now we have to mechanic this impact
damage<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.229> is<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.770> only<00:01:23.859> one<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.369> is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
damage and is the only one that is

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.270 
damage and is the only one that is
automatic<00:01:25.569> I<00:01:25.689> believe<00:01:26.109> we<00:01:26.560> may<00:01:26.710> find<00:01:27.100> out<00:01:27.189> the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
automatic I believe we may find out the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.849 
automatic I believe we may find out the
others<00:01:27.579> but<00:01:28.000> it's<00:01:28.119> quite<00:01:28.240> good<00:01:28.390> it's<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:29.770> the

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
others but it's quite good it's not the

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.649 
others but it's quite good it's not the
best<00:01:30.009> because<00:01:30.459> this<00:01:30.700> class<00:01:30.880> damaged<00:01:31.179> ones<00:01:31.420> and

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
best because this class damaged ones and

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.050 
best because this class damaged ones and
the<00:01:31.750> other<00:01:31.899> ones<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.979> do<00:01:33.159> higher<00:01:33.520> damage<00:01:33.759> are

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
the other ones that do higher damage are

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.340 
the other ones that do higher damage are
probably<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.359> bit<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.569> use<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.079> this<00:01:35.259> is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
probably a bit of use but this is

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.169 
probably a bit of use but this is
definitely<00:01:35.530> different<00:01:35.799> one<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.069> use<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.789> like

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
definitely different one to use to like

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.719 
definitely different one to use to like
a<00:01:37.270> different<00:01:37.599> approach<00:01:37.719> with<00:01:37.869> mechanic<00:01:38.729> now

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
a different approach with mechanic now

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.760 
a different approach with mechanic now
we<00:01:39.789> have<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.000> painter<00:01:40.420> this<00:01:40.840> is<00:01:41.079> less<00:01:41.439> damage

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
we have the painter this is less damage

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.399 
we have the painter this is less damage
and<00:01:41.979> I<00:01:42.459> wouldn't<00:01:42.909> recommend<00:01:43.659> using<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.200> one

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
and I wouldn't recommend using this one

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:57.949 
and I wouldn't recommend using this one
as<00:01:44.649> it's<00:01:45.640> not<00:01:45.849> the<00:01:45.909> best<00:01:46.119> engineer<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.929> use

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.779 

lastly<00:01:58.959> we<00:01:59.110> have<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.319> plum<00:01:59.799> electors<00:02:00.280> impact

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
lastly we have the plum electors impact

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.600 
lastly we have the plum electors impact
splash<00:02:01.119> damage<00:02:01.329> and<00:02:02.259> it's<00:02:03.009> quite<00:02:03.219> good<00:02:03.340> about

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
splash damage and it's quite good about

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.850 
splash damage and it's quite good about
not<00:02:03.819> using<00:02:03.879> a<00:02:04.209> lot<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:04.599> from<00:02:04.869> what<00:02:05.049> I'm<00:02:05.170> where

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
not using a lot but from what I'm where

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.380 
not using a lot but from what I'm where
I<00:02:05.890> used<00:02:06.159> them<00:02:06.429> it<00:02:06.610> gives<00:02:06.729> do<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:06.939> lot<00:02:07.090> damage

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
I used them it gives do a lot damage

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.880 
I used them it gives do a lot damage
from<00:02:07.479> space<00:02:07.750> damage<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.289> criticals<00:02:08.769> are

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
from space damage and the criticals are

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:19.160 
from space damage and the criticals are
high<00:02:09.039> also

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.230 

you
