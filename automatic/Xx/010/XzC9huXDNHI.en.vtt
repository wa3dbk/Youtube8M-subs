like my accuracy and shit um thing is

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.990 
like my accuracy and shit um thing is
like<00:01:54.869> since<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.470> higher<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.549> feels<00:01:56.790> weird

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
like since it's higher up it feels weird

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.399 
like since it's higher up it feels weird
at<00:01:57.119> first<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.840> since<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.259> higher<00:01:58.380> up

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
at first but like since it's higher up
