00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.020
 hello my name is quiet I tried in 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.700
 home today of a new chapter of techno 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.870
 the place where we are going to learn about 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.360
 technology to cangas 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.360
 refrigeration there are three types of 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.610
 liquid refrigeration each with its 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.610
 advantages and disadvantages and now we go 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.060
 before continuing I'll ask you to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.360
 activate the youtube annotations already 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.270
 that during the tour of this video 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.070
 let's leave several annotations for 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.440
 take other videos that will be going 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.239
 explaining in three units each of 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.880
 the issues and the components that we are going to 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.490
 be watching in this video 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.740
 of the type of refrigeration 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.250
 passive recreation active cooling 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.230
 and liquid cooling 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.570
 the real particles of the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.030
 passive discrimination is that it is 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.080
 composed of two components one 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.680
 thermal interface and a heat sink 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.720
 thermal interface work is 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.750
 provide better contact between 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.520
 device 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.670
 to cool to cool 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.429
 and the dissipated participated in other things 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 that a group that metallic that allows 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:30.009
 a larger area so that of this 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.360
 way the dissipation can be done 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.500
 more efficient 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.340
 active dissipation 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.140
 it's the same as passive dissipation 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 using the same components but 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.120
 just giving an extra component the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.450
 cures those fans that are going to move 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.890
 air around our heatsink for 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.700
 that in this way the heat can 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.530
 transfer from the heatsink to the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.650
 external environment in a very 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.650
 effective 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.810
 if you want to know more about the interface 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.690
 thermal or thermal straw can do 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.380
 click on this annotation that will reach 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.890
 another video if you want to see more in 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:19.209
 depth cooling coolers 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.209
 active with what you can do 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.640
 very well we got to refrigeration more 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.220
 interesting and very well known by the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.930
 common user of the pc and is the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.120
 liquid cooling 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.439
 as its name says it uses a 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.420
 liquid to cool our system 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.489
 It is generally used to use 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.829
 our Saturday minutes but also 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.689
 can be used to cool 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.310
 our video cards as well 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:51.730
 also our chipset in some 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.730
 motherboards that has been totally 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.240
 the components of this system are the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.540
 following 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.260
 a block and to know more about them 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.260
 by these electric 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 the thermal interface connectors and 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.760
 hoses 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.080
 reservoirs 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.880
 radiator 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.220
 things 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.720
 bomb 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.720
 and the coolant 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.069
 can pause the video and do 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.930
 click to go to see each of the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.930
 videos dedicated to these components 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.050
 as its name indicates the system of 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.630
 filtration weakness uses a lily 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.410
 to perform the heat transfer 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.280
 between the components 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.310
 the block is used to make contact 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.980
 on the component to be cooled 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.750
 hoses to build the circuit 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.819
 of our liquid 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:16.810
 where dissipation occurs 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:19.810
 of the liquid the radiator and the exterior 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.930
 of the system a reservoir where it is going to 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.000
 save store our liquid and the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.660
 pump that is going to push the liquid inside 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.660
 of our circuit 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.080
 wandering from the guata kuri system is the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.850
 temperature that can handle between 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.760
 all very extreme that could not be 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.250
 reach with another system of 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.009
 refrigeration as are the vacuum and the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.830
 active 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.740
 the liquid cooling that is also 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.390
 very silent since with a single cooler 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.350
 we can 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.290
 enough temperature of practically 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.930
 instead active cooling is 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.900
 much more economical than water cooling 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.690
 but the temperatures that can be 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.690
 reach are higher or not extra 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.820
 efficient refrigeration and for 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.430
 make them more efficient we need that 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.670
 our cooler go at speeds 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.960
 higher and higher speeds are produced 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.340
 greater noise therefore we are going to have 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.620
 more vibrations within our 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.620
 cabinet and more noise than for some 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.650
 can be annoying and for others not so much 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.400
 it depends on each of each pocket see 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.500
 what food system 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.840
 this forgetfulness of the techno week in 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.070
 house if you liked the 20 do not forget 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.070
 subscribe by doing 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.680
 thank you very much for being like 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.680
 always and see you next
