so much cleaner lighter design actually

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.470 
so much cleaner lighter design actually
increased<00:01:19.070> strain<00:01:19.400> stiffness<00:01:19.730> as<00:01:20.090> well<00:01:20.270> to

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
increased strain stiffness as well to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.260 
increased strain stiffness as well to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
triangulate the bike like this and then

whack from what shimano would consider a

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
front derailleur this allows it to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.450 
front derailleur this allows it to

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
the travel thing and then the derailleur

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.090 
the travel thing and then the derailleur
starts<00:01:53.470> rotating<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.600> suspension<00:01:56.170> it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
starts rotating with the suspension it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800 
starts rotating with the suspension it
gives<00:01:57.280> us<00:01:57.430> better<00:01:57.610> chain<00:01:57.880> state<00:01:58.150> clearance<00:01:58.420> so

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
gives us better chain state clearance so

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.360 
gives us better chain state clearance so
we<00:01:59.050> don't<00:01:59.200> have<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.440> dip<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.740> chain<00:01:59.920> stay<00:02:00.160> down

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
we don't have to dip the chain stay down

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.570 
we don't have to dip the chain stay down
so<00:02:00.610> far<00:02:00.880> which<00:02:01.950> having<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.009> chain<00:02:03.220> stay<00:02:03.460> on

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
so far which having the chain stay on

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.430 
so far which having the chain stay on
center<00:02:04.000> allows<00:02:04.600> us<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.930> build<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.200> lighter

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
center allows us to build a lighter

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.740

five point o functions very similarly to

five point o functions very similarly to
this<00:04:47.260> but<00:04:48.260> offers<00:04:49.480> increased<00:04:50.480> bottom<00:04:50.930> out

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050
