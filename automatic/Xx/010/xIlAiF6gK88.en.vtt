00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 In this video clip we deal 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.919
 Park us in advance with the forward 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.400
 an important note to the forward 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.170
 Parking requires a lot of space 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.429
 That's why I only recommend you there 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 to pack forward 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.750
 where you can catch up far enough 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.660
 problem is less in the actual 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.010
 a park process but rather in it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.010
 the park gap to come out again 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.750
 in the video clip basis for the wrapping 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.730
 we have the so-called eagle 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.230
 met 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.899
 this pillar flows into every vehicle 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
 on the front axle 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.860
 we know since that where the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.870
 the front axle is in the footwell the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.590
 pedals and thus our feet 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.930
 to park while driving forward 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.539
 one before getting a link always so far 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.969
 drive straight forward to the feet 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:00.950
 The vehicle is past the man 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:03.260
 want to wrap up if a few 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.840
 also visually straight is then 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.610
 stop briefly and the wheels straight 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.960
 put 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.750
 for that the big mouth of the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.090
 Steering wheel turned up twice 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.310
 become 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:23.450
 1 and 2 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.460
 and drive straight on and here 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.229
 a little trick if you later with 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.060
 the steering starts then you get though 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.650
 too close to the other blogger 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.420
 but we have in the video clip 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.310
 met eselsbrÃ¼cken 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.470
 if it's not in one direction 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.170
 then goes on exactly the opposite of 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.490
 do what you want to do 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.740
 here it does not go forward to the right 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.920
 So you have to go backwards 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.640
 left if everything is okay then it works 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.350
 again forward on the right as you 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.840
 comes out again from this park complete 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.840
 then we learn to spread in the video clip
