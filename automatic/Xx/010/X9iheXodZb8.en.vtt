00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
much different detail in technique that

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.190 
much different detail in technique that
went<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.220> map<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:36.450> still<00:00:36.870> unsure

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
went into this map I'm still unsure

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.160 
went into this map I'm still unsure
about<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.980> layout<00:00:38.130> of<00:00:38.310> it<00:00:38.660> but<00:00:39.660> other<00:00:40.079> than

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
about the layout of it but other than

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.540 
about the layout of it but other than
that<00:00:40.380> it's<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.070> nice<00:00:42.060> looking<00:00:42.570> map<00:00:43.550> got

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that it's really a nice looking map got

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.250 
that it's really a nice looking map got
this<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.060> middle<00:00:45.329> area<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> just

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this the middle area here is just

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260 
this the middle area here is just
complete<00:00:46.800> dead<00:00:47.250> zone<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.880> kind<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.149> my

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
complete dead zone which is kind of my

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.950 
complete dead zone which is kind of my
one<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.640> knock<00:00:50.880> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> math<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.690> pretty

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
one and one knock on the math is pretty

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
one and one knock on the math is pretty
linear<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.010> sense<00:00:53.340> than<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.579> two<00:00:53.820> sides

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
linear in that sense than the two sides

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.030 
linear in that sense than the two sides
to<00:00:54.360> flank<00:00:54.570> from<00:00:54.690> our<00:00:54.960> very<00:00:55.079> skinny<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.890> it's

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
to flank from our very skinny so it's

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.180 
to flank from our very skinny so it's
kind<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.280> hard<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.640> flank<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.950> even<00:00:58.950> if<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
kind of hard to flank and even if you

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
kind of hard to flank and even if you
manage<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.700> burst<00:01:00.059> through<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> group<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
manage to burst through with a group of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.840 
manage to burst through with a group of
people<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.100> easy<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> reestablish

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
people it's very easy to reestablish

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.599 
people it's very easy to reestablish
yourself<00:01:03.690> camping<00:01:04.259> as<00:01:04.469> soon<00:01:05.069> as<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.309> spawn

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:05.609 
yourself camping as soon as you spawn

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:06.919 
yourself camping as soon as you spawn
because<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:05.999> soon<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.329> spawn<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.719> either

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
because as soon as you spawn on either

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:09.590 
because as soon as you spawn on either
side<00:01:07.289> there's<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:07.920> legit<00:01:08.850> camping<00:01:09.270> spots

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
side there's two legit camping spots

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.129 
side there's two legit camping spots
that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.959> can<00:01:10.109> run<00:01:10.289> to<00:01:11.509> so<00:01:12.509> flipping<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139 
that you can run to so flipping the

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.840 
that you can run to so flipping the
spawns<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.740> often<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.579> even<00:01:14.819> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
spawns that often is not really even the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
spawns that often is not really even the
option<00:01:15.359> on<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.630> map<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.139> got<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
option on this map you just got to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.429 
option on this map you just got to
figure<00:01:16.469> out<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:16.920> side<00:01:17.279> you<00:01:17.609> like<00:01:17.789> better

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
figure out which side you like better

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.559 
figure out which side you like better
and<00:01:19.439> there's<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.219> lot<00:01:20.279> of<00:01:20.340> cross<00:01:20.729> cross<00:01:21.299> map

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
and there's a lot of cross cross map

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.870 
and there's a lot of cross cross map

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
into this map I was pretty impressed

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.959 
into this map I was pretty impressed
with<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.810> aspect<00:01:34.139> of<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.759> pretty

with that aspect of it it's very pretty
map<00:01:36.319> definitely<00:01:37.319> fun<00:01:37.469> to<00:01:37.590> go<00:01:37.709> look<00:01:38.009> around<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
map definitely fun to go look around the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.440 
map definitely fun to go look around the
theater<00:01:38.549> i'm<00:01:38.819> sure<00:01:38.999> i<00:01:39.060> didn't<00:01:39.329> find

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
theater i'm sure i didn't find

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.019 
theater i'm sure i didn't find
everything<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.859> i<00:01:40.889> definitely<00:01:41.130> recommend<00:01:41.549> go

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029 
everything but i definitely recommend go

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:43.399 
everything but i definitely recommend go
and<00:01:42.179> look<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.359> the<00:01:42.509> new<00:01:42.630> maps<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.079> theater

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and look at the new maps in the theater

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.019 
and look at the new maps in the theater
you'll<00:01:43.560> find<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:43.950> pretty<00:01:44.340> cool<00:01:44.549> stuff<00:01:44.609> in

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:45.029 
you'll find some pretty cool stuff in

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:50.060 
you'll find some pretty cool stuff in
here

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.310 

as<00:01:50.940> far<00:01:51.150> as<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.330> layout<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.840> map<00:01:52.050> goes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
as far as the layout of this map goes

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
as far as the layout of this map goes
i'm<00:01:52.530> sure<00:01:52.770> it'll<00:01:52.950> grow<00:01:53.190> on<00:01:53.220> me<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.580> time<00:01:53.820> but

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
i'm sure it'll grow on me in time but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.610 
i'm sure it'll grow on me in time but
it's<00:01:54.180> definitely<00:01:54.390> my<00:01:54.630> worst<00:01:54.870> map<00:01:55.140> right<00:01:55.440> now

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
it's definitely my worst map right now

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.320 
it's definitely my worst map right now
and<00:01:55.830> i'm<00:01:55.979> sure<00:01:56.190> i'm<00:01:56.520> working<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.970> change<00:01:57.000> that

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
and i'm sure i'm working to change that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.460 
and i'm sure i'm working to change that
i<00:01:57.479> spent<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.750> lot<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:57.930> time<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> theater

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.250 
i spent a lot of time in the theater
kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.550> looking<00:01:59.910> at<00:02:00.150> where<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.660> spawns<00:02:00.960> were

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
kind of looking at where the spawns were

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.640 
kind of looking at where the spawns were
and<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:03.450> uh<00:02:03.510> i'm<00:02:04.200> happy

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
and what was going on but uh i'm happy

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.680 
and what was going on but uh i'm happy
with<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.920> map<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:06.030> really<00:02:06.300> wish<00:02:06.420> they

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
with this map I just really wish they

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.740 
with this map I just really wish they
would<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:06.930> released<00:02:07.490> 14<00:02:08.490> maps<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.360> on

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
would have released 14 maps like this on

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
would have released 14 maps like this on
launch<00:02:10.500> day<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.039> think<00:02:11.220> everybody<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> lot

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
launch day I think everybody with a lot

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.510 
launch day I think everybody with a lot
happier<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> mouse<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.010> definitely

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
happier with the mouse is definitely

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.500 
happier with the mouse is definitely
some<00:02:14.670> duds<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.420> original<00:02:15.660> launch<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.470> I

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
some duds in the original launch and I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.760 
some duds in the original launch and I
have<00:02:18.510> no<00:02:18.660> problem<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:19.050> these<00:02:19.200> maps<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.620> don't

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
have no problem with these maps I don't

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.550 
have no problem with these maps I don't
think<00:02:19.920> they're<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.070> par<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.820> with<00:02:21.810> escalation

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
think they're a par with with escalation

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.170 
think they're a par with with escalation
but<00:02:22.890> they<00:02:23.070> make<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.489> know<00:02:23.640> they<00:02:23.790> make<00:02:23.940> first

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
but they make you know they make first

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.610 
but they make you know they make first
strike<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.840> piece<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.050> crap<00:02:25.260> then

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
strike like a piece of crap then

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.860 
strike like a piece of crap then
escalation<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.820> even<00:02:26.970> more<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.630> think

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
escalation to that even more so I think

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.500 
escalation to that even more so I think
they're<00:02:28.080> somewhere<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:28.950> between<00:02:29.209> 1st<00:02:30.209> strike

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
they're somewhere in between 1st strike

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.030 
they're somewhere in between 1st strike
and<00:02:30.540> escalation<00:02:31.350> I'm<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.890> give

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
and escalation I'm not going to give

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.240 
and escalation I'm not going to give
them<00:02:32.220> two<00:02:32.820> thumbs<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:34.830> still<00:02:35.070> early

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
them two thumbs up but it's still early

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.190 
them two thumbs up but it's still early
I'm<00:02:35.610> sure<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> maps<00:02:36.209> are<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.570> me<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.110> know

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
I'm sure the maps are on me and you know

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.650 
I'm sure the maps are on me and you know
new<00:02:37.410> content<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.950> good<00:02:38.150> having<00:02:39.150> more<00:02:39.300> maps<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
new content is good having more maps to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.040 
new content is good having more maps to
play<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.080> always<00:02:40.500> good<00:02:41.390> say<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.600> definitely

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
play is always good say it's definitely

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.910 
play is always good say it's definitely
worth<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.410> money<00:02:45.200> once<00:02:46.200> again<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.769> just

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
worth the money once again you can just

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.070 
worth the money once again you can just
see<00:02:47.070> how<00:02:47.220> much<00:02:47.400> detail<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.209> time<00:02:48.630> went<00:02:48.900> into

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
see how much detail and time went into

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.500 
see how much detail and time went into
this<00:02:49.230> map<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:50.640> much<00:02:50.700> going<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.300> so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
this map it's just so much going on so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.960 
this map it's just so much going on so
much<00:02:51.690> different<00:02:52.019> writing<00:02:52.410> signs<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
much different writing signs it's a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.960 
much different writing signs it's a
projection<00:02:54.209> screen<00:02:54.989> all<00:02:55.799> sorts<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.340> goodies

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.340 

all<00:02:59.970> sorts<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.720> good<00:03:00.959> stuff

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.440 

say<00:03:04.010> visually<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.910> definitely<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.360> most

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
say visually this is definitely the most

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.300 
say visually this is definitely the most
appealing<00:03:05.870> map<00:03:06.260> knife<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:06.830> that's<00:03:07.010> probably

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
appealing map knife so that's probably

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.770 
appealing map knife so that's probably
hazard<00:03:07.790> which<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.270> one<00:03:08.390> I'm<00:03:08.480> going<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.690> do

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
hazard which is the one I'm going to do

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.950 
hazard which is the one I'm going to do
next<00:03:08.960> I'm<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.970> streak<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.150> doing<00:03:11.450> 12<00:03:11.780> videos
