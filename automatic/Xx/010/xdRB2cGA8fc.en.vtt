guide will primarily be based on people

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.990 
guide will primarily be based on people
who<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.110> already<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.380> high<00:00:10.620> level<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.250> can<00:00:11.759> do

who are already a high level and can do

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.039 
who are already a high level and can do
like<00:00:12.780> I'd<00:00:13.019> say<00:00:13.200> level<00:00:13.440> 8299<00:00:14.839> we're<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
like I'd say level 8299 we're going to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.410 
like I'd say level 8299 we're going to
start<00:00:16.320> out<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.340> high<00:00:17.550> level<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.060> runespan

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
start out in the high level of runespan

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810 
start out in the high level of runespan
I<00:00:18.810> am<00:00:19.050> NOT<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.160> run<00:00:20.400> through<00:00:20.609> how

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
I am NOT going to go and run through how

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.490 
I am NOT going to go and run through how
to<00:00:20.850> get<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.660> how<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.230> top

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to get here and how to get to the top

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.859 
to get here and how to get to the top
floor<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.119> primarily<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.689> high

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
floor because this is primarily a high

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.480 
floor because this is primarily a high
level<00:00:25.199> guide<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> should<00:00:25.980> already<00:00:26.160> know

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
level guide and you should already know

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.880 
level guide and you should already know
how<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.260> alright<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.439> when<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:28.769> up

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
how to do so alright so when you get up

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.479 
how to do so alright so when you get up
to<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> top<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:31.140> gather<00:00:31.380> all<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.830> runes<00:00:32.250> as

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
to the top you gather all your runes as

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
to the top you gather all your runes as
normal<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.780> method<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.500> will

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
normal for this method you will

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.729 
normal for this method you will
primarily<00:00:35.040> need<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> lot<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> body<00:00:36.420> runes<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.590> if

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
primarily need a lot of body runes so if

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.010 
primarily need a lot of body runes so if
you<00:00:37.829> want<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> stock<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.610> those<00:00:38.899> get<00:00:39.899> your

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
you want to stock up on those get your

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.069 
you want to stock up on those get your
water<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.800> your<00:00:40.860> earth<00:00:41.160> whatever<00:00:42.079> you'll

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
now the way runespan should be played is

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.880 
now the way runespan should be played is
you<00:01:53.399> gather<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:54.119> rune<00:01:55.020> essence<00:01:55.409> from<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.740> s

this<00:03:26.020> other<00:03:26.170> platform<00:03:26.770> you'll<00:03:27.190> stay<00:03:27.520> there

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
this other platform you'll stay there

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.620 
this other platform you'll stay there
you<00:03:29.560> can<00:03:29.800> even<00:03:29.980> search<00:03:30.490> like<00:03:30.940> farther<00:03:31.390> north

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
you can even search like farther north

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.040 
you can even search like farther north
and<00:03:32.220> these<00:03:33.220> platforms<00:03:33.550> here<00:03:34.150> are<00:03:34.390> connected

and<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:37.060> if<00:03:37.390> there's<00:03:37.690> something<00:03:37.930> good<00:03:38.170> up

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
and so if there's something good up

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.290 
and so if there's something good up
there<00:03:38.350> you<00:03:38.650> see<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.190> can<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:39.520> run<00:03:39.760> over<00:03:39.790> and

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
there you see you can just run over and

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.190 
there you see you can just run over and
like<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.510> horseshoe<00:03:40.900> shape<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.590> beg<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.520> and<00:03:43.200> you

like a horseshoe shape I beg you and you

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.310 
like a horseshoe shape I beg you and you
could<00:03:44.320> go<00:03:44.470> grab<00:03:44.710> that<00:03:45.070> or<00:03:45.960> there's<00:03:46.960> nothing

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
could go grab that or there's nothing

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.560 
could go grab that or there's nothing

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
and with the Seoul s Wraith they're

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.220 
and with the Seoul s Wraith they're
actually<00:03:53.350> faster<00:03:54.130> XP<00:03:54.640> than<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.300> cosmic<00:03:55.900> node

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
actually faster XP than a cosmic node

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.640 
actually faster XP than a cosmic node
and<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.610> that's<00:03:58.150> why<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.900> don't<00:03:59.050> siphon

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
and so that's why you don't siphon

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.640 
and so that's why you don't siphon
anything<00:04:00.160> lower<00:04:00.370> than<00:04:00.460> a<00:04:00.670> nature<00:04:01.120> rune<00:04:01.650> all

right here we go we got our undead soul
