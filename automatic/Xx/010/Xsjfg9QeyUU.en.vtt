00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
resident evil esque the thing that we

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.109 
resident evil esque the thing that we
would<00:01:06.860> say<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.100> probably<00:01:07.250> one<00:01:07.550> of<00:01:07.580> one<00:01:07.910> of<00:01:08.000> our

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
would say is probably one of one of our

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.210 
would say is probably one of one of our
biggest<00:01:08.300> selling<00:01:08.600> points<00:01:09.020> would<00:01:09.440> be<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.040> bar

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
biggest selling points would be the bar

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.920 
biggest selling points would be the bar
that<00:01:10.369> we<00:01:10.520> have<00:01:10.729> for<00:01:11.150> technology<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.720> raised

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
that we have for technology is raised

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.350 
that we have for technology is raised
quite<00:01:12.200> high<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.700> way<00:01:13.820> we<00:01:14.000> were<00:01:14.090> able<00:01:14.119> to

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
quite high and the way we were able to

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.160 
quite high and the way we were able to
do<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:15.770> through<00:01:16.009> two<00:01:16.280> key<00:01:16.670> areas<00:01:16.930> one<00:01:17.930> is

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
do that is through two key areas one is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.050 
do that is through two key areas one is
you<00:01:18.380> learning<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.009> research<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:19.850> have

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
you learning and research we have

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.710 
you learning and research we have
studied<00:01:20.570> various<00:01:21.410> technologies<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.369> after<00:01:23.330> a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
studied various technologies and after a

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.170 
studied various technologies and after a
grueling<00:01:24.470> period<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.280> analyzing<00:01:26.030> them

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
grueling period of analyzing them

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.420 
grueling period of analyzing them
researching<00:01:26.869> them<00:01:27.050> we<00:01:27.500> were<00:01:27.619> able<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.039> realize

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
researching them we were able to realize

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.400 
researching them we were able to realize
which<00:01:28.880> we<00:01:29.090> needed<00:01:29.450> what<00:01:29.869> would<00:01:29.990> be<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.140> best

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
which we needed what would be the best

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.889 
which we needed what would be the best
what<00:01:30.710> would<00:01:30.830> fit<00:01:31.160> for<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.180> game<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.539> was<00:01:32.660> going

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
what would fit for a game that was going

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.499 
what would fit for a game that was going
to<00:01:32.960> be<00:01:33.050> on<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.350> B<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.090> it's<00:01:35.270> just<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
to be on the B and so it's just the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.880 
to be on the B and so it's just the
amount<00:01:35.660> of<00:01:35.780> time<00:01:36.050> that<00:01:36.080> we<00:01:36.289> spent<00:01:36.590> studying

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
amount of time that we spent studying

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.940 
amount of time that we spent studying
and<00:01:37.340> preparing<00:01:37.780> for<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:38.899> title<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.860> has

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
and preparing for this title that has

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.100 
and preparing for this title that has
given<00:01:40.280> us<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.520> advantage<00:01:40.640> we're<00:01:41.630> looking<00:01:41.960> at

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
given us the advantage we're looking at

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.859 
given us the advantage we're looking at
how<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:42.619> could<00:01:42.979> possibly<00:01:43.009> approach<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.149> for

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
how we could possibly approach this for

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.210 
how we could possibly approach this for
a<00:01:44.899> game<00:01:45.110> which<00:01:45.289> had<00:01:45.470> its<00:01:45.619> own<00:01:45.860> sort<00:01:46.130> of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
a game which had its own sort of

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.660 
a game which had its own sort of
stylized<00:01:46.869> atmospheric<00:01:47.869> fear<00:01:48.560> element<00:01:49.429> if<00:01:49.550> you

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
stylized atmospheric fear element if you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.460 
stylized atmospheric fear element if you
would<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:50.600> basically<00:01:50.960> went<00:01:51.140> through<00:01:51.350> and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
would we basically went through and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.100 
would we basically went through and
researched<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.310> considered<00:01:53.210> what<00:01:53.810> sort

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
researched it and considered what sort

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.649 
researched it and considered what sort
of<00:01:54.200> devices<00:01:54.830> we<00:01:55.250> could<00:01:55.460> use<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:56.030> bring<00:01:56.360> back

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
of devices we could use to bring back

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.550 
of devices we could use to bring back
the<00:01:56.960> fear<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.799> franchise<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.200> when

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
the fear to the franchise so when

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.539 
the fear to the franchise so when
talking<00:02:00.770> about<00:02:01.630> what<00:02:02.630> we<00:02:02.750> learned<00:02:03.049> from

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
talking about what we learned from

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.280 
talking about what we learned from
creating<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.640> first<00:02:04.850> game<00:02:05.090> what<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:05.900> felt<00:02:06.140> we

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
creating the first game what we felt we

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.039 
creating the first game what we felt we
needed<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.590> improve<00:02:06.979> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> second<00:02:07.850> game

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
needed to improve in the second game

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.140 
needed to improve in the second game
probably<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.170> most<00:02:09.530> key<00:02:09.979> point<00:02:10.340> for<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:10.940> we

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
probably the most key point for that we

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.640 
probably the most key point for that we
felt<00:02:11.329> we<00:02:11.390> need<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.630> improve<00:02:11.810> was<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.470> fact

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
felt we need to improve was the fact

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.800 
felt we need to improve was the fact
that<00:02:12.769> there<00:02:13.370> needs<00:02:13.549> to<00:02:13.640> be<00:02:13.700> more<00:02:13.790> fear<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.720> the
