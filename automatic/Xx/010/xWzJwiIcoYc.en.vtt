00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.200 

the<00:00:43.090> Marines<00:00:43.480> think<00:00:44.380> that<00:00:44.650> that<00:00:44.890> so<00:00:45.670> then

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
the Marines think that that so then

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.170 
the Marines think that that so then
start<00:00:46.810> a<00:00:47.050> start<00:00:47.650> point<00:00:47.890> what<00:00:48.520> you<00:00:48.640> can<00:00:48.820> do<00:00:48.970> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you need to be at the terror spawn point

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
you need to be at the terror spawn point
para<00:01:19.920> spawn<00:01:20.159> point<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
para spawn point all you have to do is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.700 
para spawn point all you have to do is
get<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.750> garbage<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.829> and<00:01:24.500> sprint<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
get on this garbage can and sprint and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.069 
get on this garbage can and sprint and
jump<00:01:26.039> over<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.610> wall<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.390> recommend

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
jump over the wall so I recommend

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.690 
jump over the wall so I recommend
getting<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.490> because

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
getting all the way to the right because

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.669 
getting all the way to the right because
it's<00:01:30.000> slightly<00:01:30.270> angled<00:01:30.840> which<00:01:31.229> means<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
it's slightly angled which means this

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:41.370 
it's slightly angled which means this
adds<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.009> more<00:01:32.159> elevated<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.960> ahead

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.399 

and<00:01:41.920> there<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.340> go<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.930> outside<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.409> map

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and there you go you're outside the map

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.510 
and there you go you're outside the map
everywhere<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.710> shoot<00:01:47.979> out<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.430> do

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
everywhere you can shoot out and do

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.210 
everywhere you can shoot out and do
damage<00:01:51.899> yeah<00:01:52.899> we<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.350> explore<00:01:53.740> around

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.870 

but<00:01:56.850> yeah<00:01:57.150> don't<00:01:57.630> fall<00:01:57.870> into<00:01:58.050> any<00:01:58.310> holes<00:01:59.310> cuz

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
but yeah don't fall into any holes cuz

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.110 
but yeah don't fall into any holes cuz
that's<00:02:00.810> only<00:02:01.080> gonna<00:02:01.320> lead<00:02:01.620> to<00:02:03.170> hold<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.470> know

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
that's only gonna lead to hold you know

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.510 
that's only gonna lead to hold you know
basically<00:02:06.120> falling<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.350> forever<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.310> ever

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
basically falling down forever and ever

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.420 
basically falling down forever and ever
and<00:02:08.700> ever<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.300> ever<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.100> place

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and ever and ever but there is one place

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
and ever and ever but there is one place
where<00:02:11.460> you<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.880> fall<00:02:12.120> down<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.930> be

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
where you can fall down and you can be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.680 
where you can fall down and you can be
under<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.740> map<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.210> not<00:02:15.360> sure<00:02:15.540> if<00:02:15.600> you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
under the map and that's not sure if you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.730 
under the map and that's not sure if you
can<00:02:15.810> shoot<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.230> but<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.800> can<00:02:16.950> always<00:02:17.070> find<00:02:17.340> out

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
can shoot up but you can always find out

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:30.100 
can shoot up but you can always find out
let's<00:02:19.740> see

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.240 

right<00:02:30.800> here

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
right here

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.390 
right here
that<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:32.940> fall<00:02:33.210> down<00:02:33.860> will<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.980> completely

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
that we fall down will be completely

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.130 
that we fall down will be completely
fine<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.920> here's<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.160> whole<00:02:38.400> underside<00:02:39.800> I

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
fine and here's the whole underside I

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.210 
fine and here's the whole underside I
think<00:02:43.140> your<00:02:43.260> little<00:02:43.410> restricted<00:02:44.040> there's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
think your little restricted there's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.650 
think your little restricted there's
invisible<00:02:44.700> walls<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.480> navigate

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
invisible walls but you can navigate

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.430 
invisible walls but you can navigate
yourself<00:02:46.050> under<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:47.930> I'll<00:02:48.930> hope<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.320> not

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
yourself under it I'll hope it's not

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.470 
yourself under it I'll hope it's not
lost<00:02:51.950> but<00:02:52.950> yeah<00:02:53.130> following<00:02:53.670> any<00:02:53.820> other<00:02:54.120> holes

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
lost but yeah following any other holes

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.750 
lost but yeah following any other holes
and<00:02:54.780> you're<00:02:54.900> basically<00:02:55.880> done<00:02:56.930> almost<00:02:57.930> baby

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
and you're basically done almost baby

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.400 
and you're basically done almost baby
yeah<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:02.610> go<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.090> way<00:03:03.269> edge

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:18.000 

and<00:03:08.830> jump<00:03:09.250> off<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:16.600> is<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.350> underside

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
and jump off and that is the underside

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.590
