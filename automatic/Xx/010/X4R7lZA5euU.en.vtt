00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.240
 update what is the store that we're going 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.130
 to do what is going to be the store where 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.100
 we could buy these ships and you're 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.470
 that are here and also when the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.850

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.180
 update and in this icon where 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.130
 is the haystack and the face of the bird 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.110
 to be able to see what they are more will remain as 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.209
 that achievements no more achievements than 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.850
 let's unlock as we go 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.550

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.120
 find all the icons or faces of 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.000
 the characters and on this side we have what 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.510
 which is simply the trophies of the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.850
 game center game and things from the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.410
 statistics and extra things but good 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.720
 the most important thing we're going to see here 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.370
 it's the game we did not come and we're going to 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.890
 start by clicking the play button 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.170
 we can find that we have up 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.650
 right now four planets available that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.020
 is going to be the one on tatooine the planet of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.400
 the stars the planet j this one is going to come 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.819
 in the next update the planet 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.920
 and we have what is this duck head and 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.560
 that this is going to be this third planet 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.540
 which is available in this version and what 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.819
 that would be the bonus but more than anything 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.769
 would be the planet bonus in quotation marks of 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.750
 the bonuses that go on each mission go 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.159
 well then let's see what is the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.280
 first planet that is the planet 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.599
 tatooine and we're going to see here what 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.640
 is the first mission that is the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.640
 presentation let's open it 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.650
 [Music] 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.490
 and well, that was the small 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.490
 presentation here is continuing 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.890
 and here ends the presentation we are going to 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.650
 hit the popcorn to continue 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.510
 this great wonderful game is going to 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.069
 send to the first mission and simply 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.739
 It is a simple mission, as it is already 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.720
 we know it's the first mission and here we 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.329
 appears what are the red dots of 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.579
 address and what are the little pigs but 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.389
 already with this as with the enemies of 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.389
 star wars go 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.169
 here we are simply going to be this 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.090
 playing to see the review of this 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.270
 wonderful game that the truth is very 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.310
 entertaining and 100% recommended and for 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.400
 that will be downloaded to install or 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.810
 If you want to buy it in the app store 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.970
 Here I will leave the prices in the 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.190
 screen or if not in the description is 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.900
 I will be leaving the prices and but 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.810
 obviously we already know that this one is 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.790
 free in what is this in what is 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.310
 install the goes up what is the game 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.740
 obviously, and well, well, let's go 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.700
 pass this to other missions nothing more 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.310
 so they can see 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.190
 let's see the 10 missions that will be 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.990
 the reason for the carry these missions is 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.450
 already a little more advanced where 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.790
 we unlock what would be the achievement go 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.070
 of this little bird as we can see is 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.080
 equal to the mission from before but 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.140
 simply that the little bird is going to take 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.420
 your sword let's see the example we throw 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.700
 we tap and he will draw his sword as 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.310
 could have noticed in the same way 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.650
 we put the address we let 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.050
 come and give tap so that is that 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.350
 to take out his sword and do more this 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.430
 more harm not to what the structure would be 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:38.040
 from here of those of the little pigs not 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.840
 well this game is super entertaining 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.160
 the truth is pretty enough 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.440
 recommendable has several levels and goes to 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.090
 have another planet next as you already 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.280
