form of massive cities but hey that's
just<00:04:37.419> speculation<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.860> reason<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.220> only

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
just speculation the reason is only

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.580 
just speculation the reason is only
number<00:04:39.669> two<00:04:39.820> is<00:04:39.940> because<00:04:40.180> not<00:04:40.450> much<00:04:40.750> was<00:04:41.110> shown

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
number two is because not much was shown

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.330 
number two is because not much was shown
so<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.250> was<00:04:42.520> a<00:04:42.550> little<00:04:43.080> disappointed<00:04:44.080> and

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
so I was a little disappointed and

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.280 
so I was a little disappointed and
before<00:04:45.340> we<00:04:45.610> go<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:45.790> number<00:04:46.000> one<00:04:46.270> here<00:04:46.720> are<00:04:46.930> five
