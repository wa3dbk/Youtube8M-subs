never had this on my channel before so
yeah<00:00:09.320> get<00:00:10.320> right<00:00:10.530> into<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:11.450> start<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.599> mean

yeah get right into it I start I mean

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.150 
yeah get right into it I start I mean
this<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.679> quite<00:00:14.009> strong<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:15.089> play<00:00:16.160> format

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
this is quite strong to play format

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.040 
this is quite strong to play format
isn't<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> moment<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:18.029> not<00:00:18.300> probably<00:00:18.869> ideal

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
isn't a moment it's not probably ideal

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.359 
isn't a moment it's not probably ideal
you<00:00:19.470> might<00:00:19.680> want<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.039> try<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> different

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
you might want to try a different

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.650 
you might want to try a different
version<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:21.859> control<00:00:22.890> yeah<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.000> main<00:00:24.119> idea<00:00:24.420> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
version of control yeah the main idea of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.570 
version of control yeah the main idea of
this<00:00:24.810> deck<00:00:25.019> was<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.710> give<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> aggression

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
this deck was to give it the aggression

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.939 
this deck was to give it the aggression
that<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.090> never<00:00:27.359> originally<00:00:27.949> microlight

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that it never originally microlight

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.550 
that it never originally microlight
never<00:00:29.160> really<00:00:29.519> originally<00:00:30.090> had<00:00:30.300> yeah<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
never really originally had yeah so the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:41.350 
never really originally had yeah so the
idea<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> being<00:00:32.070> able<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> keep<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.700> present

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.720 

ck6<00:00:42.360> gadgets<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.040> certainly<00:00:44.579> old

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
ck6 gadgets but with this certainly old

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580 
ck6 gadgets but with this certainly old
9<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.329> definitely<00:00:45.660> way<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.350> because

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
9 it's definitely way to go just because

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.889 
9 it's definitely way to go just because
it<00:00:46.800> gives<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.010> felt<00:00:47.219> ways<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.670> by<00:00:48.420> drawing<00:00:48.660> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it gives you felt ways or by drawing in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.209 
it gives you felt ways or by drawing in
so<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.230> gadgets<00:00:49.559> cuz<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.860> want<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.129> able

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so you gadgets cuz you want to be able

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
so you gadgets cuz you want to be able
to<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.460> least<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.239> yeah<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to at least get one of them yeah you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.180 
to at least get one of them yeah you
mean<00:00:52.079> you've<00:00:52.320> been<00:00:52.350> moving<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.920> deck<00:00:53.160> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
mean you've been moving this deck so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.910 
mean you've been moving this deck so
yeah<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.140> just<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.260> while<00:00:55.410> millennia<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
yeah going on just a while millennia you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.990 
yeah going on just a while millennia you
could<00:00:56.160> run<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> second

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
could run a second

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.020 
could run a second
but<00:00:57.270> once<00:00:57.510> fine<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:58.050> only<00:00:58.199> run<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:59.340> whole

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
but once fine because only run one whole

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.539 
but once fine because only run one whole
track<00:01:00.359> card<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:07.220> some<00:01:08.220> people<00:01:08.340> are

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
track card so now some people are

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.980 
track card so now some people are
running<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> template<00:01:09.060> dogfish<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.630> still

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
running a template dogfish I still

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.630 
running a template dogfish I still
prefer<00:01:10.110> okay<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.610> purely<00:01:11.790> because

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
prefer okay just purely because

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.859 
prefer okay just purely because
Priestley<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> chain-link<00:01:15.000> exactly

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
Priestley the chain-link exactly

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.840 
Priestley the chain-link exactly
increases<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> chain<00:01:16.920> link<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.640> change

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
increases the chain link will change

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
increases the chain link will change
summoning<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> also<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> can't<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.740> baited

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
summoning and also you can't be baited

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
summoning and also you can't be baited
so<00:01:20.479> it's<00:01:21.479> easiest<00:01:21.780> search<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.290> well<00:01:22.470> as

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
so it's easiest search as well as

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.109 
so it's easiest search as well as
exactly<00:01:23.009> yeah<00:01:23.159> people<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.490> format<00:01:23.850> alright

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
exactly yeah people just format alright

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.700 
exactly yeah people just format alright
invaders<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.840> well<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> I'll<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.590> you've

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
invaders as well and I'll see if you've

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.469 
invaders as well and I'll see if you've
been<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> template<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.560> fine<00:01:29.390> at<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
been the the template it's fine at the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
been the the template it's fine at the
moment<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:31.020> say<00:01:33.409> my<00:01:34.409> favorite<00:01:34.619> cards<00:01:35.040> are

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
moment I would say my favorite cards are

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.550 
moment I would say my favorite cards are
the<00:01:35.189> standard<00:01:35.869> airframes<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> fortresses

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the standard airframes in the fortresses

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
the standard airframes in the fortresses
fortress<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.299> rank<00:01:39.450> sevens<00:01:39.750> are

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
fortress because the rank sevens are

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.899 
fortress because the rank sevens are
still

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
still

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.130 
still
at<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.840> moment<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.229> toolbox<00:01:42.920> for<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:44.140> it

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
at the moment this toolbox for a it

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.039 
at the moment this toolbox for a it
confers<00:01:45.560> well<00:01:45.770> with<00:01:46.009> redox<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:47.000> one<00:01:47.150> redox<00:01:47.509> OC

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
confers well with redox the one redox OC

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.260 
confers well with redox the one redox OC
redox<00:01:48.710> going<00:01:48.979> into<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.220> gadget<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.909> obviously

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
redox going into a gadget is obviously

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.240 
redox going into a gadget is obviously
still<00:01:50.360> like<00:01:50.840> your<00:01:51.020> main<00:01:51.170> play<00:01:51.440> yeah

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
still like your main play yeah

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.580 
still like your main play yeah
but<00:01:52.610> either<00:01:52.880> way<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.479> does<00:01:53.630> combo<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.170> glad<00:01:54.350> you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
but either way it does combo so glad you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.029 
but either way it does combo so glad you
can<00:01:54.740> make<00:01:54.770> your<00:01:54.979> bank<00:01:55.130> seven<00:01:59.530> traps<00:02:00.530> just<00:02:00.680> to

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
can make your bank seven traps just to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.080 
can make your bank seven traps just to
to<00:02:01.159> go<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:03.039> with<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.130> current<00:02:04.280> format<00:02:04.700> with

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
to go do with the current format with

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.740 
to go do with the current format with
tonight's<00:02:06.460> occasion<00:02:07.460> because<00:02:07.759> every<00:02:08.630> now

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
tonight's occasion because every now

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.140 
tonight's occasion because every now
then<00:02:09.050> works<00:02:09.709> nice<00:02:09.979> but<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.520> does<00:02:10.640> work<00:02:10.819> nicely

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
then works nice but it does work nicely

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.400 
then works nice but it does work nicely
if<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.420> can<00:02:11.569> steal<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.900> monster<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.290> you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
if you can steal that monster and you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.990
