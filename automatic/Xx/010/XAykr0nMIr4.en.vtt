00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.700
 now as I am a person who piga 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.950
 of the universe of the globe 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.990
 recently I said no to I have to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.450
 do a minimum of physical activity but 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.099
 what disgusts me most, Dr. Serino 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 days from a toilet bowl for 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.910
 wipe my ass 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
 and so I told myself by buying the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.699
 bike the one that bends then 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.380
 takes up little space and takes to that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.330
 do some exercise bikes maybe nothing on 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 terrace I listen to some cash manuel 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.840
 all volume away but then I am also 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.130
 said the cigarette, however, the shoulders 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 instrument a bicycle system 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.920
 smith is so then i found her 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.700
 fuchsia and I bought it because you know that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:49.289
 as soon as I see the fuchsia I go to meet him 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 here the only way why i do some 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.600
 sport sit on something fuchsia e 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.149
 so i took this exercise bike which is me 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.320
 fuchsia just arrived 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.000
 now if by chance world thinks it is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 fuchsia had to be reddish po 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.049
 wrong bar I 'll be live in every 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.780
 if we open it together and see how much 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.820
 this fuchsia will attract me to the point of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.360
 make me become a person if so how 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.320
 says a person who loves them reads nothing 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320
 the sport 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.830
 the already mixed opening would n't be fucking 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.939
 thank goodness that he had to be a chiral who 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.939
 with the coasts that is, there is writing taken 17 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 25 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:09.710
 clearly the red dick guard 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:29.500
 write what carriage means 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:32.450
 say that if these maybe I'm say 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.830
 yes anyway we have to stop but not 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.440
 it is the first time that I happen to 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.490
 read on the link here also the red ones 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.470
 there is more is moved are two different things 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:50.840
 here is immediately thought a trouble of blue 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:55.010
 super will be the case shows at 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:00.310
 audience or access instructions what 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.110
 it looks like a walking screwdriver 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.510
 another series our city is an hour 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:12.110
 I say the ballinary associations are there 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:14.870
 the other so we have it seems like a 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.390
 heart here is what i'm not a part of 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.040
 will use a heart fight that I was in the room and 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.040
 get the little heart 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.970
 and I paid 90 euros 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:45.010
 this case here I wanted the fuchsia 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:47.140
 ayane dai and style is important on 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.690
 color is the most important thing in one 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:04:00.160
 you practice fucking me 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:04:02.500
 security without mandate surprises a 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.560
 this is the way it is and it tells you all 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:11.200
 the functions that must be put and it tells you seeds 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.930
 accumulation are then km you did 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.950
 in theory it tells calories how many kilometers 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:25.840
 you have made pulsations distance speed 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:37.620
 gm I do not know what they study so much are the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:37.620
 model mounts which is unified creed 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.660
 however, as soon as he arrives at my father 's 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.360
 I make the mount you will see immediately and later 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:56.470
 this possible desperate introduction 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:05:01.020
 as assembled and you will see how it is mounted 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.020
 and all is apparently red 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.729
 now it's okay 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:17.090
 is closed with a cock is closed for now 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.669
 I'll take pictures of open locks 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.319
 the limit we will see if I do not am 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.840
 very encouraged to do it because it aims 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:29.659
 red I wanted fuchsia for then 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:33.229
 allowed together to do it again instead of dada 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:37.039
 coffee and I don't have to do sports 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.039
 oh well this hello
