and incorporate the ribbon into the
braid<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.549> make<00:02:50.549> three<00:02:50.820> strands

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.429 

and<00:02:54.969> just<00:02:55.150> braid<00:02:55.359> it<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.659> now<00:02:55.930> while<00:02:56.200> you're

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
and just braid it and now while you're

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.530 
and just braid it and now while you're
braiding<00:02:56.700> trying<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.819> make<00:02:57.969> sure<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.359> the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
braiding trying to make sure that the

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.580 
braiding trying to make sure that the
ribbon<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:58.930> always<00:02:59.760> on<00:03:00.760> top<00:03:00.819> of<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:02.230> strand

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
ribbon is always on top of the strand

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:17.910 
ribbon is always on top of the strand
that<00:03:02.920> has<00:03:03.219> it<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:07.090> like<00:03:07.359> that

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.730 

like<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.240> now<00:03:19.840> I'm<00:03:20.050> going<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.380> take<00:03:20.590> this

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
like that and now I'm going to take this

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.449 
like that and now I'm going to take this
braid<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.990> wrap<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.980> around

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.509 

my<00:03:27.359> hair<00:03:28.760> pretty<00:03:29.760> loosely<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:31.400> well<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
my hair pretty loosely but well the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.399 
my hair pretty loosely but well the
point<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.939> make<00:03:33.090> kind<00:03:33.719> of<00:03:33.870> like<00:03:33.930> something

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
point is to make kind of like something

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.979 
point is to make kind of like something
like<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> ponytail<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.790> very<00:03:36.180> loose<00:03:36.659> so<00:03:36.959> you

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
like a ponytail with very loose so you

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.059 
like a ponytail with very loose so you
want<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.290> make<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.500> break<00:03:37.709> pretty<00:03:38.099> wide<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
want to make the break pretty wide and

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:47.720 
want to make the break pretty wide and
business<00:03:41.069> down

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.640 

and<00:03:47.910> then<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.510> can<00:03:48.660> choose<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:48.990> either<00:03:49.290> leave

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
and then you can choose to either leave

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.780 
and then you can choose to either leave
this<00:03:49.890> piece<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.310> ribbon

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
this piece of ribbon

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.089 
this piece of ribbon
she<00:03:51.630> actually<00:03:51.780> has<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.260> out<00:03:52.349> in<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.709> painting

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
she actually has it out in the painting

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.800 
she actually has it out in the painting
or<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.910> tuck<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.209> away<00:03:54.300> whatever<00:03:54.690> you

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
or you can tuck it away whatever you

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.559 
or you can tuck it away whatever you
prefer<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.920> then<00:03:56.849> you<00:03:57.180> should<00:03:57.239> have

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
prefer and then you should have

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.980 
prefer and then you should have
something<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:58.170> this

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.020 

so<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.890> think<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.310> looks<00:04:05.490> really<00:04:05.550> nice<00:04:05.970> and

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
so I think it looks really nice and

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.600 
so I think it looks really nice and
surprisingly<00:04:06.960> quite<00:04:07.290> modern<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.190> am
