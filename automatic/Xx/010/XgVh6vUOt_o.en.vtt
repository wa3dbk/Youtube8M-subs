00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the swatch it is very beautiful very

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.620 
the swatch it is very beautiful very
like<00:02:44.380> good<00:02:44.590> for<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.950> daily<00:02:45.310> makeup<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:46.600> like

like good for the daily makeup or like

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.430 
like good for the daily makeup or like
office<00:02:47.200> makeup<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.160> that's<00:02:48.550> why<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.820> bought<00:02:49.150> it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
office makeup so that's why I bought it

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.080 
office makeup so that's why I bought it
it<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.500> very<00:02:50.650> good<00:02:50.800> for<00:02:51.160> doing<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.610> natural

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
it is very good for doing a natural

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.199 
it is very good for doing a natural
makeup<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:53.080> not<00:02:53.890> too<00:02:53.920> much<00:02:54.340> not<00:02:54.400> too<00:02:54.730> less

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
makeup it is not too much not too less

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.600 
makeup it is not too much not too less
so<00:02:55.450> I<00:02:55.510> thought<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.110> would<00:02:56.350> be<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.560> good<00:02:56.890> thing<00:02:57.130> to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
so I thought it would be a good thing to

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.110 
so I thought it would be a good thing to
give<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.570> try<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.100> other<00:03:00.280> two<00:03:00.580> product

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
give it a try and the other two product

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.990 
give it a try and the other two product
is<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:02.680> not<00:03:02.860> like<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.220> recently

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000
