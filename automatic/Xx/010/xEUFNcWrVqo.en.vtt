you<00:02:58.850> can<00:02:59.000> also<00:02:59.150> show<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.480> stacks<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.960> the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
you can also show the stacks of the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.640 
you can also show the stacks of the
price<00:03:00.260> per<00:03:00.530> unit<00:03:00.710> it's<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.100> good<00:03:01.340> way<00:03:01.520> of

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
price per unit it's a good way of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.560 
price per unit it's a good way of
comparing<00:03:03.650> say<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.130> 20<00:03:04.520> stack<00:03:04.820> with<00:03:05.330> this

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
comparing say this 20 stack with this

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.050 
comparing say this 20 stack with this
eight<00:03:05.780> stack<00:03:06.260> you'll<00:03:07.250> notice<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.610> they're

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
eight stack you'll notice that they're

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.880 
eight stack you'll notice that they're
very<00:03:08.270> close<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.720> each<00:03:08.780> other<00:03:08.990> but<00:03:09.380> without<00:03:09.740> the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
very close to each other but without the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.710 
very close to each other but without the
stack<00:03:10.250> information<00:03:10.910> well<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.270> eight<00:03:11.420> stack

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
stack information well that eight stack

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.960 
stack information well that eight stack
look<00:03:11.960> significantly<00:03:12.530> cheaper<00:03:12.770> but<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.790> not

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
look significantly cheaper but it's not

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.000 
look significantly cheaper but it's not
actually<00:03:14.480> per<00:03:14.690> unit<00:03:15.020> price<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.500> just<00:03:15.860> keep

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
actually per unit price so just keep

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.700 
actually per unit price so just keep
that<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.280> mind<00:03:16.960> an<00:03:17.960> add-on<00:03:18.200> such<00:03:18.560> as

stack that you could take apart if there

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.820 
stack that you could take apart if there
is<00:05:04.669> no<00:05:04.820> elementium<00:05:05.600> or<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.169> have<00:05:06.290> no<00:05:06.410> partial

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.730 
is no elementium or you have no partial
stacks<00:05:07.160> then<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.610> will<00:05:07.760> immediately<00:05:07.940> go<00:05:08.450> into

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740

the Obsidian or so you can see here on

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.340 
the Obsidian or so you can see here on
the<00:05:13.520> bottom<00:05:13.700> right<00:05:14.090> because<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.229> is

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
the bottom right because this is

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.680 
the bottom right because this is
obsidium<00:05:15.890> most<00:05:16.430> of<00:05:16.640> what<00:05:16.789> i'm<00:05:16.910> getting<00:05:17.120> our

obsidium most of what i'm getting our

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.500 
obsidium most of what i'm getting our
uncommon<00:05:18.680> gems<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.310> that's<00:05:19.789> fine<00:05:20.060> for<00:05:20.090> my

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
uncommon gems and that's fine for my

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.370 
uncommon gems and that's fine for my
purposes<00:05:22.390> depending<00:05:23.390> on<00:05:23.390> whether<00:05:23.870> or<00:05:24.050> not<00:05:24.140> you

plan<00:05:24.590> on<00:05:24.680> doing<00:05:24.919> rares<00:05:25.220> or<00:05:25.669> you're<00:05:25.850> going<00:05:26.000> to

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
plan on doing rares or you're going to

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.719 
plan on doing rares or you're going to
transmute<00:05:26.780> then<00:05:27.530> it<00:05:27.740> will<00:05:27.919> better<00:05:28.310> determine

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
transmute then it will better determine

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.420 
transmute then it will better determine
what<00:05:29.330> value<00:05:29.990> your<00:05:30.440> obsidium<00:05:30.919> or<00:05:31.220> your

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
what value your obsidium or your

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.620 
what value your obsidium or your
elementium<00:05:31.970> has<00:05:32.680> vs<00:05:33.820> and<00:05:34.820> how<00:05:35.060> many<00:05:35.120> stacks

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
elementium has vs and how many stacks

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.659 
elementium has vs and how many stacks
are<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.440> know<00:05:36.560> going<00:05:36.919> to<00:05:37.010> be<00:05:37.160> a<00:05:37.190> good<00:05:37.460> option

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
are you know going to be a good option

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.230 
are you know going to be a good option
so<00:05:38.419> here's<00:05:38.600> an<00:05:38.750> ember<00:05:39.020> topaz<00:05:39.470> as<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:40.789> said<00:05:40.850> with

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
so here's an ember topaz as I said with

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.870 
so here's an ember topaz as I said with
obsidium<00:05:41.750> I<00:05:41.930> don't<00:05:42.229> take<00:05:42.470> any<00:05:42.800> rares<00:05:43.400> into

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
obsidium I don't take any rares into

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.279 
obsidium I don't take any rares into
account<00:05:44.180> because<00:05:44.479> they're<00:05:44.600> not<00:05:44.750> guaranteed

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
account because they're not guaranteed

account because they're not guaranteed
so<00:05:45.860> that<00:05:46.039> ember<00:05:46.340> topaz<00:05:46.700> is<00:05:46.940> a<00:05:47.090> bonus<00:05:47.600> all<00:05:48.560> of

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
so that ember topaz is a bonus all of

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.230 
so that ember topaz is a bonus all of
the<00:05:48.919> numbers<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.250> I've<00:05:49.490> crunched<00:05:49.820> are<00:05:50.060> based

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
the numbers that I've crunched are based

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.110 
the numbers that I've crunched are based
only<00:05:50.510> off<00:05:50.780> of<00:05:50.810> 6<00:05:51.470> average<00:05:52.070> on<00:05:52.280> common<00:05:52.640> gems<00:05:52.850> per

only off of 6 average on common gems per

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.469 
only off of 6 average on common gems per
stack<00:05:53.479> so<00:05:54.350> that<00:05:54.860> ember<00:05:55.100> topaz<00:05:55.490> is<00:05:55.700> just<00:05:55.970> extra

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
stack so that ember topaz is just extra
