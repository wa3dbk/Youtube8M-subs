square<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:03.410> can<00:05:03.440> hide<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.860> counter<00:05:04.690> if

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
square you can hide the counter if

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.350 
square you can hide the counter if
you're<00:05:06.919> not<00:05:07.250> washing<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.789> have<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.060> it's<00:05:08.180> just

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
you're not washing to have it it's just

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.810 
you're not washing to have it it's just
normal<00:05:08.600> construction<00:05:09.020> page<00:05:09.800> we<00:05:10.520> can<00:05:10.610> hide<00:05:10.789> the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
normal construction page we can hide the

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.629 
normal construction page we can hide the
counter<00:05:11.240> so<00:05:11.509> you<00:05:12.139> don't<00:05:12.320> need<00:05:12.500> it<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:16.460> that's

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
about it really and future updates i'm

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.510 
about it really and future updates i'm
thinking<00:05:21.740> of<00:05:21.889> doing<00:05:22.070> are<00:05:24.160> where<00:05:25.160> you<00:05:25.250> can<00:05:25.400> add

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
thinking of doing are where you can add

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.020 
thinking of doing are where you can add
background<00:05:25.970> images<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:28.250> things<00:05:28.490> like<00:05:28.729> a

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
background images and things like a

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.999 
background images and things like a
pleasant<00:05:29.539> can't<00:05:29.750> do<00:05:29.870> background<00:05:30.289> images<00:05:30.710> but

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
pleasant can't do background images but

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:34.629 
pleasant can't do background images but
in<00:05:31.220> most<00:05:31.970> web<00:05:32.330> design<00:05:32.690> these<00:05:33.650> days<00:05:33.979> they

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
in most web design these days they

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.249 
in most web design these days they
likely<00:05:34.880> plain<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.240> simple<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.780> comes<00:05:35.990> to<00:05:36.110> under

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
likely plain a simple it comes to under

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.490 
likely plain a simple it comes to under
constructions<00:05:36.979> and<00:05:37.160> coming<00:05:37.580> soon<00:05:38.320> it's<00:05:39.320> all
