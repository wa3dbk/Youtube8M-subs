00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.210 
point since this is a blank slide you
can<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:21.270> add<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.930> shape<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.739> line<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.100> this

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
can then add a shape or a line in this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.660 
can then add a shape or a line in this
situation<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:23.880> add<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.330> little<00:02:24.570> bit<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.989> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
situation so just add a little bit of a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.610 
situation so just add a little bit of a
break<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.390> not<00:02:27.570> all<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.110> single-page

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
break so it's not all the single-page

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.620 
break so it's not all the single-page
know<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.130> your<00:02:29.400> line<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.120> straight<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.480> can

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
know if your line is it straight you can

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.570 
know if your line is it straight you can
always<00:02:30.810> come<00:02:30.959> back<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.380> try<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> straighten

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
always come back and try to straighten

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.290 
always come back and try to straighten
it<00:02:32.790> again<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:34.080> got<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.290> idea<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:36.120> is

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
it again we got the idea so this is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.540 
it again we got the idea so this is
pretty<00:02:36.480> simple<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.110> come<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.980> mess<00:02:38.400> with

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
pretty simple you come in you mess with

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.550 
pretty simple you come in you mess with
your<00:02:38.670> text<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.300> add<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> line<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.319> do<00:02:40.440> the
