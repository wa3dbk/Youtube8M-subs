ones I used for the XL cage see that on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
ones I used for the XL cage see that on
the<00:01:38.130> back<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.479> thinner

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the back one it's a little bit thinner

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.469 
the back one it's a little bit thinner
so<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> how<00:01:41.010> to<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.370> and<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.180> see

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
so what I how to do and if you can see

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.230 
so what I how to do and if you can see
that<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.799> had<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> grind<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> washer<00:01:45.060> on

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that but I had to grind the washer on

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.190 
that but I had to grind the washer on
each<00:01:45.270> side<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.400> make<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.909> guess<00:01:48.540> oval<00:01:48.990> or

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
each side so can make it I guess oval or

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.340 
each side so can make it I guess oval or
square<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:52.170> sides<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:55.140> fit

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
square on on on on two sides and it fit

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
square on on on on two sides and it fit
right<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.920> groove<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> get

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
right into the groove that way I get

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.039 
right into the groove that way I get
more<00:01:58.049> surface<00:01:58.500> area<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.240> to<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.780> hold

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
more surface area to to actually hold

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.250 
more surface area to to actually hold
the<00:02:02.030> camera<00:02:03.030> or<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.450> plate<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.990> aluminum

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
the camera or the plate the aluminum

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.730 
the camera or the plate the aluminum
plate<00:02:04.440> here<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:06.570> support<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.440> so<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.680> doesn't

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
plate here to support it so it doesn't

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.629 
plate here to support it so it doesn't
break<00:02:08.009> hopefully<00:02:09.739> on<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.950> front<00:02:11.219> one<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.579> was

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:11.639 
break hopefully on the front one it was

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.170 
break hopefully on the front one it was
okay<00:02:11.939> you<00:02:11.999> don't<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.329> to<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.569> any<00:02:12.719> grinding

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180

just put the bolt through and in the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.940 
just put the bolt through and in the
washer<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> didn't<00:02:18.730> want<00:02:18.909> to<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.120> was

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
inch bit that I used for the XO cage

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.660 
inch bit that I used for the XO cage
right<00:02:39.639> here<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:41.170> will<00:02:41.680> allow<00:02:41.859> you<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.310> be

right here that will allow you to be
able<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.879> thread<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.420> bolt<00:02:43.750> through<00:02:44.109> and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
able to thread this bolt through and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.800 
able to thread this bolt through and
that<00:02:45.099> way<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.849> see<00:02:46.000> I'm<00:02:46.090> pushing<00:02:46.359> it<00:02:46.450> down<00:02:46.569> and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
that way you see I'm pushing it down and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.629 
that way you see I'm pushing it down and
it<00:02:46.870> doesn't<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.889> doesn't<00:02:47.950> go<00:02:48.250> down<00:02:48.280> that's

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
it doesn't it doesn't go down that's

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.220 
it doesn't it doesn't go down that's
because<00:02:48.849> it's<00:02:49.000> threaded<00:02:49.329> in<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.659> course<00:02:49.840> when

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
because it's threaded in of course when

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.589 
because it's threaded in of course when
you're<00:02:50.349> when<00:02:50.859> you're<00:02:51.090> screwing<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.299> don't

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
you're when you're screwing it in don't

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.690 
you're when you're screwing it in don't
don't<00:02:53.409> over<00:02:53.859> tighten<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.250> because<00:02:54.489> you'll

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
don't over tighten it because you'll

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.009 
don't over tighten it because you'll
strip<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.450> might<00:02:55.569> go<00:02:55.720> through<00:02:55.750> they

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
strip it and it might go through they

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.059 
strip it and it might go through they
might<00:02:56.169> not<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:56.919> I<00:02:56.980> don't<00:02:57.400> want<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.579> find<00:02:57.669> out

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
might not but I don't want to find out

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.509 
might not but I don't want to find out
yeah<00:03:00.069> once<00:03:00.310> once<00:03:00.669> you<00:03:00.790> drill<00:03:01.000> them<00:03:01.090> through

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
yeah once once you drill them through

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.009 
yeah once once you drill them through
just<00:03:03.519> screw<00:03:04.180> him<00:03:04.299> in<00:03:04.389> of<00:03:04.599> course<00:03:04.810> with<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
just screw him in of course with the

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:13.319 
just screw him in of course with the
washers<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:07.870> did<00:03:08.169> was<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:12.010> got<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.120> plate

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
washers what I did was I got the plate

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.550 
washers what I did was I got the plate
and<00:03:14.549> just<00:03:15.549> measured<00:03:15.969> out<00:03:16.169> whereas<00:03:17.169> I<00:03:17.229> hope<00:03:17.409> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
and just measured out whereas I hope the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.309 
and just measured out whereas I hope the
holes<00:03:17.739> would<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:19.510> play<00:03:19.690> cost<00:03:19.900> me<00:03:20.079> three

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
holes would be this play cost me three

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.949 
holes would be this play cost me three
dollars<00:03:20.650> at<00:03:20.769> hobby<00:03:20.949> bench<00:03:21.449> the<00:03:22.449> hardware<00:03:22.690> was

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
dollars at hobby bench the hardware was

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.050 
dollars at hobby bench the hardware was
about<00:03:23.739> seven<00:03:24.220> dollars<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:24.609> you<00:03:24.699> can<00:03:24.819> make<00:03:24.940> this

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
about seven dollars so you can make this

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.890 
about seven dollars so you can make this
for<00:03:25.239> like<00:03:25.359> ten<00:03:25.569> dollars<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:28.419> right<00:03:28.540> here<00:03:28.689> just

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
for like ten dollars and right here just

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.539 
for like ten dollars and right here just
look<00:03:29.049> like<00:03:29.199> it's<00:03:29.349> off<00:03:29.500> because<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:29.859> this<00:03:30.370> is

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
look like it's off because I this is

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.210 
look like it's off because I this is
this<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.689> luis<00:03:31.900> soto<00:03:32.260> move<00:03:32.530> it'll<00:03:32.859> move<00:03:32.979> back

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
this is luis soto move it'll move back

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.509 
this is luis soto move it'll move back
into<00:03:33.430> line<00:03:33.760> with<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.060> holes<00:03:34.919> and<00:03:35.919> then<00:03:36.159> once<00:03:36.400> I

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
into line with the holes and then once I

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.589 
into line with the holes and then once I
did<00:03:36.699> that<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:38.579> made<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.729> holes<00:03:39.970> off<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.449> this

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
did that I made the holes off of this

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.369 
did that I made the holes off of this
one<00:03:40.659> and<00:03:42.209> all<00:03:43.209> before<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:43.599> get<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:43.840> the

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
one and all before I get to that the

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.949 
one and all before I get to that the
holes<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.709> drilled<00:03:44.739> on<00:03:45.099> here<00:03:45.659> aren't<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:46.780> same

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
holes I drilled on here aren't the same

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.339 
holes I drilled on here aren't the same
I<00:03:48.120> didn't<00:03:49.120> use<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.329> same<00:03:49.780> drill<00:03:49.989> bit<00:03:50.139> this<00:03:50.290> is

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
I didn't use the same drill bit this is

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.990 
I didn't use the same drill bit this is
a<00:03:50.500> quarter<00:03:50.769> inch<00:03:50.919> hole<00:03:51.099> right<00:03:51.250> there<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.879> way

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
a quarter inch hole right there that way

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.319 
a quarter inch hole right there that way
they'd<00:03:52.180> slide<00:03:52.419> through<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:54.060> don't<00:03:55.060> don't

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
they'd slide through and don't don't

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.580 
they'd slide through and don't don't
give<00:03:55.449> you<00:03:55.509> a<00:03:55.569> hassle<00:03:55.720> trying<00:03:56.229> to<00:03:56.290> put<00:03:56.409> it<00:03:56.470> on

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
poly you could prolly get it cheaper

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.650 
poly you could prolly get it cheaper
than<00:06:19.120> that<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.539> know<00:06:20.530> just<00:06:20.740> depends<00:06:21.010> where

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
than that I know just depends where

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.200 
than that I know just depends where
where<00:06:22.660> you<00:06:22.750> go<00:06:22.870> I<00:06:22.900> guess<00:06:23.200> but<00:06:23.710> uh<00:06:23.850> this<00:06:24.850> is<00:06:25.000> just

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
where you go I guess but uh this is just

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.880 
where you go I guess but uh this is just
an<00:06:25.300> idea<00:06:25.389> to<00:06:25.900> give<00:06:26.080> you<00:06:26.229> I<00:06:26.260> guess<00:06:26.530> maybe<00:06:26.740> you

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
an idea to give you I guess maybe you

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.409 
an idea to give you I guess maybe you
can<00:06:27.010> make<00:06:27.099> a<00:06:27.159> better<00:06:27.400> one<00:06:27.580> than<00:06:27.640> then<00:06:28.120> I<00:06:28.210> did

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
can make a better one than then I did

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.240 
can make a better one than then I did
but<00:06:28.570> this<00:06:28.720> is<00:06:28.840> what<00:06:28.990> what<00:06:29.620> I<00:06:29.650> could<00:06:29.860> think<00:06:29.979> of

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
but this is what what I could think of

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.290 
but this is what what I could think of
on

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 
and i am going to say that i haven't

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:48.809 
and i am going to say that i haven't
tested<00:06:44.650> this<00:06:45.300> so<00:06:46.300> i<00:06:46.990> hope<00:06:47.500> it's<00:06:47.680> not<00:06:47.800> shaky<00:06:48.639> I

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:48.819 
tested this so i hope it's not shaky I

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.059 
tested this so i hope it's not shaky I
hope<00:06:49.360> it's<00:06:49.539> not<00:06:49.690> that<00:06:50.199> I<00:06:50.229> don't<00:06:50.560> see<00:06:50.830> why<00:06:51.009> it

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
hope it's not that I don't see why it

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.369 
hope it's not that I don't see why it
would<00:06:51.310> because<00:06:51.610> you<00:06:52.300> know<00:06:52.419> the<00:06:52.539> XO<00:06:52.750> cage<00:06:52.990> it

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.379 
would because you know the XO cage it

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.260 
would because you know the XO cage it
mounts<00:06:53.919> right<00:06:54.069> up<00:06:54.280> to<00:06:54.430> the<00:06:54.520> mounts<00:06:54.819> even
