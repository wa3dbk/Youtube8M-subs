00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.889
 we are going to dive into the world of fashion illustrators 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.670
 do you know the difference between a recipient and the administrator the 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.910
 first draws clothes for creators while illustrators 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.320
 they are responsible for putting in images at the earliest in December the universe of the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.049
 fashion 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.970
 there are catalogs of advertisements and sometimes even fashion pictures or 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.449
 of products thanks to their imagination and their stroke of pencil they can not 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.599
 all to afford 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.249
 a freedom in fashion magazines these are more and more fond of as in 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 germany we went to investigate it even comes from each set 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.840
 their press is very cyclical throughout the 90s failing that 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.539
 to have been able to renew his strings 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.429
 fashion illustrations always know from him a real 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:41.700
 Renaissance 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.780
 the new year preceded it the desire when I made drawings of the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.120
 net debt is to find a form that does not reflect the stereotypes that I 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.510
 see everywhere in the photos of fashion magazines 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.070
 we are far from being me I also want to show women a little more 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.929
 quirky of the intelligent women of the women who finally said m 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.070
 it's easier to do in the illustration there I can always 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.550
 drawn a pharmacist is too long besides m the project will allow to sign 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.550
 a woman in charente 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.290
 the young Berlin illustrator stinat benign and sought by magazines 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.100
 European 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
 but also Japanese us Americans 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.210
 this date can be observed not only in germany but also in 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.170
 the whole world 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.979
 that fashion design is a trend in full expansion we are interested in 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.750
 thicker we can say that finally in seven years in this arrival 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.750
 in Germany a cut 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.340
 she is not beautiful life the come back of the fashion design date of the end of the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.570
 90s 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.370
 let's say beginning of the new millennium in my opinion at that time we had enough 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.550
 fashion photos 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.360
 so I'm happy and proud to revalue fashion design in 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.630
 innovative in the world we are black 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.959
 when I was a child it is in any case I am told about this offers to each 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.090
 of these options 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.690
 so we can say of drawing that they are pictures their hosts today what 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.550
 which is trend is rather fashionable it is nature the slowness and the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.039
 unique pieces the manual work and the extraordinary 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.369
 fashion illustration fits well in this trend 2009 prospects are 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.849
 available 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
 8 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.109
 orbassour a format as big as this one justifies most of the time 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.180
 all the elements separately one hits next to the face of the other 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.180
 mistake of appreciation that seemed all computer 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.569
 mmm the computer gives me the opportunity to make proposals on paper 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.739
 all the elements that I drew separately at the bottom I actually have a 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.739
 collage before 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.799
 this morning I like the idea that we do not know anymore and who were drawn to 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.099
 the hand he knows he's been reworked on computers 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.099
 like when there is a doubt when it's not obvious 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.349
 to get rid of what is also part of the new generation of 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.080
 illustrators or fashion 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.080
 an approach very close to the deceased father 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.819
 landmarks 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.849
 we do not know what he is going to put back in what mobilizes all 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.609
 techniques 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.989
 first of all i think it's a great designer it's also a 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.439
 great painter he has an innate sense of color he makes curious mixtures 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.299
 with his drawings while scrolls 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.939
 he is daring impertinence but at the same time they give off full 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.109
 of poetry lyricism walsh 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.499
 in front of the trash armadas so 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:54.710
 yes I always try to give my ideas that massacre the finish 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.180
 da da silva i want the drawing to be something open not to let a 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.180
 message in which one can wander freely 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.719
 adeline 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.219
 at 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.470
 13th floor path 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.539
 already in their den 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.979
 and it bothers me to advise the shipping agent surprises and also 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979
 fast installed it's super nice 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.659
 m 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.059
 while German is used to that the hand will not necessarily 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.059
 behind but also wants a break 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.830
 since his studies at the fine arts in paris karin and spanish is fascinated 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.490
 by fashion illustrations 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.879
 today she is editor-in-chief image l germany 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.490
 in zurich what fascinates me 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.110
 here's the idea is to be able before the character indeed what's this 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.520
 affection can turn in every way as I want 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.669
 I can still earn money is not limited to coming 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.419
 during the year draw another went to canada one side of the dress 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.319
 high fashion alain tartas nothing is ever too expensive to conclude in 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.150
 drawing the area I have all my disposition the question of imagination 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150
 effect of making the jump 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.330
 to question 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.759
 and who likes to get out of the month typologies between two trips we have 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.639
 made a wax specified the iiai dress-code will remain in force in the 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.439
 different estimates to test action last year we have here a 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.930
 seaside resort one imagines a kind of paris if he tons 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.979
 to leave the comfort she is then trained a season in marrakech 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.669
 with the bar is rather the style of an elegant halal color 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.490
 state police was born in Calais organized to designate men 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.509
 policies which is worth very refined fashion illustration and a way of 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.819
 more and more used 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.180
 I announced our position as leader of the group option finance serge 

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:14.919
 every day we are confronted with the language of advertising losing all 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.069
 credibility 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.240
 world but I believe that drawing would however need elementary to see 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.240
 things to show abstractly next to 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.490
 there was stature when I made a drawing of Christmas mamere 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.650
 the jules factory published in a wendel magazine if I'm in the 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.840
 commercial cdac scene cvx n but it still remains a small work 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.840
 of art net against this cancer 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.289
 today some wanted to make even a catalog without a 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:50.080
 single photo 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.639
 only with illustrations of catalogs to keep almost as 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.129
 works of art
