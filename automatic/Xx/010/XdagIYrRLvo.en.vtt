00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.460
 hi in this video is about the question 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.349
 what is really a hammer and a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.990
 Hammer and you understand that on hammer 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.660
 a tone with a finger of the griffin 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.960
 hand so this sound is not extra from 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.269
 the stroke hand is struck 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.699
 can happen for example with one 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.440
 sound on a blank page it's called us 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.290
 strike the empty side and hammer 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.699
 then put a finger on it so that one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.650
 additional sound is created 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.870
 but it can be done by one already 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.610
 gripped ton be considered as 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.839
 that with a second finger ins 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.850
 is hammered further 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.500
 what that looks like and how it looks 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 Sounds like I'll show you in now 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.940
 this video so here's a simple one 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.739
 hemmer and of that would be the side up 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.739
 the tour on the second bunch 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.579
 Of course you can also hammer in that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 one already grasped a key and 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.409
 then hammering a second finger on it 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.430
 you can also combine it 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.950
 You can also hear two tones in succession 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.950
 Herrmann for example 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.250
 so very popular of course again 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.200
 the fifth position of b minor pentatonic 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.790
 There is also another video here 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.610
 on this canal with a nice view 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:21.620
 and also an explanation of the pentatonic 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:23.600
 so now I just honey one too 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.690
 on nice ideas such as something like that 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.690
 here 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.890
 so go with the whole time 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.890
 be distorted 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.299
 rank 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.290
 you come back to so beautiful 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.290
 ideas such example that yes 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.900
