00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.280
 me 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.280
 Minutes 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:18.670
 Yes I would like to explain step-up ringing this time 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.070
 First of all, what is Step Up Ring ? 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.289
 There is a screw 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.470
 Because the lens if there are brother of the filter depending on the filter system 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.250
 Cap abducted and the filter is of course different reason 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.410
 For example, nd filter 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.240
 If not aligned to each it is and all Miri number is different though there Peter ea 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.240
 Well 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.390
 Well then you may have me aligned 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:48.160
 It would align all in accordance with the one of the say Crucifixion 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:52.690
 First of all , I think that the suns time is short 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.830
 Enoi it to say that extending the shutter cans timing it is in the case of Musashi is with the most 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.330
 I'm 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.550
 It is when it is like that looking Gosogoso at that time 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.850
 Because there is no meaning 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:08.040
 It goods This is is that would align all of it is this 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.400
 I use the step up ring 67ms 77m step up 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.400
 Masu Tei 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.810
 This is originally a system of 77 mm 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.870
 Well, that's why we have 67 seconds and 77 mm 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:30.610
 At 77 seen over the lens cap of 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:35.320
 The key behind the inter is written on the reverse side of the orange 77 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.370
 Of course the lens cap here is so flexible . 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.370
 Well then 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.420
 Since this is 67 mm, I can not use it normally, but the step up ring is 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.750
 Because it is attached 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.660
 77 gap is a perfect type 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:00.570
 Align all You're in with this that Tteyuu I know the camera of one of the city is 69, but also 69 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.710
 It is 67 mi-this is a 77 mm step-up ring 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.130
 I know that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.110
 crow did it say why 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.009
 And yes I'm a manufacturer, but I'm a step up ring of the same system here 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.910
 Is 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.030
 I'm that contains the step-up ring jagged sounds good that a child of health 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.630
 That 's right and rounding and putting 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.260
 Marui's guy has this problem 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:28.110
 For example, it's good if put here. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.129
 A little slip do because it is slippery in the chops is home metal at this time to give 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.319
 Is it 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.760
 Well healthy people are jagged so it is very easy to go around 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.530
 Better health 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.140
 It is price as step up ring 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:48.660
 It's a little to nearly double, but also I'm such within 1000 yen in it Well 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.830
 Because I think that step up ring of health is easy to use in that sense 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.980
 By all means 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.150
 And the fact that I am using the Apuringu want to 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:02.480
 It is maker, but after all this one of the main school is 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.250
 I think it's easy to handle just because this person is attached, so to this park for your health 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.610
 The 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.960
 Your just So you moving glad p Dale 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.940
 How is it? Step up ring is very useful. 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.620
 I think that I understood well 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:22.010
 Make use of it by all means 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.010
