00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.220 

I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.660> biggest<00:00:58.780> difference<00:00:58.960> between

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
I think the biggest difference between

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.500 
I think the biggest difference between
Nitro<00:00:59.680> Circus<00:00:59.800> live<00:01:00.130> and<00:01:00.520> nitro<00:01:01.060> circus<00:01:01.240> was

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
to the namesake is that Nitro Circus has

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.240 
to the namesake is that Nitro Circus has
always<00:01:03.910> been<00:01:04.030> about<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.800> thinking<00:01:05.800> it's<00:01:05.980> not

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
always been about a thinking it's not

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.790 
always been about a thinking it's not
just<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.640> group<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.150> five<00:01:07.600> or<00:01:07.780> seven<00:01:08.050> guys<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.650> is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
just a group of five or seven guys it is

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.560 
just a group of five or seven guys it is
kind<00:01:09.310> of<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> mentality<00:01:09.760> of<00:01:10.120> how<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.360> go<00:01:10.540> about

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
kind of a mentality of how you go about

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.420 
kind of a mentality of how you go about
your<00:01:10.750> life<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.350> always<00:01:11.650> want<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.160> step

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
your life and just always want to step

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.850 
your life and just always want to step
up<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.910> try<00:01:13.780> harder<00:01:14.110> do<00:01:14.260> more<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:14.620> that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
up and try harder do more so that

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.070 
up and try harder do more so that
mentality<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.910> just<00:01:16.150> much<00:01:16.300> broader<00:01:16.600> here<00:01:16.900> and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
mentality is just much broader here and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.450 
mentality is just much broader here and
then<00:01:17.290> we<00:01:17.380> have<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.530> bring<00:01:17.770> into<00:01:18.040> a<00:01:18.070> smaller

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460
