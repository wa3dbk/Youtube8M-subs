program and today I want to talk to you
about<00:00:13.830> how<00:00:14.190> important<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.690> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
about how important it is to have a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
about how important it is to have a
sufficient<00:00:16.470> amount<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.890> protein<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.670> your

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
sufficient amount of protein in your

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.080 
sufficient amount of protein in your
daily<00:00:18.449> meal<00:00:18.779> plan<00:00:19.080> now<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.949> say<00:00:20.250> sufficient<00:00:20.850> not

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
daily meal plan now I say sufficient not

daily meal plan now I say sufficient not
an<00:00:21.359> overabundance<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.410> protein<00:00:23.070> every<00:00:23.850> single

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
an overabundance of protein every single

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.880 
an overabundance of protein every single
day<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.990> lot<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> people<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.710> this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
day and a lot of people have this

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.339 
day and a lot of people have this
misconception<00:00:26.090> that<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.750> need<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.019> have

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
misconception that they need to have

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
misconception that they need to have
tons<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.130> tons<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.730> protein<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.420> order<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
tons and tons of protein in order to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.740 
tons and tons of protein in order to
build<00:00:31.320> these<00:00:31.619> lean<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> toned<00:00:32.550> muscles<00:00:33.090> so

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
build these lean and toned muscles so

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.200 
build these lean and toned muscles so
first<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.649> protein<00:00:35.250> while<00:00:35.850> your<00:00:36.059> body

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
first what is protein while your body

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.170 
first what is protein while your body
breaks<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:36.899> protein<00:00:37.649> into<00:00:38.100> amino<00:00:38.340> acids<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
breaks down protein into amino acids and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.110 
breaks down protein into amino acids and
use<00:00:39.750> those<00:00:40.140> uses<00:00:40.800> those<00:00:40.980> amino<00:00:41.309> acids<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
use those uses those amino acids to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.270 
use those uses those amino acids to
build<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.600> muscles<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.920> exercise

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
build up your muscles when you exercise

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
build up your muscles when you exercise
you're<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:44.940> breaking<00:00:45.450> down<00:00:45.899> muscle

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you're actually breaking down muscle

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.160 
you're actually breaking down muscle
this<00:00:46.800> does<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> mean<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.760> need<00:00:48.120> tons<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
this does it mean that you need tons and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.549 
this does it mean that you need tons and
tons<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.860> protein<00:00:50.340> every<00:00:50.700> single<00:00:51.660> day<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.199> in

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
tons of protein every single day and in

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
tons of protein every single day and in
every<00:00:52.890> single<00:00:53.280> meal<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.969> should<00:00:54.210> keep<00:00:54.420> them

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
every single meal you should keep them

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.439 
every single meal you should keep them
at<00:00:54.809> reasonable<00:00:55.530> portions<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.789> what's<00:00:57.360> very

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
at reasonable portions now what's very

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.209 
at reasonable portions now what's very
important<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.710> need<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> have

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
important is that you need to have

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.160 
important is that you need to have
protein<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.969> every<00:01:00.359> single<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> your

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
protein with every single one of your

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.429 
protein with every single one of your
meals<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.010> help<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.430> burn<00:01:02.609> fat

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
meals because it will help you burn fat

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.780 
meals because it will help you burn fat
protein<00:01:04.439> releases<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> hormone<00:01:05.100> called

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
protein releases a hormone called

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.840 
protein releases a hormone called
glucagon<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:07.290> does<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> exact<00:01:08.100> opposite<00:01:08.729> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
glucagon that does the exact opposite of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
glucagon that does the exact opposite of
insulin<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.260> insulin<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> fat

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
insulin so we're insulin is a fat

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.090 
insulin so we're insulin is a fat
storage<00:01:11.790> hormone<00:01:11.820> glucagon<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
storage hormone glucagon is actually a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.030 
storage hormone glucagon is actually a
fat-burning<00:01:14.630> hormone<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.619> eat<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
fat-burning hormone so if you eat a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
fat-burning hormone so if you eat a
serving<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.119> servings<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:18.720> even<00:01:18.930> three

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
serving or two servings or even three

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.380 
serving or two servings or even three
servings<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.710> protein<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.610> every<00:01:21.030> single

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
servings of protein with every single

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
servings of protein with every single
one<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.869> meals<00:01:22.110> you're<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> get

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
one of your meals you're going to get

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.330 
one of your meals you're going to get
this<00:01:23.850> fat<00:01:24.240> burning<00:01:24.720> effect<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:26.070> meals

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
this fat burning effect with your meals

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.810 
this fat burning effect with your meals
it's<00:01:27.090> also<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.570> blood<00:01:28.049> sugar<00:01:28.350> stabilizer<00:01:29.159> so

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it's also a blood sugar stabilizer so

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
it's also a blood sugar stabilizer so
when<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.119> eat<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> protein<00:01:30.750> along<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.890> your

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
