heavily<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:12.239> is<00:04:12.359> an<00:04:12.450> Indian

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
heavily and it is an Indian

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.589 
heavily and it is an Indian
it's<00:04:13.109> very<00:04:13.560> crusty<00:04:14.219> and<00:04:14.669> corroded<00:04:15.150> and

it's very crusty and corroded and
there's<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:16.650> spot<00:04:16.979> right<00:04:17.310> over<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.120> last<00:04:18.299> two

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
there's a spot right over the last two

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.180 
there's a spot right over the last two
numbers<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.840> date<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.289> tried<00:04:19.680> scratching

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
numbers of the date I tried scratching

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.499 
numbers of the date I tried scratching
it<00:04:20.280> off<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> little<00:04:20.609> bit<00:04:20.759> but<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.150> don't<00:04:21.180> want<00:04:21.389> to

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
it off a little bit but I don't want to

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.170 
it off a little bit but I don't want to
end<00:04:21.750> up<00:04:21.840> scratching<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.500> date<00:04:22.710> off<00:04:23.180> probably

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
end up scratching the date off probably

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.870 
end up scratching the date off probably
put<00:04:24.389> some<00:04:24.509> my<00:04:24.630> trellis<00:04:24.870> or<00:04:25.080> some<00:04:25.199> of<00:04:25.289> this<00:04:25.349> I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
put some my trellis or some of this I

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.240 
put some my trellis or some of this I
just<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:26.970> my<00:04:27.000> choices<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.720> think<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.919> first<00:04:29.130> two

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
just in my choices I think the first two

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.550 
just in my choices I think the first two
numbers<00:04:29.400> are<00:04:29.699> 1<00:04:29.940> 9<00:04:30.150> so<00:04:30.539> it's<00:04:30.690> 19<00:04:31.139> something

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
numbers are 1 9 so it's 19 something

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.870 
numbers are 1 9 so it's 19 something
that<00:04:32.250> narrows<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.610> down<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:32.759> like<00:04:32.880> 10<00:04:33.150> years

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
that narrows it down to like 10 years

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.640 
that narrows it down to like 10 years
I'll<00:04:35.880> put<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.150> picture<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.810> after<00:04:37.229> this<00:04:37.380> cuz

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
I'll put a picture of it after this cuz

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.110 
I'll put a picture of it after this cuz
there's<00:04:37.800> no<00:04:37.860> way<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.190> can<00:04:38.340> actually<00:04:38.789> clean<00:04:39.000> this

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
there's no way I can actually clean this
