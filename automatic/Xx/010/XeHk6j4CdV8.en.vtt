00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.700
 the staff here we have a camera 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.429
 echo I said is launching here the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.960
 car and now is the procedure was 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.590
 very easy to believe 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.340
 are only 32 groups the authority is 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.910
 of these goals came here to make a 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.750
 Only fitting will fit right here. 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.250
 this other people that goes straight 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 it was better mpf can be installed here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.390
 these and two other children we go 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.170
 get the file can tell the defendant and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.360
 negative then it is you see that it is not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.000
 nothing complicated to avoid that diet or 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.370
 stockpile not for the right car crash 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.520
 or have you brought with perfect this 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.910
 process 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.760
 this camera we will put physical 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.360
 for car crash put here head 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.059
 down 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.040
 and let's make the curious little ones 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.440
 so we can put two 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.300
 bolts here in order to secure the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.660
 camera when we have to use the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.960
 camera here in this match to shock 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.800
 we're going to make a hole that I had 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.080
 here to pass or else just 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.500
 reopens with a little bit to power 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.520
 go wireless you're rest chamber is 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.600
 The one that can be reached here is in the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.170
 deco to tape next to aal 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.670
 wire that will pay for possible power 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.670
 negative of the back and I get that comes from gps 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.450
 the work only 76 saw there the step by step 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.520
 It's not too complicated to make our 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.170
 part of the rear camera what we're going 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.240
 to have to do now is to get the positive and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.730
 negative career as I liked at the beginning 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.010
 the video here has everything it 's just in the box 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.030
 then we'll do here takes this 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.880
 part here does not get ugly positive and is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.820
 the best possible is the negative 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.050
 we will fit here in this Dakar is 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.930
 that we put here into the 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.740
 car and now to be able to conclude that the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.660
 installation 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.990
 Let's just come here in the same field as we 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.530
 we got the feedback sensor power 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.540
 Let's get it here it 's that shot that goes 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.310
 search and I cook negative and linked 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.340
 Then what ever is passing is now is the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.710
 camera is the gps that is inside the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.260
 car you ever saw the fla in the windshield 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.120
 will show the image that will be 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.990
 transmitted here by this camera 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.990
 Look at the camera 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.720
 good guys, this is gps like you 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.280
 You can see there when you go here looks 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.080
 that only in 2010 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.319
 the camera is there in for car crash 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.300
 going to shoot is everything behind the car and 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.540
 show the image will move the image here 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.549
 for this project monitor s 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.169
 So when we saw there, it's very 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.930
 simple very easy facilities for which 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.150
 You want money and food, or 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.110
 shared jewelry was in our 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.210
 channel 7 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.210
 Thank you guys, thank you very much for watching.
