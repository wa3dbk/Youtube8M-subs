00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.960
 this afternoon a single big football with his country 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.109
 everywhere in hesse and rhineland-palatinate to the people of the second 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.559
 Appearance of the DNA to a team in South Africa a community experience 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.049
 was made exactly could has found somewhere for public viewing 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.110
 Fingerfertige has accompanied the whole for us on no Wiesbadener 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.689
 schoolyard 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.689
 Troost 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.900
 Despair 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.730
 and sheer horror 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.460
 the shock after the defeats 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.710
 sits deep 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 means 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.580
 he is one of the men 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 We say on Verra 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.660
 90 minutes before the mood was even more brilliant 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.510
 350 pupils of the Wiesbaden humboldt-gymnasium would be the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.240
 School books lay way and already a test for our boys' soul from the 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.970
 neck 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.100
 from the beginning 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 set on victory 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.140
 I can think that trends are Germany 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.629
 the winning teams Basler 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:02.910
 3 0 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.969
 after the two 3 0331 split by their shares 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.290
 so while looking at the win by Nicole Blechinger 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.670
 but despite all the danger the gate main-taunus 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.560
 instead Klose has to leave the field 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.010
 Serbia takes the lead 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.230
 in the 60 minute excitement 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.230
 Penalty for Germany 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 there 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.270
 but luck was missing 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.040
 we wanted the 15 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.140
 it starts when the fathers have been too tight 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.790
 sometimes given additional motivation for the team and German wave 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.340
 German wine has also become very well played in the front 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.890
 the last word should have been 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.180
 the penalty the trend because it exterminated European values 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.420
 I would give the German team 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.490
 One of two Walser does not bother with ten players still a good game 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.160
 do 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.200
 and actually should have kept up well with ten against eleven 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.950
 Germany lose against Serbia in the next match against Ghana is 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.210
 now for everything 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.450
 but despite all the disappointments, the Wiesbaden students consider ours 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.139
 Team up the flag 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.719
 would have 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.329
 No
