00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.760
 hello very good in this video is going to present a reality app 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.940
 increased based bookmarks have been used the libraries grouped for the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.790
 marker detection and the virtual library for loading and managing 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.220
 virtual models 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.859
 both sandrita libraries have been developed by the groups of 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.150
 research applications of artificial vision 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.579
 from the University of CÃ³rdoba 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.579
 let's move on to the execution of the application 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.360
 we comment now the window 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.260
 i the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.610
 the markers for the loading of the modest 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.880
 as you can see percent once detected the markers to santa 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.890
 faith and then to load the models 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.030
 at the same time as the new p the set of markers 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.039
 the board because that way the different models also move 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 It is useful too 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
 once the board expired, the moments are also rotated 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.860
 well this application 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 percent is about 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.570
 the result has to end 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.340
 then the user has to percent and place the cd plumbers the ebro in the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.810
 correct order 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 to select the numbers can be done using the mouse 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.720
 og through desserts numbers 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 in this case we are going to use the numbers two three four 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.160
 to move each number then the cursors are used 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130
 this time I will move the 4 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.770
 because that day the operation 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.660
 four between two 2 +3 equal to 5 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.660
 but let's put a terrorism case 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.000
 today in Beijing 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.010
 and until here 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.570
 this would be 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.270
 both used the mouse 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.669
 now uses the mestre keyboard does not output anything when it is correct 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.459
 a model appears 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.459
 what a tic 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.909
 in blue indicating that the entity itself is correct 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.909
 Tostes let's do it well 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
 2 3 at the beginning 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.939
 i the toscaf 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.649
 then per month that four between the two have to leave 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.399
 iniesta 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.269
 correct operation 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.150
 well this is an application that has been developed by the bookstore shaluco 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.239
 and virtual 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.239
 i have been 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.929
 developed per month as I said before 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:53.259
 the research group applied the injury before 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.149
 I hope it is not fair where this application 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:58.159
 I'll see you in the cough 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.700
 see you soon
