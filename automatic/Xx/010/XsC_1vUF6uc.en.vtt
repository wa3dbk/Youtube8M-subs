00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.910 
should have a forward system no way
shape<00:03:16.989> or<00:03:17.110> form<00:03:17.170> i<00:03:17.350> don't<00:03:17.560> even<00:03:17.650> think<00:03:17.770> that

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
shape or form i don't even think that

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.229 
shape or form i don't even think that
would<00:03:18.070> fit<00:03:18.220> well<00:03:18.370> into<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.730> culligan<00:03:19.030> be

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
would fit well into the culligan be

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.880 
would fit well into the culligan be
serious<00:03:19.570> i<00:03:19.630> don't<00:03:19.780> know<00:03:19.870> why<00:03:20.020> i<00:03:20.320> know<00:03:20.620> it's

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
serious i don't know why i know it's

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.770 
serious i don't know why i know it's
dumb<00:03:21.100> but<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:21.820> some<00:03:22.000> reason<00:03:22.300> some<00:03:22.480> part<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.720> me

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
dumb but for some reason some part of me

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.690 
dumb but for some reason some part of me
just<00:03:22.840> doesn't<00:03:23.080> feel<00:03:23.380> like<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.860> would<00:03:24.070> really

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
just doesn't feel like that would really

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.460 
just doesn't feel like that would really
fit<00:03:24.970> well<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.600> whole<00:03:25.750> feeling<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.230> call<00:03:26.440> of

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
fit well to the whole feeling of call of

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.250 
fit well to the whole feeling of call of
duty<00:03:26.860> but<00:03:27.370> perhaps<00:03:27.760> something<00:03:28.239> let<00:03:28.780> out<00:03:28.959> add<00:03:29.230> a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
duty but perhaps something let out add a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.290 
duty but perhaps something let out add a
variety<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.220> game<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:31.030> would<00:03:31.090> actually

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
variety to the game that would actually

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.880 
variety to the game that would actually
make<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.720> lot<00:03:31.900> more<00:03:31.930> fun<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:32.560> for<00:03:32.860> instance

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
make it a lot more fun like for instance

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.280 
make it a lot more fun like for instance
like<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:34.000> hope<00:03:34.420> they<00:03:34.570> have<00:03:34.660> something<00:03:34.930> like

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
like I hope they have something like

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.960 
like I hope they have something like
different<00:03:35.770> game<00:03:36.010> modes<00:03:36.040> or<00:03:36.489> different<00:03:36.760> mods

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
different game modes or different mods

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.729 
different game modes or different mods
and<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.330> can<00:03:37.510> like<00:03:37.660> get<00:03:37.900> within<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.350> game<00:03:38.530> or

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
and you can like get within the game or

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.500 
and you can like get within the game or
download<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.580> would<00:03:39.730> allow<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.090> be<00:03:40.270> fun

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
download that would allow it to be fun

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.040 
download that would allow it to be fun
so<00:03:41.220> for<00:03:42.220> instance<00:03:42.280> halo<00:03:42.760> 3<00:03:43.150> had<00:03:43.420> infection

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
so for instance halo 3 had infection

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.730 
so for instance halo 3 had infection
which<00:03:44.410> was<00:03:44.620> originally<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:45.220> custom

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
which was originally a custom

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.620 
which was originally a custom
me<00:03:45.890> so<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.670> know<00:03:46.730> I'm<00:03:46.970> going<00:03:47.210> into<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> little

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
me so I know I'm going into a little

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.210 
me so I know I'm going into a little
history<00:03:47.930> nerd<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:48.380> street<00:03:48.590> here<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:49.100> was

history nerd in street here it was
originally<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> custom<00:03:50.270> game<00:03:50.480> then<00:03:51.020> people

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
originally a custom game then people

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.490 
originally a custom game then people
made<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.680> halo<00:03:52.010> 2<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.690> basically<00:03:53.690> after<00:03:54.260> that

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
made in halo 2 and basically after that

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.950 
made in halo 2 and basically after that
candle<00:03:55.430> 3<00:03:55.580> decided<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:56.000> take<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.390> make<00:03:56.420> its<00:03:56.870> own

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
candle 3 decided to take it make its own

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
game mode action of legitimize it and it

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.320 
game mode action of legitimize it and it
became<00:04:00.170> a<00:04:00.230> real<00:04:00.650> like<00:04:01.130> actual<00:04:01.700> thing<00:04:01.970> in<00:04:02.090> halo

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
became a real like actual thing in halo

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.750 
became a real like actual thing in halo
3<00:04:02.690> which<00:04:03.170> was<00:04:03.320> pretty<00:04:03.590> awesome<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.640> thing

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
3 which was pretty awesome and the thing

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.790 
3 which was pretty awesome and the thing
was<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.300> actually<00:04:05.750> stuck<00:04:06.020> around<00:04:06.140> if<00:04:06.470> he<00:04:06.500> was

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
was that actually stuck around if he was

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.190 
was that actually stuck around if he was
made<00:04:07.100> by<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.340> people<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:08.300> made<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.900> lot<00:04:08.930> more

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
made by the people it made it a lot more

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.660 
made by the people it made it a lot more
fun<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.920> eventually<00:04:10.250> he'll<00:04:10.400> look<00:04:10.520> through

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
fun and eventually he'll look through

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.610 
fun and eventually he'll look through
incorporated<00:04:11.240> into<00:04:11.420> fun<00:04:11.750> playlists<00:04:12.290> like<00:04:12.440> the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
incorporated into fun playlists like the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.170 
incorporated into fun playlists like the
living<00:04:13.010> dead<00:04:13.130> playlist<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.700> happened<00:04:14.120> like

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
living dead playlist that happened like

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.180 
living dead playlist that happened like
every<00:04:14.420> once<00:04:14.600> in<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.840> while<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.320> he<00:04:15.920> will<00:04:16.070> reach

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
every once in a while and he will reach

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.620 
every once in a while and he will reach
as<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.400> constant<00:04:16.910> Living<00:04:17.150> Dead<00:04:17.270> play<00:04:17.480> what's

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
as a constant Living Dead play what's

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.229 
as a constant Living Dead play what's
going<00:04:17.900> on<00:04:18.020> call<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:18.860> duty<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.280> feel<00:04:19.610> will<00:04:20.120> be

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
going on call a duty I feel will be

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.760 
going on call a duty I feel will be
successful<00:04:20.660> if<00:04:20.989> they<00:04:21.110> do<00:04:21.230> something<00:04:21.470> like

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
successful if they do something like

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.310 
successful if they do something like
that<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.730> four<00:04:22.940> system<00:04:23.330> will<00:04:23.450> fail<00:04:23.480> but<00:04:24.290> I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
that so the four system will fail but I

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.110 
that so the four system will fail but I
think<00:04:24.530> if<00:04:24.620> they<00:04:24.740> incorporate<00:04:25.340> custom<00:04:25.880> games

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
think if they incorporate custom games

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.730 
think if they incorporate custom games
things<00:04:26.480> that<00:04:26.630> people<00:04:26.930> made<00:04:27.140> up<00:04:27.320> into<00:04:27.620> their

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
things that people made up into their

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.350 
things that people made up into their
future<00:04:27.980> games<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.580> then<00:04:29.000> you're<00:04:29.090> looking<00:04:29.300> a

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
future games and then you're looking a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.240 
future games and then you're looking a
lot<00:04:29.600> more<00:04:29.660> successful<00:04:30.500> I'll<00:04:30.740> give<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.010> for

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
lot more successful I'll give you a for

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
instance like I'm not even suggesting

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.200 
instance like I'm not even suggesting
they<00:04:33.800> be<00:04:33.950> for<00:04:34.130> XP<00:04:34.490> we're<00:04:34.700> actually<00:04:34.790> be<00:04:35.060> for

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
they be for XP we're actually be for

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.060 
they be for XP we're actually be for
like<00:04:35.330> very<00:04:35.540> minimal<00:04:35.960> XP<00:04:36.290> but<00:04:36.530> just<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.920> know

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
like very minimal XP but just you know

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.340 
like very minimal XP but just you know
have<00:04:37.280> fun<00:04:37.580> maybe<00:04:38.330> they<00:04:38.600> can<00:04:38.780> add<00:04:38.990> in<00:04:39.140> Mike

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
have fun maybe they can add in Mike

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.900 
have fun maybe they can add in Mike
Myers<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.980> mean<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.220> wouldn't<00:04:40.460> be<00:04:40.550> impossible

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
Myers I mean it wouldn't be impossible

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.610 
Myers I mean it wouldn't be impossible
for<00:04:41.210> them<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.450> set<00:04:41.630> up<00:04:41.720> a<00:04:41.780> Mike<00:04:41.960> Myers<00:04:42.230> game

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
for them to set up a Mike Myers game

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.680 
for them to set up a Mike Myers game
mode<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.190> actually<00:04:43.640> work<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.090> sure<00:04:44.450> it

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
mode that actually work and sure it

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.570 
mode that actually work and sure it
probably<00:04:44.870> would<00:04:45.260> not<00:04:45.770> work<00:04:46.040> as<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:46.280> know<00:04:46.400> yet

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
probably would not work as you know yet

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.790 
probably would not work as you know yet
to<00:04:46.610> like<00:04:46.880> I<00:04:47.120> don't<00:04:47.600> even<00:04:47.750> know<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:47.990> guess<00:04:48.230> now

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
to like I don't even know I guess now

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.380 
to like I don't even know I guess now
what<00:04:49.100> some<00:04:49.310> who<00:04:49.400> plan<00:04:49.610> Mike<00:04:49.760> Myers<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.240> can

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
what some who plan Mike Myers you can

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.000

make<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.720> work<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.170> if<00:04:51.290> it<00:04:51.440> had<00:04:51.620> any<00:04:51.830> other

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
make it work and if it had any other

make it work and if it had any other
mechanics<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.610> were<00:04:52.820> within<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.210> game<00:04:53.420> they

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
mechanics that were within the game they

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.630 
mechanics that were within the game they
could<00:04:54.080> easily<00:04:54.290> mod<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.950> within<00:04:55.130> their<00:04:55.370> thing

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640

is now should have no trouble at all
doing<00:05:27.170> that<00:05:27.320> so<00:05:27.860> I<00:05:27.890> feel<00:05:28.190> like<00:05:28.370> even<00:05:28.670> if<00:05:28.850> they

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
doing that so I feel like even if they

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.790

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
have to do something as simple as that I

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.500 
have to do something as simple as that I
think<00:05:31.370> that'd<00:05:31.610> be<00:05:31.670> a<00:05:31.700> lot<00:05:31.940> more<00:05:32.000> fun<00:05:32.300> at<00:05:32.420> the

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
think that'd be a lot more fun at the
