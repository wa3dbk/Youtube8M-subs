00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.540 
think they played this on the MLG
circuit<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.290> bit<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.129> lot<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
circuit for a little bit I know a lot of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
circuit for a little bit I know a lot of
the<00:00:38.670> pro<00:00:38.850> hallo<00:00:39.239> guys<00:00:39.420> got<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.379> like

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the pro hallo guys got into it like

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.889 
the pro hallo guys got into it like
final<00:00:41.309> boss<00:00:41.460> had<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> team<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.270> walshy<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
final boss had a team with walshy and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.510 
final boss had a team with walshy and
all<00:00:42.960> them<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.890> played<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.399> little

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
all them and they played it for a little

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880 
all them and they played it for a little
while<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.660> big<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> minute<00:00:46.770> or

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
while and so it was big for a minute or

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
while and so it was big for a minute or
two<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.850> big<00:00:48.059> downfall<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:49.350> being

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
two but it's big downfall was being

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.049 
two but it's big downfall was being
online<00:00:50.190> only<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.340> there<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.460> no<00:00:53.640> single

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
online only so there was no single

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.340 
online only so there was no single
player<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.360> wasn't<00:00:54.629> something<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.110> pick

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
player it wasn't something you just pick

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
player it wasn't something you just pick
up<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.649> play<00:00:55.920> whenever<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.520> wanted<00:00:56.940> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
up and play whenever you wanted you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
up and play whenever you wanted you
needed<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> internet<00:00:57.989> blah<00:00:58.320> blah<00:00:58.469> blah<00:00:58.500> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
needed the internet blah blah blah you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
needed the internet blah blah blah you
know<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.809> cause<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> lot<00:01:01.289> of

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
know so I think that cause a lot of

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.470 
know so I think that cause a lot of
people<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.100> buy<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.850> sell<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
people to not buy it or sell it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.710 
people to not buy it or sell it
prematurely<00:01:04.489> but<00:01:05.489> being<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.360> favorite

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
prematurely but being one of my favorite

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.190 
prematurely but being one of my favorite
games<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.880> will<00:01:08.880> occasionally<00:01:09.450> put<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
games I will occasionally put it in and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.310 
games I will occasionally put it in and
it<00:01:10.320> gets<00:01:10.530> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> boring<00:01:10.890> uh<00:01:12.170> having<00:01:13.170> not

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it gets kind of boring uh having not

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.740 
it gets kind of boring uh having not
having<00:01:13.619> many<00:01:13.799> people<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.189> play<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.750> but

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
having many people to play it with but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.469 
having many people to play it with but
even<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> try<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.820> join<00:01:18.030> games<00:01:18.299> by

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
even so when I try and join games by

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.100 
even so when I try and join games by
myself<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.409> find<00:01:20.220> games<00:01:20.490> usually<00:01:21.110> faster

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
myself I I find games usually faster

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.670 
myself I I find games usually faster
than<00:01:22.920> cod<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:24.119> halo<00:01:24.630> or<00:01:25.110> something<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
than cod or halo or something like that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.609 
than cod or halo or something like that
like<00:01:26.490> any<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.060> those<00:01:27.240> current<00:01:28.140> games<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.560> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
like any of those current games and this

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.569 
like any of those current games and this
games<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.009> 56<00:01:29.700> years<00:01:30.119> old<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:31.579> obviously

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
games like 56 years old so obviously

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.920 
games like 56 years old so obviously
that<00:01:32.729> shows<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.000> how<00:01:33.030> dedicated<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.659> fan

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that shows you how dedicated the fan

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.260 
that shows you how dedicated the fan
bases<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.860> only<00:01:35.040> issue<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
bases the only issue with that is that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
bases the only issue with that is that
when<00:01:36.630> i<00:01:36.659> joined<00:01:36.780> by<00:01:37.140> myself<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.770> usually

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
been playing at this point which is kind

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.530 
been playing at this point which is kind
of<00:02:00.299> why<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.930> haven't<00:02:01.920> posted<00:02:02.670> many<00:02:03.119> videos

spells that I use during the game um
there's<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.250> ton<00:04:17.549> more<00:04:17.820> tech<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.930> weapons<00:04:19.530> and
