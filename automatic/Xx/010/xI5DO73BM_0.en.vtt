00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:17.380
 where is everyone now can not 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.310
 be there is someone here can not be 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.710
 going on I did not think he was going to save us 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 the ass seems there has been a change 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.310
 of plans 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.000
 or not 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.870
 all the worst 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.679
 i 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.880
 very good to all welcome to this 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:16.240
 new video is good as I look at the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.090
 start the video of this little 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.899
 tutorial will be about 10 points 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.780
 good first thing but say that in the 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.319
 page on our page but to leave 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.770
 when I say our say to my page in 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:38.370
 the decoration ball you can collaborate with 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.620
 tutorials and others 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.380
 I'm going to do this tutorial because 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.000
 root here or sending what would be the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.060
 delay download file is 2 and 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.880
 anything they have asked me maybe tutorial and I 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.350
 I do it well the first thing I've done 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.260
 been to take the file and upload it unless 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.400
 ok you do not have here a pack has been 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.050
 gigas and nothing to remember that will be of 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.260
 split you have to be also advertising 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.890
 that goes up right and not the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.610
 to download 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.740
 It will take you about 40 minutes if you have a 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.900
 fast internet of 20 or 15 and nothing now 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.180
 that we downloaded it we passed what would be 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.830
 the file to the desktop for me would be 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.920
 easier to handle 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.810
 and we distract him we have to with the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.290
 secondary and what we have in the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.290
 desk 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.650
 this folder is called like the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.910
 file we open and we will have the following 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.160
 this is what you have to do is give it 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.040
 the file called oil more 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.070
 we need double click and it looks like 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.170
 what would this window be 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.340
 in this window as well put low 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.360
 pressure or a key 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.390
 let's go for example inside and this 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.920
 installer will already start what it would be in 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:17.010
 Algiers alone can minimize it 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.680
 while installing has more 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.350
 I recommend those left open or 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.670
 it will take a few minutes at the most 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.690
 and hey he lets us have a fast camera 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.690
 so you can see not 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.280
 good guys we are going here in the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:50.240
 installation because we have what 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.860
 that accept the role of accounts and 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.319
 open what would be the micro installer 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.319
 they are direct when we do not accept what 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.359
 would be the contract we give to next 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.530
 and we hope that it will be installed in what 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.550
 it would be this 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.800
 [Music] 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.640
 with it takes three seconds very long 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.600
 slow and I guess 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.000
 today 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.489
 your point will now continue what will be the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.550
 installation of the file 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.680
 well as you have seen it is over 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.030
 here we press anyone to 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.380
 continue inside and now we have what 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.430
 that would be states 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.710
 to play to play would be of order 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.710
 aesthetic noval among others the launcher 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.710
 6-3 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.440
 and that would be this 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.740
 and nothing we are going to verify that they crossed 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.740
 the games 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.490
 well guys this is what would be the 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.680
 game 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.880
 it's me in the past that would be the first 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.509
 phase nothing I hope you like the game 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.030
 that rather much zombies 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:12.069
 and fight a little we'll see each other in the 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.250
 next video by denying me in the 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.669
 comments what you think and nothing 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.669
 until next time 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.060
