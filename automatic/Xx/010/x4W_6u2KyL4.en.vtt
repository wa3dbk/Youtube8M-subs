the<00:00:05.720> next<00:00:06.720> thing<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.050> just<00:00:07.080> want<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.410> look<00:00:07.500> at

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the next thing I just want to look at

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.560 
the next thing I just want to look at
this<00:00:07.770> transformations<00:00:08.760> on<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.090> complex

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
this transformations on the complex

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.530 
this transformations on the complex
plane<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.250> sound<00:00:11.610> awfully<00:00:12.330> tough

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
plane and this can sound awfully tough

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.570 
plane and this can sound awfully tough
and<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.809> think<00:00:13.019> oh<00:00:13.230> I'm<00:00:13.950> not<00:00:14.010> up<00:00:14.250> for<00:00:14.280> this

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and you think oh I'm not up for this

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.280 
and you think oh I'm not up for this
this<00:00:14.760> must<00:00:15.269> be<00:00:15.420> something<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.840> do<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.020> honors

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
this must be something to do with honors

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.230 
this must be something to do with honors
Matson<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.860> has<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.340> hasn't<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:18.029> also

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
Matson in it has and it hasn't it's also

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.420 
Matson in it has and it hasn't it's also
just<00:00:18.570> very<00:00:18.810> simple<00:00:19.590> comes<00:00:19.860> after<00:00:20.130> juniors

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
just very simple comes after juniors

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.729 
just very simple comes after juniors
here<00:00:20.550> as<00:00:20.670> well<00:00:20.849> to<00:00:21.210> find<00:00:21.419> the<00:00:21.540> image<00:00:21.750> where<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:22.739 
here as well to find the image where it

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.589 
here as well to find the image where it
goes<00:00:22.950> to<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> complex<00:00:23.880> number<00:00:24.000> under<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
goes to of a complex number under a

goes to of a complex number under a
given<00:00:24.810> transformation<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.770> do<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.009> following

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
given transformation we do the following

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.450 
given transformation we do the following
write<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.270> complex<00:00:27.599> number<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:27.989> a<00:00:28.050> point<00:00:28.460> with

write the complex number as a point with

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.549 
write the complex number as a point with
the<00:00:29.579> real<00:00:29.730> part<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.239> us<00:00:30.270> so<00:00:30.509> your<00:00:30.660> 5<00:00:30.899> minus<00:00:31.290> 4<00:00:31.529> I

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
the real part for us so your 5 minus 4 I

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.819 
the real part for us so your 5 minus 4 I
5<00:00:32.369> comma<00:00:32.790> minus<00:00:33.180> 4<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.320> minus<00:00:34.680> 2

5 comma minus 4 and if you have minus 2
plus<00:00:35.070> 3i<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.790> minus<00:00:36.149> 2<00:00:36.329> comma<00:00:36.719> 3

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
plus 3i then it's minus 2 comma 3

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.680 
plus 3i then it's minus 2 comma 3
perform<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> transformation<00:00:38.730> whatever<00:00:39.510> that

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
point is a complex number so if you have

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400 
point is a complex number so if you have
minus<00:00:47.219> 1<00:00:47.370> 6<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.730> an<00:00:47.820> answer<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.570> minus<00:00:49.019> 1<00:00:49.170> plus

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
minus 1 6 is an answer it's minus 1 plus

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.799 
minus 1 6 is an answer it's minus 1 plus
6i<00:00:49.859> and<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.460> you've<00:00:50.579> 0<00:00:50.820> 2<00:00:51.089> is<00:00:51.179> an<00:00:51.300> answer<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
6i and if you've 0 2 is an answer it's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.500 
6i and if you've 0 2 is an answer it's
just<00:00:51.929> 0<00:00:52.379> plus<00:00:52.679> 2i<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.089> seems<00:00:54.269> like<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
just 0 plus 2i now this seems like a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.660 
just 0 plus 2i now this seems like a
quite<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.929> mouthful<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.649> let<00:00:55.800> me<00:00:55.980> try

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
quite a mouthful there but let me try

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.389 
quite a mouthful there but let me try
and<00:00:56.730> illustrate<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.629> with<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:58.019> example<00:00:58.399> find

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and illustrate it with an example find

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
and illustrate it with an example find

symmetry<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> origin<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.830> 3

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
symmetry in the origin now there is 3

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.360 
symmetry in the origin now there is 3
plus<00:01:05.370> 2i<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.990> might<00:01:07.200> say<00:01:07.409> 3<00:01:07.770> comma<00:01:08.070> 2

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
plus 2i there or you might say 3 comma 2

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.319 
plus 2i there or you might say 3 comma 2
and<00:01:09.110> when<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.259> see<00:01:10.500> central<00:01:11.070> symmetry<00:01:11.579> I<00:01:11.729> say

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
and when you see central symmetry I say

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.929 
and when you see central symmetry I say
I<00:01:12.540> prefer<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.040> word<00:01:14.220> reflection<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:15.200> EF<00:01:16.579> l<00:01:17.579> ec

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
I prefer the word reflection or EF l ec

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.770 
I prefer the word reflection or EF l ec
t<00:01:18.829> io<00:01:19.829> n<00:01:20.189> reflection<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.509> other<00:01:21.630> words

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
t io n reflection so in other words

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.100 
t io n reflection so in other words
where<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.170> image<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.600> origin

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
where is the image of that so the origin

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
where is the image of that so the origin
is<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.560> mirror<00:01:25.829> in<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.159> case<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.640> there's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
is the mirror in this case and there's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.109 
is the mirror in this case and there's
the<00:01:27.000> 3/2<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.990> come<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the 3/2 you come down there and out the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.539 
the 3/2 you come down there and out the
far<00:01:30.299> side<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.930> same<00:01:31.170> amount<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
far side the same amount and this is a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
far side the same amount and this is a
transformation<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.840> find<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.350> this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
transformation and I find if I do this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.630 
transformation and I find if I do this
in<00:01:34.649> class<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.100> people<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.460> paying

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
in class and people are really paying

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
in class and people are really paying
attention<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:36.060> say<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
attention they say is that it and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.109 
attention they say is that it and
they're<00:01:37.289> disappointed<00:01:37.500> almost<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.789> go<00:01:38.909> say

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
they're disappointed almost then go say

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
they're disappointed almost then go say
yes<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:40.049> transformation<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:40.979> when

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
yes that's it a transformation is when

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
yes that's it a transformation is when
you<00:01:41.189> move<00:01:41.399> something<00:01:41.430> great<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:43.289> I<00:01:43.530> have

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you move something great so all I have

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
you move something great so all I have
to<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:45.090> draw<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> Argand<00:01:45.719> diagram

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to do then is to draw the Argand diagram

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.770 
to do then is to draw the Argand diagram
of<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.500> three<00:01:46.740> plus<00:01:47.009> two<00:01:47.039> is<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.909> there's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
of it so three plus two is here there's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.539 
of it so three plus two is here there's
the<00:01:48.990> origin<00:01:49.350> go<00:01:49.619> right<00:01:49.859> through<00:01:50.039> the<00:01:50.219> origin

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the origin go right through the origin

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.130 
the origin go right through the origin
and<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> far<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.570> there<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and out the far side to there and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.830 
and out the far side to there and
there's<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> answer<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.119> image<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.630> 3

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
there's the answer so the image of 3

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.490 
there's the answer so the image of 3
plus<00:01:55.109> 2i<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.850> minus<00:01:56.850> 3<00:01:57.119> minus<00:01:57.390> 2i<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.409> is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
plus 2i is minus 3 minus 2i there it is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.310 
plus 2i is minus 3 minus 2i there it is
there<00:01:58.680> notice<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.759> distance<00:02:00.030> from<00:02:00.450> 3<00:02:00.719> plus<00:02:01.049> 2i

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there notice the distance from 3 plus 2i

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.039 
there notice the distance from 3 plus 2i
the<00:02:01.500> distance<00:02:02.159> from<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:03.049> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the distance from there to there that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.349 
the distance from there to there that
distance<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.609> same<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.179> distance

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
distance is the same as the distance

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.990 
distance is the same as the distance
from<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.109> origin<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:09.860> here<00:02:10.860> sorry<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.820> seems

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
from the origin to here sorry it seems

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.980 
from the origin to here sorry it seems
this<00:02:12.210> one<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:13.290> here

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
this one this one here

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.460 
this one this one here
that<00:02:14.680> distance<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:17.080> same<00:02:17.230> as<00:02:17.290> that

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that distance is the same as that

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.010 
that distance is the same as that
distance<00:02:17.680> so<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:18.970> very<00:02:19.180> very<00:02:19.390> easy<00:02:19.510> if

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
distance so it's very very easy if

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.810 
distance so it's very very easy if
you're<00:02:20.260> somebody<00:02:20.920> who's<00:02:21.160> willing<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.610> draw

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
you're somebody who's willing to draw

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.610 
you're somebody who's willing to draw
the<00:02:21.880> picture<00:02:22.270> edge<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:23.730> find<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.940> image<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.620> -2

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the picture edge be find the image of -2

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
in an exam look at this nigga I've

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.530 
in an exam look at this nigga I've

and<00:02:41.290> that's<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.500> pity<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.950> real<00:02:42.070> axis<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.610> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
one that was the x-axis originally so

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.720 
one that was the x-axis originally so
there's<00:02:45.760> minus<00:02:46.240> 2<00:02:46.450> plus<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.580> whereas<00:02:48.580> it's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
there's minus 2 plus I and whereas it's

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
image if the real axis here is a mirror

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.860 
image if the real axis here is a mirror
and<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.550> look<00:02:51.850> through<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.570> just<00:02:52.750> out

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
and you look through and you just out

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.500 
and you look through and you just out
the<00:02:53.020> far<00:02:53.200> side<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.680> here<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.940> image<00:02:55.330> of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
the far side to here so the image of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.190 
the far side to here so the image of
minus<00:02:55.930> 2<00:02:56.170> plus<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.710> is<00:02:57.010> minus<00:02:57.550> 2<00:02:57.910> minus<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.510> so

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
minus 2 plus I is minus 2 minus I so

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.560 
minus 2 plus I is minus 2 minus I so
minus<00:02:59.500> 2<00:02:59.620> plus<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.040> by<00:03:00.310> reflection<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.390> real

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.960 
minus 2 plus I by reflection in the real
axis<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.560> same<00:03:02.770> as<00:03:02.950> axial<00:03:03.400> symmetry<00:03:03.580> in

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
axis is the same as axial symmetry in

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.550 
axis is the same as axial symmetry in
the<00:03:04.060> real<00:03:04.180> axis<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.020> gives<00:03:05.200> us<00:03:05.320> an<00:03:05.470> image

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
the real axis and it gives us an image

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.720 
the real axis and it gives us an image
of<00:03:05.770> minus<00:03:06.100> 2<00:03:06.280> minus<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.060> again<00:03:07.420> we<00:03:08.140> notice

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
of minus 2 minus I and again we notice

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.180 
of minus 2 minus I and again we notice
that<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> distance<00:03:10.390> from<00:03:10.600> there<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:12.010> there

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
that the distance from there to there

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.210 
that the distance from there to there
that<00:03:12.460> green<00:03:13.180> piece<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:14.380> same<00:03:14.590> as<00:03:14.800> this

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
that green piece is the same as this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.520 
that green piece is the same as this
Hopf<00:03:15.550> here<00:03:16.650> okay<00:03:17.880> last<00:03:18.880> one<00:03:19.200> find<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.350> image

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
Hopf here okay last one find the image

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.460 
Hopf here okay last one find the image
of<00:03:20.860> 1<00:03:21.100> minus<00:03:21.580> 4<00:03:21.910> by<00:03:22.150> axial<00:03:22.660> symmetry<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.350> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
of 1 minus 4 by axial symmetry in the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.590 
of 1 minus 4 by axial symmetry in the
imaginary<00:03:23.950> axis<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.360> another

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
imaginary axis so it's another

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.660 
imaginary axis so it's another
transformation<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:27.100> these<00:03:27.220> are<00:03:27.370> just<00:03:27.460> three

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
transformation so these are just three

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.310 
transformation so these are just three
very<00:03:27.970> easy<00:03:28.180> transformations<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:28.990> we<00:03:29.140> have

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
very easy transformations that we have

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.900 
very easy transformations that we have
there's<00:03:29.890> 1<00:03:30.820> minus<00:03:31.450> 4i<00:03:31.720> there<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:33.310> here<00:03:33.760> is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
there's 1 minus 4i there this here is

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.300 
there's 1 minus 4i there this here is
the<00:03:34.120> imaginary<00:03:34.690> axis<00:03:34.900> it's<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:35.920> name<00:03:36.100> but

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
the imaginary axis it's the name but

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.250 
the imaginary axis it's the name but
there<00:03:36.550> so<00:03:37.240> you're<00:03:37.390> going<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.600> come<00:03:37.780> true<00:03:37.960> and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
there so you're going to come true and

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.170 
there so you're going to come true and
at<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.530> far<00:03:38.710> side<00:03:38.740> and<00:03:39.520> what<00:03:39.670> we<00:03:39.790> need<00:03:40.000> to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
at the far side and what we need to

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.300 
at the far side and what we need to
remember<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:41.230> distance<00:03:41.740> from<00:03:41.890> there<00:03:42.100> to

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
remember is the distance from there to

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.880 
remember is the distance from there to
there<00:03:42.490> is<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.960> same<00:03:44.170> as<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.500> distance<00:03:44.650> from

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
there is the same as the distance from

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.610 
there is the same as the distance from
there<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.340> there<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:46.570> if<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:46.840> one's<00:03:47.050> 1<00:03:47.230> minus

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
there to there so if this one's 1 minus

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.650 
there to there so if this one's 1 minus
4i<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.490> one<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.760> minus<00:03:49.090> 1<00:03:49.240> minus<00:03:49.420> 4i<00:03:50.370> same

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
4i this one is minus 1 minus 4i same

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.770 
4i this one is minus 1 minus 4i same

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
did one of these before this looks awful

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.800 
did one of these before this looks awful
and<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.340> looks<00:04:15.580> awful<00:04:15.760> but<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:16.420> incredibly

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
and it looks awful but it's incredibly

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.110 
and it looks awful but it's incredibly
simple<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:18.190> what<00:04:18.370> do<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:18.580> do<00:04:18.760> well<00:04:18.940> here's

6<00:04:24.610> minus<00:04:24.760> 5i<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.960> AI<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.530> just<00:04:26.890> left<00:04:27.100> sitting

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
6 minus 5i the AI is just left sitting

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.780 
6 minus 5i the AI is just left sitting
there<00:04:27.550> for<00:04:27.669> the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
there for the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.910 
there for the
and<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.450> be<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.110> see<00:04:29.290> what<00:04:29.440> happens

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
and the to be and we see what happens

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.670 
and the to be and we see what happens
next<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.850> if<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.180> get<00:04:31.240> rid<00:04:31.510> of<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.660> then<00:04:32.470> I've

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
next so if I get rid of that then I've

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680 
next so if I get rid of that then I've
read<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.980> question<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.850> I<00:04:33.940> really<00:04:33.970> am<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.480> bit

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
read the question and I really am a bit

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.400 
read the question and I really am a bit
confused

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
confused

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.520 
confused
so<00:04:35.950> you<00:04:36.010> plus<00:04:36.550> AI<00:04:36.790> is<00:04:37.270> equal<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.570> 2b<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.380> I'm

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
so you plus AI is equal to 2b so I'm

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.030 
so you plus AI is equal to 2b so I'm
replacing<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:39.250> u<00:04:39.490> by<00:04:40.360> 6<00:04:40.660> minus<00:04:40.870> 5i<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.830> there<00:04:42.010> I

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
replacing the u by 6 minus 5i so there I

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.900 
replacing the u by 6 minus 5i so there I
have<00:04:42.280> 6<00:04:42.730> minus<00:04:43.150> 5<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.530> plus<00:04:44.530> AI<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:45.040> equal<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.670> 2b

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
have 6 minus 5 I plus AI is equal to 2b

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.660 
have 6 minus 5 I plus AI is equal to 2b
so<00:04:46.450> what<00:04:46.630> have<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:46.810> done<00:04:46.840> I've<00:04:47.170> just<00:04:47.680> put<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.430> U

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
so what have I done I've just put the U

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.390 
so what have I done I've just put the U
in<00:04:48.910> there<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:50.380> gets<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.830> 3<00:04:51.070> marks

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
in there and that gets you the 3 marks

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.310 
in there and that gets you the 3 marks
in<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.640> exam<00:04:51.670> that's<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.300> attempt<00:04:52.750> that's<00:04:53.020> a

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
in the exam that's the attempt that's a

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.150 
in the exam that's the attempt that's a
good<00:04:53.710> move

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
good move

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.640 
good move
now<00:04:54.550> these<00:04:55.420> questions<00:04:55.960> are<00:04:56.080> very<00:04:56.230> confusing

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
now these questions are very confusing

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.590 
now these questions are very confusing
for<00:04:56.800> students<00:04:57.250> but<00:04:57.430> for<00:04:57.580> me<00:04:57.730> say<00:04:58.360> two<00:04:58.420> people

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
for students but for me say two people

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.690 
for students but for me say two people
are<00:04:58.810> as<00:04:58.900> easy<00:04:59.050> as<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.290> Sesame<00:04:59.740> Street<00:04:59.770> program

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
are as easy as a Sesame Street program

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.500 
are as easy as a Sesame Street program
where<00:05:01.180> Bert<00:05:02.010> collects<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.460> numbers<00:05:04.330> if

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
where Bert collects the I numbers if

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
where Bert collects the I numbers if
you're<00:05:04.660> familiar<00:05:04.780> with<00:05:04.960> Sesame<00:05:05.350> Street

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
you're familiar with Sesame Street

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.290 
you're familiar with Sesame Street
you'll<00:05:05.680> know<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.430> characters<00:05:06.850> if<00:05:07.000> not<00:05:07.180> it

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
you'll know the characters if not it

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
you'll know the characters if not it
doesn't<00:05:07.420> really<00:05:07.570> matter<00:05:07.780> than<00:05:08.020> just<00:05:08.200> two

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
doesn't really matter than just two

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.710 
doesn't really matter than just two
people<00:05:08.500> well<00:05:09.280> as<00:05:09.490> far<00:05:09.700> as<00:05:09.790> people<00:05:10.450> is<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:10.570> bit

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
people well as far as people is a bit

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.320 
people well as far as people is a bit
strong<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.200> term<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.190> two<00:05:12.730> guys<00:05:12.910> who<00:05:13.090> hang

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
strong a term of the two guys who hang

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.080 
strong a term of the two guys who hang
out<00:05:13.450> on<00:05:13.660> Sesame<00:05:14.020> Street<00:05:14.230> so<00:05:14.380> Bert<00:05:14.890> says<00:05:15.460> the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
out on Sesame Street so Bert says the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.660 
out on Sesame Street so Bert says the
real<00:05:16.390> parts<00:05:16.960> are<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.800> bits<00:05:17.980> that<00:05:18.070> I<00:05:18.250> collect

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
real parts are the bits that I collect

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.990 
real parts are the bits that I collect
so<00:05:19.030> Bert<00:05:19.300> collects<00:05:19.960> real<00:05:20.440> bits<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:21.370> Bert<00:05:21.640> will

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
so Bert collects real bits so Bert will

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.180 
so Bert collects real bits so Bert will
collect<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.480> six

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
collect the six

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.210 
collect the six
he<00:05:24.190> won't<00:05:24.490> collect<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.090> minus<00:05:25.450> 5i<00:05:26.220> because

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
he won't collect the minus 5i because

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.550 
he won't collect the minus 5i because
it's<00:05:27.640> not<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:27.820> real<00:05:27.880> part<00:05:28.390> he<00:05:28.870> won't<00:05:29.110> collect

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
it's not a real part he won't collect

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.270 
it's not a real part he won't collect
the<00:05:29.890> AI<00:05:30.100> because<00:05:30.880> it's<00:05:31.210> not<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.110> real<00:05:33.040> part

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
the AI because it's not a real part

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.790 
the AI because it's not a real part
either<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:33.700> equal<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.420> 2b<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:35.080> Bert<00:05:35.320> will<00:05:35.560> come

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
either is equal to 2b so Bert will come

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.860 
either is equal to 2b so Bert will come
up<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.520> collect<00:05:36.910> six<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:37.420> in<00:05:37.480> connect<00:05:37.780> the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
up you collect six and in connect the

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.450 
up you collect six and in connect the
two<00:05:38.050> be<00:05:38.260> you<00:05:38.560> won't<00:05:38.770> collect<00:05:38.950> anything<00:05:39.220> else

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
two be you won't collect anything else

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.120 
two be you won't collect anything else
so<00:05:40.090> Bert<00:05:40.630> will<00:05:40.870> tell<00:05:41.050> me<00:05:41.230> that<00:05:41.350> 6<00:05:41.650> is<00:05:41.830> equal<00:05:41.860> to

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
so Bert will tell me that 6 is equal to

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.710 
so Bert will tell me that 6 is equal to
2<00:05:42.370> B<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:43.150> B<00:05:43.330> is<00:05:43.540> equal<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:43.930> 3<00:05:45.240> later<00:05:46.240> on<00:05:46.450> in<00:05:46.660> the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
2 B so B is equal to 3 later on in the

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.130 
2 B so B is equal to 3 later on in the
program
