behind but he wasn't and for example if

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:22.860 
behind but he wasn't and for example if
the<00:03:14.920> dog<00:03:15.099> was<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.430> school<00:03:21.450> when<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.629> kid

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
the dog was in a school when that kid

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.680 
the dog was in a school when that kid
goes<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.440> new<00:03:23.620> school<00:03:27.150> they're<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:28.389> even

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
goes to the new school they're not even

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.149 
goes to the new school they're not even
though<00:03:28.810> they're<00:03:28.989> into<00:03:29.260> eighth<00:03:29.439> grade<00:03:29.799> or<00:03:30.069> in

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
though they're into eighth grade or in

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.589 
though they're into eighth grade or in
the<00:03:30.280> 12th<00:03:30.639> grade<00:03:30.670> they<00:03:31.030> should<00:03:31.239> really<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.569> a

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
the 12th grade they should really be a

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.509 
the 12th grade they should really be a
freshman<00:03:32.170> because<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.950> level<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.430> education

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
freshman because the level of education

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.780 
freshman because the level of education
is<00:03:34.150> higher<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.750> as<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.319> result<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:36.010> child<00:03:36.370> is

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
is higher and as a result the child is

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.910 
is higher and as a result the child is
not<00:03:37.090> where<00:03:37.389> it<00:03:37.629> needs<00:03:37.659> to<00:03:37.959> be<00:03:38.079> you<00:03:38.709> know<00:03:38.799> what

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
not where it needs to be you know what

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.920 
not where it needs to be you know what
I'm<00:03:39.010> saying<00:03:39.250> right<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:39.879> as<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.480> result<00:03:40.659> they

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
I'm saying right and so as a result they

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.259 
I'm saying right and so as a result they
can't<00:03:41.170> participate<00:03:41.409> in<00:03:42.159> obviously<00:03:42.790> higher

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
can't participate in obviously higher

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.240 
can't participate in obviously higher
learning<00:03:43.569> type<00:03:43.930> situations<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.709> that's<00:03:45.069> what

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
learning type situations and that's what

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.369 
learning type situations and that's what
happened<00:03:45.549> with<00:03:45.609> your<00:03:45.790> dog<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.329> so<00:03:46.810> what<00:03:47.290> we

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
to work with his dog so more people if

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.680 
to work with his dog so more people if

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
haven't really publish the videos and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.069 
haven't really publish the videos and
one<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.150> reasons<00:03:55.449> we<00:03:55.569> haven't<00:03:55.690> publish

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
one of the reasons we haven't publish

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.659 
one of the reasons we haven't publish
the<00:03:56.169> videos<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.250> technique

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
the videos is because of the technique

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.729
