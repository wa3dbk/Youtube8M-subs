00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
tend to breathe fire and smoke they

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.150 
tend to breathe fire and smoke they
should<00:00:52.340> be<00:00:52.520> approached<00:00:52.940> with<00:00:53.149> caution<00:00:54.160> if

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
should be approached with caution if

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.010 
should be approached with caution if
they<00:00:55.550> are<00:00:55.700> approached<00:00:56.180> at<00:00:56.539> all<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:58.879> start<00:00:59.840> a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
they are approached at all so I start a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.990 
they are approached at all so I start a
polite<00:01:00.760> conversation<00:01:01.760> hi<00:01:02.660> dragon<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.759> see<00:01:04.759> that

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
his name is elephant Ming but i think it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.500 
his name is elephant Ming but i think it

make<00:01:48.799> reference<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.759> dragon's<00:01:50.420> breath<00:01:51.100> that

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
make reference to a dragon's breath that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.359 
make reference to a dragon's breath that
may<00:01:52.520> tempt<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.420> dragon<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.140> demonstrate<00:01:54.920> more

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
may tempt the dragon to demonstrate more

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.950 
may tempt the dragon to demonstrate more
about<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.329> breath<00:01:56.659> then<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.799> wish<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.430> learn

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
about the breath then you wish to learn

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.859 
about the breath then you wish to learn
so<00:01:59.960> I<00:01:59.990> asked<00:02:00.409> him<00:02:00.649> if<00:02:00.829> he<00:02:00.979> can<00:02:01.159> fly<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:02.600> don't

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
so I asked him if he can fly you don't

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.100 
so I asked him if he can fly you don't
need<00:02:03.079> wings<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.649> fly<00:02:03.979> here<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:04.759> he<00:02:05.659> takes<00:02:05.840> right

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
need wings to fly here so he takes right

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.560 
need wings to fly here so he takes right
off<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.250> think<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.640> get<00:02:07.909> three<00:02:08.299> points

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
off and I think I get three points

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.800 
off and I think I get three points
therefore<00:02:09.850> dragon<00:02:10.850> diplomacy<00:02:11.829> he<00:02:12.829> does<00:02:13.160> an

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
therefore dragon diplomacy he does an

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.430 
therefore dragon diplomacy he does an

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.940 

gives<00:02:20.440> us<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.710> few<00:02:20.860> passes<00:02:21.370> around<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.950> boxcars

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
gives us a few passes around the boxcars

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.300 
gives us a few passes around the boxcars
I<00:02:25.020> get<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.140> impression<00:02:26.290> though<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.130> he's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
I get the impression though that he's

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.790 
I get the impression though that he's
not<00:02:27.520> really<00:02:27.850> one<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.750> your<00:02:29.050> high<00:02:29.290> flying

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
not really one of your high flying

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.710 
not really one of your high flying
dragons<00:02:31.440> he<00:02:32.440> doesn't<00:02:32.830> mind<00:02:33.010> flying<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.720> he

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
dragons he doesn't mind flying but he

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.720 
dragons he doesn't mind flying but he
doesn't<00:02:35.260> really<00:02:35.470> seem<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> put<00:02:36.220> his<00:02:36.430> whole

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
doesn't really seem to put his whole

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.320 
doesn't really seem to put his whole
heart<00:02:37.150> into<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.920> he<00:02:39.130> wanders<00:02:39.820> around<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
heart into it so he wanders around the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.550 
heart into it so he wanders around the
village<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.750> little<00:02:41.020> bit<00:02:41.170> smoking<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.250> lot<00:02:43.560> still

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
village a little bit smoking a lot still

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160 
village a little bit smoking a lot still
not<00:02:44.740> breathing<00:02:44.950> any<00:02:45.370> fire<00:02:45.690> which<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.870> suppose

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
not breathing any fire which I suppose

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.940 
not breathing any fire which I suppose
is<00:02:47.230> just<00:02:47.710> as<00:02:47.890> well<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.870> he<00:02:50.260> doesn't<00:02:50.650> really

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
is just as well but he doesn't really

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.330 
is just as well but he doesn't really
want<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.460> stay<00:02:51.870> flying<00:02:52.870> very<00:02:53.260> long<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.160> he

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
want to stay flying very long so he

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.700 
want to stay flying very long so he
settles<00:02:54.760> in<00:02:54.970> pretty<00:02:55.240> soon<00:02:56.070> by<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.510> fire<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.870> I

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
settles in pretty soon by the fire and I

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.730 
settles in pretty soon by the fire and I
