00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 in this last stretch of the campaign to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.890
 councilmen is a pleasure for us 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.019
 present 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.850
 the support and the statement that they have taken 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:14.440
 of the more than 50 artists of the city 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.900
 in a letter that states statement in 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.660
 support for the candidatures of artists 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.400
 front of left and workers 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.140
 it seems very important to us 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.689
 these to those who understand that the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.519
 culture is a good for the set of 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.220
 the population and not for a few 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.160
 me as a candidate for councilor in this 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.340
 front as well as it raises almost the 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.500
 we are really sorry 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.950
 proud of this accompaniment 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.390
 this accompaniment is the demonstration 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.370
 in some sense of the discomfort that there is 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.980
 in a sector of the artists in large 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.950
 part of the artists that we see the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.340
 abandonment by governments 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.520
 current of both the province and the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.640
 municipality and this is why since 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.340
 our independent associations 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.010
 we've been fighting side by side for a 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.509
 series of rights particularly in 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.220
 health to this this fight front that does not 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.160
 does more than continue with the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.810
 construction than as associations of 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.710
 artistic fact we are taking 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.500
 forward in neuquén 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.290
 we find this tremendously positive 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.380
 and extremely encouraged by what 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.690
 we consider a triumph that the fight 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.950
 of zanon workers like I was not going to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.140
 impact that being the the most action 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.180
 progressive in recent times to the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.160
 that we have attended with character 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.650
 artistic this is how artists do not 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.800
 today we will also be joining in 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.300
 a clear fight front with a sheet 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.220
 strong claim and be 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.470
 rejecting cultural policy to both 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.000
 municipal level as provincial that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.670
 so far he has carried forward and 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.390
 who govern 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.840
 estos chicos los veo con mucha fuerza 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.330
 As Raul said, I've known you for 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.989
 many years in the struggles of the workers 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.940
 from zanon I accompanied them as a company 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.280
 zanon workers I am Neuquén and 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.130
 Really 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.330
 and the only party that has summoned me 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.510
 has been this game the experience that 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.700
 we have we can move it and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.610
 support who wants to do things 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.680
 well the question of culture in the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 province of Neuquén and in the city of 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.050
 neuquén in which I live many years ago 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.239
 this has been one government after another with 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:55.450
 some achievements and with some mistakes 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:58.769
 tremendous I think once and for all 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.080
 culture has to be an issue that 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.870
 provoke a general call with the 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:10.599
 consensus of all residents of neuquén 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.970
 culture and art 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.300
 this is another thing to say I'm like 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.780
 artist in this case the culture should be 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.750
 in this province and in this city a 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.989
 great debate in which ideas 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.140
 ideologies have to be made clear 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.090
 and as long as this is not done they will be followed 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.959
 putting patches will continue to act 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.450
 about the context or the occasions and 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:43.120
 problems of the conjunctural conjuncture and 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.840
 I 'm really looking forward to that great 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.420
 debate with the whole population and here they 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.480
 I put my shoulder to them because I see them 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.030
 a lot of strength and I repeat again 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.030
 because they have always summoned us
