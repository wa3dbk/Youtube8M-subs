00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.110
 hello friends of the medium dynamic channel 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.470
 let's see how to unlock the samsung 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.290
 galaxy s2 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.270
 when I unlock it I mean 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.970
 make it operational completely for 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.390
 any operator is to say unlock 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.640
 the sim or what is commonly called 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.040
 free the good mobile this normally 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.840
 they usually charge for doing it but 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.930
 now we have a very good application 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.730
 who does it for free 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.350
 good to check if it really is 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.050
 blocked we do not have to mark this 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.700
 code that you put up here you see it in the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.830
 phone and then we will know if our 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.960
 terminal is blocked or not 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.600
 our operator right now I have 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.379
 installed or put my card 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.350
 telephone operator is worth it but if I 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.550
 introduce another operator for example 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.230
 are you from movistar if you have one of 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.820
 vodafone then it would not work would put me 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.070
 which is blocked good to know 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.480
 without having to put a card I have 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.879
 what to dial is the number you put here 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.920
 up then I put an asterisk 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:13.250
 pad 7 4 6 5 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.250
 625 pad and then here 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.770
 it puts network lock on that is to say it is 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.960
 blocked that means that if I 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.450
 put a card that is not the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 operator with whom I am working 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.539
 this terminal was not going to work well 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.539
 Well let's see how to unlock it 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.180
 first of all we have to enter the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 market and download a program that 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.580
 it's called galaxy s a lock 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.250
 we can download it for free 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.250
 in galaxy s and love 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.120
 once we already have that program 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.150
 installed 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.110
 we execute it 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.310
 and up here in the first tab 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.360
 we have to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.360
 with the pad 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 we have to give the first option 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.480
 step 1 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.150
 the step to 1 what it does is that it makes a 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.890
 copy of our efe folder is a 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.569
 system folder where they are saved 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.680
 all the data of our terminal 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.060
 among them the email then apart from 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.370
 that we are going to release also we 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.250
 It serves as a backup in case 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.200
 some day we lose that email or we 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.430
 It spoils our phone and does not pick up the email 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.129
 it would be a way of with this same 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.439
 program do a restoration in the 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:46.000
 last option you see that it puts restore the 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.980
 fs folder with the fs folder 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.450
 that is the folder that contains all the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.240
 data from our terminal only 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.920
 our terminal 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.910
 well then let's make a copy 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.660
 then it puts save the folder fs it 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.660
 we say yes 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.890
 as I had done before 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.940
 tells me that if I want to overwrite the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.940
 fs folder 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.980
 the first time you do it 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.490
 Anyone this is not going to tell us 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.270
 well now let's go to the second step step 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.430
 step 2 would be the unlocking if you 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.010
 we give here without a lock and then we 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.129
 ask if a blog we say yes 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.560
 good here you have to be a little eye 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.030
 watch because the mobile is going to 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.879
 look like this with a black screen 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.010
 for quite some time do not think that 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.230
 will block or that will have any 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.960
 problem I did not turn it off jce do not restart it 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.880
 it's because this is normal 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.260
 to me the first time I did it took me 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.670
 approximately one minute 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.200
 and other times that I have done it has 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.470
 slowed down but do not despair 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.239
 You will also see that he loses coverage 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.640
 you see that the operator's coverage of 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.909
 phone has lost it is worth it here as 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.110
 that is without mobile coverage i what 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.579
 what I do is so that I do not get paid 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.379
 I'm touching it from time to time 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.640
 already if the screen does not turn off like this 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.500
 will turn off the screen that you give the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.440
 turned on again is the program 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.629
 is still running but please do not 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.209
 turn it off is because you only pay it 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.030
 cancel the process and we can load 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.919
 the terminal is worth we already have coverage what 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.490
 we see again with which the thing is 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.490
 working 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.099
 already has 3g already connected too 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.099
 we see it 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.560
 I repeat is a black screen 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.930
 completely worth it and here at the end we 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.480
 It has been good it has been fast this time 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.820
 It says that if the signal is working it is 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.770
 say if we have phone signal not the 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.169
 3g but of the telephone the one that puts here the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.150
 bars 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.889
 we have to go to step 3 if not 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.409
 we had a signal 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.090
 ok if this galaxy application does not come out 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.970
 he does not answer we tell him to wait 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.590
 in what what he said if we get this 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.810
 phone signal we have signal from 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.760
 telephony we went directly to the step to 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.760
 3 what would this be 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.800
 the one to create back files 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.210
 if we did not have a telephone signal it is 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.220
 say that these bars appeared to us 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.810
 as if not in the symbol that has 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.730
 left before then we reset the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.650
 terminal and we re - open this 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.240
 program and we directly execute the 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.830
 step 3 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.520
 good as yes we have a signal because I 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.300
 directly I go to step 3 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.669
 we say yes 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.409
 ok you have already created it correctly and 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.300
 accept vale 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.699
 if we once do this 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.909
 process is already released from another if a 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.169
 Once we do this process we want 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.909
 unblock it is to free it 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.830
 Well, for example, because we have to 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.169
 Take it to the cetera guarantee etc. 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.620
 we would have to execute the last option 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.780
 what is to restore fs folder 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.430
 restoring that we would have it again 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.199
 blocked exactly like the 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.889
 principle and we could take it to 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.889
 technical service 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.849
 this system is completely reversible 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.419
 well let's check if this terminal 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.039
 now it is blocked or it is not blocked 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:21.100
 asterisk 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:24.840
 7 46 56 25 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.370
 Well, we already have it unlocked 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.500
 network property 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:34.470
 Well nothing has already released the mobile 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.470
 to use it with the company that we want 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.100
 tell you what to do this process 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.990
 we have to be root but if we have to 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.900
 have rooteado the end if not not us 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.460
 will let you do this process if you want 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.080
 see how to root I have other videos 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.580
 which leaves how to root the good 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.840
 friends, I hope it was from 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.840
 utility and until the next video
