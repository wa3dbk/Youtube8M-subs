have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.890> cook<00:00:41.070> filling<00:00:41.430> or<00:00:41.579> raw<00:00:41.879> filling<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
have a cook filling or raw filling the

traditional filling is actually usually

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.190 
traditional filling is actually usually
cooked<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> mixture<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> shredded

cabbage and carrots cooked and then

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
cabbage and carrots cooked and then
drained<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.260> reason<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.649> cook<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> ahead<00:00:50.070> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
drained the reason you cook it ahead of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
drained the reason you cook it ahead of
time<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.180> expel<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.539> moisture<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.260> when

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
time is to expel that moisture so when

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.830 
time is to expel that moisture so when
they<00:00:52.440> fry<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:52.949> don't<00:00:53.129> boil<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.699> important<00:00:54.420> or

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
they fry they don't boil up important or

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560 
they fry they don't boil up important or
get<00:00:55.440> soft<00:00:55.739> another<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.329> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
get soft another thing you can do that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
get soft another thing you can do that
I've<00:00:57.780> done<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.050> success<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.920> use<00:00:59.250> lower

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
I've done with success is use lower

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.029 
I've done with success is use lower
moisture<00:00:59.930> ingredients<00:01:00.930> slice<00:01:01.590> them<00:01:01.829> thinly

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
moisture ingredients slice them thinly

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
moisture ingredients slice them thinly
toss<00:01:02.940> them<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.180> some<00:01:03.300> starch<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
toss them with some starch and so as it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
toss them with some starch and so as it
cooks<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.220> binds<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> liquid<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
cooks it actually binds that liquid so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.060 
cooks it actually binds that liquid so
the<00:01:06.240> shredded<00:01:06.720> filling<00:01:07.080> rolls<00:01:07.830> really

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the shredded filling rolls really

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
the shredded filling rolls really
compactly<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.360> works<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:09.960> well

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
compactly and that works out really well

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.420 
compactly and that works out really well
so<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.409> want<00:01:10.650> everything<00:01:10.979> very<00:01:11.130> fine

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so you want everything very fine

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.120 
so you want everything very fine
julienne<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.450> shredded<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.860> use

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
julienne or just shredded you can use

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
julienne or just shredded you can use
larger<00:01:14.640> pieces<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.540> bit<00:01:15.659> more

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
larger pieces just a little bit more

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.210 
larger pieces just a little bit more
technique<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> rolling<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.009> quite

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
technique in rolling but it's quite

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.289 
technique in rolling but it's quite
simple<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.939> show<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.119> a

Southwestern egg roll with grilled
chicken<00:01:20.000> roasted<00:01:21.000> peppers<00:01:21.420> avocado<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.650> long

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
chicken roasted peppers avocado so long

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.410 
chicken roasted peppers avocado so long
for<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.400> things<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.119> why<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.390> we

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
for all these things so why don't we

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840 
for all these things so why don't we
start<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> classic<00:01:25.610> portioning<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
start with the classic portioning is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
start with the classic portioning is
important<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.840> there's<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> few<00:01:28.619> things<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
important so there's a few things that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.219 
important so there's a few things that
you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.850> use<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.420> measuring<00:01:30.930> cup

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you can do you can use a measuring cup

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.230 
you can do you can use a measuring cup
and<00:01:31.409> about<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> half<00:01:32.159> cup<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.790> works<00:01:33.000> out

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and about a half cup or so works out

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 
and about a half cup or so works out
well<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.470> weigh<00:01:34.829> them<00:01:35.130> right<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
well you can weigh them right and have a

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
well you can weigh them right and have a
few<00:01:36.180> ounces<00:01:36.329> two<00:01:36.840> three<00:01:37.170> four<00:01:37.409> ounces

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
few ounces two three four ounces

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.530 
few ounces two three four ounces
depending<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.549> density<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> filling

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
depending on the density of the filling

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.520 
depending on the density of the filling
but<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.560> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.610> consistent

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
but you want to do that consistent

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.719 
but you want to do that consistent
consistent<00:01:43.530> portions<00:01:43.950> important<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.549> also

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
consistent portions important but also

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.060 
consistent portions important but also
consistent<00:01:45.540> size<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> find<00:01:46.740> works<00:01:46.950> best

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
consistent size what I find works best

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
consistent size what I find works best
is<00:01:47.430> putting<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> couple<00:01:47.880> pieces<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.390> tape<00:01:48.659> on

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is putting a couple pieces of tape on

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.510 
is putting a couple pieces of tape on
the<00:01:48.960> board<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:50.040> use<00:01:50.750> previously<00:01:51.750> rolled

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the board I will use previously rolled

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.340 
the board I will use previously rolled
egg<00:01:53.520> roll<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.299> tape<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:55.490> then<00:01:56.490> another<00:01:56.790> one

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
egg roll the tape down then another one

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
egg roll the tape down then another one
showing<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> length<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> roll<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:00.149> I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
showing the length so as I roll them I

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.170 
showing the length so as I roll them I
have<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> guy<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.829> put<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.880> will

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
have a guy and I put it down here I will

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.209 
have a guy and I put it down here I will
put<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> point<00:02:03.869> facing<00:02:04.110> upwards<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.950> it's

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
put the point facing upwards if it's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.950 
put the point facing upwards if it's
ripped<00:02:05.490> or<00:02:05.700> something<00:02:06.090> no<00:02:06.479> worries

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
ripped or something no worries

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.350 
ripped or something no worries
just<00:02:07.140> put<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> towards<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> bottom<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:09.090> for

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
just put it towards the bottom then for

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.839 
just put it towards the bottom then for
my<00:02:09.479> filling<00:02:09.780> I'll<00:02:10.349> take<00:02:11.190> about<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.520> half<00:02:11.819> cup

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
my filling I'll take about a half cup

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.790 
my filling I'll take about a half cup
and<00:02:12.750> I'm<00:02:12.870> going<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.110> use<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.440> cab

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
and I'm going to use the cab

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.920 
and I'm going to use the cab
one<00:02:14.040> here<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:16.500> goes<00:02:16.740> at<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> bottom<00:02:20.510> now<00:02:21.510> we

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
one here that goes at the bottom now we

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.140 
one here that goes at the bottom now we
want<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.380> tight<00:02:22.740> for<00:02:23.400> two<00:02:23.610> reasons<00:02:24.090> one

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
want this tight for two reasons one

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.000 
want this tight for two reasons one
there's<00:02:24.660> nothing<00:02:24.960> like<00:02:25.080> biting<00:02:25.380> into<00:02:25.650> an<00:02:25.860> egg

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
there's nothing like biting into an egg

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.890 
there's nothing like biting into an egg
roll<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.250> having<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.910> gap<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.540> there<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
roll and having this gap in there it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600 
roll and having this gap in there it
just<00:02:28.140> feels<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.460> missing

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
just feels like you know it's missing

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.910 
just feels like you know it's missing
something<00:02:30.090> number<00:02:30.510> two<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:31.110> there's<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.620> lot<00:02:31.770> of

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
something number two if there's a lot of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
something number two if there's a lot of
air<00:02:32.160> they<00:02:32.370> will<00:02:32.520> float<00:02:32.850> more<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.420> you'll

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
air they will float more then you'll

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.060 
air they will float more then you'll
have<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.840> stir<00:02:34.080> them<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:34.470> you're<00:02:34.620> cooking<00:02:34.920> them

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
have to stir them as you're cooking them

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.360 
have to stir them as you're cooking them
so<00:02:35.700> I'll<00:02:35.790> compress<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.450> mixture<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.960> start

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
so I'll compress this mixture to start

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.470 
so I'll compress this mixture to start
before<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.610> even<00:02:38.850> roll<00:02:41.030> then<00:02:42.030> what<00:02:42.240> I'm<00:02:42.360> gonna

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
before I even roll then what I'm gonna

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.480 
before I even roll then what I'm gonna
do<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.990> will<00:02:43.290> pull<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.680> over<00:02:46.070> pull<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.100> back<00:02:47.460> so

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
do I will pull this over pull it back so

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.320 
do I will pull this over pull it back so
it's<00:02:47.910> taut<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.990> it's<00:02:49.140> tight<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.860> then<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:51.000> I'm

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
it's taut so it's tight and then as I'm

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420 
it's taut so it's tight and then as I'm
rolling<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.230> want<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> keep<00:02:52.710> pushing<00:02:53.100> it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
rolling it I want to keep pushing it

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.100 
rolling it I want to keep pushing it
tighter<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.330> tighter<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.870> I'll<00:02:54.930> roll<00:02:55.550> and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
tighter and tighter so I'll roll and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.080 
tighter and tighter so I'll roll and
once<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.260> get<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.830> point<00:02:59.160> where<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.760> have

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
once I get to this point where I have

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.900 
once I get to this point where I have
these<00:03:00.300> edges<00:03:00.630> are<00:03:01.230> level<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.580> what<00:03:02.790> I'm

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
these edges are level then what I'm

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.790 
these edges are level then what I'm
going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.240> is<00:03:03.390> lift<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.230> fold<00:03:04.560> it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
going to do is lift this up and fold it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000 
going to do is lift this up and fold it
over<00:03:05.060> lift<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.270> side<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.840> fold<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.350> over<00:03:07.440> now

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
over lift this side and fold it over now

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.120 
over lift this side and fold it over now
what's<00:03:08.250> important<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:10.110> unfolding<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.890> to

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
what's important is and unfolding it to

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.500 
what's important is and unfolding it to
the<00:03:11.220> length<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.700> tape<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.060> course<00:03:12.300> that's

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
the length of the tape of course that's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.750 
the length of the tape of course that's
why<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> put<00:03:12.900> those<00:03:13.020> guides<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.760> what's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
why I put those guides there what's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.460 
why I put those guides there what's
important<00:03:15.240> is<00:03:15.360> when<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.540> fold<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.320> this

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
important is when I fold this that this

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.040 
important is when I fold this that this
edge<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.950> straight<00:03:17.220> or<00:03:17.580> slightly<00:03:17.940> inward<00:03:18.570> if

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
edge is straight or slightly inward if

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.170 
edge is straight or slightly inward if
it's<00:03:19.350> facing<00:03:19.739> outwards<00:03:20.220> when<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.430> fold<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.000> it's

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
it's facing outwards when I fold it it's

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.120 
it's facing outwards when I fold it it's
gonna<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.690> odd<00:03:21.930> piece<00:03:22.380> protruding<00:03:23.040> so

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
gonna have this odd piece protruding so

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.820 
gonna have this odd piece protruding so
I<00:03:23.160> don't<00:03:23.370> want<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.790> want<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.090> straight<00:03:24.420> as

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
I don't want that I want it straight as

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.949 
I don't want that I want it straight as
well<00:03:25.830> I'm<00:03:26.190> gonna<00:03:26.520> take<00:03:26.820> an<00:03:27.000> egg<00:03:27.239> wash<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
well I'm gonna take an egg wash the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.880 
well I'm gonna take an egg wash the
pastry<00:03:28.410> brush<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.330> brush<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.540> top<00:03:30.750> egg<00:03:31.530> wash

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
pastry brush and brush the top egg wash

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.300 
pastry brush and brush the top egg wash
works<00:03:32.190> best<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.760> seals<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.600> tight<00:03:34.310> then

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
works best it seals it really tight then

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.610 
works best it seals it really tight then
I'm<00:03:35.459> gonna<00:03:35.610> roll<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.780> keep<00:03:37.080> making<00:03:37.530> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
I'm gonna roll it and keep making it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.210 
I'm gonna roll it and keep making it
taut<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:42.180> egg<00:03:42.900> roll<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.709> wrapped<00:03:43.980> it's

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
taut so there egg roll it's wrapped it's

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.280 
taut so there egg roll it's wrapped it's
rounded<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> edges<00:03:44.940> it's<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.110> right

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
rounded on the edges it's the right

little<00:04:06.540> bit<00:04:06.660> more<00:04:06.780> strategic<00:04:07.290> how<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.440> lay<00:04:07.709> them

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
little bit more strategic how I lay them

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.890 
little bit more strategic how I lay them
down<00:04:08.130> they<00:04:08.640> need<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.910> be<00:04:09.000> long<00:04:09.209> strips<00:04:09.660> I'll

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
down they need to be long strips I'll

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.960 
down they need to be long strips I'll
start<00:04:10.410> with<00:04:10.500> one<00:04:10.739> piece<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:10.980> chicken<00:04:11.340> long

start with one piece of chicken long
strips<00:04:12.330> are<00:04:12.480> better<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:12.900> each<00:04:13.110> bite<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.560> get

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
strips are better so each bite you get
