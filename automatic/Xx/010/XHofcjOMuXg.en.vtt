into the clam stock that we just sauteed

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.330 
into the clam stock that we just sauteed
and<00:03:47.349> we're<00:03:47.470> going<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.650> let<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:47.979> cook<00:03:48.280> for

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
and we're going to let this cook for

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.080 
and we're going to let this cook for
about<00:03:48.669> five<00:03:49.060> minutes<00:03:49.329> on<00:03:49.659> medium<00:03:50.049> high<00:03:50.470> heat

about five minutes on medium high heat

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.869 
about five minutes on medium high heat
and<00:03:52.090> then<00:03:52.780> we<00:03:53.019> add<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.680> already<00:03:54.519> have<00:03:54.760> it

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
and then we add I already have it

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.149 
and then we add I already have it
measured<00:03:55.239> out<00:03:55.359> we<00:03:55.900> out<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.079> few<00:03:56.319> tablespoons<00:03:56.739> of

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
measured out we out a few tablespoons of

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.670 
measured out we out a few tablespoons of
flour<00:03:57.400> as<00:03:57.970> well<00:03:58.299> as<00:03:58.510> freshly<00:03:59.019> chopped<00:03:59.379> parsley

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680

and salt and pepper right in here and

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.750 
and salt and pepper right in here and
that<00:04:02.379> will<00:04:02.500> help<00:04:02.620> thicken<00:04:03.010> up<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.310> broth

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
that will help thicken up the broth

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.210 
that will help thicken up the broth
without<00:04:04.599> adding<00:04:04.959> too<00:04:04.989> much<00:04:05.319> fat<00:04:05.650> because<00:04:05.949> this

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
without adding too much fat because this

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.129 
without adding too much fat because this
is<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.400> cream-based<00:04:06.819> soup<00:04:07.540> but<00:04:07.689> we<00:04:07.810> don't<00:04:07.989> want

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
is a cream-based soup but we don't want

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.800 
is a cream-based soup but we don't want
to<00:04:08.199> add<00:04:08.319> so<00:04:08.709> much<00:04:08.979> cream<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.579> thicken<00:04:09.849> it<00:04:10.060> but

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
to add so much cream to thicken it but

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.780 
to add so much cream to thicken it but
the<00:04:10.930> flower<00:04:11.199> does<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.530> really<00:04:11.739> nice<00:04:11.979> job<00:04:12.040> so

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
the flower does a really nice job so

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.119 
the flower does a really nice job so
it'll<00:04:13.569> take<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.989> few<00:04:14.049> minutes<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.949> actually

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
it'll take a few minutes to actually

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.210 
it'll take a few minutes to actually
thicken<00:04:15.939> and<00:04:16.209> then<00:04:16.989> after<00:04:17.380> five<00:04:17.680> minutes<00:04:17.949> if

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
thicken and then after five minutes if

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.460 
thicken and then after five minutes if
it's<00:04:18.370> still<00:04:18.699> too<00:04:18.970> thin<00:04:19.389> for<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.109> can<00:04:20.259> add

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
it's still too thin for you you can add

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.249 
it's still too thin for you you can add
1<00:04:20.799> tablespoon<00:04:21.459> flour<00:04:21.669> at<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.030> time<00:04:22.330> till<00:04:23.169> it

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
1 tablespoon flour at a time till it

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.040 
1 tablespoon flour at a time till it
gets<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.710> right<00:04:23.860> thickness<00:04:24.250> so<00:04:25.240> now<00:04:25.509> we

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
gets to the right thickness so now we

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.409 
gets to the right thickness so now we
are<00:04:26.080> going<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.830> chop<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.520> clams<00:04:27.820> we're<00:04:28.300> going
