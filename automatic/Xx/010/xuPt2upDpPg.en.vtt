00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
positive it has a nice edge so you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.920 
positive it has a nice edge so you
usually<00:02:22.320> take<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.130> by<00:02:23.459> crimping<00:02:24.030> which<00:02:24.600> means

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
usually take it by crimping which means

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.199 
usually take it by crimping which means
like<00:02:25.200> your<00:02:25.410> knuckles<00:02:25.860> go<00:02:26.130> up<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.580> here<00:02:27.180> it

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
like your knuckles go up and here it

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.650 
like your knuckles go up and here it
goes<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.820> hand<00:02:30.150> hold<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.630> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
goes like this this this hand hold is a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.759 
goes like this this this hand hold is a
pinch<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.390> not<00:02:33.600> as<00:02:33.780> Tiny<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.410> crimp

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
pinch so it it is not as Tiny as a crimp

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.920 
pinch so it it is not as Tiny as a crimp
and<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.700> hold<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.930> by<00:02:37.080> pinching<00:02:37.700> or<00:02:38.930> this

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and you hold it just by pinching or this

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.400 
and you hold it just by pinching or this
could<00:02:40.320> be<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:40.769> example<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.430> sloper<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.230> a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
could be for example a sloper so it's a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.979 
could be for example a sloper so it's a
large<00:02:43.709> hold<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:44.700> very<00:02:45.120> very<00:02:45.660> nasty

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
large hold but it's very very nasty

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.620 
large hold but it's very very nasty
because<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.799> very<00:02:47.040> open<00:02:47.580> it's<00:02:47.820> very<00:02:48.060> rounded

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
because it's very open it's very rounded

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.020 
because it's very open it's very rounded
and<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.799> use<00:02:49.980> totally<00:02:50.670> different

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
and you have to use totally different

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.000 
and you have to use totally different
force<00:02:51.330> than<00:02:51.720> holding<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.440> crimp<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:54.890> would<00:02:55.890> say

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
force than holding a crimp I would say

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.850 
force than holding a crimp I would say
it's<00:02:56.160> very<00:02:56.390> important<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.690> be<00:02:57.959> able<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
it's very important to be able to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.880 
it's very important to be able to
imagine<00:02:59.489> yourself<00:03:00.239> climbing<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.350> boulder

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
imagine yourself climbing a boulder

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.020 
imagine yourself climbing a boulder
beforehand<00:03:02.989> because<00:03:03.989> my<00:03:04.920> technique<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.730> to

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
beforehand because my technique is to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.350 
beforehand because my technique is to
really<00:03:06.380> try<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.410> imagine<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.310> if<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.880> always

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
really try to imagine as if I always

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.420 
really try to imagine as if I always
already<00:03:09.600> climbing<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.769> then<00:03:11.190> when<00:03:11.400> I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
already climbing on it and then when I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.430 
already climbing on it and then when I
get<00:03:11.820> on<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> wall<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.720> doesn't<00:03:13.200> feel<00:03:13.380> like

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
get on the wall it doesn't feel like

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.069 
get on the wall it doesn't feel like
first<00:03:13.890> go<00:03:14.160> anymore<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.850> feels<00:03:15.299> like<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.810> had

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
first go anymore it feels like I had

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.390 
first go anymore it feels like I had
already<00:03:16.320> climbed<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.980> route<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:19.400> workout

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
already climbed the route I workout

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.140 
already climbed the route I workout
every<00:03:21.150> move<00:03:21.540> out<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.959> my<00:03:22.500> forte<00:03:23.010> move<00:03:23.430> circuit

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
every move out of my forte move circuit

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.680 
every move out of my forte move circuit
and<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:25.290> have<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.070> go<00:03:26.250> through<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.730> route<00:03:26.940> maybe

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
and I have to go through the route maybe

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.720 
and I have to go through the route maybe
two<00:03:28.140> or<00:03:28.290> three<00:03:28.320> times<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:29.489> sure

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
two or three times to be really sure

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.360 
two or three times to be really sure
that<00:03:29.760> I've<00:03:30.120> got<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.660> my<00:03:30.870> mind<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.530> as<00:03:32.280> I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
that I've got it in my mind and as I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.310 
that I've got it in my mind and as I
started<00:03:32.670> climbing<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.390> really<00:03:33.660> focus<00:03:33.900> only

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
started climbing I can really focus only

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.470 
started climbing I can really focus only
on<00:03:34.650> climbing

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
on climbing

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.730 
on climbing
it's<00:03:36.480> kind<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.840> challenge<00:03:37.200> sometimes<00:03:37.410> to

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
it's kind of a challenge sometimes to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.620 
it's kind of a challenge sometimes to
memorize<00:03:38.250> everything<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:39.120> with<00:03:39.450> more

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
memorize everything but with more

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.110 
memorize everything but with more
practice<00:03:40.110> it's<00:03:40.350> not<00:03:40.470> such<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> big<00:03:41.250> deal<00:03:41.310> really

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.960 

in<00:03:45.800> bouldering<00:03:46.800> competitions<00:03:47.490> there<00:03:47.850> are

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
in bouldering competitions there are

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.500 
in bouldering competitions there are
four<00:03:48.380> problems<00:03:49.380> each<00:03:49.800> round<00:03:50.250> ranking<00:03:51.240> is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
four problems each round ranking is

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.920 
four problems each round ranking is
decided<00:03:52.470> upon<00:03:52.760> how<00:03:53.760> many<00:03:53.820> Boulder<00:03:54.450> problems

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
decided upon how many Boulder problems

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.510 
decided upon how many Boulder problems
you<00:03:55.410> did<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.030> how<00:03:57.030> many<00:03:57.270> attempts<00:03:58.250> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.430> are

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
you did and how many attempts if you are

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.610 
you did and how many attempts if you are
not<00:03:59.730> precise<00:04:00.240> enough<00:04:00.270> while<00:04:00.990> climbing<00:04:01.440> past

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
not precise enough while climbing past

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.220 
not precise enough while climbing past
you<00:04:02.070> can<00:04:02.280> easily<00:04:02.580> make<00:04:03.180> some<00:04:03.420> mistake<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.080> can

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
you can easily make some mistake you can

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.770 
you can easily make some mistake you can
slip<00:04:04.620> or<00:04:05.010> something<00:04:05.460> like<00:04:05.580> this<00:04:05.790> very

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
slip or something like this very

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.449 
slip or something like this very
important<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.790> combination<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.690> being

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
important is the combination of being

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:20.289 
important is the combination of being
precise<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.959> fast

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.800 

that<00:04:21.139> is<00:04:21.289> something<00:04:21.650> that<00:04:21.709> is<00:04:21.979> very<00:04:22.509> very<00:04:23.509> hard

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
that is something that is very very hard

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.839 
that is something that is very very hard
it's<00:04:24.110> either<00:04:24.349> one<00:04:24.650> one<00:04:25.099> side<00:04:25.370> or<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.669> other

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
it's either one one side or the other

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.360 
it's either one one side or the other
one<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.449> it's<00:04:27.080> very<00:04:27.470> hard<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.919> find<00:04:28.159> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
one and it's very hard to find the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.730 
one and it's very hard to find the
balance<00:04:28.520> I<00:04:31.509> just<00:04:32.509> said<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> goal<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.349> a<00:04:33.470> work

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
balance I just said a goal and a work

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.670 
balance I just said a goal and a work
hard<00:04:34.129> in<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.639> gym<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:35.330> train<00:04:35.629> and<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.289> finally

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
hard in the gym to train and I finally

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.129 
hard in the gym to train and I finally
when<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.490> go<00:04:37.729> out<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.240> competition<00:04:38.599> if

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
when I go out of the competition if

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.230 
when I go out of the competition if
everything<00:04:39.889> happens<00:04:40.039> it's<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.759> so

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
everything happens it's just so

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.419 
everything happens it's just so
beautiful
