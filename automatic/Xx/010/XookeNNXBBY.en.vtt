Valley<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.430> let<00:01:36.610> people<00:01:36.880> try<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.180> as<00:01:37.300> well

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
Valley so we let people try that as well

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.859 
Valley so we let people try that as well
time<00:01:38.650> superiority<00:01:39.460> what's<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.330> basics<00:01:40.720> of

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
time superiority what's the basics of

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.430 
time superiority what's the basics of
the<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.710> mode<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:43.330> mode<00:01:43.600> intended<00:01:44.229> to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
the of that mode it's mode intended to

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.870 
the of that mode it's mode intended to
kind<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.770> capture<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.190> feeling<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.550> a<00:01:45.640> tank

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
kind of capture the feeling of a tank

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.060 
kind of capture the feeling of a tank
battle<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.540> you<00:01:46.600> basically<00:01:46.960> take<00:01:47.320> part<00:01:47.619> in<00:01:47.830> a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
battle so you basically take part in a

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.490 
battle so you basically take part in a
tampy<00:01:48.400> tune<00:01:48.660> going<00:01:49.660> it<00:01:49.780> going<00:01:50.140> up<00:01:50.260> against

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
tampy tune going it going up against

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.840 
tampy tune going it going up against
another<00:01:50.560> time<00:01:50.920> between<00:01:51.039> trying<00:01:51.399> to<00:01:51.490> fight<00:01:51.670> for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
another time between trying to fight for

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.219 
another time between trying to fight for
control<00:01:51.940> over<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.420> central<00:01:52.810> point<00:01:52.960> on<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.200> map

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
control over a central point on the map

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.290 
control over a central point on the map
so<00:01:53.950> we'll<00:01:54.070> have<00:01:54.130> lots<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.460> tank<00:01:54.670> on<00:01:54.910> tank

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
so we'll have lots of tank on tank

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.870 
so we'll have lots of tank on tank
action<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.220> one<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.460> things<00:01:57.490> with<00:01:57.789> the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
action and one of the things with the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.210 
action and one of the things with the
mode<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.270> tanks<00:01:58.509> were<00:01:58.600> actually<00:01:58.810> respawn

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
mode is that tanks were actually respawn

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.990 
mode is that tanks were actually respawn
basically<00:02:00.220> instantly<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.670> base<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:00.970> we

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
basically instantly in the base so we

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.609 
basically instantly in the base so we
have<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.210> constant<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.840> know<00:02:01.960> availability<00:02:02.530> of

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.800 
you can play any way you want I mean you
can<00:02:18.370> run<00:02:18.700> around<00:02:18.819> as<00:02:19.030> an<00:02:19.120> infantry<00:02:19.450> laying<00:02:19.660> out

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
can run around as an infantry laying out

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.510 
can run around as an infantry laying out
minefields<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.680> using<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.069> rocky<00:02:21.250> knowledge

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
minefields and using a rocky knowledge

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.790 
minefields and using a rocky knowledge
and<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.090> that's<00:02:22.390> still<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.600> possibility

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
and so on so that's still a possibility

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.559 
and so on so that's still a possibility
absolutely<00:02:23.910> obviously<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.360> sort<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
absolutely obviously that that sort of

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.809 
absolutely obviously that that sort of
feels<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.680> DNA<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.100> battlefields<00:02:27.760> are

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
feels like the DNA of battlefields are

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.700 
feels like the DNA of battlefields are
not<00:02:28.180> locked<00:02:28.450> players<00:02:28.720> into<00:02:29.080> tanks<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.560> just

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
not locked players into tanks and just

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.290 
not locked players into tanks and just
have<00:02:29.890> sort<00:02:30.460> of<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.610> tank<00:02:30.850> mode<00:02:31.120> like<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.600> but

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
have sort of a tank mode like that but

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.520 
have sort of a tank mode like that but
you<00:02:34.300> are<00:02:34.480> doing<00:02:34.690> something<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.170> little<00:02:35.319> bit

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
you are doing something a little bit

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.900 
you are doing something a little bit
different<00:02:35.830> with<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.040> do<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.610> fact<00:02:36.819> that
