squeeze them by hand so once I got these
onions<00:02:00.909> soften<00:02:01.270> just<00:02:01.719> a<00:02:01.840> little<00:02:02.079> bit

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650

we're<00:02:03.160> going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.340> go<00:02:03.460> ahead<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.940> add<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
we're going to go ahead and I add the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.880 
we're going to go ahead and I add the
garlic<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:05.140> know<00:02:05.230> you<00:02:05.290> can't<00:02:05.590> make<00:02:05.710> any

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890

tomato<00:02:06.250> sauce<00:02:06.550> without<00:02:06.790> garlic<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.390> think

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
tomato sauce without garlic I think

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.490
