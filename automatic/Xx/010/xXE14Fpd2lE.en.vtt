00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 of low level energy then how 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.030
 Christian headquarters are spent and the one below 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 to get started 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.459
 in this it is done by taking four tables 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.590
 oak for example appears with those of 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.710
 the other tables also works but 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.009
 waths up 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.009
 amounts 3 koppers 3 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.080
 copper 2 copper cables and 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.419
 we have the first one how is the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.540
 second the second is taking cable from 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.400
 gold for 2 the block machin perfect as 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.470
 the third is done by taking a 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.910
 electronic circuit a transformer 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.699
 medium that we have done before and one in that 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.000
 crystal and these x 4 cables that like 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.829
 they are made are made to saw you have to 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.949
 take the first refined iron and we 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.900
 it will come out this is the crafter we take 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.260
 this we put a router behind and we 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.059
 will come out the insulated protected cable will 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.059
 we put another place behind and we get 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.260
 the cable for two does not come out this is the 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.420
 fiddling and this is the result you 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.340
 we put another one behind fret the result 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.670
 we already have the four already we can 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.880
 make our 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.259
 perfect high voltage transformer 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.509
 guys having this we can already ride 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.780
 our nuclear reactor and it 's so simple 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.939
 ride is here as is the cable going 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.310
 to do is a quick example I'll 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.280
 ride one here will not not ride you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.080
 I'm going to teach in the town that I have 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 fed was a reactor 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.979
 I have the nuclear reactor this hole that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.799
 you see here was a nuclear reactor is of 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.590
 proof that I have had feeding everything 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.180
 this town this whole town each 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.240
 each house tells him to have a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.080
 compressor or a macerated or something a 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.090
 couple of things maybe 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.090
 and I made a few channels below ground 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.850
 passing all the wiring as you can see 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.799
 so all the houses have a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 an oven for example to ones the energy 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.650
 because he is disconnected and all 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.590
 they worked so you can feed 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.770
 quietly a whole town of agreement 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.720
 then how it is done is easy having 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.720
 all the elements we just need 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.299
 and here is going to have 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.299
 the key pieces 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.980
 and that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.709
 we make the nuclear reactor 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.750
 the nuclear reactor 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.410
 the reactor chamber 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:47.530
 he has gone crazy 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.530
 and we put it like that if we put the uranium 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.110
 the double 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.999
 here is not worth that one 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.999
 and we put it on 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.910
 so perfect and we just have to pass the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.740
 wired with the first the transformer 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.010
 great that is first of all 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.390
 we need the elec kellen that is the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.910
 capacitor would be to pass a cable 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.890
 and connect it but this dot has to 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.440
 go connected to where the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.940
 energy of agreement guys then 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.940
 we put fat cable 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.740
 fat cable 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.740
 because you come out of the nuclear reactor 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.610
 today is not going slow we think 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.959
 all right 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.599
 perfect we keep going here now 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.879
 we have our warehouse we follow 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.769
 Passing table and what we have to do 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.440
 is to put the big transformer with 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.010
 these three little dots looking for you to 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.799
 you for where the energy comes we pass 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.930
 middle cable middle medium 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:07.640
 of two and we put him 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.920
 the average transformer we pass cable 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.430
 medium by the dots here same in the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.430
 three dots
