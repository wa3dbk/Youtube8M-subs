however it is written wonderfully it has

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.720 
however it is written wonderfully it has
some<00:03:05.790> adult<00:03:06.060> themes<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.750> if<00:03:07.020> you're<00:03:07.860> not<00:03:08.070> 18<00:03:08.550> or

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
all however this one caught my eye the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.990 
all however this one caught my eye the
most<00:03:18.690> because<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.650> Adolf<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.130> Wunderland<00:03:20.820> I

most because it is Adolf in Wunderland I
love<00:03:21.270> everything<00:03:21.840> alice<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.590> wonderland

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
love everything alice in wonderland

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.000 
love everything alice in wonderland
alice<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.700> wonderland<00:03:23.730> themes<00:03:24.360> are

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
alice and wonderland themes are

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.200 
alice and wonderland themes are
absolutely<00:03:26.010> wonderful<00:03:26.160> whenever<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.940> see<00:03:27.180> a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
absolutely wonderful whenever I see a

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.400 
absolutely wonderful whenever I see a
different<00:03:27.540> rendition<00:03:27.960> of<00:03:28.050> Alice<00:03:28.320> in

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
different rendition of Alice in

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.110 
different rendition of Alice in
Wonderland<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.010> automatically<00:03:29.670> want<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:29.970> pick

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
Wonderland I automatically want to pick

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.690 
Wonderland I automatically want to pick
it<00:03:30.210> up<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.470> was<00:03:31.860> very<00:03:32.010> interesting<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.670> me

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
it up so this was very interesting to me

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.840 
it up so this was very interesting to me
because<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:33.090> lot<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> characters<00:03:33.840> were

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
because a lot of the characters were

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.980 
because a lot of the characters were
relatable<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.090> characters<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.570> Alice<00:03:36.900> in

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
relatable to the characters in Alice in

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.560 
relatable to the characters in Alice in
Wonderland<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.740> had<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> plot<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.670> had<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> climax

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
Wonderland it had a plot it had a climax

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.450 
Wonderland it had a plot it had a climax
it<00:03:39.750> has<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> resolution<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.890> that's<00:03:41.040> more<00:03:41.340> than

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
it has a resolution and that's more than

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.160 
it has a resolution and that's more than
I<00:03:41.550> can<00:03:41.580> say<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.480> lot<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.780> books<00:03:42.960> out<00:03:43.140> there

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
I can say for a lot of books out there

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.950 
I can say for a lot of books out there
so<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:43.860> gave<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.190> 4<00:03:44.340> out<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.520> 5<00:03:44.730> really<00:03:45.540> good<00:03:45.750> I

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
so I gave it a 4 out of 5 really good I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.090 
so I gave it a 4 out of 5 really good I
enjoyed<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.740> lot<00:03:46.920> next<00:03:48.470> tree<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.590> codes<00:03:49.860> by

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
enjoyed it a lot next tree of codes by

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.340 
enjoyed it a lot next tree of codes by
jonathan<00:03:50.520> safran<00:03:50.550> foer<00:03:50.880> Boyer<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.840> always<00:03:52.260> say

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
of the lines that he picked out of here

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.020 
of the lines that he picked out of here
were<00:04:23.110> stunning<00:04:24.009> they<00:04:24.250> were<00:04:24.310> absolutely

were stunning they were absolutely

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.670 
were stunning they were absolutely
beautiful<00:04:25.750> it's<00:04:25.990> something<00:04:26.319> that<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.560> could
