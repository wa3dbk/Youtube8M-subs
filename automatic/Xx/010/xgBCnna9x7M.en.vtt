the other because I'm facing a certain

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.710 
the other because I'm facing a certain
way<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:54.829> don't<00:02:55.099> know<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.940> always<00:02:56.269> happens

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.270 
way I don't know but it always happens
like<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.110> my<00:02:57.200> videos<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.680> I'm<00:02:57.739> like<00:02:57.950> I

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
like that in my videos and I'm like I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.780 
like that in my videos and I'm like I
know<00:02:58.670> my<00:02:59.209> eyeshadows<00:02:59.810> matching<00:03:00.410> right<00:03:01.220> but

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790

know my eyeshadows matching right but
anyway<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.090> think<00:03:02.329> this<00:03:02.510> side<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.900> probably

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
anyway I think this side is probably

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.390 
anyway I think this side is probably
going<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.379> be<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.500> little<00:03:03.680> bit<00:03:03.799> darker<00:03:04.099> than<00:03:04.129> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
going to be a little bit darker than the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.140 
going to be a little bit darker than the
side<00:03:04.579> but<00:03:05.209> whatever<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.079> lighting<00:03:06.530> okay

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
side but whatever it's the lighting okay

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.360 
side but whatever it's the lighting okay
