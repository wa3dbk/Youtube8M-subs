soundtracks non sound decoder and gave
it<00:01:14.729> my<00:01:14.880> weathering<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.070> do

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
demonstration here I haven't really done
anything<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.560> walk<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
anything with it so walk put the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.690 
anything with it so walk put the
headlights<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.979> let's<00:01:26.250> run<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> down<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
headlights on and let's run it down the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.730 
headlights on and let's run it down the
track

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.450 

I<00:01:31.930> still<00:01:32.930> gotta<00:01:33.110> set<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.409> up<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.710> decoder<00:01:34.070> probe

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
I still gotta set it up a decoder probe

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.880 
I still gotta set it up a decoder probe
and<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:35.060> get<00:01:35.180> all<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.479> functions<00:01:36.290> down<00:01:36.500> right

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
and you get all the functions down right

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.410 
and you get all the functions down right
and<00:01:37.130> get<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.399> momentum<00:01:37.670> set<00:01:38.090> up<00:01:38.210> obviously

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and get the momentum set up obviously

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.139 
and get the momentum set up obviously
but<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.040> gonna<00:01:40.220> look<00:01:40.399> good<00:01:40.580> running<00:01:40.909> with

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
but this is gonna look good running with

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.770 
but this is gonna look good running with
my<00:01:41.360> Kato<00:01:42.259> SD<00:01:42.830> 40<00:01:43.159> -<00:01:43.369> tubes<00:01:43.759> that<00:01:44.509> are<00:01:44.570> in

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
my Kato SD 40 - tubes that are in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.359 
my Kato SD 40 - tubes that are in
two-tone<00:01:45.200> green<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.590> think<00:01:46.009> that'll<00:01:46.250> look

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
two-tone green I think that'll look

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.249 
two-tone green I think that'll look
really<00:01:46.880> great<00:01:47.270> together<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:49.509> along<00:01:50.509> with<00:01:50.539> my

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
really great together and along with my

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.260 
really great together and along with my
Bowser<00:01:52.250> C<00:01:53.000> 6:30<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:55.100> two-tone<00:01:55.640> green<00:01:55.700> as<00:01:56.060> well
