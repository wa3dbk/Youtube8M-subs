show you how to do is pre-exhaust your

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.910 
show you how to do is pre-exhaust your
Chin's<00:00:36.660> from<00:00:37.050> several<00:00:37.469> different<00:00:37.800> angles

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
Chin's from several different angles

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.760 
Chin's from several different angles
using<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> cables<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.989> find<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> cables

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
using the cables and I find the cables

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
using the cables and I find the cables
are<00:00:40.890> great<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.730> helping<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> isolate

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
are great for really helping to isolate

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.450 
are great for really helping to isolate
the<00:00:42.690> muscles<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> keeps<00:00:43.739> constant

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the muscles because it keeps constant

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
the muscles because it keeps constant
tension<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:44.969> muscles<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.629> all<00:00:45.660> times<00:00:46.079> so

I'm going to show you some different

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.850 
I'm going to show you some different
cable<00:00:48.120> crossover<00:00:48.600> variations<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.680> can

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
cable crossover variations and you can

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.439 
cable crossover variations and you can
do<00:00:49.950> these<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> beginning<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.210> chest

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
do these at the beginning of your chest

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
do these at the beginning of your chest
workout<00:00:51.840> pre<00:00:52.500> exhausted<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
workout pre exhausted so then when you

go into your later exercises your bench
presses<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.520> things<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.000> you'll<00:00:57.449> feel

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
presses and things like that you'll feel

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
presses and things like that you'll feel
your<00:00:57.930> chest<00:00:58.199> working<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.250> already

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
your chest working because it's already

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
pre exhausted and it's already pumped up

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.039 
pre exhausted and it's already pumped up
greatly<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> strategy<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.899> have

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
greatly the strategy that you have

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.520 
greatly the strategy that you have
trouble<00:01:04.409> building<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.890> jets

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
trouble building up your jets

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
trouble building up your jets
the<00:01:07.530> first<00:01:07.740> exercise<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the first exercise we're going to do is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.260 
the first exercise we're going to do is
low<00:01:09.540> pulley<00:01:09.900> cable<00:01:10.409> crossovers<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:12.119> this

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
low pulley cable crossovers and for this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.000 
low pulley cable crossovers and for this
you<00:01:12.450> need<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> set<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.930> cables<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you need to set the cables up on the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
you need to set the cables up on the
bottom<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> cable<00:01:15.119> crossover<00:01:15.689> station

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
bottom of the cable crossover station

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.350 
bottom of the cable crossover station
and<00:01:16.350> you're<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> cross<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.610> hands<00:01:18.060> up

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and you're going to cross your hands up

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
and you're going to cross your hands up
towards<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.990> face<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.530> start<00:01:20.220> from<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
towards your face and start from the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.460 
towards your face and start from the
bottom<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.850> cross<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
bottom and cross up now this is the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
bottom and cross up now this is the
opposite<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> way<00:01:23.460> most<00:01:23.700> people<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:24.210> cable

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
opposite of the way most people do cable

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.320 
opposite of the way most people do cable
crossovers<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.250> variation<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.090> going

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
crossovers but this variation is going

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810 
crossovers but this variation is going
to<00:01:27.390> hit<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> upper<00:01:28.439> chest<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to hit more of the upper chest so it's a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
to hit more of the upper chest so it's a
really<00:01:30.000> great<00:01:30.360> exercise<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.140> hit<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> upper

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
really great exercise to hit that upper

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
really great exercise to hit that upper
inner<00:01:32.130> area<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.790> chest<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.329> help

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
inner area of your chest and help

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.319 
inner area of your chest and help
pre-exhaust<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> harder

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
pre-exhaust it and this is a harder

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.420 
pre-exhaust it and this is a harder
variation<00:01:36.960> than<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> other<00:01:37.470> cable<00:01:37.740> crossover

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
variation than the other cable crossover

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.069 
variation than the other cable crossover
moves<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.360> why<00:01:39.540> we're<00:01:39.720> doing<00:01:39.960> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
moves and that's why we're doing this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.850 
moves and that's why we're doing this
one<00:01:40.259> first<00:01:42.140> now<00:01:43.140> we're<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.530> set<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
one first now we're going to set the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.109 
one first now we're going to set the
cables<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.759> they're<00:01:44.880> approximately

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
cables up so that they're approximately

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.030 
cables up so that they're approximately
shoulder<00:01:45.869> height<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> beginning<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
shoulder height at the beginning and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460 
shoulder height at the beginning and
this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> great<00:01:48.270> variation<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.110> really

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this is a great variation that really

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
this is a great variation that really
hits<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> center<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> chest<00:01:50.700> you're

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
hits the center of the chest you're

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.700 
hits the center of the chest you're
going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> work<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> overall<00:01:52.290> pecs

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
going to work more of the overall pecs

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560 
going to work more of the overall pecs
because<00:01:53.189> your<00:01:53.340> hands<00:01:53.700> are<00:01:53.820> perfectly<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.299> line

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
because your hands are perfectly in line

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.899 
because your hands are perfectly in line
with<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> center<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> chest<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.729> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
with the center of the chest and this is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.609 
with the center of the chest and this is
actually<00:01:57.240> my<00:01:57.360> favorite<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> cable

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
actually my favorite of all the cable

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.069 
actually my favorite of all the cable
crossover<00:01:59.189> variations<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:00.780> gives<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
crossover variations it really gives you

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.630 
crossover variations it really gives you
a<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.350> peak<00:02:01.619> contraction<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a good peak contraction right in the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.630 
a good peak contraction right in the
middle<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> pecs

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.660 

and<00:02:10.750> our<00:02:11.750> final<00:02:12.019> cable<00:02:12.470> crossover<00:02:13.040> variation

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and our final cable crossover variation

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.970 
and our final cable crossover variation
is<00:02:13.910> done<00:02:14.180> from<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> high<00:02:14.720> pulley<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.379> this<00:02:15.830> is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
is done from the high pulley and this is

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.410 
is done from the high pulley and this is
probably<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.430> variation<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.090> you're<00:02:17.239> most

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
probably the variation that you're most

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.420 
probably the variation that you're most
familiar<00:02:17.599> with<00:02:18.019> seeing<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.590> this<00:02:19.190> one's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
familiar with seeing and this one's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.009 
familiar with seeing and this one's
going<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> work<00:02:19.700> more<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.390> lower<00:02:20.660> and

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
going to work more of the lower and

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.290 
going to work more of the lower and
inner<00:02:21.290> area<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.980> chest<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.580> when<00:02:23.239> you

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
inner area of the chest so when you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.259 
inner area of the chest so when you
combine<00:02:23.660> all<00:02:23.900> three<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.379> these<00:02:24.500> variations

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
combine all three of these variations

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.550 
combine all three of these variations
cable<00:02:26.269> crossovers<00:02:26.840> from<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.140> low<00:02:27.319> pulley

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
cable crossovers from the low pulley

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.890 
cable crossovers from the low pulley
cable<00:02:28.430> crossover<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.030> done<00:02:29.180> from<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.480> center

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
cable crossover is done from the center

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.780 
cable crossover is done from the center
as<00:02:30.049> well<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.680> from<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.920> high<00:02:31.069> pulley<00:02:31.370> you're

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
as well as from the high pulley you're

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.250 
as well as from the high pulley you're
going<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.030> work<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.660> areas<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:33.170> your

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
going to work all the areas of your

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.800 
going to work all the areas of your
chest<00:02:33.560> lower<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.519> or<00:02:34.819> an<00:02:34.940> upper<00:02:35.299> chest<00:02:35.569> and

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
chest lower in or an upper chest and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.360 
chest lower in or an upper chest and
it's<00:02:36.140> really<00:02:36.349> going<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.560> help<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.830> pre-exhaust

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
it's really going to help to pre-exhaust

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's really going to help to pre-exhaust
these<00:02:37.640> muscles<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.780> move<00:02:38.989> into

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
these muscles so that when you move into

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.870 
these muscles so that when you move into
your<00:02:39.349> heavy<00:02:39.650> mass<00:02:39.950> building<00:02:40.250> moves<00:02:40.580> like

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
your heavy mass building moves like

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.160 
your heavy mass building moves like
bench<00:02:41.090> presses<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.690> things<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:41.989> that

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
bench presses and things like that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.690 
bench presses and things like that
you're<00:02:42.709> going<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.890> get<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.069> better<00:02:43.310> chest

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
you're going to get a better chest

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.380 
you're going to get a better chest
workout<00:02:48.579> at<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.610> beginning<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.239> your

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
workout at the beginning of your

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.960 
workout at the beginning of your
workouts<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.560> what<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.739> want<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.010> do<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.489> to

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
workouts and what I want you to do is to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.190 
workouts and what I want you to do is to
sense<00:02:53.329> of<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:55.310> each<00:02:55.670> variation<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:56.810> start<00:02:57.110> with

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
sense of of each variation so start with

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.199 
sense of of each variation so start with
the<00:02:57.319> top<00:02:57.530> then<00:02:58.099> go<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.459> middle<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:58.940> then

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
the top then go to the middle and then

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.360 
the top then go to the middle and then
you<00:02:59.239> go<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.019> bottom<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.590> if<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.099> want<00:03:01.280> to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
you go to the bottom and if you want to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.900 
you go to the bottom and if you want to
just<00:03:01.610> keep<00:03:02.000> doing

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.240 

and<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.690> is<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.020> great<00:03:06.290> exercise<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:07.070> sit

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
and this is a great exercise like sit

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.770 
and this is a great exercise like sit
really<00:03:07.490> help<00:03:07.730> pump<00:03:07.970> up<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.210> chest<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
really help pump up the chest and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.140 
really help pump up the chest and
pre-exhaust<00:03:09.710> or<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.310> get<00:03:10.430> into<00:03:10.670> your<00:03:10.760> main

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
pre-exhaust or you get into your main

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.380 
pre-exhaust or you get into your main
exercises<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:13.040> key<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.400> cable<00:03:13.730> crossovers

exercises the key with cable crossovers

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.570 
exercises the key with cable crossovers
don't<00:03:14.690> go<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.990> heavy<00:03:15.230> focus<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.190> using<00:03:16.490> a

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
don't go to heavy focus on using a

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.550 
don't go to heavy focus on using a
moderate<00:03:17.000> weight<00:03:17.150> really<00:03:17.660> feel<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.230> stretch

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
moderate weight really feel the stretch

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.290 
moderate weight really feel the stretch
in<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.010> bottom<00:03:19.310> really<00:03:19.760> feel<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> peak

contraction at the top flexing and
squeeze<00:03:22.640> my<00:03:22.670> muscles<00:03:23.330> pumping<00:03:23.840> them<00:03:23.960> up<00:03:24.020> is

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
squeeze my muscles pumping them up is

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.690 
squeeze my muscles pumping them up is
the<00:03:24.470> most<00:03:24.650> important<00:03:25.010> part<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.370> exercise

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
the most important part of this exercise

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.510 
the most important part of this exercise
then<00:03:26.690> afterwards<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:27.950> go<00:03:28.130> into<00:03:28.250> your<00:03:28.340> heavy

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
then afterwards you go into your heavy

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.670 
then afterwards you go into your heavy
mass<00:03:29.150> building<00:03:29.600> works<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.260> get<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.410> better

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
mass building works and get a better

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.460 
mass building works and get a better
pump<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.100> your<00:03:31.130> chest<00:03:31.450> muscle<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.260> give<00:03:33.440> that

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
pump in your chest muscle so give that

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.500
