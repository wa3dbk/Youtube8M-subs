00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
got us excited was we added the two

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.100 
got us excited was we added the two
bowling<00:02:23.989> lanes<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:25.060> unlike<00:02:26.060> everything<00:02:26.690> else

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
that we have found and seen we wanted it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.400 
that we have found and seen we wanted it
to<00:02:30.620> design<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.220> in<00:02:31.340> such<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.730> way<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:33.140> can

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
to design it in such a way that you can

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.380 
to design it in such a way that you can
actually<00:02:33.849> play<00:02:34.849> with<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:36.049> yes<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.799> is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
actually play with it so yes it is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.520 
actually play with it so yes it is
completely<00:02:38.830> removable<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:42.260> can

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
completely removable and you can

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.210 
completely removable and you can
actually<00:02:43.299> play<00:02:44.299> around<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.049> balling<00:02:45.500> if<00:02:45.709> you

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
actually play around the balling if you

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.729 
actually play around the balling if you
want<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:47.810> your<00:02:48.110> phone

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.900 

Lego<00:02:51.880> bowling<00:02:52.880> lanes<00:02:53.390> there<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.140> have<00:02:54.349> them

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
Lego bowling lanes there you have them

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.900 
Lego bowling lanes there you have them
that<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.329> we<00:02:56.480> show<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.810> how<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.260> build

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
that is what we show you how to build

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.509 
that is what we show you how to build
completely<00:02:58.910> modular<00:02:59.209> as<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.900> can<00:03:00.110> see<00:03:00.379> so<00:03:01.310> if

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
completely modular as you can see so if

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.910 
completely modular as you can see so if
you<00:03:01.760> want<00:03:02.060> more<00:03:02.360> information<00:03:02.690> about<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.620> one

get we're going to show you how to build
everything<00:03:31.160> but<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:31.609> is<00:03:31.819> our<00:03:32.120> idea<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.019> a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
everything but this is our idea of a

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.920 
everything but this is our idea of a
modular<00:03:33.980> bowling<00:03:34.489> alley<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.720> said

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
modular bowling alley and like said

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.629 
modular bowling alley and like said
what's<00:03:36.109> really<00:03:36.410> cool<00:03:36.590> about<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:37.160> is<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.430> can

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
what's really cool about it is you can

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.819 
what's really cool about it is you can
actually<00:03:37.880> play<00:03:38.690> with<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.049> if<00:03:39.230> that's<00:03:39.470> what<00:03:39.650> you

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
actually play with it if that's what you

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.979 
actually play with it if that's what you
want<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:41.120> once<00:03:41.359> you're<00:03:41.540> done<00:03:41.569> playing

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
want it and once you're done playing

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.629 
want it and once you're done playing
with<00:03:42.139> it<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.889> can<00:03:43.099> easily<00:03:44.919> put<00:03:45.919> it<00:03:46.069> right<00:03:46.340> back

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
with it you can easily put it right back

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.150 
with it you can easily put it right back
in<00:03:46.910> place<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:48.849> when<00:03:49.849> that's<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.299> place<00:03:51.160> you

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
in place and when that's in place you

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.120 
in place and when that's in place you
nobody<00:03:52.910> would<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.239> ever<00:03:53.480> known<00:03:53.950> see<00:03:54.950> it

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
nobody would have ever known see it

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.039 
nobody would have ever known see it
looks<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:55.700> perfectly<00:03:56.329> smooth<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.019> can

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
looks it's perfectly smooth you can

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.199 
looks it's perfectly smooth you can
literally<00:03:57.530> attach<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.310> next<00:03:58.579> modular

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
literally attach the next modular

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.990 
literally attach the next modular
building<00:03:59.599> if<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.930> want<00:04:00.200> next<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.889> it<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.790> when

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
building if you want next to it and when

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.610 
building if you want next to it and when
it's<00:04:02.150> in<00:04:02.329> place<00:04:02.540> you<00:04:02.989> wouldn't<00:04:03.260> even<00:04:03.349> know

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
it's in place you wouldn't even know

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.319 
it's in place you wouldn't even know
that<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.980> could<00:04:04.160> actually<00:04:04.190> remove<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.150> it

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
that you could actually remove it it

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.390 
that you could actually remove it it
looks<00:04:05.690> absolutely<00:04:05.930> perfect<00:04:09.099> this<00:04:10.099> is<00:04:10.160> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
looks absolutely perfect this is the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.640 
looks absolutely perfect this is the
second<00:04:11.030> floor<00:04:11.329> that<00:04:11.569> goes<00:04:11.840> on<00:04:12.049> top<00:04:12.349> then

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
second floor that goes on top then

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.659 
second floor that goes on top then
that's<00:04:12.950> where<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.280> have<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.489> snack<00:04:14.060> bar<00:04:14.480> and

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
that's where you have the snack bar and

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.729 
that's where you have the snack bar and
then<00:04:16.669> like<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.419> said<00:04:17.750> here<00:04:18.079> we<00:04:18.260> have<00:04:18.500> the

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
then like I said here we have the

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.800 
then like I said here we have the
kitchen<00:04:18.979> then<00:04:19.400> we<00:04:19.549> have<00:04:19.760> finally<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:20.570> roof

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
kitchen then we have finally the roof

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.380 
kitchen then we have finally the roof
and<00:04:21.079> again<00:04:21.979> everything<00:04:22.310> here<00:04:22.940> in<00:04:23.150> this
