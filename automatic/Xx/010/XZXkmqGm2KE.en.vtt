00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
incrementing up as it goes so per disc

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.560 
incrementing up as it goes so per disc
the<00:02:06.190> first<00:02:06.430> clip<00:02:06.610> will<00:02:06.730> be<00:02:06.760> one<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.210> then<00:02:07.330> so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
the first clip will be one and then so

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.869 
the first clip will be one and then so

on with this with the C starting it out

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.640 
on with this with the C starting it out
now<00:02:10.300> this<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.629> default<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.470> what

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
now this is the default this is what

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.160 
now this is the default this is what
they<00:02:11.709> call<00:02:11.860> like<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.250> non<00:02:13.060> free<00:02:13.569> or<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:13.989> this

they call like the non free or this this

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.280 
they call like the non free or this this
did<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.909> set<00:02:16.180> naming<00:02:16.629> convention<00:02:17.140> I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
did the the the set naming convention I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.240 
did the the the set naming convention I
can<00:02:17.590> change<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.069> by<00:02:18.610> going<00:02:18.640> down<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.480> my<00:02:19.629> menu

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
can change that by going down in my menu

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.730 
can change that by going down in my menu
to<00:02:21.250> what<00:02:21.940> they<00:02:22.060> call<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.540> free<00:02:23.350> naming

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
to what they call a free naming

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.040 
to what they call a free naming
convention<00:02:24.160> so<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.400> see<00:02:24.550> there<00:02:24.760> says<00:02:24.970> free

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
convention so you see there says free

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.560 
convention so you see there says free
and<00:02:26.770> then<00:02:26.920> below<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.250> says<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.700> don't<00:02:27.970> naming

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
now in this format it's allowing me to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.340 
now in this format it's allowing me to
change<00:02:31.060> my<00:02:31.240> name<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.570> mentioned<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:31.990> by

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
that it'll we use and we set that about

leave<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:49.300> title<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.260> could<00:03:50.710> go<00:03:50.860> through

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
leave it as title but I could go through

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.650 
leave it as title but I could go through
and<00:03:51.370> change<00:03:51.940> what<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.330> is<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:57.330> then<00:03:58.330> when

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
and change what that is and then when

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.730 
and change what that is and then when
I'm<00:03:58.840> done<00:03:58.870> go<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.600> there<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.720> go<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.260> then

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
I'm done go to and there you go and then

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.380 
I'm done go to and there you go and then
it's<00:04:02.890> at<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.010> number<00:04:03.340> now<00:04:03.760> right<00:04:04.000> now<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.300> set

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
it's at a number now right now it's set

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.390 
it's at a number now right now it's set
to<00:04:04.450> five<00:04:04.840> this<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.650> numeric<00:04:06.070> that's<00:04:06.280> gonna

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
to five this is the numeric that's gonna

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.280 
to five this is the numeric that's gonna
start<00:04:06.760> with<00:04:06.910> as<00:04:07.150> in<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.780> first<00:04:07.960> clip<00:04:08.140> will<00:04:08.260> be

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
start with as in the first clip will be

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.690 
start with as in the first clip will be
five<00:04:08.530> or<00:04:08.560> one<00:04:08.950> or<00:04:09.100> four<00:04:09.310> and<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:09.520> it<00:04:09.610> will

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
five or one or four and then it will

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.520 
five or one or four and then it will
increment<00:04:09.910> up<00:04:10.120> forward<00:04:10.510> so<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.930> left<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:11.440> as

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
increment up forward so I left it as

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.420 
increment up forward so I left it as
title<00:04:11.830> but<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:11.980> can<00:04:12.100> call<00:04:12.220> you<00:04:12.310> can<00:04:12.340> call

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
title but I can call you can call

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.780 
title but I can call you can call
whatever<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.880> like<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:15.010> know<00:04:15.130> any<00:04:15.490> any

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
whatever you like you know any any

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.270 
whatever you like you know any any
naming<00:04:15.970> convention<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.420> prefer<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.440> then<00:04:17.920> on

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
naming convention you prefer and then on

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.010 
naming convention you prefer and then on
the<00:04:18.520> disc<00:04:18.730> from<00:04:19.030> then<00:04:19.150> on<00:04:19.299> your<00:04:19.660> clips<00:04:19.870> will<00:04:19.989> be

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
the disc from then on your clips will be

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.790 
the disc from then on your clips will be
name<00:04:20.170> title<00:04:20.440> 0<00:04:21.130> 0<00:04:21.340> 0<00:04:21.520> 1<00:04:21.670> 0<00:04:21.730> 0<00:04:22.150> 0<00:04:22.180> 2<00:04:22.510> 0<00:04:22.540> 0<00:04:22.780> 3<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:23.350> you

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
name title 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 3 so you

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.440 
name title 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 3 so you
can<00:04:23.950> decide<00:04:24.190> based<00:04:24.760> on<00:04:24.880> your<00:04:24.970> project<00:04:25.390> you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
can decide based on your project you

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.090 
can decide based on your project you
want<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.660> call<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.320> project<00:04:26.680> name<00:04:26.830> and

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
want to call it the project name and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.250 
want to call it the project name and
then<00:04:27.610> increment<00:04:27.790> from<00:04:28.030> from<00:04:28.390> 0<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.840> forward

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
then increment from from 0 and forward

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.380 
then increment from from 0 and forward
now<00:04:29.740> this<00:04:30.250> is<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.430> great<00:04:30.700> and<00:04:30.940> easy<00:04:31.120> way<00:04:31.360> to

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
now this is a great and easy way to

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.270 
now this is a great and easy way to
increment<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.960> name<00:04:32.110> files<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:33.070> goes

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
increment to name files and it goes

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.800 
increment to name files and it goes
pretty<00:04:33.400> fast<00:04:33.640> but<00:04:33.940> then<00:04:34.060> again<00:04:34.180> you<00:04:34.570> have<00:04:34.690> that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
pretty fast but then again you have that

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.330 
pretty fast but then again you have that
you'd<00:04:35.229> have<00:04:35.380> to<00:04:35.560> you<00:04:35.710> have<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.860> keep<00:04:36.010> in<00:04:36.130> mind

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
you'd have to you have to keep in mind

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.450 
you'd have to you have to keep in mind
that<00:04:36.790> per<00:04:37.300> disk<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.990> should<00:04:38.169> either

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
that per disk you you should either

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.540 
that per disk you you should either
never<00:04:39.789> back<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.120> zero<00:04:40.419> again<00:04:40.630> or<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:42.430> keep

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
never back to zero again or or just keep

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.610 
never back to zero again or or just keep
in<00:04:42.610> mind<00:04:42.639> that<00:04:42.789> it's<00:04:42.940> gonna<00:04:43.030> as<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:44.169> fills<00:04:44.440> up

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
in mind that it's gonna as this fills up

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.089 
in mind that it's gonna as this fills up
the<00:04:44.979> next<00:04:45.310> number<00:04:45.550> will<00:04:45.669> come<00:04:45.759> up<00:04:45.910> as<00:04:46.030> well

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
the next number will come up as well

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.350 
the next number will come up as well
addition<00:04:48.099> to<00:04:48.130> all<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.819> can<00:04:49.060> do<00:04:49.120> something

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
addition to all this I can do something

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.850 
addition to all this I can do something
called<00:04:49.389> plan<00:04:49.810> metadata<00:04:50.289> I<00:04:50.380> mentioned<00:04:50.680> just<00:04:50.710> a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
called plan metadata I mentioned just a

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.219 
called plan metadata I mentioned just a
minute<00:04:50.949> ago<00:04:51.130> I'm<00:04:51.699> gonna<00:04:51.849> go<00:04:51.940> back<00:04:52.150> into<00:04:52.419> menu
