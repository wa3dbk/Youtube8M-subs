charger<00:00:11.969> port<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.540> fourth<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:14.210> so<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.299> you

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
charger port in fourth so you so if you

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.760 
charger port in fourth so you so if you
have<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.780> new<00:00:15.929> iPhones<00:00:16.379> then<00:00:16.619> you're

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
have one of the new iPhones then you're

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.109 
have one of the new iPhones then you're
actually<00:00:16.949> going<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.640> able<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.910> definitely

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
actually going to be able to definitely

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
actually going to be able to definitely
use<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.720> since<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.199> already<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.740> where

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
use this since you already have where

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
use this since you already have where
these<00:00:20.640> charging<00:00:21.240> cables<00:00:21.570> laying<00:00:21.779> around

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
these charging cables laying around

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.040 
these charging cables laying around
otherwise<00:00:23.420> this<00:00:24.420> isn't<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> be

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
otherwise this isn't going to be

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.050 
otherwise this isn't going to be
something<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.800> because<00:00:26.279> usually<00:00:26.550> most

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
something for you because usually most

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.370 
something for you because usually most
of<00:00:27.300> them<00:00:28.070> have<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.250> mini<00:00:29.460> USB<00:00:29.960> now<00:00:30.960> something

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
of them have the mini USB now something

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.979 
of them have the mini USB now something
that's<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:31.800> odd<00:00:32.099> about<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.989> usually

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
that's really odd about this is usually

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.350 
that's really odd about this is usually
when<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.489> port<00:00:35.850> usually

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
when they have that little port usually

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.780 
when they have that little port usually
they<00:00:36.510> come<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.050> wire<00:00:37.399> this<00:00:38.399> time<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
they come with that wire this time it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.720 
they come with that wire this time it
came<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> mini<00:00:39.540> USB<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.410> USB<00:00:40.620> which<00:00:41.550> I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
came with a mini USB to USB which I

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.729 
came with a mini USB to USB which I
guess<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.300> any<00:00:42.510> android<00:00:42.930> phone<00:00:43.200> this

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
guess if you have any android phone this

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.490 
guess if you have any android phone this
is<00:00:43.950> great<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.489> pop<00:00:44.820> inside<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> USB<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.469> charge

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is great to pop inside the USB to charge

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.709 
is great to pop inside the USB to charge
your<00:00:46.860> Android<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.579> your<00:00:47.850> kindle<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.360> whatever

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
your Android or your kindle or whatever

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.389 
your Android or your kindle or whatever
but<00:00:49.469> otherwise<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.520> does<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.420> purpose<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.410> III

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
but otherwise it does no purpose so III

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.950 
but otherwise it does no purpose so III
would've<00:00:54.059> thought<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.539> maybe<00:00:54.690> they

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
would've thought you know maybe they

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
would've thought you know maybe they
have<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> sitting<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> wire<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.430> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
have a sitting on the wire like this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.750 
have a sitting on the wire like this
with<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> lightning<00:00:57.239> port<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.579> you<00:00:59.579> would<00:00:59.730> be

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
with a lightning port then you would be

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.410 
with a lightning port then you would be
okay<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.649> case<00:01:01.820> some<00:01:02.820> people

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
okay to have it just in case some people

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
okay to have it just in case some people
who<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.660> android<00:01:04.260> phones<00:01:04.559> don't<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
who have android phones don't have that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.060 
who have android phones don't have that
button<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.750> i<00:01:06.780> thought<00:01:07.110> was<00:01:07.229> really<00:01:07.290> cool<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
button that i thought was really cool so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.600 
button that i thought was really cool so
all<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.000> put<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:10.610> lightning

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
all you do is just put your lightning

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.740 
all you do is just put your lightning
port<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:12.270> apple<00:01:12.689> red<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:15.509> just

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
port from apple red in there and just

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
port from apple red in there and just
fits<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.200> perfect<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:18.049> turn<00:01:19.850> red

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
fits in perfect and actually turn red

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
fits in perfect and actually turn red
when<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.240> charging<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.500> blue

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
when it's charging and then I think blue

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.050 
when it's charging and then I think blue
when<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.619> took<00:01:25.830> about<00:01:26.060> four

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
when it's not and now it took about four

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.600 
when it's not and now it took about four
to<00:01:27.540> five<00:01:27.570> hours<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
to five hours to actually get a like a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.510 
to five hours to actually get a like a
full<00:01:29.970> charge<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.079> yeah<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
full charge on this so yeah so I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.359 
full charge on this so yeah so I
actually<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.329> iphone<00:01:33.869> 4<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
simple as that so the power by PB 2680

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.179 
simple as that so the power by PB 2680
actually<00:01:50.490> goes<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.149> 2999<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> candace

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
actually goes for 2999 on the I candace

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.859 
actually goes for 2999 on the I candace
website<00:01:53.729> i<00:01:53.909> thought<00:01:54.360> was<00:01:54.509> pretty<00:01:54.689> cool

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
