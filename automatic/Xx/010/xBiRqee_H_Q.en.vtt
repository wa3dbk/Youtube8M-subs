Carlson<00:02:17.450> explains<00:02:17.569> on<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.319> level<00:02:18.650> that's

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
Carlson explains on this level that's

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.370 
Carlson explains on this level that's
pretty<00:02:19.069> cool<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:23.060> game's<00:02:23.299> quite<00:02:23.599> forgiving<00:02:24.200> I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
pretty cool the game's quite forgiving I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.559 
pretty cool the game's quite forgiving I
think<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:25.400> whether<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.730> changes<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
think then whether it changes on the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.660 
think then whether it changes on the
higher<00:02:26.750> difficulty<00:02:27.260> levels<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.890> can't

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
higher difficulty levels but can't

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
higher difficulty levels but can't
really<00:02:28.730> fall<00:02:29.060> off<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.390> track<00:02:29.630> one<00:02:29.810> easy

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.180 

picking<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.750> all<00:02:35.870> those<00:02:36.080> coins<00:02:36.380> across<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.070> we

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
picking up all those coins across so we

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.870 
picking up all those coins across so we
can<00:02:37.310> upgrade<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.790> carts<00:02:38.150> afterwards<00:02:38.870> oh<00:02:42.880> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
can upgrade the carts afterwards oh and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.010 
can upgrade the carts afterwards oh and
so<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.090> can<00:02:44.330> pull<00:02:44.630> up<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.870> track<00:02:46.780> then<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.900> is

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
so you can pull up the track then it is

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.540 
so you can pull up the track then it is
just<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.260> bit<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.470> assistance<00:02:48.710> dad<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:49.370> make

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
just a bit of assistance dad so make

00:02:49.550 --> 00:03:06.540 
just a bit of assistance dad so make
sure<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.060> don't<00:02:50.180> very<00:02:50.480> often

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.000 

no<00:03:07.550> more<00:03:07.790> practice<00:03:08.270> that's<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.080> guys<00:03:09.320> why

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010
