00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
around or desktop so having good build

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
around or desktop so having good build
quality<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.900> essential<00:02:03.900> while<00:02:04.050> buying<00:02:04.230> a<00:02:04.410> new

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
quality is essential while buying a new

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.190 
quality is essential while buying a new
laptop<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.580> one<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> things<00:02:06.570> that's<00:02:06.720> most

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
laptop and one of the things that's most

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.290 
laptop and one of the things that's most
ignored<00:02:07.560> while<00:02:07.800> buying<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.160> new<00:02:08.280> laptop<00:02:08.310> itself

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
ignored while buying a new laptop itself

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.840 
ignored while buying a new laptop itself
so<00:02:09.989> while<00:02:10.739> talking<00:02:11.099> about<00:02:11.250> build<00:02:11.640> quality

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
so while talking about build quality

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.640 
so while talking about build quality
what<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.110> things<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.470> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
what is what are the things that you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280 
what is what are the things that you
should<00:02:13.830> keep<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.130> mind<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:15.030> first<00:02:15.450> we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
should keep in mind so first we

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.660 
should keep in mind so first we
while<00:02:16.620> looking<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> bit<00:02:17.189> quality<00:02:17.579> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
while looking at the bit quality you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.789 
while looking at the bit quality you
should<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> material<00:02:18.629> used<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
should see the material used in the

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.429 
should see the material used in the
manufacturing<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.670> laptop<00:02:21.030> itself<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.780> as

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
manufacturing the laptop itself and as

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.819 
manufacturing the laptop itself and as
you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.680> see<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.989> laptops<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.260> lenovos

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
you can see in this laptops the lenovos

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.429 
you can see in this laptops the lenovos
eat<00:02:26.189> 480<00:02:26.640> laptop<00:02:27.120> which<00:02:27.299> I<00:02:27.450> personally<00:02:28.019> using

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
eat 480 laptop which I personally using

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.429 
eat 480 laptop which I personally using
it<00:02:29.219> as<00:02:29.549> you<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.730> see<00:02:29.879> here<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.420> lid<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.200> made

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
it as you can see here the lid is made

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.039 
it as you can see here the lid is made
RF<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.280> metal<00:02:32.730> which<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.959> the

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
RF and metal which is one of the

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.050 
RF and metal which is one of the
preferred<00:02:34.370> materials<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.670> prefer

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
preferred materials that I prefer

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.839 
preferred materials that I prefer
personally<00:02:36.840> aluminium<00:02:37.349> which<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.250> great<00:02:38.459> any

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
personally aluminium which is great any

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.530 
personally aluminium which is great any
other<00:02:39.239> method<00:02:39.569> should<00:02:39.989> do<00:02:40.319> as<00:02:40.620> well<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.579> I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
other method should do as well and I

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.170 
other method should do as well and I
perform<00:02:42.959> metal<00:02:43.290> or<00:02:43.470> plastics<00:02:44.040> because<00:02:44.730> they

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
perform metal or plastics because they

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.660 
perform metal or plastics because they
tend<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.629> be<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.379> resistive<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.069> scratches

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
tend to be more resistive to scratches

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.059 
tend to be more resistive to scratches
to<00:02:48.170> fingerprints<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.409> and<00:02:50.540> they<00:02:51.540> basically

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
to fingerprints and and they basically

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.099 
to fingerprints and and they basically
they<00:02:53.069> basically<00:02:53.459> harder<00:02:53.819> than<00:02:53.970> plastics<00:02:54.540> so

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
they basically harder than plastics so

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.080 
they basically harder than plastics so
they<00:02:55.290> tend<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:56.189> a<00:02:56.220> better<00:02:56.459> job<00:02:56.579> in

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
they tend to do a better job in

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.020 
they tend to do a better job in
maintaining<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.019> better<00:02:58.650> build<00:02:58.950> quality<00:02:59.030> so

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
maintaining the better build quality so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.210 
maintaining the better build quality so
I'll<00:03:00.810> just<00:03:00.870> go<00:03:01.139> ahead<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.319> open<00:03:01.530> al<00:03:01.829> up<00:03:02.040> you

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
I'll just go ahead and open al up you

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.039 
I'll just go ahead and open al up you
can<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.669> whole<00:03:02.819> chassis<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.569> laptop

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
can see the whole chassis of the laptop

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.009 
can see the whole chassis of the laptop
is<00:03:04.379> a<00:03:04.620> metal<00:03:05.400> except<00:03:05.849> for<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.269> screen<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
is a metal except for the screen the

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.800 
is a metal except for the screen the
screen<00:03:07.230> bezel<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:08.389> which<00:03:09.389> you<00:03:09.480> can<00:03:09.599> see

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
screen bezel here which you can see

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.409 
screen bezel here which you can see
that's<00:03:10.650> mirror<00:03:10.919> of<00:03:11.129> plastic<00:03:11.639> which<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
that's mirror of plastic which is the

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.349 
that's mirror of plastic which is the
downside<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:13.139> this<00:03:13.290> laptop<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:13.799> i<00:03:14.549> prefer<00:03:15.329> the

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
downside to this laptop but i prefer the

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.259 
downside to this laptop but i prefer the
metal<00:03:15.900> over<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.439> plastic<00:03:16.859> build<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.489> terms<00:03:18.150> of

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
metal over the plastic build in terms of

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.970 
metal over the plastic build in terms of
build<00:03:18.480> quality<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.989> terms<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.560> material

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
build quality in terms of the material

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.610 
build quality in terms of the material
used<00:03:20.189> the<00:03:21.019> advantages<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.260> metal<00:03:22.560> are

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
used the advantages of the metal are

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.830 
used the advantages of the metal are
basically<00:03:23.010> obviously<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:23.909> I<00:03:23.940> said<00:03:24.269> prevent

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
basically obviously like I said prevent

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.680 
basically obviously like I said prevent
scratches<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.709> also<00:03:25.859> prevents<00:03:26.690> fingerprints

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
scratches it also prevents fingerprints

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.430 
scratches it also prevents fingerprints
and<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.650> also<00:03:29.310> has<00:03:29.519> less<00:03:30.180> flex<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.169> if

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
and it also has less flex to it so if

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.479 
and it also has less flex to it so if
you<00:03:31.769> had<00:03:31.949> a<00:03:31.979> laptop<00:03:32.280> which<00:03:32.669> had<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:33.090> plastic<00:03:34.489> lid

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
you had a laptop which had a plastic lid

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.539 
you had a laptop which had a plastic lid
or<00:03:35.729> plastic<00:03:36.329> palm<00:03:36.599> rest<00:03:36.870> it<00:03:37.590> tends<00:03:37.919> to<00:03:38.129> flex

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
or plastic palm rest it tends to flex

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.479 
or plastic palm rest it tends to flex
more<00:03:38.909> much<00:03:39.120> more<00:03:39.389> and<00:03:39.629> gives<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> cheap

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
more much more and gives you a cheap

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.270 
more much more and gives you a cheap
feeling<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.500> which<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.709> personally<00:03:43.949> don't

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
feeling and which I personally don't

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.009 
feeling and which I personally don't
like<00:03:44.430> especially<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.419> a<00:03:45.449> laptop<00:03:45.690> because

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
like especially for a laptop because

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.469 
like especially for a laptop because
you're<00:03:46.590> going<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:46.919> a<00:03:46.949> laptop<00:03:47.190> say<00:03:47.639> for

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
you're going to have a laptop say for

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.680 
you're going to have a laptop say for
three<00:03:49.229> years<00:03:49.470> four<00:03:49.919> years<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.340> all<00:03:51.060> time<00:03:51.449> it's

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
three years four years and all time it's

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.800 
three years four years and all time it's
obviously<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.709> stay<00:03:53.310> with<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:54.269> all

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
obviously going to stay with you and all

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.180 
obviously going to stay with you and all
the<00:03:55.049> time<00:03:55.229> like<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.590> said<00:03:55.799> it's<00:03:55.979> going<00:03:56.129> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
the time like I said it's going to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.580 
the time like I said it's going to
collect<00:03:56.459> scratches<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:58.409> to<00:03:58.500> get

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
collect scratches and going to get

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.580 
collect scratches and going to get
damaged<00:03:58.949> so<00:03:59.129> I<00:03:59.250> prefer<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.729> metal<00:04:00.150> because<00:04:00.590> you

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
damaged so I prefer a metal because you

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
businesses business line notebooks are I

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.840 
businesses business line notebooks are I

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
think they have the probook so HP have

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.000 
think they have the probook so HP have
their<00:04:50.060> probook<00:04:50.510> line<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.930> notebooks<00:04:51.650> as<00:04:51.800> well

their probook line of notebooks as well

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.290 
their probook line of notebooks as well
which<00:04:52.250> are<00:04:52.490> really<00:04:52.730> well<00:04:53.030> made<00:04:53.410> moving<00:04:54.410> on<00:04:54.590> I

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
which are really well made moving on I

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.560 
which are really well made moving on I
think<00:04:56.300> they'll<00:04:56.510> make<00:04:56.720> relatively<00:04:57.200> well

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
think they'll make relatively well

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.180 
think they'll make relatively well
relatively<00:04:59.570> well<00:04:59.810> made<00:04:59.990> laptops<00:05:00.440> although<00:05:01.160> I

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
relatively well made laptops although I

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.340 
relatively well made laptops although I
wouldn't<00:05:01.790> trade<00:05:02.120> them<00:05:02.330> on<00:05:02.510> par<00:05:02.750> with<00:05:02.780> HP

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
wouldn't trade them on par with HP

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.970 
wouldn't trade them on par with HP
Lenovo<00:05:04.360> but<00:05:05.360> they<00:05:05.870> make<00:05:06.080> some<00:05:06.350> good<00:05:06.500> laptops

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
Lenovo but they make some good laptops

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.070 
Lenovo but they make some good laptops
as<00:05:07.130> well<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.970> think<00:05:08.690> they<00:05:08.780> have<00:05:08.810> their

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080

other manufactures like Toshiba like

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.570 
other manufactures like Toshiba like
compaq<00:05:34.910> which<00:05:35.510> is<00:05:35.660> now<00:05:35.780> taken<00:05:36.140> by<00:05:36.350> or<00:05:36.680> by<00:05:37.070> HP

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
I wouldn't consider because they usually

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.480 
I wouldn't consider because they usually
use<00:05:47.300> plastic<00:05:48.169> in<00:05:48.320> their<00:05:48.680> manufacturing<00:05:49.310> and
