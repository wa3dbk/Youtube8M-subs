 behind these walls the clocks tick differently slowly 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.650
 there are no appointments no hassle 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.449
 and no stress 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.660
 the tv and outside at the blasphemous place 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.660
 the agency 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.509
 here people come to their silence here a bumblebee or 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.529
 a day 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:24.769
 one week 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.769
 or a month 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.749
 every day begins with a morning devotion 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.749
 bid and silence 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.560
 Silence is not just not talking 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.430

 that the geese cast votes with those 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.340
 After all, we want interior space 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.870
 Â«The thoughts of the people among each other what annoyed me 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.250
 have and so on 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.960
 Of course they want to make him restless and they are coming 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 and that can do that sometimes up high 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 I take it myself very consciously 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 it also makes me a little happier 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.200

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.180
 just out 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.640
 out of everyday life the stress with the pressure to perform 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.000
 here I can 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 how much more, for example 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.020
 to give one of them 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.360
 which is good for me 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.400
 that's the way it is in Austria 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.360
 around 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.670
 here the question does not ask me whether and that effective or so 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 should 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 I just do it 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.169
 Silence in that moment all day 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.169
 that's pretty hard 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.849

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:23.129

 an incredible things on the table BZ the further way and so on 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.409

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.439
 Once a day the castors meet at the Oberloh 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.939
 talks about her experiences with the job 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.679
 that's part of it 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.569
 anyone can come here 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.759
 regardless of age occupation and denominations 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.680
 From the preconditions, the only one who searches is people 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 to be 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.989
 for what happens 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:08.559
 silence 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:14.290
 meditate reading the love of children so no everyday Orioles looks like now 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.859
 ste 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.859
 not quite connected with me 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.400
 because not every time or much more divided 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.919
 phoning and thinking that I'm MacRumors tomorrow and 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.289
 what each time help cooking food but 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:35.609
 then I am only 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.939
 and that gives me a very deep connection with myself and with 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:40.169
 God
