00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 all right 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 or the data but they are very good as 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.490
 it comes from the video today we're going to see how 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 Attack with barbarians and bowmen in glasses 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.870
 high already here are 2300 the main thing is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.370
 bring almost half of barbarians and the 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.440
 half of archers a little more than 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.230
 archers and 8 break walls to be able 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.930
 enter since if you do not get stuck those who 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 they are the barbarians and they would destroy them ok 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.000
 here I will show you a repetition 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.110
 very concise first drew the attention of 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.290
 the kings so that in a moment 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 determined to be of hindrance when 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.170
 inside the village here as well as his 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.710
 Clan castle was very close to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.320
 the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.550
 the walls call attention to 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.460
 everything also the clan castle and 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.140
 the conflict starts ok to strategy is 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.590
 basically throw first what they are 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.600
 barbarians and just behind them go 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.690
 releasing what archers are here 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.619
 see, it would be all because there are barbarians and 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.479
 archers fighting and then the archers 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.130
 they only shoot a barbarian and while 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.680
 archers from behind his castle are going 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.540
 firing the mines but here I'm going to 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.899
 start there for a bit of percentage 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.820
 free that there are no defenses covering and 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.390
 begins to drop hordes of barbarians ok 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.610
 from behind as he mentioned archers 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.400
 and little by little the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.810
 work they break one have to go in 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000
 a particular moment in which the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.770
 mortar does not shoot since it can be 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.190
 fatal and the attack could look towards 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.710
 down 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.260
 here more barbarians 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.720
 see here to destroy the wizard towers 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.520
 which are the elementals of destroying 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.430
 first since it 's use splash and 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.740
 here the archers would destroy them 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.510
 little by little I am entering your village I am 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.800
 one was also on the other hand 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.540
 I decided to enter on behalf of the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.710
 resources where the mines and 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.690
 warehouses 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.130
 the barbarians are distracting 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.210
 mortars while the archers go 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.369
 shooting from behind 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.100
 the hell towers in these attacks do not 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.190
 They are very useful because they are big 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.090
 hordes are destroying them here I already did 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.050
 a percentage greater than 50 and I was 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:24.270
 destroying even more what are their 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.489
 resources and so you would have seen 135 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.280
 archers 99 and barbarians and 8 breaks walls 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.430
 with this the result of 55 percent 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.290
 they are glasses , few glasses are won because they do not 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.180
 you are in a village 100% less than 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.350
 come lightning but here is a 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.670
 example example of how they can achieve it 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.980
 Of course, the breaking walls must 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.890
 be level 5 the archers at least 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.620
 level 6 and the level 6 barbarians also 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.239
 if not the attack is not so precise here 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.370
 let's see another attack first I'm going to 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.640
 be here what the troops of the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 clan castle at this instant I put 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.630
 barbarians and breaks walls to see if there were 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.700
 more and I see that there is no attention 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.560
 of what the king is 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.450
 but first I will destroy what is the 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.970
 mortar here I will implement my kings 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.670
 and four ray teams to see 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.890
 also how they work they should put the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.900
 troops right where they're going to launch the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.470
 rays and that preferably in a mortar 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.519
 so that it does not destroy the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.130
 barbarians and what archers are 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.640
 here destroys the other flame a little the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.010
 attention of the kings only of the king 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.290
 mainly and I put you here 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.170
 accelerate it because it's a long process 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.700
 God takes away a little time but what 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.170
 you recover in the battle here loose my 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.299
 clan castle and they start doing the 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.370
 conflict with the king 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.560
 ok where I'm going to start 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.480
 drop what are barbarians so that 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.430
 go entering little by little too 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.590
 loose what is the king so that he goes away 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.739
 leading much of the attacks and 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.959
 the splash of some magician towers 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.640
 which are very low level 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.010
 here the queen archer also does very 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.380
 good job indeed I recommend them 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.079
 much that they improve it a high level already 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.720
 which is very efficient here and see the 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.209
 barbarians have already left because they are the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.069
 first to which the defenses go and 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.560
 whether they do just behind the queen 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.680
 it was hers and I destroyed here 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.820
 I'm with the town hall ' 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.160
 it's an easy idea and they can steal 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.500
 resources and glasses that little by little already 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.690
 that you do not steal so many glasses and neither 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.610
 you steal so many resources but 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.009
 I mainly want you to see what it is 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.370
 the technique and destroying villages with 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.530
 barbarians and archers, it did not happen 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.509
 everything I hope you liked and we 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.509
 we see until the next video bye
