it<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.049> like<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> 747<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:48.060> reality<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.810> we

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it was just like a 747 the reality is we

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.410 
it was just like a 747 the reality is we

that<00:02:44.080> turret<00:02:44.590> there<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> day<00:02:45.190> camera<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
that turret there is a day camera a

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.250 
that turret there is a day camera a
low-light<00:02:46.150> camera<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.720> an<00:02:46.840> infrared<00:02:47.140> camera

so<00:02:47.830> any<00:02:48.130> light<00:02:48.430> spectrum<00:02:49.000> we're<00:02:49.150> able<00:02:49.330> to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
so any light spectrum we're able to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.390 
so any light spectrum we're able to
operate<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.930> airplane<00:02:50.260> you'll<00:02:51.130> notice<00:02:51.370> some

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
operate this airplane you'll notice some

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.729 
operate this airplane you'll notice some
different<00:02:51.850> antennas<00:02:52.840> up<00:02:52.870> top<00:02:53.290> they<00:02:53.470> look<00:02:53.620> like

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
different antennas up top they look like

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.710 
different antennas up top they look like
footballs<00:02:54.010> those<00:02:54.459> are<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.730> c-band<00:02:55.090> antennas

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
footballs those are the c-band antennas

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.930 
footballs those are the c-band antennas
anytime<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.440> take<00:02:56.709> off<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.100> land<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.550> have<00:02:57.790> to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
anytime we take off and land we have to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.870 
anytime we take off and land we have to
have<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> data<00:02:58.330> link<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:59.050> field<00:02:59.620> somewhere<00:03:00.070> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
have a data link on field somewhere the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.490 
have a data link on field somewhere the
only<00:03:01.120> problem<00:03:01.390> with<00:03:01.570> K<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.320> there's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
only problem with K you is there's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.840 
only problem with K you is there's
what's<00:03:02.709> called<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.980> latency<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.520> delaying

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
what's called the latency of delaying

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.550 
what's called the latency of delaying
the<00:03:04.000> signal<00:03:04.360> of<00:03:04.450> upwards<00:03:04.810> of<00:03:04.930> two<00:03:05.080> seconds

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
the signal of upwards of two seconds

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.590 
the signal of upwards of two seconds
makes<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.070> landing<00:03:06.459> really<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.300> rodeo

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
makes a landing really like a rodeo

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.870 
makes a landing really like a rodeo
event<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.350> don't<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.860> when<00:03:09.700> we

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
event so we don't do that when we

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.820 
event so we don't do that when we
operate<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.360> c-band<00:03:10.750> frequency<00:03:11.320> range<00:03:11.590> it's

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
operate the c-band frequency range it's

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.440 
operate the c-band frequency range it's
real<00:03:12.040> time<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.610> in<00:03:12.730> other<00:03:12.790> words<00:03:13.000> if<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.239> make<00:03:13.420> a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
real time so in other words if I make a

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.600 
real time so in other words if I make a
control<00:03:13.780> input<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.320> happens<00:03:14.680> then<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.340> that's

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
control input it happens then and that's

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.250 
control input it happens then and that's
what<00:03:15.820> those<00:03:16.000> two<00:03:16.180> things<00:03:16.420> are<00:03:16.630> on<00:03:16.810> top<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
what those two things are on top and the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.539 
what those two things are on top and the
bottom<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.590> there's<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.799> transmitter<00:03:18.280> one<00:03:18.519> a

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549
