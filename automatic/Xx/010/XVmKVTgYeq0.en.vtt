00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.540

 particular gift of one of his 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 fanatics 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.540
 he had the luxury of singing what he wanted in 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.490
 his return to the chip thousand seven subjects 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.110
 themselves and other artists their 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.110
 fanatics like that I thanked him 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.199
 in full action and before more than 12,000 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.730
 rich free people rose the bra of 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.730
 one of his followers as a gift 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.559
 the best anecdote of the festival dispar the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.190
 that last night he gathered four idols of the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.190
 eighties pop 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.450
 Matica was responsible for opening the 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.210
 musical summit in the movistar arena 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.170
 although he disappointed a bit with his voice a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.170
 both spent 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.890
 many people 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.270
 an hour later I went on stage 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.380
 samantha fox perhaps the most awaited by 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.380
 the masculine 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.010
 mechanical effect and made the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.640
 demanding with classics like nations with 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.640
 touch 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.430
 she changed clothes four times in the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.430
 scheduled performance time 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.530
 of begin are returned to being 20 years old 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.690
 above this scenario 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.119
 and energy that he transmitted to each of 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.659
 the eighties who sang in chorus their 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.659
 radial hits 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.560
 the pop man went from less to more 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.869
 that was noticed when rick astley left 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.479
 clear that his voice keeps sounding like in 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.850
 his best years an hour and a half 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.950
 music to leave the audience satisfied 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:25.319
 of couple 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:25.319
 and much better 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.800
 trip to the past that had four and two 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.410
 the eighties together for the first time in 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.940
 Chile for many a debt settled with 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.940
 all this generation 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.220
