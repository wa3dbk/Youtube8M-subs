00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.890
 good time of the day dear lovers 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:12.509
 Chess is still nothing 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:17.070
 interesting but the opponent found three 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.369
 minutes to seize the center as it is not 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.369
 rewarded 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:30.029
 I exchange a little bit 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:33.949
 prevented him from developing and knight now 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.949
 now I want 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.770
 what to develop my horse but I don’t know 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.510
 whether to move the pawn forward first probably 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.780
 I will not because Santana does not issue so 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.469
 Now you can put the Shah Mardan 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.860
 you can strengthen your central pawn 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.860
 sit here nice yes probably here here 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.760
 he so is the length of the pawn ahead 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 you design 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.950
 know how to advantage in spaces 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 so it is not profitable for me to exchange money 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.420
 did vadim 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.020
 Sanan wall connector 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.689
 defended the pawn 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.810
 sark 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.810
 what to do 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.630
 I go to the figures here all the backup started and 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 I am threatening to meet here poker hir 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.800
 Nowhere on the sides can an elephant 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:21.120
 interferes with the short side maybe too 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:24.540
 maybe drove a knight while moving pawns 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.360
 here because I don't know what to do or maybe 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.360
 to be come 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.360
 this 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.880
 and his pawn on the pawn and I want to 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.230
 period we have so 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.230
 my rook played 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.950
 there can take, in principle, to take was 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:10.770
 in a hurry here it can even be a figure 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:14.120
 the figure fails to swap 2 rook so 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.930
 how is nothing threatening me here 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.930
 need to accelerate a little bit 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.269
 you can take it here and come pve 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.810
 the regime is still all my pieces are attacking except 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.810
 that horse 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.920
 this horse can also connect to 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.920
 attack and case 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.420
 the rival is catching up the mini in time 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.630
 was the beginning of bianco 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.790
 but I did not give him a squad ovation he is here 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:06.750
 plopped plopped in the end got 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:13.910
 such an uncomfortable position so he wants 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:18.620
 here are my elephant driven 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:23.010
 what can i answer 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:28.950
 it would be good if I put the check in 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:34.830
 he will take then I will take where he left then 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:39.140
 I put here the steps he is forced to take 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:45.620
 the horse and I come to the regime still there already 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:51.540
 I take the knight too with a queen and I can surrender 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:58.620
 utter defeat here now 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:05:02.000
 what do you need what pastor 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:08.030
 modish our opponent surrenders 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.410
 what happened here first rival 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.150
 moved pawns on the kingside 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.800
 for some reason at this time to capture the center and 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.760
 I have already appeared spatially 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.760
 small advantage 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:27.150
 at the expense of him his horse was 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.470
 and forced to develop on the edge of the board horse 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.440
 in the edge on the edge of the board the same bad yorker 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.030
 oval he himself still does not retire could 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:43.020
 castle short of no heroes 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.150
 i develop my figures he continue not 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.229
 rocker applause end up with the words I sat down here 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.150
 your queen and defended the pawn and he 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.100
 for some reason, the queen went back but of course 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.220
 fer is useless here but by 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.070
 at least he pressed on the d5 pawn and not 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.729
 it was possible to block it again 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.830
 marker 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.580
 now he has this opportunity not 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.759
 because when he flies horse horses 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.710
 and planted back and started moving pawns 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.409
 at this time, well, here it’s not floundering 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.749
 He knows what he is to do surgery 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:22.110
 no way in the end he was 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:24.180
 forced to hide and vertical and got 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.389
 such a combination in which the result 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.020
 who lost pawn what happens i 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.930
 I take here and he has to take it from us 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.999
 you it because the elephant at the expense of here 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.740
 another loses a pawn well and further already 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:43.219
 when two is okay from was open 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.949
 vertical and 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:49.919
 the cupcake is ready to break in this is a matter let's say 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:53.669
 so here is my winning technology 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.499
 position I found such a move here 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:07:00.569
 to come 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:07:03.749
 so as to connect the horse with tempo to 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:07.649
 attack exchange a horse panic and he 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:10.110
 did not begin to exchange in the end got another 

00:07:07.649 --> 00:07:14.430
 worse situation like this 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:18.899
 and here now he could probably not 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:21.330
 swim for example here if passed 

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:25.259
 here this horse would be lost in any 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:29.629
 case he lost everything here it would result in 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:29.629
 I had to give up thank you for your attention
