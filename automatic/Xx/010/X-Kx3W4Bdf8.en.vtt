did<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.019> mention<00:00:31.230> yellow<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.160> fourteen

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
did I mention yellow this is a fourteen

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.979 
did I mention yellow this is a fourteen
hundred<00:00:32.850> millimeter<00:00:33.239> version<00:00:33.420> which<00:00:33.750> means

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
hundred millimeter version which means

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.920 
hundred millimeter version which means
it's<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:35.040> wide<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> bigger

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it's this wide so this is the bigger

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
it's this wide so this is the bigger
heavier<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.579> something<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.090> make

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
heavier one which is something to make

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
heavier one which is something to make
me<00:00:39.809> happy<00:00:40.200> plus<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.590> got<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.739> lot<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> power<00:00:41.100> I

tried this yet let's try it

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.430 
tried this yet let's try it
Wow<00:00:45.989> hey<00:00:47.059> that's<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.450> than<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
Wow hey that's more than one to one I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.619 
Wow hey that's more than one to one I
can<00:00:49.710> tell<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.030> four<00:00:51.300> cell

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
can tell you that much it's a four cell

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
can tell you that much it's a four cell
plane<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.649> pad<00:00:53.190> lots<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.850> wing

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
plane so it's got pad lots of wing

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.889 
plane so it's got pad lots of wing
surface<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> nice<00:00:55.739> light<00:00:56.190> pick<00:00:56.879> wing<00:00:57.329> it

surface with a nice light pick wing it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.540 
surface with a nice light pick wing it
should<00:00:58.170> probably<00:00:58.379> float<00:00:58.949> around<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.520> there

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
should probably float around up there

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.810 
should probably float around up there
and<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:01.260> got<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> course<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> controls

the gear the tail wheel is cool

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.240 
the gear the tail wheel is cool
everything<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> real<00:01:16.710> plane<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
everything is like the real plane on

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.710 
everything is like the real plane on
this<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.610> wouldn't<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.909> too<00:01:18.090> surprised<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> find

this I wouldn't be too surprised to find

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.230 
this I wouldn't be too surprised to find
some<00:01:18.960> middle<00:01:19.350> tubes<00:01:19.740> inside<00:01:20.280> stretched

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
some middle tubes inside stretched

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.830 
some middle tubes inside stretched
fabric<00:01:21.689> over<00:01:22.439> them<00:01:23.299> so<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.420> you've<00:01:24.570> ever<00:01:24.720> seen

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
fabric over them so if you've ever seen

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.330 
fabric over them so if you've ever seen
one<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.259> six<00:01:25.650> shows<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:26.040> an<00:01:26.159> airshow

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
one of those six shows at an airshow

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
one of those six shows at an airshow
with<00:01:26.970> some<00:01:27.330> guy<00:01:27.509> flying<00:01:28.140> upside<00:01:28.619> down<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

backwards and sitting in the wrong seat

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.149 
backwards and sitting in the wrong seat
and<00:01:30.990> stuff<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.590> probably<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and stuff like that's probably one of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.730 
and stuff like that's probably one of
these<00:01:32.280> let's<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
these let's see if we can do that the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.260 
these let's see if we can do that the
vertigo<00:01:36.020> right<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> rub<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.299> Oh<00:01:41.240> aren't<00:01:42.240> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
vertigo right so rub with Oh aren't you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.800 
vertigo right so rub with Oh aren't you
gonna<00:01:42.450> check<00:01:42.780> your<00:01:42.960> tail<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.439> me<00:01:43.490> you're<00:01:44.490> not

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
gonna check your tail for me you're not

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.109 
gonna check your tail for me you're not
alone<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.259> plane<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.790> very

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
alone on this plane you have to be very

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.090 
alone on this plane you have to be very
gentle<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> rudder<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.619> you're<00:01:49.770> taking

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
gentle on the rudder when you're taking

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.560 
gentle on the rudder when you're taking
off<00:01:50.250> tiny<00:01:50.759> tiny<00:01:51.299> little<00:01:51.509> touches

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.450 

this<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.930> with<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.140> tad<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.860> nose<00:01:58.130> weight

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
this is it with a tad of nose weight

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.530 
this is it with a tad of nose weight
added<00:01:58.730> I<00:01:59.120> think<00:01:59.300> 40<00:02:00.290> grams<00:02:00.620> or<00:02:01.010> something<00:02:01.540> it's

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
added I think 40 grams or something it's

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.380 
added I think 40 grams or something it's
nice-looking<00:02:03.320> little<00:02:04.130> clean<00:02:04.580> isn't<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.120> yes

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
nice-looking little clean isn't it yes

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.720 
nice-looking little clean isn't it yes
it<00:02:05.660> look<00:02:05.780> really<00:02:06.050> very<00:02:06.080> very<00:02:06.800> realistic<00:02:07.400> and

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
it look really very very realistic and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.969 
it look really very very realistic and
also<00:02:08.119> doesn't<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.810> look<00:02:08.960> realistic<00:02:09.619> like

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
also doesn't it look realistic like

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.710 
also doesn't it look realistic like
really<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.490> way<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.880> flies<00:02:11.240> in<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.510> air

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
really the way that it flies in the air

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.830 
really the way that it flies in the air
the<00:02:12.170> way<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.530> flies<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> air<00:02:13.840> yeah

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the way that it flies in the air yeah

a<00:02:26.600> power<00:02:27.600> loop<00:02:28.080> done<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.190> cup<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:34.190> suite

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
a power loop done in a cup you can suite

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.330 
a power loop done in a cup you can suite
just<00:02:37.170> what<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.410> supposed<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:38.010> look<00:02:38.280> at
