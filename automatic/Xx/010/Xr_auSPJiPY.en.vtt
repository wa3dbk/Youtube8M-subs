00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.500 

these<00:00:01.530> are<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.920> what<00:00:02.760> we're<00:00:02.939> calling<00:00:03.120> paper

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
these are the what we're calling paper

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.570 
these are the what we're calling paper
flowers<00:00:04.080> they're<00:00:04.410> just<00:00:04.620> circles<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.370> tissue

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
flowers they're just circles of tissue

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.540 
flowers they're just circles of tissue
paper<00:00:06.109> which<00:00:07.109> I've<00:00:07.319> smeared<00:00:07.649> paper<00:00:08.069> clay<00:00:08.309> on

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
paper which I've smeared paper clay on

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.549 
paper which I've smeared paper clay on
it's<00:00:08.760> dried<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.420> then<00:00:09.719> what<00:00:10.050> I've<00:00:10.170> been<00:00:10.320> doing

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
it's dried and then what I've been doing

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.600 
it's dried and then what I've been doing
is<00:00:10.650> putting<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.130> back

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
is putting on the back

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.020 
is putting on the back
tissue<00:00:12.210> paper<00:00:12.389> which<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.769> then<00:00:14.030> been

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
tissue paper which I have then been

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
tissue paper which I have then been
painting<00:00:15.630> over<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> PVA<00:00:16.470> glue<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.130> it's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
painting over with a PVA glue so it's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.980 
painting over with a PVA glue so it's
got<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.699> lovely<00:00:18.529> translucency<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
got this lovely translucency to it but a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.570 
got this lovely translucency to it but a
little<00:00:21.990> bit<00:00:22.080> too<00:00:22.260> big<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.830> what<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.490> this

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
little bit too big so what I do at this

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.589 
little bit too big so what I do at this
stage<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.859> very<00:00:25.970> roughly<00:00:26.970> tear<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
stage is just very roughly tear it

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.179 
stage is just very roughly tear it
around<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.260> edge<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:30.109> that<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.289> goes<00:00:31.920> more

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
around the edge so that it goes more

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.420 
around the edge so that it goes more
more<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.610> line<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.410> roughness<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.590> what

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
more in line with the roughness of what

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.220 
more in line with the roughness of what
I'm<00:00:35.550> trying<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> create<00:00:36.300> which<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> sort<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I'm trying to create which is a sort of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.270 
I'm trying to create which is a sort of
impression<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.860> flower<00:00:38.930> really<00:00:40.760> like<00:00:42.170> and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
impression or flower really like and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.630 
impression or flower really like and
then<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.610> using<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.800> liquid<00:00:46.800> acrylic<00:00:47.250> gesso

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
then I'm using a liquid acrylic gesso

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.279 
then I'm using a liquid acrylic gesso
and<00:00:48.289> what<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:51.289> thickly

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and what I'm going to do is just thickly

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.639 
and what I'm going to do is just thickly
paint<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.780> quite<00:00:54.780> quickly<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
paint on quite quickly so that it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.799 
paint on quite quickly so that it
actually<00:00:56.070> leaves<00:00:56.340> I'll<00:00:57.000> show<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> sec

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.980 

quite<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> trail<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:02.000> paint<00:01:04.549> there<00:01:05.810> then<00:01:06.810> it's

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
quite a trail of paint there then it's

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320 
quite a trail of paint there then it's
going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.380> left<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> dry<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.580> when<00:01:09.180> it's

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
going to be left to dry and when it's

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
going to be left to dry and when it's
dry<00:01:09.590> I've<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:11.479> an<00:01:12.479> old<00:01:12.780> paint<00:01:13.110> brush<00:01:13.350> which

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
dry I've got an old paint brush which

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
dry I've got an old paint brush which
I'm<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.790> dip<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.479> resin<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I'm going to dip into the resin and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
I'm going to dip into the resin and
paint<00:01:16.890> over<00:01:17.100> I've<00:01:18.030> also<00:01:18.270> got<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.670> lot<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> these

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
paint over I've also got a lot of these

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.780 
paint over I've also got a lot of these
ready<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:22.950> also<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> dip

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
ready now which I'm also going to dip

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.410 
ready now which I'm also going to dip
into<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> resin<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.630> paint<00:01:24.840> over<00:01:25.369> possibly

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
into the resin and paint over possibly

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
into the resin and paint over possibly
two<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.509> three<00:01:27.630> times<00:01:27.810> we'll<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
two or three times we'll have to see the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
two or three times we'll have to see the
trick<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> end<00:01:30.810> bits

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
trick is not to get it in the end bits

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.929 
trick is not to get it in the end bits
because<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.740> don't<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> resin<00:01:32.400> which<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> also

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
because we don't the resin which is also

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.980 
because we don't the resin which is also
a<00:01:32.970> glue<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.990> stick<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> wood<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:36.210> did

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
a glue to stick it to the wood and I did

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
a glue to stick it to the wood and I did
have<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> trick<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.220> put<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
have a trick which was to put all the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
have a trick which was to put all the
kebab<00:01:39.090> sticks<00:01:39.390> onto<00:01:39.720> plastic<00:01:39.900> drinking

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
kebab sticks onto plastic drinking

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.639 
kebab sticks onto plastic drinking
straws<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> don't<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.170> they'd<00:01:43.290> fit<00:01:43.500> on

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
straws but I don't think they'd fit on

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.030 
straws but I don't think they'd fit on
the<00:01:43.770> end<00:01:43.799> actually<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.670> these<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the end actually of these so that's the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
the end actually of these so that's the
sort<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.390> technique<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.570> revise<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:50.549> after

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
sort of technique to revise so after

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
sort of technique to revise so after
that<00:01:52.100> what<00:01:53.100> I'm<00:01:53.220> also<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.790> do<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:55.040> just

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that what I'm also going to do is just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.260 
that what I'm also going to do is just
develop<00:01:56.939> these<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> little<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:58.040> with<00:01:59.040> this

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
develop these a little more with this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
develop these a little more with this
paragraph<00:02:00.270> II<00:02:00.600> thingy<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.649> can<00:02:01.829> take<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
paragraph II thingy you can take that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.730 
paragraph II thingy you can take that
off<00:02:02.189> actually<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.810> necessary

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.020 

and<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.920> why<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.129> sitting<00:02:08.310> by<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> open

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and that's why I'm sitting by the open

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.500 
and that's why I'm sitting by the open
door<00:02:09.239> because<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:11.790> will<00:02:12.030> burn

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
door because it will burn

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.589 
door because it will burn
nicely<00:02:14.510> all<00:02:15.230> away<00:02:17.290> around<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.650> edge<00:02:19.599> whatever

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
nicely all away around the edge whatever

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.770 
nicely all away around the edge whatever
you<00:02:20.810> happen<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.110> want<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:24.560> idea<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:24.980> to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
you happen to want it so the idea is to

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.690 
you happen to want it so the idea is to
get<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.230> marks<00:02:27.800> into<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:31.069> careful<00:02:31.430> not<00:02:31.550> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
get the marks into the be careful not to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.920 
get the marks into the be careful not to
burn<00:02:31.900> your<00:02:32.900> fingers<00:02:39.489> coming<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.730> really<00:02:41.239> very

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
burn your fingers coming on really very

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.160 
burn your fingers coming on really very
nicely<00:02:42.200> indeed<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.940> all<00:02:47.150> about<00:02:47.360> suggestion

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
nicely indeed it's all about suggestion

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.240 
nicely indeed it's all about suggestion
and<00:02:48.380> not<00:02:48.709> about<00:02:49.010> actually<00:02:49.870> being<00:02:50.870> very

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
and not about actually being very

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.280 
and not about actually being very
single-minded<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.760> laboring<00:02:53.239> hard<00:02:53.290> to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
single-minded and laboring hard to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.630 
single-minded and laboring hard to
create<00:02:54.530> something<00:02:54.860> which<00:02:55.130> looks<00:02:55.430> exactly

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
create something which looks exactly

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.890 
create something which looks exactly
like<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:57.340> flock<00:02:58.340> never<00:02:59.120> seen<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.450> flower<00:02:59.630> look

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
like a flock never seen a flower look

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.690 
like a flock never seen a flower look
like<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.260> anyway<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.780> can<00:03:02.959> also<00:03:03.140> just

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
like this anyway and you can also just

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.770 
like this anyway and you can also just
because<00:03:04.700> they're<00:03:04.970> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.180> be<00:03:05.269> coated<00:03:05.540> in

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
because they're going to be coated in

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.920 
because they're going to be coated in
resin<00:03:06.549> poke<00:03:07.549> little<00:03:07.760> holes<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:09.470> tool<00:03:10.780> from<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
resin poke little holes in tool from the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.960 
resin poke little holes in tool from the
front<00:03:12.200> or<00:03:12.470> from<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.340> back<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:14.360> back<00:03:14.630> also<00:03:15.970> can

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
front or from the back the back also can

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:30.610 
front or from the back the back also can
have<00:03:17.120> marks<00:03:17.540> made<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.900> when<00:03:30.049> they<00:03:30.230> overlay

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
have marks made and when they overlay

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.840 
have marks made and when they overlay
each<00:03:30.799> other<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.609> they're<00:03:32.390> stuck<00:03:32.810> down<00:03:33.140> onto

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
each other and they're stuck down onto

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.699 
each other and they're stuck down onto
the<00:03:34.850> mille<00:03:35.209> gum<00:03:35.480> oh<00:03:35.810> it's<00:03:36.320> not<00:03:36.410> corn<00:03:36.620> really

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
the mille gum oh it's not corn really

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.580 
the mille gum oh it's not corn really
gomez<00:03:37.130> it's<00:03:37.340> called<00:03:37.489> milli<00:03:37.700> pot<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.420> think<00:03:39.350> I

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
gomez it's called milli pot I think I

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.349 
gomez it's called milli pot I think I
could<00:03:39.739> look<00:03:39.859> really<00:03:40.959> okay<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:43.030> if<00:03:44.030> they<00:03:44.180> don't

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
could look really okay and if they don't

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.880 
could look really okay and if they don't
well<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.989> scrap<00:03:45.230> yeah<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.440> do<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.769> try

well just scrap yeah I do and try

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.000 
well just scrap yeah I do and try
something<00:03:46.160> else<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:46.640> I'm<00:03:47.540> 99%<00:03:48.260> sure<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.890> all

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
something else but I'm 99% sure it's all

00:03:49.010 --> 00:04:11.170 
something else but I'm 99% sure it's all
gonna<00:03:49.130> be<00:03:49.310> fine

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.899 

so<00:04:12.180> facts<00:04:12.450> like<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> fronts<00:04:14.700> like

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
so facts like that and the fronts like

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.629 
so facts like that and the fronts like
that<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:16.190> what<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.430> also<00:04:17.609> do<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.680> just<00:04:19.680> go

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
that and what I can also do is just go

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.990 
that and what I can also do is just go
in<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.600> little<00:04:21.750> bit<00:04:23.570> here<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.690> there<00:04:26.000> because

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
in a little bit here and there because

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.969 
in a little bit here and there because
some<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.330> them<00:04:27.479> can<00:04:27.660> be<00:04:27.780> just<00:04:28.139> gently<00:04:28.590> touched

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
some of them can be just gently touched

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.420 
some of them can be just gently touched
with<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.580> burning<00:04:30.590> look<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.310> some<00:04:33.210> can<00:04:33.449> be

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
with the burning look and some can be

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.050 
with the burning look and some can be
quite<00:04:36.110> intensely<00:04:37.110> done<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.699> going<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.970> be

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
quite intensely done this is going to be

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.610 
quite intensely done this is going to be
more<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.300> an<00:04:39.449> intense<00:04:39.780> one<00:04:40.139> I<00:04:40.169> think<00:04:42.620> wings

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
more of an intense one I think wings

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.040 
more of an intense one I think wings
getting<00:04:44.070> up<00:04:44.220> which<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> good<00:04:45.240> idea<00:04:45.360> isn't<00:04:45.810> it

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
getting up which is a good idea isn't it

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.240 
getting up which is a good idea isn't it
there<00:04:47.039> how<00:04:47.669> about<00:04:47.699> that<00:04:49.039> good

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
there how about that good

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.210 
there how about that good
okay<00:04:51.180> I'm<00:04:51.660> gonna<00:04:51.960> then<00:04:52.229> coat<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.680> with<00:04:52.800> resin

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
okay I'm gonna then coat it with resin

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.540 
okay I'm gonna then coat it with resin
and<00:04:53.460> leave<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.330> dry<00:04:54.530> overnight<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.919> maybe

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
and leave it to dry overnight and maybe

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.760 
and leave it to dry overnight and maybe
then<00:04:56.910> I'll<00:04:57.030> have<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.240> do<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.449> backside<00:04:57.870> by

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
then I'll have to do the backside by

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.189 
then I'll have to do the backside by
then<00:04:58.979> it'll<00:04:59.250> be<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.610> really<00:05:00.300> interesting<00:05:00.630> piece

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
then it'll be a really interesting piece

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.800 
then it'll be a really interesting piece
to<00:05:01.710> work<00:05:02.039> with<00:05:04.430> what<00:05:05.430> else<00:05:05.610> that's<00:05:06.479> about<00:05:06.630> it

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
to work with what else that's about it

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.900 
to work with what else that's about it
really

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
really

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.050 
really
I'd<00:05:08.910> quite<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.389> just<00:05:10.610> going<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.760> hit

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
I'd quite like to just going to hit

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.260 
I'd quite like to just going to hit
these<00:05:12.240> again<00:05:12.919> just<00:05:13.919> to<00:05:14.330> intensify<00:05:15.330> them<00:05:17.270> I'm

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
these again just to intensify them I'm

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.649 
these again just to intensify them I'm
just<00:05:18.479> going<00:05:18.659> into<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:20.120> into<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.270> little

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
just going into the into the little

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.990 
just going into the into the little
holes<00:05:21.930> like<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.470> I'm<00:05:22.650> leaving<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.190> unwitting

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
holes like that I'm leaving it unwitting

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.110 
holes like that I'm leaving it unwitting
it<00:05:24.150> in<00:05:24.560> just<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.740> makes<00:05:25.979> quite<00:05:26.550> dark

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
it in just it makes quite dark

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.170 
it in just it makes quite dark
impressions<00:05:28.220> because<00:05:29.220> it's<00:05:29.520> all<00:05:29.789> gonna<00:05:29.970> be

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
impressions because it's all gonna be

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.909 
impressions because it's all gonna be
this<00:05:30.360> one<00:05:30.599> is<00:05:30.720> all<00:05:30.840> going<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.050> be<00:05:31.139> about<00:05:31.289> sepia

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
this one is all going to be about sepia

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.089 
this one is all going to be about sepia
and<00:05:32.539> burnt<00:05:33.539> which<00:05:34.289> is<00:05:34.500> sepia<00:05:35.039> and<00:05:36.830> silver<00:05:37.830> and

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
and burnt which is sepia and silver and

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.649 
and burnt which is sepia and silver and
copper<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:39.139> think<00:05:40.139> that's<00:05:40.289> gonna<00:05:40.530> look<00:05:40.710> good<00:05:41.659> so

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
copper I think that's gonna look good so

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.580 
copper I think that's gonna look good so
I<00:05:42.690> haven't<00:05:42.810> done<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.050> back<00:05:43.199> yet

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
I haven't done the back yet

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.540 
I haven't done the back yet
I<00:05:43.620> don't<00:05:43.830> think<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:43.979> need<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:44.220> do<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.430> back

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
I don't think I need to do the back

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.110 
I don't think I need to do the back
because<00:05:44.699> I<00:05:45.060> might<00:05:45.870> put<00:05:46.860> some<00:05:46.889> Mille<00:05:47.520> pot<00:05:47.820> on

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
because I might put some Mille pot on
