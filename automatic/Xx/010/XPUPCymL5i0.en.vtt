 well we hope a little more 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.079
 here load the game 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.110
 and we are here 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.110
 inside the game 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.970
 let's go outside 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.860
 and good once out what they are going to 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.080
 to do is to hit the back button 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.080
 to exit to configurations 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.220
 we give options 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.150
 let's go back to everything because 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.150
 you will have it in English at 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.710
 configurations so they go up 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.980
 until the last option 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.940
 and here you select your language 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.150
 This would be Spanish Spanish 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.920
 once done that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.599
 and we go 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.599
 to screen settings 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.920
 Here the brightness that will come by 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:21.000
 default by at 30 or at 50 what they have 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.510
 what to do is increase it to 100 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.500
 here in visual effects you to you 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.820
 will come on high 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.860
 they're going to put it in low in resolution what 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.530
 they put at their whim although I recommend them 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.530
 make it between 50 and 30 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.390
 Here in shadow we give you no 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.360
 reflection of the car in low captions and 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.570
 well that we are going to put back left 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.570
 there 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.810
 here in games 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.110
 the traffic they have 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.230
 aim would be the free aim that 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.370
 you can point or blocked that would be 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.519
 turns off 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.359
 press the shoot button and you're 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.449
 point out that here we go you want to just leave 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.449
 there 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.860
 and well they almost have the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.860
 basic configurations that would be 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.060
 in the game 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.190
