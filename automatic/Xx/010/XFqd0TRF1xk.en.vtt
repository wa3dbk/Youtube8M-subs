00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 more 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.460
 two new meteorological phenomena 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.169
 have appeared by 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.620
 the canton climate phenomenon worry 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:14.570
 el niño cyclone atu remains very active 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.640
 and reading often hears the media 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.369
 talk about el niño year and risk 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.939
 cyclonic for French Polynesia 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:27.679
 what is this phenomenon el niño et niño 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.480
 is the name of the child jesus in spanish 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.029
 this name is given a warm ocean current 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.010
 which appears every three to six seven 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.289
 years on the coasts of south america 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.219
 running from north to south the equator the 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.899
 Peru and Chile 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.239
 between Christmas and April 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.360
 the appearance of this hot el niño current 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.579
 cause the decrease of the orderly so the 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.500
 decrease in endangered fish 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.949
 fishing enterprises in Peru and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.199
 Chile 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.730
 on the other hand it brings rains 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.949
 abundant on the wise plains of the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.660
 peru and the equator which increases 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.940
 those years the agricultural productions 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.920
 this current el niño on the coasts 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.390
 of South America is actually one of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.340
 signs of a much more phenomenon 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.730
 expanse that touches the entire ocean 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.730
 peaceful 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.240
 in normal year the situation is the 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.280
 following there is a difference of 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.759
 atmospheric pressure between the east coast 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.920
 from the south pacific and the west coast to the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.180
 latitude of the equator and peru se 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.979
 place high pressures 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.070
 while on indonesia and australia 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.689
 lie low pressures 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.860
 trade winds blow high 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.299
 pressures to low pressures 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.950
 from east to west 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.720
 the greater the pressure difference is 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 big plus the trade winds are strong 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.530
 crossing the Pacific Ocean 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.320
 the trade winds takes care of moisture at 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.450
 contact the hot surface of the ocean in 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.100
 rising hot and humid air 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.500
 cools and causes strong 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.729
 rainfall 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 on the other hand the surface waters of the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.590
 Pacific are pushed by the trade winds of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.580
 east to the west 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.770
 hot waters a temperature 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.840
 greater than 28 degrees centigrade 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.409
 accumulate in the western part of the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560
 peaceful 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.060
 forming a large hot water tank 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.789
 this explains the abundant rains on 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.319
 the philippines indonesia papua 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.970
 new Guinea 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.060
 south east asia and north of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.489
 australia the sea level is then of 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.260
 30 to 70 cm higher in the part 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.860
 west of the pacific as in the party 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.480
 is 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.190
 this gives birth to a current 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.200
 submarine that brings water up 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.340
 cold located deep down the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.530
 south american coast 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.780
 this rise of cold water is called m 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.190
 veling she threatened schrey on the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.290
 coast of chile and peru 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.670
 every three or six years this 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 atmospheric and oceanic circulation 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.100
 is disturbed by the phenomenon el niño 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.660
 the trade winds lose their strength on the 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.790
 center and west of the Pacific Ocean 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.440
 because of the increase in the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.880
 atmospheric pressure on australia 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.830
 and Indonesia 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.989
 this weakening of the trade winds has for 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.859
 consequence the shift of the rains 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.209
 further east on the central pacific 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.200
 the weakening of the trade winds has also 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.359
 as a consequence of suppressing 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.090
 the accumulation of hot water on the 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.250
 west pacific coasts the current 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.720
 cold underwater are no longer formed and 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.299
 the upwell of cold water on the surface 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.250
 veling disappears on the coast of Peru 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.989
 and from the equator the ribs of 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.700
 australia of indonesia know 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.709
 periods of severe drought and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.810
 risks of fire on the coasts of 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.970
 peru and the equator water surface 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.739
 there is hotter and deeper than 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.290
 normal this favors evaporation 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.510
 heavy rainfall is falling 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.269
 on the eastern shores of the Pacific until 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.459
 center of the Pacific Ocean 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.630
 the operation is therefore the following 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.670
 when the atmospheric pressure increases 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.180
 west of the Pacific off the coast 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.100
 australia 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.959
 it is decreasing east off 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.510
 South America and vice versa 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.880
 we're talking about Southern Oscillation that or 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.130
 turn also the chains associated with el 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.660
 niño the whole phenomenon carries the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.660
 scientific name of enzo 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.190
 the el niño phenomenon is an anomaly 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.340
 in the atmospheric circulation 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.110
 general his appearance of places the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.730
 precipitation zones from west to 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.770
 eastern pacific ocean 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.760
 abundant rains water the ribs 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.000
 south america 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.500
 usually marked by drought 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.270
 and the niño stops the upwelling 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.430
 cold along the american coast of 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.200
 south drying up food for them 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.420
 very abundant fish in this area 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.210
 in normal times it is a disaster 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.070
 for the fishermen inversely the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.870
 usually wet regions australia 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.580
 and indonesia know great 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.980
 drought and serious risks of 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.900
 fires of cyclones are formed on 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.830
 overheated waters in the eastern part 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.930
 pacific 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.280
 outside their usual route and 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.750
 touches French Polynesia 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.020
 normally spared 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.820
 thus during the year el niño 1983 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.390
 French poetry was touched by 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.530
 five cyclones nano in january orama en 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.170
 February 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.570
 dreaming in march lucky january in april 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.880
 making about fifteen victims and 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.020
 considerable damage 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.060
 other cyclone passages on the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:04.930
 French Polynesia correspond to 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:11.170
 el niño years in 1987-88 1997-98 2002 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:13.960
 2003 and in 2009 2010 in 1997 98 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.560
 there were 12 tropical storms and 8 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.400
 tropical cyclones oceans in 1997 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.880
 destroyed the island of maupiti to 95% in bed in 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.110
 2010 destroyed tubuai island 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.790
 some years instead of a return to 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.460
 the normal after a year online at 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.980
 pontoon in excess reverses a year 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.520
 cold called the niña succeeds to a 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.310
 hot year 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.810
 el niño la niña is characterized by a 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.520
 accumulation of cold water in the 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.620
 pacific off south america 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.870
 for fishermen from Peru and Chile 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.250
 it's a bargain with the return of 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.990
 more fish 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.690
 the rainfall distribution is 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.580
 so modified the niña concentrate the 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.820
 rains over australia and accentuates the 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.100
 drought the Polynesian archipelagos 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.340
 the niña is not automatically a 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.420
 episode el niño in the twentieth century for 25 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.820
 episode el niño 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.820
 there are only 17 episodes the niña 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.270
 how is Polynesia concerned 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.270
 by the phenomenon el niño la niña 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.960
 outside the el niño periods 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.360
 cyclones are rare in the eastern part 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.870
 of the Pacific where is the Polynesia 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.290
 French 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:28.260
 on the other hand in period el niño the risk 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.540
 cyclonic is real with the phenomenon the 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.090
 niña the rainy season is disturbed 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.380
 Droughts are common in 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.780
 atolls the drying up of the tablecloths 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.540
 phreatic accelerates in Polynesia 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.010
 French municipalities lack water it 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.720
 is important to spot the signs 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.200
 precursors of phenomena el niño la 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.270

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.640
 meteorological data and 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.230
 oceanographic data collected by 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.810
 national observation systems and 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.040
 international monitoring allows to monitor 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.240
 see the episodes 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:59.120
 el niño the niña el niño la niña are at 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.169
 the origin of major natural hazards 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.669
 could you find them with your
