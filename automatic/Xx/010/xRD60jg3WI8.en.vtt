just going to cut out some semi circles

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
just going to cut out some semi circles
on<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.969> semicircle<00:00:33.329> I'm<00:00:33.930> gonna<00:00:34.200> mark<00:00:34.530> where

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
on the semicircle I'm gonna mark where

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
on the semicircle I'm gonna mark where
the<00:00:34.860> center<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> compass<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the center is you can use a compass and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
the center is you can use a compass and
and<00:00:36.960> make<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> circle<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.670> cut<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.270> in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and make a circle and then cut it in

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
and make a circle and then cut it in
half<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.680> gonna<00:00:40.920> mark<00:00:41.190> where<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
half and but I'm gonna mark where the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
half and but I'm gonna mark where the
center<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:42.660> gonna<00:00:42.809> mark<00:00:43.200> like

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
center is and then I'm gonna mark like

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.139 
center is and then I'm gonna mark like
where<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> would<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> fold<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.120> whole

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
where I would like to fold the whole

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.220 
where I would like to fold the whole
line<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.410> once<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:50.000> as<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.930> take

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
line so once I have that as I would take

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.060 
line so once I have that as I would take
the<00:00:52.500> circle<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.379> kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.559> bend<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> little

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the circle and kind of bend it a little

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.700 
the circle and kind of bend it a little
bit<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.030> cardboard<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.780> bend<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.379> bit

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
bit the cardboard I bend it a little bit

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.209 
bit the cardboard I bend it a little bit
so<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.010> more<00:00:59.210> pliable<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.949> then<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.070> will

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
so it's more pliable and then I will

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.700 
so it's more pliable and then I will
bend<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.699> around<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.239> where<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.539> mark<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
bend it around to where the mark is so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
bend it around to where the mark is so
it<00:01:04.920> makes<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.339> cone<00:01:05.600> then<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> would<00:01:06.810> take<00:01:06.990> some

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it makes a cone then I would take some

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
it makes a cone then I would take some
hot<00:01:07.380> glue<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:09.000> glue<00:01:09.930> inside<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:11.630> stick

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
hot glue and and glue inside here stick

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.000 
hot glue and and glue inside here stick
it<00:01:12.750> over<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.350> glue<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.740> inside

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it over there and then glue it inside

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.810 
it over there and then glue it inside
over<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.799> sure<00:01:16.950> everything<00:01:17.369> holds

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
over here to make sure everything holds

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.560 
over here to make sure everything holds
together<00:01:19.490> then<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> take<00:01:21.509> a
