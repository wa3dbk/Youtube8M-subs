00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.269
 we stayed in the sections now 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.790
 we go to the folder to download the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.239
 file we mark it 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.819

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.099
 in this way you are going to remove the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.620
 Two doves that do not say writing europe 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:50.800
 and writing others must come from this 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.800
 way once done we see in accept 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.110
 and restart the device 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.110
 but before that we're going to see what 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.890

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.600
