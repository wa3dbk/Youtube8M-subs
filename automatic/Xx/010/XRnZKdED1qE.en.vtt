 you will see more clear news from cf 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.250
 but also has a curious case of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.469
 digital security that happened there in 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.460
 australia then it turns on that it was 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.460
 stay current 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.310
 Let's start the news of this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.070
 friday with cs ending today 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.490
 there are some vegas in the united states to zte 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.279
 exhibited a modular smartphone concept 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.829
 he calls himself is obvious and was shown 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.930
 behind a glass cover the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.040
 visitors could not check the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.290
 Details 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.590
 the design provides that all components 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.550
 can be embedded in a structure of 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.440
 plastic 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.059
 so the user can replace the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.149
 component modules 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.969
 zte clarified that the company is not 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.649
 developing a smartphone so in this 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.600
 moment when everything indicates the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.239
 The company's engineers work to 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.770
 overcome any difficulties encountered by a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.379
 project like this 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 for curiosity the motorola is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.610
 another company that works with this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.000
 concept of modular smart phones and the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990
 own cf when displaying a pc project 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 modular 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.820
 so whats the curiosity you there? 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 believes that the future of technology can 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 be modulated from taking parts 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 caterpillar has launched the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 qat is the mobile phone that does not have 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.430
 top line configuration too much 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.189
 Contrary but he can handle every quiet 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.009
 only the appliance has metal edges 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.140
 to withstand falls of up to in meter and 80 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.119
 inches in height and can be 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.680
 plunged into different types of 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.020
 liquids up to one meter deep 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.600
 for half an hour 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.759
 it has wide buttons so it can be 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.090
 operated by workers wearing gloves for 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.140
 example the 2.2-inch screen with 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 resolution of 320 by 240 pixels 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.880
 the camera is 3 megapixel resolution 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.950
 so by the settings you can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.200
 realize that it was meant to be 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.039
 used in harsh workplaces 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.459
 for example 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.470
 still in cs amd presented the prototype 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.860
 from nano 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.230
 is an ultra-sharp computer with the new 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.640
 the company ApeÃº technology that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.290
 mothers day 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.020
 the device displayed has ssd of 256 gb 2 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.120
 gb ram camera bluetooth wi fi connection 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.820
 and an accessory that adds a 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.220
 usb port and an hdmi 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.410
 The curious thing about the presentation is that the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.990
 computer ran a match of 14 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.970
 in 1080p resolution 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.490
 this is a prototype so it does not have 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.740
 forecast to reach the market and our 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.160
 channel on youtube has several videos with 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.130
 cool news from this cs 2014 that is 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.200
 finishing one of them shows edson a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.020
 computer the size of a 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.510
 sd card that can control the most 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.550
 various types of electronic devices 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.790
 and our team in las vegas also 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.310
 checked closely how the auto works 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.950
 lg flex regeneration 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.050
 this model is capable of simply 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.340
 eliminate scratches on the back only 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.440
 receiving heat 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.180
 these are just two tips but our 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.700
 channel is full of videos as well 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.850
 interesting for you to check 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.450
 update for galaxy s 4 should give 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.590
 a new interface is the device that 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.800
 possibility arose from 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.060
 screenshots of a 4 s running what 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.980
 seems to be version 4.4 of android 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.430
 other catches show that the device 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.049
 performance with this update 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.120
 according to some operators 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.790
 this accident must begin to be 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.370
 distributed at the end of January 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.330

 in Australia a young man of 16 years 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.890
 has detected a vulnerability on the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.200
 transportation department 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.209
