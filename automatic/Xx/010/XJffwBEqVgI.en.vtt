back into your ponytail and for a
shining<00:02:33.820> at<00:02:34.060> finish<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.290> go<00:02:35.440> through<00:02:35.769> and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
shining at finish you can go through and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.740 
shining at finish you can go through and
spray<00:02:36.310> directly<00:02:36.519> onto<00:02:37.000> your<00:02:37.180> scalp

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.240 

and<00:02:40.870> from<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.380> thing<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.920> should<00:02:42.100> go

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
and from that thing it should go

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.360 
and from that thing it should go
straight<00:02:42.550> on<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.850> tuna<00:02:43.150> fish<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:45.190> what<00:02:45.340> I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
straight on to the tuna fish so what I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.000 
straight on to the tuna fish so what I
like<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.850> do<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.570> take<00:02:46.960> a<00:02:47.230> quite<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.710> large

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
like to do is take a quite a large

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.880 
like to do is take a quite a large
section<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.930> looks<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.200> little<00:02:50.380> bit<00:02:50.650> more

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
section so it looks a little bit more

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.290 
section so it looks a little bit more
formal<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:52.480> cover<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.930> band<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.970> maybe<00:02:55.180> a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
formal and to cover the band so maybe a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:09.840 
formal and to cover the band so maybe a
three<00:02:55.570> centimeter<00:02:55.870> section<00:03:08.340> any<00:03:09.340> brush<00:03:09.670> will

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
three centimeter section any brush will

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.490 
three centimeter section any brush will
do<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:11.410> item<00:03:11.830> two<00:03:11.950> like<00:03:12.100> that

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
do the item two like that

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.100 
do the item two like that
and<00:03:14.500> you're<00:03:14.620> gonna<00:03:14.800> have<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.520> bobby<00:03:16.300> pin<00:03:16.390> handy

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
and you're gonna have a bobby pin handy

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.610 
and you're gonna have a bobby pin handy
and<00:03:18.040> then<00:03:18.190> you're<00:03:18.310> gonna<00:03:18.400> proceed<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.060> wrap<00:03:19.620> in

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
and then you're gonna proceed to wrap in

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.010 
and then you're gonna proceed to wrap in
any<00:03:20.830> direction<00:03:21.040> really<00:03:21.550> around<00:03:22.510> your<00:03:22.750> pointy

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
any direction really around your pointy

I<00:03:26.190> don't<00:03:27.190> like<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.490> open<00:03:27.790> up<00:03:27.940> my<00:03:28.120> bobby<00:03:28.360> pins<00:03:28.630> I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
I don't like to open up my bobby pins I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.840 
I don't like to open up my bobby pins I
tend<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.500> find<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> little<00:03:30.610> bit<00:03:30.700> more

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
tend to find that it's a little bit more

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.050 
tend to find that it's a little bit more
firmer<00:03:31.240> if<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.600> leave<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.050> groups<00:03:32.320> closed

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
firmer if you leave the groups closed

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:45.940 
firmer if you leave the groups closed
and<00:03:34.060> then<00:03:35.020> just<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.590> sir

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.600 

now<00:03:46.520> previously<00:03:46.790> we<00:03:47.360> had<00:03:47.480> prepped<00:03:48.430> Phoenix<00:03:49.430> is

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
now previously we had prepped Phoenix is

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.870 
now previously we had prepped Phoenix is
here<00:03:50.349> with<00:03:51.349> any<00:03:51.620> heat<00:03:51.860> protectant<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.610> we

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
here with any heat protectant and we

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.720 
here with any heat protectant and we
basically<00:03:53.330> gave<00:03:53.630> her<00:03:53.959> just<00:03:54.890> random<00:03:55.430> loose

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
basically gave her just random loose

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.140 
basically gave her just random loose
kind<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.239> coats<00:03:56.540> we<00:03:57.050> allowed<00:03:57.349> them<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:58.150> put

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
kind of coats we allowed them to put

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.270 
kind of coats we allowed them to put
down<00:03:59.690> completely<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.620> then<00:04:00.770> we<00:04:00.890> brush<00:04:01.040> them

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
down completely and then we brush them

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.580 
down completely and then we brush them
out<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.209> people<00:04:02.360> textured<00:04:03.160> result<00:04:05.590> and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
out so that people textured result and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.350 
out so that people textured result and
now<00:04:06.709> depending<00:04:07.220> on<00:04:07.340> how<00:04:07.520> thick<00:04:07.940> you<00:04:08.090> want<00:04:08.120> your

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
some of those sections underneath place

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.060 
some of those sections underneath place
them<00:04:13.640> forward<00:04:14.019> grab<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.170> back<00:04:15.380> section<00:04:15.680> and
