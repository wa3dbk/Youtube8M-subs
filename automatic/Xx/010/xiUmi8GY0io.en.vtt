00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
part do I feel pressure um I don't feel

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.750 
part do I feel pressure um I don't feel
no<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.930> didn't<00:00:19.199> feel<00:00:19.260> pressure<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.640> alter<00:00:20.640> my

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
no I didn't feel pressure to alter my

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.420 
no I didn't feel pressure to alter my
appearance<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.990> any<00:00:22.170> way<00:00:22.730> I<00:00:23.840> think<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.430> think

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
appearance or in any way I think I think

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.250 
appearance or in any way I think I think
I<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.789> more<00:00:26.970> pressure<00:00:27.240> being<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> girl<00:00:27.900> I

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I have more pressure being the girl I

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.890 
I have more pressure being the girl I
think<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.820> media<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.119> more<00:00:30.359> interested<00:00:30.810> in

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
think the media is more interested in

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.639 
think the media is more interested in
what<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.349> choose<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> wear<00:00:32.340> whereas<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.649> boys

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
what I choose to wear whereas with boys

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
what I choose to wear whereas with boys
I<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:34.920> there's<00:00:35.190> less<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I think there's less you can do with it

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
I think there's less you can do with it
so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.590> there's<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:38.040> interest<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so I think there's more interest and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.540 
so I think there's more interest and
sometimes<00:00:39.350> that's<00:00:40.350> quite<00:00:40.680> hard<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.430> it's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
sometimes that's quite hard and it's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.060 
sometimes that's quite hard and it's
quite<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> lot<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:43.260> I've<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.559> older<00:00:43.590> I've

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
quite a lot of it as I've got older I've

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.610 
quite a lot of it as I've got older I've
been<00:00:44.280> aware<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.329> people<00:00:45.360> care<00:00:45.899> about<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
been aware that people care about what I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.479 
been aware that people care about what I
put<00:00:46.680> my<00:00:47.039> body<00:00:47.219> which<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.610> change<00:00:48.090> home<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.980> it's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
put my body which is change home so it's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.029 
put my body which is change home so it's
something<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.940> I've<00:00:51.320> become<00:00:52.320> interested<00:00:52.949> in

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
something that I've become interested in

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
something that I've become interested in
and<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.719> kind<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> how<00:00:54.960> Dan<00:00:55.590> went<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.039> did

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
and I think kind of how Dan went and did

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
and I think kind of how Dan went and did
Equus<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.510> Rupert's<00:00:57.899> taken<00:00:58.199> on

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
Equus and you know Rupert's taken on

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.540 
Equus and you know Rupert's taken on
other<00:00:58.410> film<00:00:58.680> roles<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.309> I've<00:00:59.430> been

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
other film roles and because I've been

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
other film roles and because I've been
studying<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.149> haven't<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.719> much<00:01:00.750> time<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
studying I haven't had as much time to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
studying I haven't had as much time to
go<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.590> make<00:01:01.680> another<00:01:01.980> film<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.670> start

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
go and make another film and start

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
go and make another film and start
trying<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.960> directors<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.650> casting

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
trying to get directors and casting

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.170 
trying to get directors and casting
agents<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> look<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.580> me<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> different<00:01:05.790> way

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
agents to look at me in a different way

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.920 
agents to look at me in a different way
so<00:01:06.840> i<00:01:06.900> think<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.680> way<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.280> doing<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.689> been

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
so i think my way of doing that has been

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.560 
so i think my way of doing that has been
fashion<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.010> modeling<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
fashion and modeling and you know in a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.999 
fashion and modeling and you know in a
way<00:01:15.689> i've<00:01:15.869> been<00:01:15.900> trying<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> play<00:01:16.619> different

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
way i've been trying to play different

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.980 
way i've been trying to play different
characters<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.759> each<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> photo<00:01:18.720> shoots

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
characters in each of the photo shoots

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.789 
characters in each of the photo shoots
that<00:01:19.229> I've<00:01:19.439> done<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.490> hope<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.799> people

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that I've done and and hope that people

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.580 
that I've done and and hope that people
could<00:01:23.040> look<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.280> me<00:01:23.369> differently<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.960> mean

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
could look at me differently and I mean

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.480 
could look at me differently and I mean
I<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.310> naive<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.880> me<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I would be very naive of me to to not to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.380 
I would be very naive of me to to not to
be<00:01:29.579> aware<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:31.020> will<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.229> hard<00:01:31.470> for

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
be aware that it will be hard for

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.520 
be aware that it will be hard for
audiences<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.630> separate<00:01:34.049> us<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.350> these

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
audiences to separate us from these

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380 
audiences to separate us from these
characters<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.549> much<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.270> know

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
characters that are so much you know

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.429 
characters that are so much you know
with<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.930> kind<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> we're<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.340> identified<00:01:38.880> with

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
with so kind of we're so identified with

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.719 
with so kind of we're so identified with
so<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.650> maybe<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:41.070> been<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.579> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so I think maybe that's been my way of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.539 
so I think maybe that's been my way of
expressing<00:01:41.820> myself<00:01:43.549> but<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:46.280> yeah<00:01:47.280> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
expressing myself but it's not yeah I

expressing myself but it's not yeah I
