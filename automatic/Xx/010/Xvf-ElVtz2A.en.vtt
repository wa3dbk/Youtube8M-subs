okay I need to connect to my VPN server
now<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.510> test<00:00:03.689> that<00:00:03.899> out<00:00:03.929> so<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.740> first<00:00:04.950> thing

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
now and test that out so the first thing

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.010 
now and test that out so the first thing
I'm<00:00:05.250> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.430> do<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.879> I'm<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.660> open<00:00:06.750> up

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
I'm going to do is I'm going to open up

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.669 
I'm going to do is I'm going to open up
a<00:00:07.109> command<00:00:07.440> prompt<00:00:08.300> and<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:10.290> going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> see<00:00:10.590> if

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
a command prompt and I'm going to see if

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.570 
a command prompt and I'm going to see if
I<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:10.950> ping<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:12.090> server<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.469> know<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
I can ping the server so I know the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
I can ping the server so I know the
server's<00:00:15.000> IP<00:00:15.240> address<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:17.510> I'm<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
server's IP address so I'm on just the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.929 
server's IP address so I'm on just the
local<00:00:19.500> network<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.730> going<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
local network here so this is going to

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.640 
local network here so this is going to
be<00:00:21.090> from<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.170> local<00:00:22.680> VPN<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.029> that's<00:00:24.439> not<00:00:25.439> that

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
be from a local VPN so that's not that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.920 
be from a local VPN so that's not that
great<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:27.150> not<00:00:27.300> testing<00:00:27.750> from

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
great because it's not testing from

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.560 
great because it's not testing from
outside<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.650> network<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.279> let's<00:00:30.210> just<00:00:30.359> i

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
outside of the network but let's just i

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.150 
outside of the network but let's just i
can<00:00:30.869> only<00:00:30.990> test<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.500> now<00:00:31.650> from<00:00:31.830> within

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
can only test it right now from within

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.720 
can only test it right now from within
the<00:00:32.250> network<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.030> i<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.630> ping<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.170> server<00:00:34.730> so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the network so i can ping the server so

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.860 
the network so i can ping the server so
that's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.210> sign<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:38.390> since<00:00:39.390> i<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.660> ping

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that's a good sign and since i can ping

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.850 
that's a good sign and since i can ping
the<00:00:39.899> server<00:00:40.170> i<00:00:40.590> should<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.460> able<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:42.860> connect

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the server i should be able to connect

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.959 
the server i should be able to connect
to<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.219> I'm<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.789> I've

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
wired connection here somewhere too but

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.740

just<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.630> wireless<00:03:31.050> one<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.970> am<00:03:33.300> now<00:03:33.510> on

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
just the wireless one so I am now on

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
that local network so now I it's just as

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.410

now<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.810> next<00:03:43.530> test<00:03:43.799> will<00:03:44.010> be<00:03:44.220> can<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.090> set<00:03:45.360> up

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
now the next test will be can I set up
