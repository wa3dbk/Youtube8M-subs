I think this yeah submissive alright it
looks<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:50.240> little<00:01:50.300> weird<00:01:50.540> because<00:01:50.690> that's<00:01:51.050> just

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
looks a little weird because that's just

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.540 
looks a little weird because that's just
the<00:01:51.260> way<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.500> bitter<00:01:51.740> herbs<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.160> do<00:01:52.310> or

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
the way the bitter herbs to do or

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.740 
the way the bitter herbs to do or
whatever<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.600> now<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.110> tap<00:01:54.470> on<00:01:54.650> this<00:01:54.800> flower

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
whatever so now that tap on this flower

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.750 
whatever so now that tap on this flower
there's<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.840> little<00:01:57.050> delay<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:58.450> it's<00:01:59.450> redstone

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
there's a little delay but it's redstone

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.000 
there's a little delay but it's redstone
so<00:02:01.760> all<00:02:02.119> intensive<00:02:02.600> purposes<00:02:02.660> it's<00:02:03.500> it's<00:02:03.830> just

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
so all intensive purposes it's it's just

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.400 
so all intensive purposes it's it's just
a<00:02:04.100> straight<00:02:04.340> shot<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:05.570> can't<00:02:05.810> actually<00:02:06.050> go

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
a straight shot you can't actually go

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.249 
a straight shot you can't actually go
down<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:07.729> rung<00:02:08.360> there<00:02:08.570> anything<00:02:08.869> like<00:02:09.050> that

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
down a rung there anything like that

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.560 
down a rung there anything like that
the<00:02:09.500> down<00:02:09.740> layer<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.940> doesn't<00:02:11.240> work<00:02:11.330> like<00:02:11.510> that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
the down layer it doesn't work like that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.990 
the down layer it doesn't work like that
gets<00:02:12.040> they<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.340> still<00:02:13.610> working<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:13.910> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
gets they are still working on the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.480 
gets they are still working on the
plugin<00:02:14.420> but<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:15.830> pretty<00:02:16.130> cool<00:02:16.280> let<00:02:16.459> me

but somehow I did want to know is if you
know<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.160> made<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.459> Redstone<00:02:43.880> going<00:02:44.150> all

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
know this I made the Redstone going all

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.060 
know this I made the Redstone going all
the<00:02:44.600> way<00:02:44.660> around<00:02:44.840> here<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.350> even<00:02:45.830> all<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> way

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
the way around here and even all the way

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.210 
the way around here and even all the way
to<00:02:46.190> these<00:02:46.430> other<00:02:46.820> dandelion<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.680> hit<00:02:49.040> this

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
to these other dandelion so I hit this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.910 
to these other dandelion so I hit this
dandelion<00:02:49.760> which<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> button<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:51.680> works

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
dandelion which is a button it works

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.820 
dandelion which is a button it works
fine<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.610> something<00:02:53.360> else<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.630> note<00:02:53.830> I'll

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
fine and something else to note I'll

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.710 
fine and something else to note I'll
tell<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.280> second<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.850> Redstone<00:02:56.269> always

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
tell you in a second the Redstone always

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.259 
tell you in a second the Redstone always
stays<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.650> even<00:02:58.610> though<00:02:58.700> that's<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:59.000> button

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
stays on so even though that's a button

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.350 
stays on so even though that's a button
it<00:02:59.360> acts<00:02:59.540> more<00:02:59.870> like<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.140> lever<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.850> if<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.060> tap<00:03:02.239> it

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
it acts more like a lever so if I tap it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.960 
it acts more like a lever so if I tap it
again<00:03:02.600> then<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.320> goes<00:03:03.440> up<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.709> down<00:03:03.799> so<00:03:04.250> it's

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
again then it goes up and down so it's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.550 
again then it goes up and down so it's
programmed<00:03:05.420> as<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.630> button<00:03:05.930> but<00:03:06.170> it's<00:03:06.290> actually

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
programmed as a button but it's actually

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.430 
programmed as a button but it's actually
a<00:03:06.590> lover<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.970> that's<00:03:08.600> how<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.810> functions<00:03:09.320> right

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
a lover so that's how it functions right

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.890 
a lover so that's how it functions right
now<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:09.950> like<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.670> said<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.150> goes<00:03:11.450> all<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.780> way

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
now so like I said this goes all the way

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.039 
now so like I said this goes all the way
around<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> Redstone<00:03:12.769> so<00:03:14.019> hypothetically<00:03:15.019> a

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
around the Redstone so hypothetically a

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.960 
around the Redstone so hypothetically a
normal<00:03:15.680> redstone<00:03:16.100> what<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.489> able<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.790> do

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
normal redstone what you be able to do

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.130 
normal redstone what you be able to do
is<00:03:17.329> tap<00:03:18.140> this<00:03:18.440> left<00:03:19.209> flowers<00:03:20.209> left<00:03:20.540> lever<00:03:20.840> or

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
is tap this left flowers left lever or

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.650 
is tap this left flowers left lever or
button<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.760> both<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.940> these<00:03:23.060> should<00:03:23.299> open

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
button and both of these should open

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.310 
button and both of these should open
safely<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.130> not<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.360> if<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.019> see<00:03:27.200> right

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
safely but it is not so if you see right

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.910 
safely but it is not so if you see right
there<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:28.220> does<00:03:28.880> that<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.350> if<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.470> tap<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.709> one

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
there it does that so if I tap that one

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.800 
there it does that so if I tap that one
and<00:03:31.340> if<00:03:31.549> that<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:31.910> one<00:03:32.090> it's<00:03:32.329> gonna<00:03:32.420> open

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
and if that this one it's gonna open

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.009 
and if that this one it's gonna open
this<00:03:33.079> one<00:03:33.140> close<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.680> other<00:03:34.720> it's<00:03:35.720> really

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
this one close the other it's really

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.560 
this one close the other it's really
weird<00:03:36.230> but<00:03:36.829> I<00:03:36.890> guess<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.370> know<00:03:37.519> it's<00:03:38.030> it's<00:03:38.450> a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
weird but I guess you know it's it's a

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.050 
weird but I guess you know it's it's a
bug<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.170> they're<00:03:39.470> still<00:03:39.620> programming<00:03:40.190> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
bug and they're still programming the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.940 
bug and they're still programming the
plug-in<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.230> pretty<00:03:42.350> cool

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
plug-in so it's pretty cool

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.740 
plug-in so it's pretty cool
something<00:03:43.549> else<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.760> wanted<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.060> note<00:03:44.209> is<00:03:44.390> the

something else I wanted to note is the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.590 
something else I wanted to note is the
