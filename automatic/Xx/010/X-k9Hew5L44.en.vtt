00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
pretty well but who knows so I'm going

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.290 
pretty well but who knows so I'm going
to<00:00:24.119> go<00:00:24.240> ahead<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.539> take<00:00:24.660> our<00:00:24.840> Big<00:00:25.019> Mac<00:00:25.230> here

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:39.770 

stick<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:32.570> that's<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> prize<00:00:38.420> get<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.570> in

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
stick it in that's a prize get on in

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.060 
stick it in that's a prize get on in
there<00:00:42.020> assume<00:00:43.020> Charlie<00:00:43.469> likes<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:43.860> bit

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
there assume Charlie likes a little bit

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:54.229 
there assume Charlie likes a little bit
of<00:00:44.160> ketchup<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:48.649> little<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:49.860> sure<00:00:53.239> then

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
of ketchup so it a little bit sure then

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.240 
of ketchup so it a little bit sure then
we're<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> take<00:00:56.149> diet<00:00:57.149> coke<00:00:57.420> actually

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.680 

we're<00:01:02.250> unsure<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.390> should<00:01:03.600> be

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
we're unsure actually if we should be

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.399 
we're unsure actually if we should be
using<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.970> soda<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.299> maybe<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> milkshake<00:01:06.960> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
using a soda or maybe a milkshake so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.720 
using a soda or maybe a milkshake so
this<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:08.090> decide

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.030 

so<00:01:14.330> there's<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:17.470> I'm<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:18.590> going<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.830> zoom

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
so there's that I'm just going to zoom

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
so there's that I'm just going to zoom
in<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:19.310> on<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:20.410> concoction<00:01:26.620> and<00:01:27.620> here<00:01:27.890> we<00:01:27.950> go

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:02:11.630 

we're<00:01:46.360> gonna<00:01:46.509> mix<00:01:46.719> it<00:01:46.810> again<00:01:46.930> just

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.770 

it<00:02:12.640> feels<00:02:12.940> pretty<00:02:13.120> good<00:02:13.209> but<00:02:13.420> I'm<00:02:13.510> even<00:02:13.630> going

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it feels pretty good but I'm even going

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.360 
it feels pretty good but I'm even going
to<00:02:13.870> mix<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.170> more<00:02:14.260> time<00:02:14.410> make<00:02:15.099> sure<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
to mix it one more time make sure the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:35.170 
to mix it one more time make sure the
consistency<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:17.410> as<00:02:17.620> an<00:02:17.709> exciting

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:03:05.030 

ok<00:02:57.950> back<00:02:58.950> out<00:03:02.090> all<00:03:03.090> right<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:04.440> seems<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.920> have

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
ok back out all right it seems to have

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:30.460 
ok back out all right it seems to have
worked<00:03:05.069> pretty<00:03:05.550> well<00:03:22.340> smell<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.489> interesting

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.170 

it's<00:03:31.040> not<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.460> bad<00:03:31.640> I<00:03:33.850> think<00:03:34.850> Charlie<00:03:34.940> can

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
it's not that bad I think Charlie can

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.280 
it's not that bad I think Charlie can
finish<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.510> I<00:03:35.720> think<00:03:36.050> there's<00:03:36.200> the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
finish this I think there's the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.760 
finish this I think there's the
challenge<00:03:36.680> trolleys<00:03:37.400> moment
