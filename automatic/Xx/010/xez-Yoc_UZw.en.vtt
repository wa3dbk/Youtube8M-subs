00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.130
 but no 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.500
 and we promised here in the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.630
 program show you all kinds of motorcycles 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.910
 almost always we highlight the motorcycles of 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.490
 high-end the best scooters in this 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.579
 case the programs that passed the eighth 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.810
 of liter but today we want to be a 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:32.439
 little bit more real come down to reality 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.809
 the first bike the most economical the one 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.050
 can buy a user who needs 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.870
 move to many places that 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.780
 they have many occupations and this model 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.150
 of zanella of 110 cubic centimeters me 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.760
 I think it was the option to show them 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.519
 that there is a tremendous range of this type 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.040
 of models in this category of motorcycles 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.100
 that just serve for that 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.780
 they serve so that the transport that is missing 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.510
 sometimes in Argentina in the interior 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.430
 of the interior good in some way it 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.059
 can supply with a vehicle of that 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.760
 category 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.300
 andy many guys women 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 it is the vehicle of the family 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.540
 this is the sixth time 110 is that 4 of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.240
 sant the beginning in entrance to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.100
 motorcycling a simple photo with 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.100
 drum brakes but that has 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.480
 many good things of luxury the lock 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.880
 address incorporated in the lock 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.280
 a very good finish of the bike in what 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.460
 makes what is the body the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.980
 plastic locks to go under the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.440
 seat find an important place 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.060
 to keep the helmet that you do not steal the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.600
 fuel cap because there is the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.030
 tank and carry packages but I'm going 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.910
 counting that these have a rolled 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.810
 front of 17 inches by 225 of 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.050
 wide and back jail 14 famous 14 for 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.250
 100 that gives the possibility to this motorcycle 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.620
 to have this peace under the seat 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.370
 look good for those who do not know how 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.500
 comes 0km with the manual if the sheet 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.420
 guarantee that is very important because 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.930
 all vehicles have a guarantee 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.520
 prolonged revision certificates 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.050
 periodicals required for the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.670
 vehicle always be well in what 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.220
 has to meet the dealer in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.800
 the chips sometimes I do not know if everyone 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.510
 you know but life not in the dealership 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.939
 that comes with the motorcycle 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.189
 and also a team of tools like 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.350
 to be able to do the little things that the 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.560
 user can I do at home 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.440
 well all this is warning you 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.560
 you already know 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.840
 to be an economic motorcycle serving 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.000
 has many luxuries has a very 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.790
 complete everything that has to do with 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.980
 warning lights does not have the warning 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 that the change is in that it is so 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.140
 important all the speedometer by 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.170
 course and control of the fuel 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.360
 with a needle I say it is very important 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.730
 know where the fuel uca goes 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.680
 more when he grabs us on some route not 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.610
 if the light turns on when it is turned on 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.130
 we know there is not little left 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.110
 very good quality the light key is that 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.720
 it is used all the time both in light of 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.290
 turn as light change the command is not 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.690
 true and the speaker there we are seeing 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.300
 and details as good the key of nasa 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.730
 is placed in the carburetor there is a 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.010
 hole there so that one can put 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.440
 the hand the screw to purge the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.880
 carburetor when we let it stop me 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.190
 I think it's very important that everyone 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.290
 know if the motorcycle does not end for the time 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.200
 in winter with the tank full of nash 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.940
 it is rotten electric starter and 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.500
 boot to kicks this is a great 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.420
 benefit that has the kick you 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.940
 you stay a day without a battery or something happens 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.610
 the sideburns and you go and this is 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.459
 fundamental is that it is close to the 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.280
 hand is so we can measure it all 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.380
 the day the rod to measure the level 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.690
 of the fuel now let's take out that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.940
 top because this bike has a clutch 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.530
 automatic centrifugal and four 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.910
 speeds that are made with the foot but 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.709
 they do not have what is done only for 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.130
 clutch when you have to regulate the 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.310
 clutch that nut and that screw 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.690
 just for that action that is whether 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.510
 has an automatic name has a 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.209
 clutch regulation with it against 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.090
 nut moving asparagus that has 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.550
 a slot for screwdriver we can 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.770
 to get closer or not to fight and have more or less 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.680
 clutch does not have to do someone who 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.009
 know but I assure you it is not difficult 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.680
 do 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.169
 the theme of the chain we always warn 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.749
 that is fixed in a chain cover of the 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.580
 motorcycles as in this case that is the 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.889
 game that the chain has to have 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.520
 centimeter and a half centimeter each 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:50.249
 manufacturer is going to tell you how good it is 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.830
 very easy to look at and feel the chain 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:55.559
 and look if you are lubricated lady 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.629
 with an aerosol with a lubricant in 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:59.520
 spray calmly you know that 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.080
 we recommend castrol can 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.279
 having the lubricated chain is not a 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.580
 operation that has to take it to 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:08.039
 mechanical and stretch the chain by 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.439
 that piece the stretch chain that has that 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.809
 three hairlines nut that is not 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:15.029
 difficult you can do all this 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:18.180
 is to show you that there are motorcycles 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:20.039
 entrance to motorcycling that cost us 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.169
 a fortune that will give us a great 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.969
 very nice service look at the look 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:29.490
 of this the zb 110 that 4 of zanella is 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.370
 very pretty very modern 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.960
 to the safe luminosity assured with 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.419
 all the security of because it's a lot 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.680
 once fully approved 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.759
 I heard from him that the Chinese bike that 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.490
 walk down the street are not approved 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.199
 it's a shame the whole bike that 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.139
 are in Argentina come from where 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.539
 come they have a technical homologation 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.910
 but you can not enter the country 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.849
 It has very good light sounds very good 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.039
 horn has very good turning light and 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.830
 plus a great escape protector for 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.680
 that nobody is going to burn with the escape 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.630
 which is a bit the frequent accident 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.020
 when the one that goes back down 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.909
 of this immense seat so comfortable that 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.190
 you can calmly carry two 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.110
 large people and back you can 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.110
 add a grill because everything comes 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.470
 prepared for a grill and carry a 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.110
 so necessary package in the use of all 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.090
 the days especially the ladies that 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.409
 they are going to do the errands with the motorbike 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:31.199
 this bike really is the start for a 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:33.120
 motorcyclist who has to learn that 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.249
 you have to use it for the use let's say 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.120
 normal everyday everyday 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:40.430
 and enter the motorcycle world yes no 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.010
 I want to tell you and this is very, very, very 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.810
 important this vehicle of 110 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.040
 cubic centimeters with all these 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:52.030
 advances cost less than 5 thousand pesos 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.030
 but no
