but what exactly is a flame for that we

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.490 
but what exactly is a flame for that we
have<00:02:10.760> to<00:02:10.910> go<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.090> professor<00:02:11.570> patio<00:02:12.050> furniture

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500

patty whole again children well what is

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.110 
patty whole again children well what is
my<00:02:17.720> fire<00:02:17.990> is<00:02:18.290> fire<00:02:18.710> matter<00:02:19.040> matter<00:02:19.880> is

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
my fire is fire matter matter is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.410 
my fire is fire matter matter is
anything<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.600> occupies<00:02:21.320> space<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
anything that occupies space so the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.600 
anything that occupies space so the
flame<00:02:23.780> itself<00:02:24.020> is<00:02:24.560> matter<00:02:24.980> because<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
flame itself is matter because it is a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.580 
flame itself is matter because it is a
mixture<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.030> gases<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.660> are<00:02:26.720> burning<00:02:27.080> but

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
mixture of gases that are burning but

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.500 
mixture of gases that are burning but
the<00:02:27.920> light<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.460> get<00:02:28.730> from<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.060> fire<00:02:29.270> is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the light that you get from the fire is

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.410 
the light that you get from the fire is
not<00:02:30.050> matter<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.830> energy<00:02:31.430> also<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> heat

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
not matter it is energy also the heat

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.840 
not matter it is energy also the heat
from<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.660> fire<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.170> not<00:02:33.560> matter<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.100> his<00:02:34.400> Angie

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
from the fire is not matter in his Angie

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.240 
from the fire is not matter in his Angie
so<00:02:35.180> only<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.600> flame<00:02:35.870> itself<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.500> matter

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850 

and<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.150> reason<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.570> flames<00:02:43.840> go<00:02:44.290> up<00:02:44.560> is

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
and the reason the flames go up is

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.830 
and the reason the flames go up is
because<00:02:45.220> they<00:02:45.520> are<00:02:45.580> burning<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.330> gases<00:02:46.720> are

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
because they are burning the gases are

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.630 
because they are burning the gases are
burning<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.320> they're<00:02:47.680> lighter<00:02:47.950> than<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.490> air

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
burning and they're lighter than the air

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.440 
burning and they're lighter than the air
such<00:02:49.240> as<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.720> match<00:02:53.820> though<00:02:54.820> I'm<00:02:54.970> holding<00:02:55.360> it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
such as this match though I'm holding it

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.720 
such as this match though I'm holding it
horizontally<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.710> flames<00:02:57.040> are<00:02:57.280> still<00:02:57.580> moving

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
horizontally the flames are still moving

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.580 
horizontally the flames are still moving
up<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> gases<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.320> are<00:02:59.380> being

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
up because the gases that are being

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.830 
up because the gases that are being
burned<00:02:59.860> our<00:03:00.280> big<00:03:00.520> have<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> lighter<00:03:01.360> density

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
burned our big have a lighter density

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.500 
burned our big have a lighter density

on<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.340> floor<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:09.780> suddenly<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.049> stick

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
on the floor and suddenly the stick

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.780 
on the floor and suddenly the stick
ignited<00:04:11.829> this<00:04:12.370> was<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.970> first<00:04:13.299> match<00:04:13.989> stick

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
ignited this was the first match stick

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.069

these<00:04:15.790> matches<00:04:16.359> were<00:04:16.510> different<00:04:16.900> from<00:04:16.989> the

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
these matches were different from the

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.689 
these matches were different from the

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
matches of today because they don't

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.629 
matches of today because they don't
contain<00:04:19.150> any<00:04:19.209> phosphorus<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:21.340> how<00:04:21.579> do
