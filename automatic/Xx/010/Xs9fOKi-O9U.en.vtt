time<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:55.019> strength<00:00:56.359> I've<00:00:57.359> noticed<00:00:58.140> from

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
time on my strength I've noticed from

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.910 
time on my strength I've noticed from
footage<00:00:58.979> that<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.519> have<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.649> little<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.889> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
footage that I have a little bit of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.509 
footage that I have a little bit of
background<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.290> but<00:01:04.290> wink<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> hole

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
background and but wink out of the hole

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.810 
background and but wink out of the hole
at<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> bottom<00:01:06.740> once<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.829> hit<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.009> full<00:01:08.579> depth

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
at the bottom once I hit that full depth

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.690 
at the bottom once I hit that full depth
280g<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> I've<00:01:10.950> been<00:01:11.040> really<00:01:11.280> focused<00:01:11.640> on

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
280g so I've been really focused on

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.249 
280g so I've been really focused on
keeping<00:01:11.909> my<00:01:12.090> back<00:01:12.390> tight<00:01:12.719> throughout<00:01:13.079> the

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
keeping my back tight throughout the

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.550 
keeping my back tight throughout the
whole<00:01:13.530> movement<00:01:14.399> and<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.899> caught<00:01:16.409> myself

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
whole movement and I have caught myself

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.340 
whole movement and I have caught myself
letting<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:22.100> loose

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
letting my back loose

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.039 
letting my back loose
for<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> quick<00:01:25.250> second<00:01:25.700> at<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.820> bottom<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:29.049> I

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
for a quick second at the bottom and I

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.600 
for a quick second at the bottom and I
don't<00:01:30.530> believe<00:01:30.830> it's<00:01:31.070> from<00:01:32.000> lack<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.299> mobility

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
don't believe it's from lack of mobility

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.010 
don't believe it's from lack of mobility
flexibility<00:01:34.610> because<00:01:35.240> I<00:01:35.450> don't<00:01:35.600> feel<00:01:35.780> any

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
flexibility because I don't feel any

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.499 
flexibility because I don't feel any
pressure<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:36.710> don't<00:01:37.250> feel<00:01:37.369> any<00:01:37.610> pain<00:01:37.880> or<00:01:38.210> any

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
very good in this movement but I know

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.820 
very good in this movement but I know
it's<00:02:10.610> at<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.569> bottom<00:02:11.750> getting<00:02:12.709> real<00:02:12.890> low

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
it's at the bottom getting real low

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.040

right<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.040> 320<00:02:16.549> for<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> double

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.680 

and<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.820> know<00:02:22.000> there's<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.210> lot<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.360> foreign

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
and I know there's a lot of foreign

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.300 
and I know there's a lot of foreign
police<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:23.110> there<00:02:28.320> but<00:02:29.320> again<00:02:29.410> no<00:02:29.770> stress<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
police out there but again no stress I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.920 
police out there but again no stress I
don't<00:02:30.430> feel<00:02:30.580> any<00:02:30.760> pressure<00:02:30.910> my<00:02:31.210> lower<00:02:31.390> back<00:02:31.600> so

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
don't feel any pressure my lower back so

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.810 
don't feel any pressure my lower back so
I'm<00:02:32.560> fine<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.100> think<00:02:33.220> if<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:33.580> just

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
I'm fine with that I think if I just

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.480 
I'm fine with that I think if I just
keep<00:02:34.230> focusing<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.410> keeping<00:02:35.740> my<00:02:35.890> back<00:02:36.130> tight

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
keep focusing on keeping my back tight

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.680 
keep focusing on keeping my back tight
it<00:02:36.790> will<00:02:37.540> prevent<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:39.400> rounding<00:02:39.820> because<00:02:40.390> a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
it will prevent the rounding because a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.000 
it will prevent the rounding because a
couple<00:02:41.080> weeks<00:02:41.380> ago<00:02:41.530> i<00:02:41.680> was<00:02:41.740> looking<00:02:41.950> at

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
couple weeks ago i was looking at

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.560 
couple weeks ago i was looking at
footage<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.460> my<00:02:42.580> back<00:02:42.760> was<00:02:42.970> rounding<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.330> lot

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
footage in my back was rounding a lot

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.360 
footage in my back was rounding a lot
more<00:02:43.810> while<00:02:44.110> i<00:02:44.140> was<00:02:44.290> hitting<00:02:44.590> at<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.730> depth

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
more while i was hitting at that depth

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.790 
more while i was hitting at that depth
sees<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.520> little<00:02:48.610> but<00:02:49.150> wink<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.800> rounding

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
sees a little but wink and the rounding

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.210 
sees a little but wink and the rounding
but<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.840> lot<00:02:52.840> better<00:02:53.170> than<00:02:53.560> my<00:02:53.830> previous

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
but it is a lot better than my previous

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:05.160 
but it is a lot better than my previous
leg<00:02:57.220> days<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:03.460> here<00:03:03.640> we<00:03:03.970> did<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> bunch<00:03:05.020> of

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
leg days so here we did a bunch of

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.510 
leg days so here we did a bunch of
doubles<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.650> then<00:03:06.580> couple<00:03:07.450> back<00:03:07.660> down<00:03:07.900> sets

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
doubles and then couple back down sets

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
you can see as weight lightens up for me

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.750 
you can see as weight lightens up for me
I<00:03:24.959> get<00:03:25.959> less<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.590> back<00:03:27.100> rounding<00:03:27.550> and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
I get less of that back rounding and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.740 
I get less of that back rounding and
ball<00:03:28.420> twink<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.440> I'm<00:03:30.190> not<00:03:30.250> stressing<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.970> legs

than you know 90 degrees it would be

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.800 
than you know 90 degrees it would be
easy<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.510> eliminate<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.530> back<00:03:42.310> rounding<00:03:42.760> and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
I feel that five sets of five is it good

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.270 
I feel that five sets of five is it good
it's<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.810> good<00:04:38.930> ratio<00:04:39.170> you<00:04:39.800> know<00:04:39.920> if<00:04:40.040> you<00:04:40.130> did

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
it's a good ratio you know if you did

it's a good ratio you know if you did
three<00:04:40.520> sets<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:41.030> five<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.590> volume<00:04:42.830> would

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
three sets of five and the volume would

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.980 
three sets of five and the volume would
it<00:04:43.190> be<00:04:43.310> their<00:04:43.580> intensity<00:04:44.360> wouldn't<00:04:44.690> be<00:04:44.750> there

completely<00:05:11.090> locked<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.380> i<00:05:12.680> choose<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.250> do<00:05:13.370> it

completely locked and i choose to do it
that<00:05:13.610> way<00:05:13.700> because<00:05:13.850> i<00:05:14.060> find<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.390> more

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
that way because i find it more

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.750 
that way because i find it more
difficult<00:05:14.920> it<00:05:15.920> does<00:05:16.100> require<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.490> lot<00:05:16.730> more

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
difficult it does require a lot more

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.850 
difficult it does require a lot more
mobility<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.660> lot<00:05:17.900> more<00:05:18.050> flexibility<00:05:18.650> in<00:05:18.770> the

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
mobility a lot more flexibility in the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
about 235 on the bar you'll see slight

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.310 
about 235 on the bar you'll see slight
rounding<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.690> every<00:05:30.690> week<00:05:30.840> he<00:05:30.960> gets<00:05:31.110> better

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
rounding and every week he gets better

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:41.750 
rounding and every week he gets better
better<00:05:34.580> in<00:05:35.580> my<00:05:35.730> opinion<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:39.980> when<00:05:40.980> I<00:05:41.010> do<00:05:41.130> see

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
better in my opinion and when I do see

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.760 
better in my opinion and when I do see
more<00:05:41.940> rounding<00:05:42.300> it's<00:05:42.450> it's<00:05:42.750> my<00:05:42.960> mistake<00:05:43.200> it's

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
more rounding it's it's my mistake it's

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.220 
more rounding it's it's my mistake it's
not<00:05:43.980> a<00:05:44.010> lack<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.370> mobility<00:05:44.610> it's<00:05:45.120> more<00:05:45.450> of<00:05:45.630> me

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
not a lack of mobility it's more of me

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.210 
not a lack of mobility it's more of me
just<00:05:46.470> letting<00:05:47.120> my<00:05:48.120> lower<00:05:48.480> back<00:05:48.780> loose<00:05:49.530> and<00:05:49.920> not
