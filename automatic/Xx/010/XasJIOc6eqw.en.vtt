derma rolling

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
derma rolling
so<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.609> derma<00:01:02.910> rolling<00:01:03.149> worked<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.750> well

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so because derma rolling worked so well

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.140 
so because derma rolling worked so well
with<00:01:04.140> her<00:01:04.320> she<00:01:04.559> partnered<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.640> plastic

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150

surgeon<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.930> she<00:01:06.960> ended<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.010> creating<00:01:08.280> her

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
surgeon and she ended up creating her

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
surgeon and she ended up creating her
own<00:01:08.700> derma<00:01:09.420> roller<00:01:09.689> line<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.409> essentially

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
own derma roller line so essentially

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.870 
own derma roller line so essentially
what<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:10.920> doing<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.340> you're<00:01:11.520> using<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
what you're doing is you're using the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
what you're doing is you're using the
needle<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.450> face<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.990> you're<00:01:13.080> poking

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
needle on your face and you're poking

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.980 
needle on your face and you're poking
holes<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.010> creating<00:01:14.520> very<00:01:15.030> minor<00:01:15.360> injuries

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
holes so creating very minor injuries

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.510 
holes so creating very minor injuries
and<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.409> face<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.830> kind<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.250> what's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and your face is kind of like what's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
and your face is kind of like what's
going<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.080> face<00:01:19.259> tries<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
going on here so your face tries to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
going on here so your face tries to
repair<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.729> actually<00:01:21.090> happens<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
repair it up what actually happens is

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.340 
repair it up what actually happens is
your<00:01:22.470> scarves<00:01:22.890> end<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.670> healing<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.720> again

like<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.680> said<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> great<00:01:26.400> alternative

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
like I said this is a great alternative

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810 
like I said this is a great alternative
for<00:01:27.060> those<00:01:27.420> who<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.650> tried<00:01:28.890> medication<00:01:29.610> as

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
for those who have tried medication as

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
for those who have tried medication as
well<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.299> creams<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> something

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
well as creams because this is something

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
well as creams because this is something
that<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.159> completely<00:01:32.520> different<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.450> after

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that is completely different so after

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
that is completely different so after
you<00:01:34.110> use<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.619> derma<00:01:35.070> roller<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.640> very

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you use a derma roller it's very

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690

think that 30 day policy is great

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.580 
think that 30 day policy is great
because<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.390> myself<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.170> definitely<00:01:58.500> do

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
because I know myself I definitely do

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
because I know myself I definitely do
not<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.189> lot<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> money<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.360> spending

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
not have a lot of money to be spending

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.399 
not have a lot of money to be spending
on

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
on

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.559 
on
these<00:02:01.649> different<00:02:02.070> sort<00:02:02.429> of<00:02:02.520> acne<00:02:02.969> products<00:02:03.450> so

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
these different sort of acne products so

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:04.880 
these different sort of acne products so
I<00:02:03.600> think<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:04.020> great<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I think that's great that they have that

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.440 
I think that's great that they have that
policy<00:02:05.219> because<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.939> doesn't<00:02:06.179> work<00:02:06.270> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
policy because if it doesn't work for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
policy because if it doesn't work for
you<00:02:06.539> then<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.109> send<00:02:07.289> it<00:02:07.380> back<00:02:07.530> so

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
you then you can just send it back so

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.880 
you then you can just send it back so
this<00:02:08.039> kit<00:02:08.369> originally<00:02:09.000> would<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.330> $99<00:02:10.319> but

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
this kit originally would be $99 but

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
this kit originally would be $99 but
they<00:02:10.979> cut<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> down<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> 69<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> really<00:02:13.379> do

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
they cut it down to 69 so I really do

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.809 
they cut it down to 69 so I really do
think<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.830> that's<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.160> pretty<00:02:14.340> great<00:02:14.519> price

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
think that that's a pretty great price

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.699 
think that that's a pretty great price

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
of needling you have and today I'm going

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.809 
of needling you have and today I'm going
to<00:02:45.780> be<00:02:45.840> using<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.260> point<00:02:46.650> two<00:02:46.860> five<00:02:47.129> millimeter

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
to be using a point two five millimeter

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.569 
to be using a point two five millimeter
and<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.329> goes<00:02:48.480> all<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.720> way<00:02:48.840> up<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.579> 1.0

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
and it goes all the way up to 1.0

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.880 
and it goes all the way up to 1.0
millimeter<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.810> I'm<00:02:52.290> guessing<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.650> that

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
millimeter and I'm guessing that that

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
millimeter and I'm guessing that that
would<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.459> for<00:02:53.489> your<00:02:53.790> body<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.390> you

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
I just want to make sure that's right

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.150 
I just want to make sure that's right
information<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:37.140> I'm<00:04:37.260> giving<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.710> guys<00:04:37.740> but

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.710 
information that I'm giving you guys but
I<00:04:38.190> think<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.670> it's<00:04:38.790> only<00:04:38.880> twice<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.240> month<00:04:39.390> so

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
I think that it's only twice a month so

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.210 
I think that it's only twice a month so
that's<00:04:39.870> why<00:04:40.020> I've<00:04:40.110> only<00:04:40.290> use<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.860> once

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.950 
that's why I've only use this once
before<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.150> don't<00:04:42.240> know<00:04:42.390> why<00:04:42.570> but<00:04:42.810> like

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
before and I don't know why but like

when<00:05:35.400> I<00:05:35.460> first<00:05:35.820> tried<00:05:36.090> this<00:05:36.270> out<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:36.870> it

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
when I first tried this out and it

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.200 
when I first tried this out and it
didn't<00:05:37.350> really<00:05:37.500> hurt<00:05:37.770> me<00:05:37.950> that<00:05:38.130> much<00:05:38.340> is<00:05:38.729> I

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
didn't really hurt me that much is I

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.780 
didn't really hurt me that much is I
mean<00:05:39.630> when<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.110> think<00:05:40.320> of<00:05:40.440> derma<00:05:40.680> roller<00:05:40.919> you

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
mean when you think of derma roller you

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.280 
mean when you think of derma roller you
think<00:05:42.030> like<00:05:42.210> my<00:05:42.390> god<00:05:42.630> I<00:05:42.660> don't<00:05:42.870> really<00:05:43.080> want<00:05:43.260> to

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
think like my god I don't really want to

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.900 
think like my god I don't really want to
put<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.560> on<00:05:43.680> my<00:05:43.800> face<00:05:43.830> especially<00:05:44.430> if<00:05:44.700> I<00:05:44.790> have

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
put that on my face especially if I have

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.520 
put that on my face especially if I have
asked<00:05:45.270> me<00:05:45.390> but<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:45.780> just<00:05:45.810> really<00:05:46.110> does<00:05:46.350> not

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
asked me but it just really does not

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.110 
asked me but it just really does not
hurt<00:05:46.680> me<00:05:46.800> that<00:05:46.950> much<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.310> don't<00:05:47.400> know<00:05:47.550> maybe<00:05:47.910> the

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
hurt me that much I don't know maybe the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.510 
hurt me that much I don't know maybe the
point<00:05:48.390> 25<00:05:48.780> is<00:05:49.140> it's<00:05:49.740> pretty<00:05:50.010> low<00:05:50.220> it's<00:05:50.430> the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
point 25 is it's pretty low it's the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.610 
point 25 is it's pretty low it's the
second<00:05:50.910> lowest<00:05:51.090> so<00:05:51.419> maybe<00:05:51.600> that's<00:05:51.870> why<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.440> know

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
second lowest so maybe that's why I know

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.050 
second lowest so maybe that's why I know
some<00:05:53.010> people<00:05:53.310> will<00:05:53.400> start<00:05:53.640> off<00:05:53.760> with<00:05:53.940> the

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
some people will start off with the

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.460 
some people will start off with the
small<00:05:54.360> size<00:05:54.660> and<00:05:54.690> then<00:05:55.169> they'll<00:05:55.290> work

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
small size and then they'll work

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.219 
small size and then they'll work
themselves<00:05:55.740> up<00:05:56.580> into<00:05:56.790> a<00:05:56.880> large<00:05:57.180> size<00:05:57.479> but<00:05:57.960> I

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
themselves up into a large size but I

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.560 
themselves up into a large size but I
think<00:05:58.740> I'm<00:05:58.860> okay<00:05:58.979> with<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.550> point<00:05:59.790> 25<00:06:00.210> for<00:06:00.479> now

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
think I'm okay with the point 25 for now

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.460 
think I'm okay with the point 25 for now
so<00:06:01.229> now<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.560> my<00:06:01.800> face<00:06:02.130> is<00:06:02.460> all<00:06:02.700> red<00:06:03.200> I'm<00:06:04.200> just
