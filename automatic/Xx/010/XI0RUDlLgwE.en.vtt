00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.100
 we will wake up five times 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.580
 hei then until 2008 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.819
 or then we have the mess 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.340
 the ones to be elected are terrified that the electors still want to vote 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.969
 wake up to the election 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.480
 The big, awakening is traditionally only the day after a vote 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.499
 planned 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.829
 when suddenly holes are discovered the two days left 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.059
 previously unthinkable Â»or if it turns out that once painted 4 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.029
 Millions of short - time workers are actually unemployed and that one has to deal with the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.890
 Democracy and one's own career now choose a party 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.010
 Collaborate with the times for substantive reasons in any case 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.300
 wanted to have something to do 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.200
 Campaigning is basically a very special form of torture 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.860
 At some point Petrak man this mixture of sloppiness hypocrisy and false 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.650
 Promises just do not anymore 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.530
 then please stop please please no matter what comes afterwards 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.830
 Most voters were allowed one this time 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.420
 No matter which Santa Claus we give on election Sunday this time 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.750
 no sweets to distribute 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.210
 that is to distribute after this election gifts in the form of tax cuts 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.330
 Only one party can claim that is lucky 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.460
 their election campaign is on the castle courtyard 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.310
 but to be allowed to drown roses for us 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.960
 everyone else knows in the face of the economic crisis and the huge ones 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.870
 Household holes remains this time only the tail 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.280
 The question is now in what form the route is used 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.400
 she meets the top five percent of the company with an income of 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.280
 over 7000 euros gross a month in the form of tax increases or hits them 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.869
 the lower third of the society in the form of once again shortened 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.460
 social benefits 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.100
 and if they still do not know which party which part of the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.630
 People who want to move the route, they just do 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.930
 Wahlomat 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.050
 there they will be questioned about the end of their opinion and afterwards experienced 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.560
 which party wants what you think is right 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.160
 Many are wide eyed when they ask the question because grandma dance detention 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.470
 have answered 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.660
 I think it anyway much democracy damage if you in the voting booth one 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.829
 would set up election-o-mat 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.400
 Instead of behind a cardboard nose on the good luck to make a cross 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.910
 In the polling booth in Thach, they explain the 30 questions they really do 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.180
 want content and at the end says the Wahlomat 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.099
 Congratulations you have just chosen episode of the party 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.239
 Maybe the bad awakening on the day after the election might come for some 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:31.779
 parties
