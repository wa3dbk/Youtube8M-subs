00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.990
 and then youtube people questioning that 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.950
 offers this here with moto g2 and I will 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 to show you is to move applications or 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 games for the memory card this 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.060
 even staff is not no card 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:24.109
 eight gigabytes of memory 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:27.420
 this phone we have 12 gb here in 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.070
 phone we have here seven more 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.680
 little usb card 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.620
 so I'll show you guys I always 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 I like to show because I have certain 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.520
 cell phones of a particular version of the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.899
 android that sometimes moves sometimes not 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.910
 move understood 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.399
 there will always be someone who will be there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.489
 speaking ah I can move all because 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.789
 I have ruch here in case it does not have 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.670
 butt has nothing and is simply something 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.309
 so one law which can not do 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.559
 a course on the device is this explanation 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.870
 who should promote the card is going to 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.689
 He reads to stay on his cell phone. 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.360
 That's why the bike g2 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.400
 He ends this problem with you. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.560
 want several programs here several 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.420
 games and then finish the space you do not 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.270
 can not say anything else because he is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.020
 different from the g1 bike that has no 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 micro usb card slot and this 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 here it already comes with card entry 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.430
 micro sd personal step 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.140
 so come on we have apps here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.380
 some applications right? 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.540
 but only those that I install and some that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 enables you to die by card 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.740
 Ok folks we have here we have a lot 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.530
 big here the trigger should have this s 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.770
 fahel explorer and we have the sambÃ´ and sef 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:56.969
 It's personal so let's do the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.469
 next here we have 7.40 and 1.360 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:06.270
 to note here from the side 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:07.290
 let's go 1.3 megs and 7.40 that way 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.950
 here o 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.540
 she who has all the applications here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:23.250
 let's make that count 2.2 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:25.409
 and 11 gigs there is a 37 point while 42 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.459
 points 2 11 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:42.840
 so now we come here and wee 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:45.269
 move to sd 3rd move to sd 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.650
 Phone has increased a bit, okay? 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.989
 Let's go back with a little c'mon. 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.329
 bookmark this other pss explorer explorer 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.629
 9 for the card and if it is smaller 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:03.720
 He moves faster knows how to surf if 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:05.459
 move to the card I do not know why 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.970
 It sometimes increases a little here. 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.370
 staff should have some reason to 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.989
 partition must be different then 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.989
 this increases it slightly 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.810
 of the partition is the following is each per 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.010
 memory is divided into blocks. 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.780
 independent of block size 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.000
 so he ends up occupying more than 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:37.130
 example on the card in relation to the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:43.940
 we're now here O 77 megs which is 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:49.079
 1,311 there went to 77 megs and the trot and 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:53.880
 7.3 here 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:57.959
 who is 1.3 went to 77 67 point 47 point 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.989
 3 free or should not tread here 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.760
 It was not much help, right? 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:09.540
 Let's now see here 2.1 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.599
 on the other side with 11 gigs is still there 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.329
 2.1 eleven days here 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.340
 almost nothing personal almost nothing even 100 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.120
 megas here would be basically this 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.860
 dude here 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.919
 ie it will relieve a little too little 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.800
 understood for example the game must tread 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.650
 same 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.069
 he saw a lot of things he just died there 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.409
 how much in 60 mega of the museum 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.960
 rest of the other two here too 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.720
 understood it does not relieve much is possible 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.300
 move is with ruth you will move all 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.330
 world will move everyone understood and 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.050
 but I would not recommend doing today is in 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.930
 people who like to do rum changes understand 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.180
 does a lot of thing I do not advise to 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.470
 do today because then you will always have 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.000
 people who will try to locate the cell phone 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.919
 will give error and does not know why is 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.759
 giving the time of the actors an error 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.340
 cell phone 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.229
 okay so you pay close attention 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.270
 you cult in the device of 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.580
 you just move everyone 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.080
 pro memory card understood understand 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.639
 here at the time you make the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.250
 update will give error 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.710
 there you have to do a restore in the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.090
 device're back as he was 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.030
 factory 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.030
 I now do not know if it's the hard of 7 or the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.379
 Rissete factor's there then you do 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.340
 this you can update the 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.590
 appliance 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.400
 good staff so much attention for 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.279
 favor 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.830
 So what do we do next? 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.360
 conclusion that I have already said do not reflect 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.599
 with too much can refresh for some 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.190
 another program as it comes to move more 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.169
 even more information 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:50.229
 but for this our case here no no 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:52.270
 refreshed so much that the 460 70 is 540 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.169
 megas for example was only moved more or 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.990
 less then 1 77 megs per card or 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.360
 400 meters still remained a 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.770
 device then okay the staff is so 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.440
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.379
 video if you want something else you 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.379
 They leave the suggestion there had chemistries 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.300
 less than games and I already know which 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.469
 it's the games that have to do 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.169
 I thank everyone who has given me the 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.629
 game tips but I have tips 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:27.009
 you want me to say something 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:29.289
 of the appliance understood is a lounge 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.289
 ask if the sound is good if 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.909
 good camera that I've put does 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.469
 Another test I did not do is still 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.969
 well then I hope you have 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:39.819
 I like it if you like it 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:42.479
 Bliss please, thank you so much and 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.479
 said
