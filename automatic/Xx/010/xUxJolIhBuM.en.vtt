00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.690
 what bothers the patients 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.860
 the slightly drooping mouth angle the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.389
 a little sad or so 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.340
 sullen impression 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.369
 that 's just the reason that gravity 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.920
 Here the warning soft parts down 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.029
 usually said that are heard 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 here further up that sees 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.950
 Of course much friendlier one 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.899
 This could make something acidic 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.210
 you can also botox something here 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.040
 so inject this muscle after 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.540
 but pulls down is weakened 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.250
 Permanently you can only do that operationally 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.350
 solve by here a triangle 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.880
 takes out and this muscle of the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.710
 mouth wrap is supposed to lift 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.440
 something shortened so that we actually 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.460
 want to have this condition 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.790
 one sees here the hanging ones 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.240
 mouth angle very precisely what the patient 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.920
 please open something I am looking for 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:59.610
 first wrap my mouth here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 itself on the starts then here then 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.810
 I take a stretch of twelve here 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.810
 millimeter 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:23.030
 along the lips red and line 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.340
 we take a second line to the top in 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.340
 a length of 7 mm 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.440
 and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.900
 then this ball of the triangle I am 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.479
 here with the other base so now 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.310
 we will first stun 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:55.509
 there is not a little pieks 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.509
 scare lower lips around border 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.440
 I take this forward triangle out 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:14.750
 now the triangle is drawn again 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.030
 closed while keeping the mouth angle 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.290
 raised 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.260
 We do that with a very thin one 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:29.560
 self-dissolving thread so that one 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:31.670
 no external stitches usually looks 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.379
 you can do that without a nap 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.190
 making at the patient the good 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.000
 tolerate 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.790
 now comes the last stitch then it is 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.989
 the operation already ended you can see 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.700
 already nice that the mouth angle 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.799
 It pulls up nicely here 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.880
 this fine line disappears 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.560
 after a few days 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.569
 it will possibly still for a while 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.709
 here a small red line visible 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.510
 be yours in the course of time 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.670
 one does not need to disappear threads 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.430
 they pull themselves loose like that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.079
 now they look at times 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.239
 finished so you can already see that 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.810
 this downtrend is now gone is it 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.730
 So it goes up nicely now 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.440
 now a little paralyzed by the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.630
 Stunning takes about one more time 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.970
 hour and then it could be free again 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.200
 move and this fine strokes the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.230
 will be within a few days 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.230
 disappear as hurt 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.800
 So the operation is six weeks ago 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.650
 Give them reflect as it is because of the gang 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.070
 the very good vintage so mean 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.610
 Expectations have been fully fulfilled and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:48.160
 happy with the new form with main 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.550
 upward facing mouth angles and in the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.950
 known circle noticed that me 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.050
 how happy i look and if i look 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.930
 looking in the mirror then I see 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:03.700
 not as well as I fill myself up and for 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.920
 me a full success so times are 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.540
 Mouth angles are now tending to decline 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.150
 earlier in the past, they are down sharply 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.620
 gone and you can see now after six 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.209
 Weeks actually no more food 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.400
 So this completely disappeared because 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.470
 that he was put under the skin and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.660
 now it is actually a friendly one 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.959
 Nice to point up the mouth angle too 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.959
