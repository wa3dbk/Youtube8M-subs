00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 simple tutorial for you here on how 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.580
 to resolve an error in any cs type 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.379
 the vast majority of errors are 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.379
 consists of the valve 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.160
 first you have to have a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.480
 installer successful installer clean 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.070

 wanting to settle in Olympus, this is a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.399
 error is on my here in clickpb the game 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.579
 goes to an inter server is a server 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.800
 has a more agile way to solve this 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.460
 but it may not work my not 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.760
 It worked so I'm making a video. 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:51.239
 simply install the cse 2011 made 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.879
 by online access 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.789
 not exactly you are older does not 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.230
 I know someone from the forum 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:08.580
 Let's see all the files in the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:21.689
 computer search appeared a folder 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:24.150
 again in a general survey of the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.390
 computer here is the folder to keep away 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390
 Paulo 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.270
 with that I got it all I got in 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:44.360
 general who wants to do a general search 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.400
 Here national fame give and never 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.970
 researching here where he finds a 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.280
 director of the valve folder does not delete you 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.009
 delete all directors of the valve folder 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.750
 everything has to do with the spokesperson of the 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.670
 social control that develops the number 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.580
 White in connection with public 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.539
 game right on the map 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:16.970
 on the menu because you're on the menu 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:19.370
 Good, I'll be here, it'll probably be 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.840
 only this will cause a fight that I 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.840
 I do not know if I here 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.870
 hamer current editor but i step to valve 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.599

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.569
 Talk to you if you're going to prove yourself. 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.030
 Wow, but how come our got a dll? 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.950
 of the valve a business configurations galera 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.319
 your computer 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.099
 do not persist with the sea gives the valve're 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.760
 right d'aubuisson along with cs 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:11.230
 So, really, there's going to be nobody here. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.230
 ours caught up with a club here 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:32.439
 accident again should not do 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:32.439
 Ignore it 's because here 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.020
 1 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.120
 have what you will have to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:55.080
 will have what you will delight 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:04:02.040
 manually right here you should not take 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:04.250
 annually the city was a tomb back 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.250
 on here 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.019
 on what to upgrade let's see if it goes 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.500
 think it is that the consensus does not pass 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.500
 valve 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.829
 Let's see Let's see Let's see Let's see 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.340
 the video is getting very long four 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.340
 minutes 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.870
 so I 'm going to give a hostel a fast one 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.669
 until it looks hummer develops here I 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.790
 I will not accept you to pay exactly 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:41.889
 It's as bad to close as I know if I go 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:44.530
 install the controversial site 2011 move forward 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.389
 I'm going to give some topic and then I 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.669
 back 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.940
 I came back here so it's for you all 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.750
 It's in the cs now, I'm thinking of April 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.660
 which normally here in windowed mode 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.520
 lower his sound here as you can 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.630
 see it already changed all the settings 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.350
 right 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.910
 already a very good detail is a 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.889
 possibility 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.500
 Now my problem was with my chin and 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.330
 end server new game 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.720
 I'm going to stay here who normally follows 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.710
 has shown servers in it has been a 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.389
 game so the latent hint you went there 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.639
 then think only servers 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:30.000
 Brazilians on the map play at the most 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.000
 100 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:39.789
 I do not know at most and without at least 50 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:44.229
 no step very 50 and here i put 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:48.729
 all as may be that the server 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:51.930
 where the game comes from is that the rain a 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.930
 way map of play 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.950
 AndrÃ© 27 with a difficult pace the difficult 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:07.610
 Find a map here for me to play here. 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:10.940
 11 for sam have to relax 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.660
 so I did not see playing very young and very 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.350
 thank you 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.970
