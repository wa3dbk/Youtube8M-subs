00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.490
 hello youtube friends today I will teach you 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:11.170
 to make a paper bed 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:14.889
 and what we will need is a sheet and 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:19.240
 a good pair of scissors we first double 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.689
 as a triangle what is left over we have it 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.689
 what to cut 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.620
 but very carefully because the minimum 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.620
 error 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.940
 do not enter the figure good this what 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.850
 we separate 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.440
 It has to stay like that, then we look for it 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.440
 from this part of the state 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.900
 the ball of the program we put it in shape 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.680
 of square 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.190
 let's go halfway for that I'm careful 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.190
 why 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.600
 an ugly dot is folded a part and the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 they have to bend very well after 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.000
 here they have to fold it here 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 remark or because these two points 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.040
 of sight will not need after the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.790
 tips will not need one of the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.790
 four sides 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.820
 but very good that it does not happen 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.820
 another line or nothing 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.780
 then we flipped him 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.080
 after the tips we started talking 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.080
 A) Yes 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.670
 also of the four parts 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.200
 Hello 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.930
 we flipped it 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.930
 after the pints seized a love 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.590
 of the four parts again 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.709
 then it's not complicated but not what 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.709
 is 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 then we flip it over again 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.840
 and from these open doors we do not 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.530
 cable and we have to do it in a way 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.640
 of rectangle of the 41 but nothing else is 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.640
 the way we flip them 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.849
 we make it here 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.739
 only three do we have to double 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.739
 down and one up 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.549
 we unfolded it 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.650
 and is the good bed friends I hope that 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.700
