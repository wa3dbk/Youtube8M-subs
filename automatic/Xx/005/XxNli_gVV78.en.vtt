00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
so what we look at now is panorama view

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.430 
so what we look at now is panorama view
which<00:00:02.389> Nintendo<00:00:03.389> claims<00:00:03.600> was<00:00:03.720> at<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.140> e3

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
which Nintendo claims was at the e3

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.289 
which Nintendo claims was at the e3
event<00:00:04.650> but<00:00:05.029> unfortunately<00:00:06.029> never<00:00:06.120> got<00:00:06.270> a

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
event but unfortunately never got a

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.220 
event but unfortunately never got a
chance<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.509> see<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.810> point<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.140> is

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
chance to see at that point so this is

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.759 
chance to see at that point so this is
brand<00:00:07.500> new<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:08.010> us<00:00:08.719> in<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.900> nutshell<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.650> can

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
brand new for us in a nutshell you can

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.240 
brand new for us in a nutshell you can
see<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.040> TV<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:12.290> just<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.410> car<00:00:13.710> drive<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.130> we

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
see on the TV is just a car drive and we

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.340 
see on the TV is just a car drive and we
think<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> car<00:00:14.849> driving<00:00:15.330> along<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> streets

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
think is a car driving along the streets

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.410 
think is a car driving along the streets
and<00:00:16.590> from<00:00:17.310> here<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:17.970> actually<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and from here you can actually get a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.460 
and from here you can actually get a
more<00:00:18.600> interactive<00:00:18.810> view<00:00:19.199> where<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.380> can

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
more interactive view where you can

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.330 
more interactive view where you can
actually<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.859> kind<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.900> rotate<00:00:21.900> see

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
actually just kind of rotate see

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.560 
actually just kind of rotate see
basically<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:23.640> sides<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> street<00:00:24.480> I

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
basically all sides of the street I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
basically all sides of the street I
think<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.099> real-time<00:00:26.099> google

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
think it as like a real-time google

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.140 
think it as like a real-time google
street<00:00:26.789> view<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.960> goes<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.939> down

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
street view and goes up and you can down

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.700 
street view and goes up and you can down
the<00:00:30.179> interesting<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.660> no<00:00:30.960> matter<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.380> far<00:00:31.679> I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the interesting is no matter how far I

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.930 
the interesting is no matter how far I
go<00:00:32.040> down<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:33.239> never<00:00:33.450> ever<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.100> driver

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
go down I can never ever see the driver

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.200 
go down I can never ever see the driver
in<00:00:36.149> question<00:00:37.640> also<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:38.969> did

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
in question also if I actually did

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420 
in question also if I actually did
rotate<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> car<00:00:40.290> I'd<00:00:40.530> probably

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
rotate like this in a car I'd probably

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150 
rotate like this in a car I'd probably
be<00:00:42.180> dead<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.870> point<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> last<00:00:44.070> thing

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
be dead at this point so the last thing

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
be dead at this point so the last thing
we're<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.520> at<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.480> HD

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
we're going to look at is the HD

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
we're going to look at is the HD
experience<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.100> seeing<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
experience what we're seeing here is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.639 
experience what we're seeing here is
basically<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.450> example<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.440> use

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
basically an example of what we use

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.799 
basically an example of what we use

powers can be capable of whereas the wii

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.029 
powers can be capable of whereas the wii
was<00:00:52.050> decidedly<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> standard

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039

have<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> lot<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> controls<00:01:16.799> around<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> use

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
have a lot of controls around we can use

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.840 
have a lot of controls around we can use
the<00:01:17.850> stick<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> camera<00:01:19.680> angle<00:01:19.850> ever

so slightly but with a camera but we can
actually<00:01:23.790> completely<00:01:24.390> dramatically<00:01:25.020> change

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290

additionally with the with light we can

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.429 
additionally with the with light we can
change<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> entire<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.020> 90<00:01:31.290> today

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
change the entire thing from 90 today

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
change the entire thing from 90 today
and<00:01:32.310> we're<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.880> happening<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.360> real

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and we're all this is happening in real

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.469 
and we're all this is happening in real
time<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.210> especially

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
time and you can see especially

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.330 
time and you can see especially
nighttime<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.409> how<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.619> light<00:01:38.070> is
