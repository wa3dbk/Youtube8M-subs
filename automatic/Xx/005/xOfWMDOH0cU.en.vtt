00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.600
 another time but be sure to take off too 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.240
 it looks like this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.279
 box as always de everything is written on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
 Chinese or Japanese 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.300
 I don't even know, but again, I 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.910
 used the instruction in English 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.040
 language to understand it all today 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.860
 I'll show you how I did it all so 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.420
 we will be that of the test and yes such here 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.420
 way it all looks inside and 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.640
 cut off a corner of the lady then will we 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.190
 pour 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.420
 and fall asleep pink powder and pour 1 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.159
 measuring spoon with water and stirred it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 we should have a strawberry type 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:03.379
 ice cream is now the same with white 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.379
 powder 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.440
 and it should turn out vanilla 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440
 ice cream 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.410
 Now such a pastry syringe 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.900
 my somehow turn out there is such 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.030
 captivatingly what place does he need 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.920
 turn well and actually like that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.180
 turn into something normal 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.160
 You can pour this texture and so 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.380
 That was the result 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.230
 it's very hard to do and i have this 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.340
 it took a lot of time so i 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.040
 I cut through my hole and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.470
 We start of course very shame on us 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 I never make ice cream 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.530
 so it came out as something very strange 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 but 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 now also there are two rollers here 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.930
 I have to cut it here well here 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.079
 the family itself also joined 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.079
 how to get a decoration 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.659
 Here we hang on two cooking such we 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.659
 have turned out 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 and then I will say such a basket 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.120

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.000

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.890

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.720

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.910
