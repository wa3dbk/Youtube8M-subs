certainly

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.920 

the<00:06:58.720> fastest<00:06:59.110> lap<00:06:59.200> was<00:06:59.320> one<00:06:59.669> 21.6<00:07:01.200> that<00:07:02.200> is

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
the fastest lap was one 21.6 that is

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.360 
the fastest lap was one 21.6 that is
just<00:07:04.930> over<00:07:05.320> 20<00:07:05.590> seconds<00:07:05.889> outside<00:07:06.220> the

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
Leprechaun our world

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.650 
Leprechaun our world
yeah<00:07:07.960> I<00:07:07.990> think<00:07:08.169> so<00:07:09.280> at<00:07:09.400> 20<00:07:09.790> years<00:07:09.820> outside<00:07:10.360> it

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
yeah I think so at 20 years outside it

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:32.730 
yeah I think so at 20 years outside it
is<00:07:10.720> really<00:07:11.110> something

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.980 

let's<00:07:33.740> hear<00:07:33.950> it
