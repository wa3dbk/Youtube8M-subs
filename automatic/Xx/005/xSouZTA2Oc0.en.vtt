00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
or fullness to my hair so I'm deciding

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.060

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
bands and put a ponytail at the top so I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.490 
bands and put a ponytail at the top so I
can<00:01:36.800> just<00:01:37.160> have<00:01:37.220> more<00:01:37.490> control<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.270> I'm<00:01:38.780> have

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.200 
can just have more control and I'm have
an<00:01:39.620> idea<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.160> I'm<00:01:40.250> probably<00:01:40.460> gonna<00:01:40.790> end<00:01:40.880> up

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
an idea that I'm probably gonna end up

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
an idea that I'm probably gonna end up
pinning<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.110> up<00:01:42.230> somehow<00:01:42.560> not<00:01:43.040> exactly<00:01:43.400> sure

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
pinning it up somehow not exactly sure

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.730 
pinning it up somehow not exactly sure
but<00:01:44.240> first<00:01:44.420> before<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:44.870> work<00:01:45.020> with<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.350> part<00:01:45.620> I

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
but first before I work with that part I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.010 
but first before I work with that part I
want<00:01:46.010> to<00:01:46.160> secure<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.820> headband<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.540> saw

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020

several people use bobby pins so I have
several<00:01:51.410> bobby<00:01:51.650> pins<00:01:52.070> I'm<00:01:52.280> gonna<00:01:52.490> use<00:01:53.090> some

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
several bobby pins I'm gonna use some

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.990

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
pin the head wrap in place so so that it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:07.000 
pin the head wrap in place so so that it
stays<00:01:59.240> better<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.960> those<00:02:06.200> poppy<00:02:06.440> pins<00:02:06.740> did<00:02:06.980> a

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
stays better so those poppy pins did a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.760 
stays better so those poppy pins did a
really<00:02:07.460> good<00:02:07.730> job<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:08.320> securing<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.410> heaven

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
really good job of securing the heaven

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.450 
really good job of securing the heaven
in<00:02:09.950> place<00:02:10.190> it's<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:11.090> going<00:02:11.660> anywhere<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:13.250> I

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
in place it's not going anywhere and I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.920 
in place it's not going anywhere and I
would<00:02:13.640> have<00:02:13.730> never<00:02:13.940> thought<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.330> put<00:02:14.660> bobby

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
would have never thought to put bobby

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.740 
would have never thought to put bobby
pins<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:16.130> headband<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:16.970> not<00:02:17.210> seen<00:02:17.480> other

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
pins and a headband if I not seen other

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.650 
pins and a headband if I not seen other
tutorials<00:02:18.440> where<00:02:19.070> they<00:02:19.220> did<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.540> was

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
tutorials where they did so so that was

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.590 
tutorials where they did so so that was
a<00:02:20.690> good<00:02:20.900> idea<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.520> I'm<00:02:22.970> just<00:02:23.150> tightening<00:02:23.480> on

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
a good idea and I'm just tightening on

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.949 
a good idea and I'm just tightening on
my<00:02:23.720> ponytail<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:25.340> I'm<00:02:25.730> thinking<00:02:26.600> maybe<00:02:26.630> I

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
my ponytail and now I'm thinking maybe I

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.070 
my ponytail and now I'm thinking maybe I
should<00:02:27.200> put<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.380> bang<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:28.600> some<00:02:29.600> kind<00:02:29.840> of<00:02:29.870> hair

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
should put a bang or some kind of hair

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.380 
should put a bang or some kind of hair
out<00:02:30.260> at<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.980> front<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.760> now<00:02:31.910> I'm<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.120> taking

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
out at the front so now I'm just taking

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.600 
out at the front so now I'm just taking
a<00:02:32.450> wide<00:02:32.630> toothed<00:02:32.900> comb<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.590> taking<00:02:34.370> some<00:02:34.580> of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
a wide toothed comb and taking some of

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.910 
a wide toothed comb and taking some of
my<00:02:34.730> hair<00:02:35.030> down<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.780> swoop<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.560> over<00:02:36.800> to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
my hair down so I can swoop it over to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.670 
my hair down so I can swoop it over to
the<00:02:37.040> side<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.459> had<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:38.060> curling<00:02:38.600> wand<00:02:38.660> on<00:02:39.140> standby

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
the side I had a curling wand on standby

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.979 
the side I had a curling wand on standby
it<00:02:39.830> was<00:02:40.130> already<00:02:40.370> heated<00:02:40.730> up<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.090> ready<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.780> go

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
it was already heated up and ready to go

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.430 
it was already heated up and ready to go
but<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.200> really<00:02:42.290> did<00:02:42.920> not<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.250> enough<00:02:43.520> time<00:02:43.700> to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
but I really did not have enough time to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.380 
but I really did not have enough time to
add<00:02:45.440> any<00:02:45.770> curls<00:02:46.190> but<00:02:46.550> that<00:02:46.730> was<00:02:46.880> initially

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
add any curls but that was initially

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.479 
add any curls but that was initially
what<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.570> planned<00:02:47.870> on<00:02:48.050> doing<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.440> didn't<00:02:48.860> end<00:02:49.340> up

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
what I planned on doing I didn't end up

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.220 
what I planned on doing I didn't end up
having<00:02:49.760> enough<00:02:49.910> time<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.120> do<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.540> though<00:02:50.750> so

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
having enough time to do that though so
