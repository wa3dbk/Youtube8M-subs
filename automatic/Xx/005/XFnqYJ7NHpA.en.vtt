00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.219 
you mean three things you don't need
dirt<00:01:15.190> you're<00:01:15.909> going<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.210> need<00:01:16.299> to<00:01:16.390> bed<00:01:16.630> you're

dirt you're going to need to bed you're
going<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.740> need<00:01:17.920> grass<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.200> simplest

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
going to need grass so the the simplest

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.770 
going to need grass so the the simplest
explanation<00:01:20.920> of<00:01:21.549> this<00:01:21.670> is<00:01:21.909> we're<00:01:22.090> looking<00:01:22.270> for

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
explanation of this is we're looking for

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.859 
explanation of this is we're looking for
a<00:01:22.810> hole<00:01:22.990> something<00:01:23.740> like<00:01:24.070> this<00:01:24.580> and<00:01:25.210> what

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
a hole something like this and what

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:26.820 
a hole something like this and what
we're<00:01:26.020> going<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.200> do<00:01:26.260> is<00:01:26.380> we're<00:01:26.530> gonna<00:01:26.619> put

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
we're going to do is we're gonna put

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.280 
we're going to do is we're gonna put
grass<00:01:27.189> down<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.790> then<00:01:27.909> put<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.420> bed<00:01:28.689> over<00:01:28.930> top

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
grass down and then put the bed over top

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.640 
grass down and then put the bed over top
of<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.799> as<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.010> can<00:01:30.280> see<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.659> bed<00:01:32.020> has

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
of it and as you can see the bed has

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.980 
of it and as you can see the bed has
replaced<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:35.530> super<00:01:36.130> easy<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.610> do

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
replaced it so it's so super easy to do

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.820 
replaced it so it's so super easy to do
and<00:01:37.990> then<00:01:38.170> we'll<00:01:38.290> try<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.560> again

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
and then we'll try it again

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.399 
and then we'll try it again
but<00:01:39.100> yeah<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.960> essentially<00:01:40.960> what<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.229> is

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
but yeah so essentially what this is

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.420 
but yeah so essentially what this is
doing<00:01:41.619> is<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:43.030> just<00:01:43.270> taking<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:45.040> taking

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
doing is it's just taking it's taking

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.990 
doing is it's just taking it's taking
advantage<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.360> tile<00:01:46.540> in<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.990> air<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:48.000> it's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
advantage of a tile in the air and it's

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.609 
advantage of a tile in the air and it's
just<00:01:49.210> replacing<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.810> bedrock<00:01:50.110> it's<00:01:50.290> all<00:01:50.439> it's

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
just replacing the bedrock it's all it's

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.080 
just replacing the bedrock it's all it's
doing<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:51.040> not<00:01:51.070> popping<00:01:51.579> it<00:01:51.729> you're<00:01:51.970> not

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
doing it's not popping it you're not

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.429 
doing it's not popping it you're not
gonna<00:01:52.210> be<00:01:52.360> able<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.600> collect<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.110> or<00:01:53.229> anything

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
gonna be able to collect it or anything

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.789 
gonna be able to collect it or anything
like<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.820> let<00:01:55.270> me<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.780> if<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:56.290> see<00:01:56.530> another

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
like that so let me see if I see another

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.740 
like that so let me see if I see another
spot<00:01:57.189> so<00:01:57.430> let's<00:01:57.640> actually<00:01:57.850> go<00:01:58.060> ahead<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.509> test

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
spot so let's actually go ahead and test

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.050 
spot so let's actually go ahead and test
this<00:01:58.930> just<00:01:59.380> unlike<00:01:59.799> a<00:01:59.829> random<00:02:00.430> spot<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.909> see

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
this just unlike a random spot and see

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.870 
this just unlike a random spot and see
if<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.270> works<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.470> does<00:02:02.650> work<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:03.070> some<00:02:03.790> of

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
if it works so it does work on some of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.490 
if it works so it does work on some of
the<00:02:03.970> random<00:02:04.360> spots<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.960> try<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:05.259> way<00:02:05.590> as<00:02:05.740> well

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the random spots to try this way as well

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.069 
the random spots to try this way as well
see<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.280> looks<00:02:09.519> like<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.819> works<00:02:09.970> sometimes<00:02:10.390> and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
see so looks like it works sometimes and

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.830 
see so looks like it works sometimes and
then<00:02:11.170> sometimes<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.980> looks<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.659> okay<00:02:13.659> it's<00:02:13.780> a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
then sometimes it looks like okay it's a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.420 
then sometimes it looks like okay it's a
bit<00:02:13.989> work<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.409> that<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:14.709> let's<00:02:14.950> try<00:02:15.219> it<00:02:15.279> on

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
bit work on that one let's try it on

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.090 
bit work on that one let's try it on
this<00:02:15.579> one

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
this one

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.320 
this one
okay<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.160> didn't<00:02:18.490> work<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.090> was

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
okay so didn't work on that one was

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.810 
okay so didn't work on that one was
tried<00:02:19.600> on<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.990> one<00:02:21.210> let's<00:02:22.210> actually<00:02:22.420> try<00:02:22.900> it

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
tried on this one let's actually try it

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.010 
tried on this one let's actually try it
right<00:02:24.820> here<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.700> sometimes<00:02:28.600> it'll<00:02:28.840> work

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
right here so it sometimes it'll work

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.350 
right here so it sometimes it'll work
sometimes<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.650> won't<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.400> depends<00:02:31.330> on

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
sometimes it won't it just depends on

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.130 
sometimes it won't it just depends on
the<00:02:32.020> situation<00:02:32.490> now<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.600> said<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> can

the situation now like I said you can
use<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.680> make<00:02:35.800> traps<00:02:36.130> there's<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.490> lot<00:02:36.850> of

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
use this to make traps there's a lot of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.820
