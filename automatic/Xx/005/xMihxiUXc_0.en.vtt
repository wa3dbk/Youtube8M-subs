make a difference in individual patients

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.180 
make a difference in individual patients
but<00:02:55.240> hopefully<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.780> can<00:02:55.960> make<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.380> difference<00:02:56.680> in

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
but hopefully I can make a difference in

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.610 
but hopefully I can make a difference in

of<00:03:12.130> Pittsburgh<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.760> how<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.030> doing<00:03:16.330> today

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
of Pittsburgh so how you doing today

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.440 
of Pittsburgh so how you doing today
okay<00:03:18.040> I'm<00:03:18.340> getting<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.760> little<00:03:18.850> tired<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:19.330> I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
okay I'm getting a little tired but I

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.700 
okay I'm getting a little tired but I
guess<00:03:19.690> that's<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:19.990> from<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.350> radiation

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
guess that's just from the radiation

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.960 
guess that's just from the radiation
that<00:03:20.980> I'm<00:03:21.100> going<00:03:21.250> through<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.610> I<00:03:21.670> only<00:03:21.790> have

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
that I'm going through and I only have

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.630 
that I'm going through and I only have
six<00:03:22.210> more<00:03:22.360> treatments<00:03:22.960> so<00:03:23.140> good<00:03:23.470> my<00:03:24.100> husband

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
six more treatments so good my husband

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.880 
six more treatments so good my husband
had<00:03:24.910> had<00:03:25.120> cancer<00:03:25.660> he<00:03:25.990> passed<00:03:26.260> away<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.500> year<00:03:26.620> ago

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
had had cancer he passed away a year ago

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.730 
had had cancer he passed away a year ago
and<00:03:27.340> he<00:03:28.270> was<00:03:28.300> offered<00:03:28.810> clinical<00:03:29.230> trials<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
and he was offered clinical trials and

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.880 
and he was offered clinical trials and
he<00:03:29.890> refused<00:03:30.400> them<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.820> after<00:03:31.780> he<00:03:32.200> refused<00:03:32.440> him

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
he refused them and after he refused him

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.220 
he refused them and after he refused him
in<00:03:33.070> my<00:03:33.760> mind<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.300> thought<00:03:34.540> what<00:03:34.990> an<00:03:35.110> opportunity

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
in my mind I thought what an opportunity

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.590 
in my mind I thought what an opportunity
to<00:03:35.830> help<00:03:35.950> other<00:03:36.160> people<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.910> he<00:03:37.060> didn't<00:03:37.360> take

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
to help other people that he didn't take

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.930 
to help other people that he didn't take
that<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.140> often<00:03:38.770> said<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.010> myself<00:03:39.460> that<00:03:39.640> if<00:03:39.820> I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
that and often said to myself that if I

clinical<00:03:56.800> trial<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.280> was<00:03:57.520> in<00:03:57.790> they<00:03:58.330> took<00:03:58.540> a

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
clinical trial that I was in they took a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.780 
clinical trial that I was in they took a
genetic<00:03:59.020> testing<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.560> my<00:03:59.710> tumor<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.340> then

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
genetic testing of my tumor and then

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.060 
genetic testing of my tumor and then
randomly<00:04:01.300> they<00:04:01.540> chose<00:04:01.870> me<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.410> take<00:04:02.920> the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
randomly they chose me to take the

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.890 
randomly they chose me to take the
radiation<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:04.030> hormone<00:04:04.390> therapy

radiation and the hormone therapy

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.320 
radiation and the hormone therapy
basically<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.040> clinical<00:04:06.460> trial<00:04:06.670> was<00:04:06.850> folded

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
basically the clinical trial was folded

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.750 
basically the clinical trial was folded
into<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:08.530> Cancer<00:04:09.010> Care<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.460> already

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
into the Cancer Care I was already

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.510 
into the Cancer Care I was already
getting<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.780> wasn't<00:04:11.140> like<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.290> giant<00:04:11.830> leap<00:04:12.220> into

getting it wasn't like a giant leap into

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
something into a foreign area it was all

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.849 
something into a foreign area it was all
intermingled<00:04:15.880> together<00:04:16.270> I<00:04:16.810> did<00:04:17.560> not<00:04:17.650> feel

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
intermingled together I did not feel

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.560 
intermingled together I did not feel
that<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.100> was<00:04:18.160> an<00:04:18.310> inconvenience<00:04:19.060> when<00:04:19.270> I<00:04:19.299> was

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
that it was an inconvenience when I was

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.020 
that it was an inconvenience when I was
randomized<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.470> just<00:04:20.980> had<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.700> have<00:04:21.910> the

radiation in the hormone therapy we know

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.100 
radiation in the hormone therapy we know
that<00:04:23.950> certain<00:04:24.670> drugs<00:04:25.150> now<00:04:25.510> are<00:04:25.810> more

that certain drugs now are more

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.860 
that certain drugs now are more

when I talk to my patients about
clinical<00:04:30.400> trials<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:31.030> say<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.660> them<00:04:31.810> well<00:04:31.840> the

try<00:04:44.780> down<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.990> road<00:04:46.199> there<00:04:46.560> will<00:04:47.130> be<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> way<00:04:47.639> of

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
try down the road there will be a way of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.330 
try down the road there will be a way of
curing<00:04:48.509> all<00:04:48.870> cancers<00:04:49.530> not<00:04:49.740> just<00:04:50.069> breast

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
curing all cancers not just breast

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.300 
curing all cancers not just breast
cancer<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.720> clinical<00:04:52.169> trials<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.800> me<00:04:53.039> are

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
cancer and the clinical trials to me are

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.290 
cancer and the clinical trials to me are
very<00:04:53.699> important<00:04:54.449> for<00:04:55.259> that<00:04:55.530> step<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.300> again

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
very important for that step and again

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.930 
very important for that step and again
that's<00:04:57.449> how<00:04:57.750> we<00:04:57.810> make<00:04:58.139> progress<00:04:58.500> is<00:04:59.009> by<00:04:59.729> this

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
that's how we make progress is by this

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.900 
that's how we make progress is by this

clinical<00:05:02.910> trials<00:05:03.270> participation<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.259> so<00:05:04.680> I

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
clinical trials participation and so I

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.309 
clinical trials participation and so I
think<00:05:05.039> as<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.400> society<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:06.270> general<00:05:06.300> we<00:05:06.780> all<00:05:06.990> win

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
think as a society in general we all win

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.460 
think as a society in general we all win
when<00:05:07.650> we<00:05:07.770> participate<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.460> clinical<00:05:08.610> trials
