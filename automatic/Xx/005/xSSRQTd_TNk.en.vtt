continue working with it in the next
couple<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.560> rows<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.700> you'll<00:02:40.210> pick<00:02:40.330> up<00:02:40.450> your

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
couple of rows so you'll pick up your

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.200 
couple of rows so you'll pick up your
next<00:02:40.810> color<00:02:41.200> once<00:02:42.010> again<00:02:42.310> two<00:02:42.580> strands<00:02:43.030> held

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
next color once again two strands held

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.980 
next color once again two strands held
together<00:02:43.570> throughout<00:02:43.960> will<00:02:44.950> make<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.130> slipknot

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
together throughout will make a slipknot

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.800 
together throughout will make a slipknot
leaving<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.050> nice<00:02:47.230> long<00:02:47.500> tail<00:02:51.180> we'll<00:02:52.180> put<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
leaving a nice long tail we'll put the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.330 
leaving a nice long tail we'll put the
slip<00:02:53.020> knot<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:55.030> next<00:02:55.390> empty<00:02:55.750> peg<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:57.070> get

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
slip knot on the next empty peg you get

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.630 
slip knot on the next empty peg you get
nice<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.550> tight<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.980> we're<00:03:00.160> ready<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.490> take

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
nice and tight now we're ready to take

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.790 
nice and tight now we're ready to take
our<00:03:00.700> weeding<00:03:01.180> tool<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:03.070> start<00:03:03.730> weaving<00:03:04.800> our

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
our weeding tool and start weaving our

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.540 
our weeding tool and start weaving our
next<00:03:06.220> row<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:08.410> do<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.770> same<00:03:08.800> way

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
next row we do it the same way

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.330 
next row we do it the same way
it's<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> previous<00:03:10.600> rows<00:03:10.870> going<00:03:11.560> over<00:03:11.920> four

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
it's the previous rows going over four

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.680 
it's the previous rows going over four
and<00:03:12.780> under<00:03:13.780> four<00:03:15.030> you'll<00:03:16.030> continue<00:03:16.480> working

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
and under four you'll continue working

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.360 
and under four you'll continue working
this<00:03:16.990> way<00:03:17.200> until<00:03:17.230> we<00:03:17.710> get<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.160> other<00:03:18.280> end

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
this way until we get to the other end

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.790 
this way until we get to the other end
of<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.700> loom<00:03:18.940> where<00:03:19.570> we'll<00:03:20.170> weave<00:03:20.440> through

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
of the loom where we'll weave through

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.460 
of the loom where we'll weave through
our<00:03:20.980> next<00:03:21.310> color<00:03:21.520> as<00:03:21.820> you<00:03:22.600> can<00:03:22.720> see<00:03:22.990> we<00:03:23.260> have

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
our next color as you can see we have

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.740 
our next color as you can see we have
our<00:03:23.770> two<00:03:24.010> different<00:03:24.310> rows<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:25.360> different

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
our two different rows of different

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.810 
our two different rows of different
colors<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.350> we're<00:03:27.040> ready<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.490> start

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
colors and we're ready to start

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.200 
colors and we're ready to start
repeating<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.660> pattern<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.940> we'll<00:03:31.060> go<00:03:31.180> ahead

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
repeating the pattern so we'll go ahead

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.520 
repeating the pattern so we'll go ahead
and<00:03:31.510> pick<00:03:31.690> up<00:03:31.720> our<00:03:31.960> first<00:03:32.230> color<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:35.260> as<00:03:35.380> you

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
and pick up our first color and as you

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.850 
and pick up our first color and as you
can<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:36.210> we've<00:03:37.210> skipped<00:03:37.570> two<00:03:38.200> pegs<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.800> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
can see we've skipped two pegs and the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.040 
can see we've skipped two pegs and the
yarn<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.460> just<00:03:39.700> wrapping<00:03:40.240> around<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.900> we'll

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
yarn is just wrapping around it so we'll

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.710 
yarn is just wrapping around it so we'll
go<00:03:44.200> ahead<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.620> pull<00:03:44.920> these<00:03:45.100> strands<00:03:45.820> all<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
go ahead and pull these strands all the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.230 
go ahead and pull these strands all the
way<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.410> opposite<00:03:47.830> end<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.190> loom<00:03:48.490> and

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
way to the opposite end of the loom and

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.690 
way to the opposite end of the loom and
we'll<00:03:49.360> keep<00:03:49.570> working<00:03:50.350> this<00:03:50.740> way<00:03:50.950> across<00:03:51.460> the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
we'll keep working this way across the

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.140 
we'll keep working this way across the
loom<00:03:52.170> carrying<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.950> yarns<00:03:54.250> across<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.940> peg

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
loom carrying the yarns across the peg

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.510 
loom carrying the yarns across the peg
when<00:03:55.780> we<00:03:55.930> switch<00:03:56.170> colors<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:57.160> really<00:03:57.190> just

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
when we switch colors it's really just

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.270 
when we switch colors it's really just
that<00:03:57.670> easy<00:03:57.880> now<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.750> can<00:03:59.080> make<00:03:59.230> any<00:03:59.620> kind<00:04:00.190> of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
that easy now you can make any kind of

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.570 
that easy now you can make any kind of
pattern<00:04:00.490> on<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.390> loom
