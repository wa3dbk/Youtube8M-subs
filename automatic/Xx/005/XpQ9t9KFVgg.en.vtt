00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.960 
and that will do and all you have to do
now<00:02:40.200> there's<00:02:40.830> cover<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:41.250> popping<00:02:41.610> up<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
now there's cover that's popping up and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.760 
now there's cover that's popping up and
actually<00:02:42.630> wait<00:02:42.960> for<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.320> cook<00:02:43.470> from<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
actually wait for it to cook from the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.890 
actually wait for it to cook from the
skin<00:02:44.070> side<00:02:44.310> up<00:02:44.610> I'm<00:02:45.180> never<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.720> turn

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
skin side up I'm never going to turn

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.360 
skin side up I'm never going to turn
this<00:02:46.080> fish<00:02:46.260> around<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> cook

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
this fish around it's just going to cook

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.370 
this fish around it's just going to cook
like<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.270> it's<00:02:48.420> reasonably<00:02:48.870> important

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
like this so it's reasonably important

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.140 
like this so it's reasonably important
that<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.770> a<00:02:49.800> lid<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.280> fish<00:02:50.460> if<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
that you have a lid on the fish if you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.360 
that you have a lid on the fish if you
don't<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> weber<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:53.220> you

don't have a weber like this all you
have<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.640> do<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.270> your<00:02:54.450> barbecue<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.020> put

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
some rock and roll over after with the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.970 
some rock and roll over after with the
shiny<00:02:57.120> side<00:02:57.390> down<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.560> exactly

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
shiny side down and you can get exactly

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.910 
shiny side down and you can get exactly
the<00:02:59.160> same<00:02:59.400> thing

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.820 

and<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:05.190> it's<00:03:05.490> just<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.760> question<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.209> waiting

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.520 

and<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.980> course<00:03:11.630> nobody<00:03:12.630> expects<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.200> wait

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
that all over all over it's bubbling

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.110 
that all over all over it's bubbling
through<00:03:54.980> on<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.250> Snooki<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.730> can<00:03:55.880> see<00:03:56.030> it

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
through on the Snooki you can see it

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.580 
through on the Snooki you can see it
even<00:03:56.239> on<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.569> side<00:03:56.780> even<00:03:57.200> in<00:03:57.319> the<00:03:57.410> thick

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
even on the side even in the thick

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.500 
even on the side even in the thick
muscle<00:03:57.920> right<00:03:58.040> over<00:03:58.250> here<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.390> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
muscle right over here and this is the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.509 
muscle right over here and this is the
time<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.900> take<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:00.230> snip<00:04:00.470> off<00:04:00.650> what<00:04:01.400> we're

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
time to take the snip off what we're

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.160 
time to take the snip off what we're
going<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.730> do<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:02.090> we're<00:04:02.690> going<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:02.930> take

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
going to do is we're going to just take

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.870 
going to do is we're going to just take
it<00:04:03.319> off<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.709> will<00:04:03.950> probably<00:04:04.340> be<00:04:04.430> back<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.640> two

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
it off it will probably be back in two

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.420 
it off it will probably be back in two
pieces<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.650> that's<00:04:06.890> just<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.160> way<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.400> goes

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
pieces but that's just the way it goes

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.520 
pieces but that's just the way it goes
the<00:04:08.239> best<00:04:08.480> thing<00:04:08.690> about<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:09.260> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
the best thing about it is that the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.039 
the best thing about it is that the
reason<00:04:09.829> why<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.010> cook<00:04:10.370> snook<00:04:10.790> with<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.750> skin

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
reason why you cook snook with a skin

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.410 
reason why you cook snook with a skin
down<00:04:12.319> is<00:04:12.590> because<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:13.069> skin<00:04:13.370> will<00:04:14.000> now<00:04:14.180> get

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
down is because the skin will now get

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.420 
down is because the skin will now get
burnt<00:04:14.690> or<00:04:15.140> whatever<00:04:15.590> happens<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.160> down

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
burnt or whatever happens to a down

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.580 
burnt or whatever happens to a down
there<00:04:16.669> but<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.450> rest<00:04:17.600> of<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.900> meat<00:04:18.079> will<00:04:18.440> be

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
there but the rest of the meat will be

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:33.619 
there but the rest of the meat will be
beautiful<00:04:19.190> tea

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.290 

from<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.349> section<00:04:34.740> right<00:04:34.949> there<00:04:35.089> that<00:04:36.089> piece

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
from that section right there that piece

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.119 
from that section right there that piece
of<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.539> stomach<00:04:36.929> that's<00:04:37.289> my<00:04:37.499> favorite<00:04:37.949> piece

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
of the stomach that's my favorite piece

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.230 
of the stomach that's my favorite piece
