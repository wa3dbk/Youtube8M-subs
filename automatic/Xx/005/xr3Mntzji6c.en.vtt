00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.470
 every one of them today takes care of me from 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.509
 miami canada I bring you a new 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.120
 video of tips on this occasion this map 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.520
 of rekalde and are some grenades for 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.540
 have an aggressive start at the beginning 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.309
 of the game because this one 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.050
 to this place where it ends up seems 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.670
 let's also respawn to when I'm 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.439
 directing let's call them a man 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.550
 to notice in confusions and that is a 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.860
 little simpler than for me 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.270
 explain them not only better grenades 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.710
 world are not the best beginnings of the 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.320
 world but its beginnings that to me 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.820
 they work very well and well I hope 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.410
 that you also work for them 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.910
 you help them and it is , 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.850
 mainly that they like this video 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.010
 and that my goal is to learn 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.690
 some and why are not we going to answer 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.579
 nothing that I think the most 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.559
 what I bring that is coming out of what 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.480
 is the spa one on the top there's 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.220
 like a strip of windows and what 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.660
 it's a helicopter destroyed with the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.010
 window frames and with a propeller 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.540
 of helicopters noises is formed a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.760
 kind of goal you just thought 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.710
 here if the grenade passes through that goal 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.270
 whether they score a goal 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.160
 the grenade stays in the hall more 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.110
 transited of what the state is should 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.050
 it's the show that I tell you, look, it's the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.520
 hallway I tell you you can take 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.160
 double can be carried triple is a very 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.740
 good nothing have favorites this other is 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.420
 in the spa where you see in the in the room 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.640
 which is on the left side plug in the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.500
 armchair identifies I put two lines if 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.090
 put the grenade between its lines that is 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.220
 between the two branches of what is the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.930
 tree the armada between directly what 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.550
 which is the fourth if there has to be anything in 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.040
 what is the arrow the grenade there 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.140
 exactly here the first grenade that 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.940
 that I show you between the two stripes is 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.590
 so that the grenade between this room the 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.180
 second is to kill the guy who comes out 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.790
 running then you decide there is 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.380
 that send it this other nothing has no 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.940
 joke is a very simple branch 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.610
 it's just to show that tour 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.869
 and the grenade helps you according to 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.789
 go out and start shooting 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.050
 then like that it's also like for 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.460
 protect you in what you do 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.190
 travel on the left side and you can 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.750
 attack what is given with mobs esther 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.360
 nothing of my favorites from spam 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.149
 must first is a square and what is 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.979
 a centex to clean up that whole area and 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.990
 If in case you have expected the 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.670
 left side that goes blind and this 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.349
 second sentence that you are going to throw that is 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.340
 pointing to half of what is the frame 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.170
 of the door 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.819
 so that the wey who is after the campero 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.810
 that are a bar that is all 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.090
 we know that a point always 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.769
 campero and do not see you stay 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.540
 arrowed then practically you 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.569
 you can clean everything that is memory 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.580
 you alone the truth is once very good 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.560
 this as a tour I like a shit and 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.870
 it works very well I hope that you 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.790
 it works very well and good this last one 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.379
 which is price coming out of what are the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.720
 electric stairs basically the 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.010
 brotherhood between the two announcements a bit 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.049
 more stuck to the xxi if they fix I'm 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.340
 more stuck to the one on the right over what 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.709
 is the announcement this wood that is 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.299
 short of me then quite the frog 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.099
 on the side of chivas that exactly 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.019
 transit of what is the fucking camper that 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.910
 you can wait for the judges who 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.769
 are coming out of the room then 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.459
 I bring them as one says 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.540
 grenade to attack and another to defend 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.540
