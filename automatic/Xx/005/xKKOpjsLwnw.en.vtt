00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
given I'm not American so I was a little

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.210 
given I'm not American so I was a little

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
what they learnt and all the stuff which

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.800 
what they learnt and all the stuff which
you<00:02:06.630> covered<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> day<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.920> they'd<00:02:08.250> obviously

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
you covered in day one they'd obviously

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.520 
you covered in day one they'd obviously
internalized<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.080> that's<00:02:10.259> what<00:02:10.410> they

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
internalized because that's what they

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.460 
internalized because that's what they
fed<00:02:10.770> back<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.940> also<00:02:12.120> someone<00:02:13.050> did<00:02:13.200> say<00:02:13.349> there

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
fed back but also someone did say there

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.840 
fed back but also someone did say there
was<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.620> lot

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
was a lot

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.340 
was a lot
to<00:02:13.910> take<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.570> I<00:02:14.600> do<00:02:14.720> think<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.140> course

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
to take in so I do think the course

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.620 
to take in so I do think the course
content<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.580> don't<00:02:16.730> find<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.150> much<00:02:17.330> one

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
content is you don't find as much one

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.630 
content is you don't find as much one
person<00:02:17.660> said<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.350> had<00:02:18.530> I'm<00:02:18.710> surprised<00:02:19.370> at<00:02:19.490> how

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
person said I had I'm surprised at how

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.910 
person said I had I'm surprised at how
much<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.970> included<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:20.720> one<00:02:20.930> course<00:02:21.320> and

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
much is included in just one course and

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.560 
much is included in just one course and
realistically<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.760> think<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.120> value<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
realistically I think the value of the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.760 
realistically I think the value of the
course<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:23.900> three<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.230> four<00:02:24.410> thousand<00:02:24.740> dollars

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
course is three to four thousand dollars

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.000 
course is three to four thousand dollars
oh<00:02:25.190> really<00:02:25.670> yeah<00:02:26.360> probably<00:02:26.690> more<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.410> probably

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
oh really yeah probably more it probably

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.550 
oh really yeah probably more it probably
has<00:02:28.040> I've<00:02:28.670> been<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.030> many<00:02:29.060> courses<00:02:29.560> myself

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
has I've been to many courses myself

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.350 
has I've been to many courses myself
where<00:02:30.830> it's<00:02:31.190> only<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> tiny<00:02:31.640> portion<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.210> what<00:02:32.330> I

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
where it's only a tiny portion of what I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.760 
where it's only a tiny portion of what I
taught<00:02:32.750> nodes<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.320> know<00:02:33.440> where<00:02:33.620> they

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
taught nodes you know where they

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.290 
taught nodes you know where they
promised<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.310> world<00:02:34.460> and<00:02:34.760> yet<00:02:34.850> they<00:02:35.060> failed

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
promised the world and yet they failed

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.910 
promised the world and yet they failed
to<00:02:35.390> deliver<00:02:35.570> but<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.930> think<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.650> even

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.160 
to deliver but I think you you even
under<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.820> under<00:02:38.150> promised<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.750> you're<00:02:38.840> over

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
under you under promised and you're over

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.990 
under you under promised and you're over
delivering<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.680> people<00:02:39.980> are<00:02:40.070> going<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.250> be<00:02:40.340> so

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
delivering and people are going to be so

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.880 
delivering and people are going to be so
