00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hi my name is Nate storey and I'm a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.999 
hi my name is Nate storey and I'm a
greenhouse<00:00:02.310> grower<00:00:02.730> in<00:00:02.879> Laramie<00:00:03.240> Wyoming<00:00:03.270> and

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
greenhouse grower in Laramie Wyoming and

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.900 
greenhouse grower in Laramie Wyoming and
it's<00:00:05.009> food<00:00:05.250> day<00:00:05.430> today

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
it's food day today

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.350 
it's food day today
so<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.210> thought<00:00:06.569> I'd<00:00:07.250> talk<00:00:08.250> real<00:00:08.910> quick<00:00:09.179> about

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
so I thought I'd talk real quick about

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:25.570 
so I thought I'd talk real quick about
food<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> future<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.740> food

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.830 

as<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:27.269> doing<00:00:27.539> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
as you can see we're doing some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.380 
as you can see we're doing some
hydroponic<00:00:28.710> production<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.640> probably

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
hydroponic production which is probably

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.840 
hydroponic production which is probably
a<00:00:30.480> part<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.320> future<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.740> food

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
a part of the future of food

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.950 
a part of the future of food
the<00:00:33.239> thing<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.750> wanted<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.110> touch<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.440> today<00:00:34.649> is

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
the thing I wanted to touch on today is

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
the thing I wanted to touch on today is
when<00:00:36.960> people<00:00:37.079> start<00:00:37.350> talking<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.890> food

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
when people start talking about food

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
when people start talking about food
they<00:00:38.399> tend<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> talk<00:00:38.910> about<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.480> really

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
they tend to talk about these really

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260 
they tend to talk about these really
dark<00:00:40.230> Malthusian<00:00:41.129> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.579> futures<00:00:41.969> where

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
dark Malthusian kind of futures where

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
dark Malthusian kind of futures where
where<00:00:43.230> there's<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.860> enough<00:00:44.190> food<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> go

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
where there's not enough food to go

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.069 
where there's not enough food to go
around<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.120> there's<00:00:45.270> too<00:00:45.420> many<00:00:45.539> people<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
around and there's too many people to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.299 
around and there's too many people to
feed<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.640> I<00:00:47.690> my<00:00:48.690> message<00:00:49.050> today<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
feed and I my message today was just one

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.150 
feed and I my message today was just one
of<00:00:50.750> excitement<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.870> hope<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.530> excited

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
of excitement and hope I'm very excited

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.100 
of excitement and hope I'm very excited
about<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> future<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.879> food<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
about the future of food I think it's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.459 
about the future of food I think it's
going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.539> really<00:00:57.539> awesome<00:00:57.570> adventure

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
going to be a really awesome adventure

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.340 
going to be a really awesome adventure
that<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.609> excited<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.180> embark<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.629> but

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that I'm really excited to embark on but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.410 
that I'm really excited to embark on but
probably<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.670> if<00:01:02.940> we're<00:01:03.090> talking<00:01:03.210> about

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
probably you know if we're talking about

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
probably you know if we're talking about
what<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> future<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.199> food<00:01:04.350> looks<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.860> it's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
what the future of food looks like it's

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.399 
what the future of food looks like it's
gonna<00:01:05.189> look<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.460> traditional<00:01:05.820> AG<00:01:06.420> melded

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
gonna look like traditional AG melded

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
gonna look like traditional AG melded
with<00:01:08.060> agriculture<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> future<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
with agriculture of the future that is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.179 
with agriculture of the future that is
protected<00:01:10.590> agriculture<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.750> as<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.979> move

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
protected agriculture so as as we move

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
protected agriculture so as as we move
forward<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.850> production<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
forward with production as we have to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
forward with production as we have to
produce<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.369> less<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:18.000> there's<00:01:18.210> more

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
produce more on less as there's more

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.999 
produce more on less as there's more
people<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.960> there's<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.259> larger<00:01:19.619> middle<00:01:19.740> class

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
people as there's a larger middle class

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
people as there's a larger middle class
in<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> world<00:01:20.369> generally<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.360> things<00:01:21.570> look

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
in the world generally as things look

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.740 
in the world generally as things look
more<00:01:21.990> hopeful<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.710> look<00:01:23.070> better<00:01:23.600> we're<00:01:24.600> going

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
more hopeful and look better we're going

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.870 
more hopeful and look better we're going
to<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> produce<00:01:25.290> even<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> lot

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to have to produce even more with a lot

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.300 
to have to produce even more with a lot
less<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.900> we're<00:01:28.770> gonna<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.009> moving<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
less so we're gonna be moving to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.550 
less so we're gonna be moving to
marginal<00:01:30.000> areas<00:01:30.390> areas<00:01:30.810> where<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> soil<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
marginal areas areas where the soil is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
marginal areas areas where the soil is
depleted<00:01:31.710> areas<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.540> not

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
depleted areas that are just have not

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
depleted areas that are just have not
been<00:01:33.869> traditionally<00:01:34.770> ideal<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.759> agriculture

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
been traditionally ideal for agriculture

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.120 
been traditionally ideal for agriculture
so<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.110> move<00:01:37.259> forward<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.770> gonna<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:38.009> do

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
so as we move forward we're gonna be do

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.039 
so as we move forward we're gonna be do
more<00:01:38.280> protected<00:01:38.820> agriculture<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.600> lot<00:01:39.869> like

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
more protected agriculture a lot like

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.210 
more protected agriculture a lot like
we're<00:01:40.560> doing<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.890> here

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we're doing in here

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
we're doing in here
inside<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> greenhouse<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.299> we're<00:01:43.200> gonna<00:01:43.290> have

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
inside a greenhouse and we're gonna have

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
inside a greenhouse and we're gonna have
to<00:01:43.560> exert<00:01:43.740> more<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.310> more<00:01:44.490> control<00:01:44.939> over<00:01:45.210> our

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to exert more and more control over our

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.530 
to exert more and more control over our
food<00:01:45.899> sources<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.460> anytime<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.670> anyone<00:01:48.240> says

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
food sources so anytime that anyone says

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.230 
food sources so anytime that anyone says
that<00:01:48.899> oh<00:01:49.079> well<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.770> can't<00:01:50.009> grow<00:01:50.640> enough<00:01:51.000> we

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that oh well we can't grow enough we

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
that oh well we can't grow enough we
won't<00:01:51.420> make<00:01:51.659> enough<00:01:51.960> food<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> feed<00:01:52.619> everyone

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
won't make enough food to feed everyone

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.460 
won't make enough food to feed everyone
in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> future<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:54.149> balderdash<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:55.290> can

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
in the future that's balderdash we can

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.609 
in the future that's balderdash we can
we<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.490> better<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.500> we're<00:01:58.500> doing

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
we can do a lot better and we're doing

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580 
we can do a lot better and we're doing
it<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.610> growing<00:01:59.939> 2<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.869> 3<00:02:01.049> times<00:02:01.229> as

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it here we're growing 2 to 3 times as

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
it here we're growing 2 to 3 times as
much<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.829> most<00:02:02.159> folks<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.880> grow<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
much as most folks can grow in a
