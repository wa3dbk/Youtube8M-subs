00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.140
 nintendo brings the brand new view 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 Finally in Germany on the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.670
 market we could get the black one 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.870
 have ever looked closer console 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.150
 Of course a little rehearsal played 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.920
 and tell them now how much fun 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.840
 it really makes the new wii 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 numbers 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.789
 first a little something to the hardware of the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.769
 view the real real hard texmex 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.359
 are not really known because they have the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.619
 tender does not mean anything you say 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.260
 through the internet are haunting in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.840
 However, official info is sure that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 it's an 8 gigabyte version and a 32 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.230
 gigabyte version gives 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.750
 both are smaller to load 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.040
 Price difference between the optical 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.559
 drive will continue to be only nintendo 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.140
 own volumes support the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.690
 look like cds but are not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.800
 So that means dvds and blu-rays like you 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.870
 she knows about films, for example 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 can not be played 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.550
 unless nintendo decides 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.199
 on their own brutes 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.660
 Sometime to press and film 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.910
 publish 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.379
 cool is that the wii u finally by hdmi 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.769
 to be connected to the television 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.369
 can 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.189
 that allows hd resolutions 720p 1080p 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.080
 depending on what you support tv 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.240
 With that, the times are the same as the old ones 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.189
 and the sd resolutions finally passÃ© 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.960
 You can already see a close-up 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.759
 picture pixels are barely visible anymore 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.549
 our test device view corresponds to the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.200
 so-called premium package that nintendo 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.180
 sold with the 32 gb big console 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 In addition there is this for the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.130
 console so that it can stand upright 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.920
 It does not have to lie that view 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 Gamepad Velvet Charging Station 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.140
 sensor bar for the old wii 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.880
 the controller is designed by the way 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.770
 can be used as well as 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.600
 all sorts of cables and accessories 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.119
 what you need for a direct start 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.340
 as a game is in the beginning andrew thinks 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.280
 land a small collection of minigames 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.600
 little sympathy play with otherwise 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.130
 then you have to play all the other games 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.289
 to buy 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.469
 the real heart of the view is 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.450
 but this tablet controller here 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.209
 he has the normal ones 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.269
 tax buttons analog sticks on 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.269
 stick a VGA camera to the 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.120
 take pictures or videos and 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:27.000
 a single touch display with one 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.630
 resolution of 854 x 480 pixels and 6.2 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.400
 inch display diagonal multitouch gestures 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.890
 are not possible with that one means one 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.330
 can serve your own with one finger 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.650
 and perform actions for it one can 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.910
 but also refrain on the finger 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.989
 if you want for example no 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.900
 wants and can have fingerprints 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.000
 Use this enclosed donor for 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.680
 what is not obvious is the gamepad 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.120
 also has different acceleration 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.830
 and motion sensors in it 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.870
 that is quite similar to the normal ones 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.209
 wii controllern can thus also per 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.920
 we are controlled by moving games 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.660
 We were already a few days with view 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.360
 employ had fun there 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.980
 The graphics are finally up to par 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.959
 arrived on which the playstation 3 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.760
 and the xbox 360 also lie 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.260
 but it is not much more 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.579
 that means microsoft and sony 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.190
 at some point your new consoles 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.299
 The ju will bring back forcibly 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.730
 well below that are what the 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.140
 technical possibilities this concerns 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.410
 But we liked that house 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.810
 Tax Concept We Gamepad Here This 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.250
 true all-rounder one grabs 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.200
 acceleration sensor or different 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.959
 acceleration sensors touch display 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.220
 control units camera and so on in 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.709
 a device is really easy and 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.370
 is just really an ideal 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.889
 control for the view 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.900
 but of course that really matters 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.090
 Of course, every game console is the one 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.340
 games and here we want them now 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.170
 A small selection shows what the view 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:55.770
 on it has 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:55.770
 [Music] 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:26.540
 but what 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:26.540
 [Music] 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.650
 the station we need so it goes with it 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.770
 ammo and learn fast there 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.650
