00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.609
 in the tournament 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.050
 wissant or planters December I 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.140
 believe that it is also very very late 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.400
 evening we started with their fees 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.340
 we were in the studio we finished the day 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.170
 we were bored we stayed here we are 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.990
 still wanted to push so 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.340
 the thriller cave and we found 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.080
 their fees and then once I believe 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.970
 that some directly dial their 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.760
 milk of other compounds the next day 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:46.180
 and here it is gone culture to the strikes 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.890
 carried in the shit their head from the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.670
 furnace of course I do of the time 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.210
 some generous documents about it's 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.269
 of insurgent ads but after that are the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.540
 taxpayers know how to differentiate between 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.430
 the batteries 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:07.190
 and kids years I often have 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:15.380
 young mix but for me all that 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:22.280
 it's too easy to find that done 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.600
 part of your second degree go out must 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.040
 that every time I ride report that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.060
 I applied myself and it's a sentence for 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.410
 to say that it's been a long time 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:35.070
 still there but now 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.930
 nothing still 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.610

 paradise or hell 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.359
 and that's it's still a 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.969
 metaphor because here we are there and 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.200

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.609
