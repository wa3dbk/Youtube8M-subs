00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:07.930
 we are live with eric bauthÃ©ac 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.580
 hi eric hi eric so what is it 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.620
 what do you think about them 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.750
 statements by frÃ©dÃ©ric antonetti that 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.349
 joined on the phone today who did 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:22.529
 not you are accused of being 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.529
 cheats his reputation 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.050
 who is this coach every time 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.339
 every time he loses or what is it 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.100
 never know of their faith it's always 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.630
 the fault of the bond arbitrator 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.140
 now we go home have seen the 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.970
 images i ask diego about the action 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.740
 at the moment I take where I take a 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.780
 impulse to jump to the head 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:53.920
 completely 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:55.000
 and that may be impressed in 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.260
 seeing the images we do not have 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.700
 the impression that you are going to touch him the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.320
 balloon but we certainly see too 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 djebbour who makes you a little 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.740
 stroller in your back you see what you 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.539
 do not tell you but it's a center me 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.090
 I get to myself you come between 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.100
 two advocates after I do not think that 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.409
 I have the balloon I do not honestly think 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.210
 I think the ball is too much but I 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.139
 think that diebolt plays badly because 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.139
 that if they do not touch 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.370
 it's hard these hard is terrible it's 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.620
 hard to hear like that from 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.480
 cheat sorting activities to be 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.190
 cheats but right now it's when 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.810
 we play we are not supposed to be 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.450
 cheats we're supposed to be in a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.860
 competition to play trying to do 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.380
 for the better after there are situations 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.910
 in which bernard was shown 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.210
 finger here you're being fingered in 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.160
 and antoine twilight twilight you are 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.940
 stigmatized by coach 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.460
 reindeer I have not played the first mi 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.290
 from time to time we must also see the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.970
 tampons that dario of the times and price in 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.370
 first half time jeremy foot is more 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.800
 buffers too so without really 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.820
 come for there to get us in and 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.820
 to play the draw 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.100
 it was tense on the ground you felt 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.080
 that you felt they were there to 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.090
 so as not to lose 00 00 00 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.650
 it's downright downright I think 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.050
 with the potential prison team 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 offensive and the quality of play that 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.989
 could be in this team I 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.640
 think they did not come to us 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.900
 to play their game and I find that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.290
 pity because it is a very beautiful 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.959
 team 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.380
 yes except these Greek who meant a 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.760
 Greek word 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.400
 at the same time you have to be honest when 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.750
 anyone who moves to nice he 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.800
 like it's the team in shape he's going it the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.120
 Knowing with the knife between the teeth 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.860
 because you know that nice is not no 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.810
 more noted backhand than paris this will be yes 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.760
 but here it is, but serious already 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.440
 naturally me my age like but 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.050
 still now you know you're going to 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.010
 nice being in front but of a put 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.140
 the heating blue what do you know he 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.340
 must be a fighter whose good because 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.200
 that you're used to 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.650
 to have this opposition style we will say 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.050
 only at home 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.810
 here we are difficult to move 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.510
 really a Mediterranean public we are going 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.959
 say very hot so the teams 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.790
 we can come to my house I think 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.700
 it's this amalgam that makes 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.590
 tell mister antonetti what it is 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.060
 it annoys them to take a penalty on 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.010
 such a mild mistake we will say 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.540
 maybe it was just that you 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.340
 say all the blows that could have 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.099
 after now well fault is fault there 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.780
 sees the seduction annihilation of a 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.780
 goal action now here I think 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.689
 on the other hand I agree with him 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.750
 but the red I think it's a little 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.129
 severe because it was worth the new 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.299
 first red both yellow cards 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.700
 I did not see because I will try 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.310
 warm me up so I did not do 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.720
 attention but it's hard for a team 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.299
 but from there to put the second carton 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.530
 red I think that's for sure 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.180
 also there is something that needs to be 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.440
 certainly consider this moment you 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.239
 are a team that bothers and also 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.700
 because you're playing 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.409
 because of its stakes in the process of 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.389
 winning matches by that is there 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:17.579
 you're up it's getting closer 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.579
 from the top than from the bottom no it is saint louis 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.320
 between all new players from 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.139
 players who arrived a little on the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.289
 late too so that's almost three months 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.900
 of the adaptation will say I found myself 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.000
 really our game we produce beautiful 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.280
 game every game and is maybe 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.280
 disturb our merry way 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.729
 thereafter
