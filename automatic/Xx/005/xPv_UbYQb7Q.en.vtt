00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
nutraceutical things like that we are

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869

required to make disease claims we do

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.910 
required to make disease claims we do
clinical<00:00:42.360> trials<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.320> way<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.680> much

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
clinical trials so in that way we much

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
clinical trials so in that way we much
more<00:00:44.160> mimic<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.760> traditional<00:00:45.510> pharmaceutical

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
more mimic a traditional pharmaceutical

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
more mimic a traditional pharmaceutical
but<00:00:46.680> unlike<00:00:46.920> pharmaceuticals<00:00:47.730> which<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but unlike pharmaceuticals which have to

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.450 
but unlike pharmaceuticals which have to
go<00:00:48.510> through<00:00:48.719> these<00:00:48.870> several<00:00:49.559> phase<00:00:49.890> trials<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
go through these several phase trials to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.970 
go through these several phase trials to
show<00:00:50.670> safety<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.239> efficacy<00:00:51.649> because<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
show safety and efficacy because all of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.069 
show safety and efficacy because all of
our<00:00:53.219> ingredients<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.910> generally<00:00:54.660> recognized

our ingredients are generally recognized
as<00:00:55.199> safe<00:00:55.260> there's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> much<00:00:56.460> shorter<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
as safe there's a much shorter time to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.430 
as safe there's a much shorter time to
market<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.989> already<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
market because we already have the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.680 
market because we already have the
safety<00:00:58.680> data<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.129> place<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
safety data in place so we just have to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.840 
safety data in place so we just have to
demonstrate<00:01:00.899> efficacy<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> data

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
demonstrate efficacy and have the data

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
demonstrate efficacy and have the data
to<00:01:03.210> back<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.140> disease<00:01:04.470> claims<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.949> we're

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to back up the disease claims that we're
