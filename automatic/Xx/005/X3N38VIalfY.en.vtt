00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.460
 who looks back 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.699
 is lost 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.839
 another winner he looks forward 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.259
 he could not 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.159
 silver 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.810
 even because we have no solution where 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.130
 on the back of the neck we have no eyes at the back of the neck 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.009
 our eyes are 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.949
 of the three 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.739
 for us we always follow 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.809
 if the people sit ever forward they would go there in cane eleven days of 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:29.599
 walking 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.210
 but because they mean look back 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.400
 they spent 40 years walking in circles 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.550
 walking in circles and most of them died 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.310
 most of these died because they doubt a powder they wanted to look back 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.449
 dream all 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.820
 josue collor than the new generation 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.890
 it means who looked 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.100
 Forward, who's going to look ahead? 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.070
 duff is smart 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040
 these last 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.660
 and look forward 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.600
 Jesus said I saw 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.810
 for them to have 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.880
 life and attention my ass then the land promised to us today is life 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.650
 It's the life that Jesus promised me He promised to pass to all of us. 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.040
 which is obvious 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.670
 fasting is a partial or total withdrawal of food 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 purpose to afflict the physical body in order to achieve more strength for the club 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.010
 spiritual 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.750
 during fasting the spirit becomes stronger after the desires of the flesh are 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 annulled by the power of the spirit 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.160
 so we consider prayer fasting serves the purple than that made with the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.080
 sides 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.729
 because in it to the inexpressible javelin of the human soul itself 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.520
 in pursuit of individual or political benefits 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 how should you start your fast 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.250
 choose a place reserved and on Friday night 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.710
 wc knees before bed 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.190
 and I repeat the following occasion 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.440
 my God, I approve of this fast in favor of resolving my impossible case 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.979
 and then you must say goodbye as is your impossible case on Saturday 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.189
 morning when you arrive at the church 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.189
 and to present to God his fast saying 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:23.629
 Autonomous Pluto 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.069
 I present my fast to resolve this impossible cause. 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.259
 Until now you have done your part 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.259
 now the rest is pointer 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.799
 jesus pants impossible for your cause to be solved 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.069
 major disturbances 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.259
 the cause that sought too hard would make tyranny heard 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.269
 one of the pants is impossible
