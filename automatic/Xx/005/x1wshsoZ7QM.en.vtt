really<00:03:53.170> showed<00:03:53.530> just<00:03:54.459> how<00:03:54.579> expansive<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
really showed just how expansive the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.740 
really showed just how expansive the
mastodon<00:03:56.950> universe<00:03:57.370> really<00:03:57.700> could<00:03:57.819> be<00:03:57.970> with

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
mastodon universe really could be with

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.690 
mastodon universe really could be with
the<00:03:58.870> hunter<00:03:59.230> we<00:03:59.889> got<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.160> witness<00:04:00.310> another

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
the hunter we got to witness another

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.699 
the hunter we got to witness another
branch<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.480> universe<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.170> we<00:04:02.319> got<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.560> see

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
branch of the universe and we got to see

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.160 
branch of the universe and we got to see
them<00:04:02.889> explore<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.760> add<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.389> on<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:05.049> the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
them explore that and add it on to the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.030 
them explore that and add it on to the
palette<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.620> they<00:04:05.739> had<00:04:05.859> already<00:04:06.069> grown

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
palette that they had already grown

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.440 
palette that they had already grown
however<00:04:09.040> with<00:04:09.189> crack<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.549> sky<00:04:09.790> we<00:04:09.970> got<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.269> see

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
however with crack the sky we got to see

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.390 
however with crack the sky we got to see
a<00:04:10.599> full<00:04:11.019> combined<00:04:11.530> effort

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
a full combined effort

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.600 
a full combined effort
we<00:04:12.670> did<00:04:12.849> see<00:04:13.120> things<00:04:13.900> lead<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.590> lean<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.340> little

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
we did see things lead and lean a little

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.340 
we did see things lead and lean a little
bit<00:04:15.730> more<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.180> prog<00:04:16.389> site<00:04:16.720> on<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:17.019> album

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
bit more to the prog site on this album

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.430 
bit more to the prog site on this album
but<00:04:18.070> overall<00:04:18.400> not<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.299> bad<00:04:19.600> thing<00:04:19.810> at<00:04:19.959> all<00:04:20.139> in

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
but overall not a bad thing at all in

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.469 
but overall not a bad thing at all in
fact<00:04:20.919> if<00:04:21.130> anything<00:04:21.370> something<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.360> should

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
fact if anything something that should

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.439 
fact if anything something that should
be<00:04:22.510> willingly<00:04:22.900> embraced<00:04:24.060> these<00:04:25.060> guys<00:04:25.300> were

through Blood Mountain there's no
difference<00:04:35.440> with<00:04:35.620> crack<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.949> sky<00:04:36.190> however

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
difference with crack the sky however

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.760 
difference with crack the sky however
the<00:04:37.720> way<00:04:37.840> in<00:04:37.930> which<00:04:38.050> they<00:04:38.229> did<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.500> the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the way in which they did it the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.070 
the way in which they did it the
framework<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.550> philosophy<00:04:40.210> changed<00:04:40.990> a

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
framework the philosophy changed a

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.460 
framework the philosophy changed a
little<00:04:41.320> bit<00:04:41.639> so<00:04:42.639> it's<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.510> no<00:04:43.660> surprise<00:04:43.900> that

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
little bit so it's of no surprise that

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.140 
little bit so it's of no surprise that
this<00:04:44.590> worked<00:04:44.860> it's<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.550> no<00:04:45.700> surprise<00:04:46.120> that

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
this worked it's of no surprise that

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.060 
this worked it's of no surprise that
this<00:04:46.600> was<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.780> successful<00:04:47.200> experiment<00:04:47.950> by<00:04:48.040> the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
this was a successful experiment by the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.400 
this was a successful experiment by the
band<00:04:48.660> because<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:49.720> was<00:04:49.930> something<00:04:50.139> they<00:04:50.350> were

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
band because it was something they were

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.960 
band because it was something they were
already<00:04:50.740> doing<00:04:50.979> only<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.700> slightly

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
already doing only in a slightly

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.690 
already doing only in a slightly
different<00:04:52.060> way<00:04:52.440> but<00:04:53.440> they<00:04:53.560> easily<00:04:53.830> could<00:04:54.639> have

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
different way but they easily could have

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.820 
different way but they easily could have
divided<00:04:55.120> their<00:04:55.419> previous<00:04:55.810> two<00:04:55.960> albums<00:04:56.110> into

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
divided their previous two albums into

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.490 
divided their previous two albums into
perhaps<00:04:57.490> five<00:04:57.940> or<00:04:58.120> six<00:04:58.360> long<00:04:58.690> lengthy<00:04:59.260> songs

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
perhaps five or six long lengthy songs

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.550 
perhaps five or six long lengthy songs
with<00:05:00.190> multiple<00:05:00.639> parts<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.270> perhaps<00:05:02.229> would

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
with multiple parts and perhaps would

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.110 
with multiple parts and perhaps would
have<00:05:02.590> gotten<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:03.040> exact<00:05:03.370> same<00:05:03.550> acclaim<00:05:03.910> and

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
have gotten the exact same acclaim and

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.110 
have gotten the exact same acclaim and
the<00:05:04.360> exact<00:05:04.720> same<00:05:04.900> outcome<00:05:05.820> however<00:05:06.820> they

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
the exact same outcome however they

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.029 
the exact same outcome however they
didn't<00:05:07.479> they<00:05:07.900> did<00:05:08.110> with<00:05:08.260> crack<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.650> sky<00:05:08.860> and

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
didn't they did with crack the sky and

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.409 
didn't they did with crack the sky and
which<00:05:09.130> cracked<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.490> sky<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.789> worked<00:05:10.210> it

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
which cracked the sky it worked it

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.020 
which cracked the sky it worked it
functioned<00:05:10.930> perfectly<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:12.039> the<00:05:12.729> seven

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
functioned perfectly and the seven

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.719 
functioned perfectly and the seven
tracks<00:05:13.330> are<00:05:13.690> able<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.110> keep<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:14.380> engaged<00:05:14.729> this

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
tracks are able to keep you engaged this

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:16.800 
tracks are able to keep you engaged this
is<00:05:15.850> not<00:05:16.000> something<00:05:16.360> where<00:05:16.510> you're<00:05:16.630> finding

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
is not something where you're finding

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.650 
is not something where you're finding
yourself<00:05:17.200> skipping<00:05:17.560> over<00:05:17.680> things<00:05:18.660> perhaps

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
yourself skipping over things perhaps

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.510 
yourself skipping over things perhaps
someone<00:05:20.139> may<00:05:20.260> say<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.710> tracks<00:05:20.950> five<00:05:21.160> and<00:05:21.370> six

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
someone may say that tracks five and six

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.909 
someone may say that tracks five and six
are<00:05:21.639> a<00:05:21.669> tad<00:05:21.910> weak<00:05:22.410> but<00:05:23.410> that's<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.650> matter<00:05:23.800> of

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
are a tad weak but that's a matter of

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.980 
are a tad weak but that's a matter of
opinion<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.520> think<00:05:24.580> that<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:25.030> album<00:05:25.360> flows<00:05:25.660> as

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
opinion I think that the album flows as

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.580 
opinion I think that the album flows as
a<00:05:26.020> whole<00:05:26.320> in<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:27.610> very<00:05:27.820> very<00:05:28.060> nice<00:05:28.590> Universal

and United fashion there is a lot of

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.490 
and United fashion there is a lot of
balance<00:05:33.520> on<00:05:33.849> this<00:05:33.970> album<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:34.599> very<00:05:34.870> unique

and this is also also my favorite
Mastodon<00:05:41.020> album<00:05:41.349> that<00:05:41.590> was<00:05:41.740> really<00:05:42.190> funny

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
Mastodon album that was really funny

Mastodon album that was really funny
this<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:44.139> clearly<00:05:44.560> my<00:05:44.830> favorite<00:05:45.220> Mastodon

were<00:06:41.890> able<00:06:42.130> to<00:06:42.160> boast

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
were able to boast

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.580 
were able to boast
I<00:06:42.790> believe<00:06:43.420> I've<00:06:43.600> listened<00:06:43.960> to<00:06:43.990> crack<00:06:44.200> the<00:06:44.380> sky

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
I believe I've listened to crack the sky

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.340 
I believe I've listened to crack the sky
the<00:06:44.650> most<00:06:45.070> I<00:06:45.430> believe<00:06:46.390> the<00:06:46.510> crack<00:06:46.720> the<00:06:46.900> sky<00:06:47.110> has

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
the most I believe the crack the sky has

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.720 
the most I believe the crack the sky has
blood<00:06:47.650> mountain<00:06:47.950> beat<00:06:48.160> by<00:06:48.340> a<00:06:48.370> narrow<00:06:48.610> margin

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
blood mountain beat by a narrow margin

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.430 
blood mountain beat by a narrow margin
but<00:06:49.270> then<00:06:49.390> you<00:06:49.510> have<00:06:49.630> to<00:06:49.810> factor<00:06:50.020> in<00:06:50.320> the<00:06:50.350> fact

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
but then you have to factor in the fact

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.770 
but then you have to factor in the fact
that<00:06:50.980> there<00:06:51.520> are<00:06:51.610> many<00:06:51.850> fewer<00:06:52.120> tracks<00:06:52.480> on

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
that there are many fewer tracks on

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.880 
that there are many fewer tracks on
crack<00:06:53.470> the<00:06:53.620> sky<00:06:54.330> so<00:06:55.330> it's<00:06:55.510> being<00:06:55.690> spun<00:06:56.050> more

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
crack the sky so it's being spun more

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.210 
crack the sky so it's being spun more
often<00:06:57.250> I<00:06:58.380> want<00:06:59.380> to<00:06:59.440> know<00:06:59.500> what<00:06:59.650> you<00:06:59.770> guys<00:06:59.920> feel

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.220 
often I want to know what you guys feel

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.030 
often I want to know what you guys feel
about<00:07:00.280> crack<00:07:00.730> the<00:07:00.850> sky<00:07:01.380> was<00:07:02.380> this<00:07:02.500> as<00:07:02.680> large<00:07:02.920> of

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:03.040 
about crack the sky was this as large of

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.660 
about crack the sky was this as large of
an<00:07:03.100> experiment<00:07:03.610> as<00:07:03.820> maybe<00:07:04.030> I<00:07:04.150> feel<00:07:04.600> it<00:07:04.720> is<00:07:05.670> was

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 
an experiment as maybe I feel it is was

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.940 
an experiment as maybe I feel it is was
this<00:07:06.850> as<00:07:07.060> big<00:07:07.390> of<00:07:07.420> a<00:07:07.600> bowl<00:07:07.810> double<00:07:08.200> of<00:07:08.500> a<00:07:08.710> leap

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
this as big of a bowl double of a leap

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.790 
this as big of a bowl double of a leap
of<00:07:09.130> a<00:07:09.250> risk<00:07:09.520> that<00:07:09.760> I<00:07:09.820> think<00:07:10.180> that<00:07:10.300> it<00:07:10.420> is<00:07:10.710> do<00:07:11.710> you
