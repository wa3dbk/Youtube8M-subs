 in the clinic and they peeled them with 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.479

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.659

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.799
 three football matches together the 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.270

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.490
 sides but I love master so I took advantage 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.060
 to send greetings to a chiche a tere and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.730
 still 20 years ago 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.850
 the production is wrong and it almost kills me 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.070
 Monica works with us a long time ago 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.780

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.550
 your memories I'm going to have to put a 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.619
 money because it will deliver all my 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:18.270
 secrets then that's why I take advantage for 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:21.570
 save the pancreas intestine that makes 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.220
 bad that it does you good whatever it is 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.220
 we cook together and it really is a 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.560
 person who loves us very much you have to 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.510
 have a person like us to girl 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.610
 help because he really is also with 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.080
 her job teaching dresses and doing 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.980
 a lot of anamorós stuff and so 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.200
 cute and me too for bal Harbor and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.240
 a girl who comes walking with some 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.990
 shorcitos so small I say but not 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.150
 my god how beautiful how beautiful and to go to 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.810
 Deborah beautiful you know that I just 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.810
 think said 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.770
 but I felt like I told him nobody laughed 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.540
 they saw no, but this one was divine 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.250
 the mind impressed me very much that day 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.370
 because it says that once again a madrasa 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.290
 is proving to be like a lioness with 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.260
 the baby as she takes care of her as she is 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.840
 present all the time and well I knew 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.510
 I knew that you could tell that in your wood 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.240
 and that's why I chose it, that's why I think 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.440
 that we choose each other happens what 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.240
 same as that as a lover as a 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.310
 thing and also on a personal level you 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.400
 you met my old my old cipol and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.920
 this guard and when I lost my son 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.300
 in 2010 it was like how you feel 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.040
 as much as you are a big egg that 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.050
 have a more resolute life than not 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.370
 determined that you're on track what are you doing 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.660
 what you like working so 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.210
 you have a life 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.990
 almada but I felt a bit like we are 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.750
 we 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.390
 of families that are a family death and 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.720
 a lot of being in touch for more than 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.940
 we are big boys but I felt 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.120
 like that detachment like that 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.890
 orphanage and how you feel with the return 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.240
 to television because that's what 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.700
 I wanted to do this was like you saw when 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.200
 when you were little if you were with the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.180
 bicycle chain that broke like this 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.550
 well the link was joined again 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.860
 girl not logically to re-enter 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.760
 in the cycle of life and that for me is 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.760
 very good 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.580
 I do not ask you anything about television that 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.410
 can you say anything, did not say anything to me 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.410
 but television is important because 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.410
 logically
