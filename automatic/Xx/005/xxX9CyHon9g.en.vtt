00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.150 

yeah<00:00:13.480> we're<00:00:13.660> evaluating<00:00:14.020> to<00:00:14.469> the<00:00:14.590> low<00:00:14.770> speed

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
yeah we're evaluating to the low speed

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.550 
yeah we're evaluating to the low speed
operation<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:16.360> the<00:00:16.510> four-wheel<00:00:17.289> drive<00:00:17.529> system

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
operation of the four-wheel drive system

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.429 
operation of the four-wheel drive system
the<00:00:18.160> brakes<00:00:18.429> and<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:19.390> throttle<00:00:19.750> ensuring

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
the brakes and the throttle ensuring

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.740 
the brakes and the throttle ensuring
that<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.830> driver<00:00:21.099> has<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.449> degree<00:00:22.720> of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
that the driver has the degree of

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.790 
that the driver has the degree of
controllability<00:00:23.470> needed<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.130> negotiate

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.990 

look<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> suspension<00:00:32.460> makes<00:00:32.670> the<00:00:32.820> base

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
look the suspension makes the base

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.480 
look the suspension makes the base
vehicle<00:00:33.480> very<00:00:34.350> stable<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> comfortable<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
vehicle very stable and comfortable to

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.690 
vehicle very stable and comfortable to
drive<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.810> means<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.460> driver

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
drive and it means that that the driver

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.300 
drive and it means that that the driver
can<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.020> look<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.230> my<00:00:40.500> hand<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:40.980> driving

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
can if you look at my hand I'm driving

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.500 
can if you look at my hand I'm driving
at<00:00:41.400> some<00:00:41.490> rough<00:00:41.640> roads<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.180> hands<00:00:42.360> are

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
at some rough roads but my hands are

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.390 
at some rough roads but my hands are
fairly<00:00:42.690> steady<00:00:43.020> means<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.950> don't<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.130> to<00:00:44.220> make

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
fairly steady means I don't have to make

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.370 
fairly steady means I don't have to make
a<00:00:44.430> lot<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> Corrections<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.360> wheel<00:00:45.540> the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
a lot of Corrections the wheel the

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.470 
a lot of Corrections the wheel the
vehicle<00:00:46.680> tracks<00:00:46.920> nice<00:00:47.130> and<00:00:47.370> straight<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:48.030> its

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
vehicle tracks nice and straight on its

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.940 
vehicle tracks nice and straight on its
own<00:00:48.630> so<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.930> base<00:00:49.110> chassis<00:00:49.470> gives<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> people

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
own so the base chassis gives the people

00:00:49.950 --> 00:01:18.490 
own so the base chassis gives the people
a<00:00:50.190> lot<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.750> stability<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.530> its<00:00:52.710> own<00:00:52.830> right

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:39.260 

you

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.749 

initially<00:01:40.270> we've<00:01:41.110> had<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.310> vulnerable

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
initially we've had the the vulnerable

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.700 
initially we've had the the vulnerable
components<00:01:43.689> are<00:01:43.810> protected<00:01:44.289> by<00:01:44.320> cross

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
components are protected by cross

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.249 
components are protected by cross
chassis<00:01:45.039> cross<00:01:45.310> members<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.420> things<00:01:46.899> like<00:01:47.049> the

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
chassis cross members so things like the

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.010 
chassis cross members so things like the
engine<00:01:47.710> oil<00:01:47.799> pan<00:01:48.130> are<00:01:48.640> tucked<00:01:49.450> up<00:01:49.600> out<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.840> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
engine oil pan are tucked up out of the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.649 
engine oil pan are tucked up out of the
way<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.439> as<00:01:50.860> if<00:01:51.009> there's<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.280> big<00:01:51.659> frame

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
way and as if there's a big frame

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.690 
way and as if there's a big frame
crossmember<00:01:53.289> underneath<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.549> really

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
crossmember underneath it to to really

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.029 
crossmember underneath it to to really
give<00:01:54.909> it<00:01:55.030> some<00:01:55.060> solid<00:01:55.630> protection<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.920> this

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
give it some solid protection but this

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.289 
give it some solid protection but this
was<00:01:57.310> that<00:01:57.939> this<00:01:58.060> shield<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:59.729> not<00:02:00.729> quite<00:02:00.970> able

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
was that this shield was not quite able

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.710 
was that this shield was not quite able
to<00:02:01.780> absorb<00:02:02.560> some<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.189> the<00:02:03.310> bumps<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:03.939> rocks

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
to absorb some of the bumps and rocks

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.059 
to absorb some of the bumps and rocks
that<00:02:04.929> might<00:02:05.110> hit<00:02:05.289> it<00:02:05.319> without<00:02:05.860> getting

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
that might hit it without getting

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.130 
that might hit it without getting
deflected<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.060> we<00:02:07.539> asked<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.869> design

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
deflected so we asked the design

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.870 
deflected so we asked the design
engineers<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.739> go<00:02:08.860> back<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.280> look<00:02:09.640> at<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
engineers to go back and look at the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.180 
engineers to go back and look at the
design<00:02:10.209> and<00:02:10.450> they<00:02:11.260> they<00:02:11.739> came<00:02:11.920> up<00:02:11.950> with<00:02:12.069> a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
design and they they came up with a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.309 
design and they they came up with a
really<00:02:12.880> clever<00:02:13.150> solution<00:02:13.720> without<00:02:13.840> actually

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
really clever solution without actually

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.699 
really clever solution without actually
making<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.680> putt<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.220> steel<00:02:15.459> thicker<00:02:15.790> or<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
making the putt the steel thicker or the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.220 
making the putt the steel thicker or the
for<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.220> part<00:02:18.459> heavier<00:02:18.880> they<00:02:19.840> were<00:02:19.900> able

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
for the the part heavier they were able

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.320 
for the the part heavier they were able
to<00:02:20.440> make<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:20.950> fast<00:02:21.280> dipper<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.849> they<00:02:21.970> double

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
to make it fast dipper so they double

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.120 
to make it fast dipper so they double
the<00:02:22.450> stiffness<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.739> front

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
the stiffness of this of this front

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.270 
the stiffness of this of this front
under<00:02:24.519> shield<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.750> now<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.230> now<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.250> I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
under shield and now it's now I can I

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.559 
under shield and now it's now I can I
could<00:02:27.610> safely<00:02:27.849> say<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.120> one<00:02:28.299> of<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
could safely say it's one of the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.870 
could safely say it's one of the
toughest<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:29.019> shields<00:02:29.799> we<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.069> in<00:02:30.220> in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
toughest on shields we have in in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:03:04.770 
toughest on shields we have in in
amongst<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.510> competitors<00:02:32.019> said

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.500 

yeah<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.050> throats<00:03:06.790> there's<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.910> pretty<00:03:08.300> wide

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
yeah the throats there's a pretty wide

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.160 
yeah the throats there's a pretty wide
variety<00:03:08.959> bro<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.780> they<00:03:11.780> give<00:03:11.959> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
variety bro to you and they give the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.370 
variety bro to you and they give the
suspension<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.680> good<00:03:12.830> working<00:03:13.190> out
