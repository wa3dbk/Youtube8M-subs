00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:18.919 
talk about how to ride a 5 metre loop so

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.830 
talk about how to ride a 5 metre loop so
let's<00:00:19.130> look<00:00:19.279> at<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:19.579> dressage<00:00:20.180> arena<00:00:20.660> to

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
let's look at the dressage arena to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.450 
let's look at the dressage arena to
start<00:00:21.140> with<00:00:21.320> here's<00:00:22.130> our<00:00:22.279> 20<00:00:22.699> by<00:00:22.849> 40<00:00:23.329> arena<00:00:24.460> so

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
start with here's our 20 by 40 arena so

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.970 
start with here's our 20 by 40 arena so
how<00:00:25.640> do<00:00:25.699> we<00:00:25.820> know<00:00:25.910> where<00:00:26.599> to<00:00:26.840> ride<00:00:27.079> to<00:00:27.379> for<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.739> 5

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
how do we know where to ride to for a 5

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.860 
how do we know where to ride to for a 5
metre<00:00:28.399> loop<00:00:29.500> well<00:00:30.500> 5<00:00:31.160> metres<00:00:31.700> means<00:00:32.300> it<00:00:32.629> comes

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
metre loop well 5 metres means it comes

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.360 
metre loop well 5 metres means it comes
in<00:00:33.170> off<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.350> side<00:00:33.800> by<00:00:34.700> 5<00:00:35.120> meters<00:00:35.920> so<00:00:36.920> let's<00:00:37.129> say

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
in off the side by 5 meters so let's say

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.799 
in off the side by 5 meters so let's say
we're<00:00:37.550> going<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.760> write<00:00:37.969> a<00:00:38.000> 5<00:00:38.300> metre<00:00:38.570> loop

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
we're going to write a 5 metre loop

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.940 
we're going to write a 5 metre loop
between<00:00:39.289> M<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:40.180> F<00:00:41.500> coming<00:00:42.500> off<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.770> right

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
between M and F coming off the right

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.910 
between M and F coming off the right
rein<00:00:43.540> how<00:00:44.540> do<00:00:44.600> I<00:00:44.750> know<00:00:44.810> where<00:00:45.079> 5<00:00:45.290> metres<00:00:45.739> is

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
rein how do I know where 5 metres is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.120 
rein how do I know where 5 metres is
that's<00:00:46.430> easy<00:00:47.470> there's<00:00:48.470> an<00:00:48.560> imaginary<00:00:48.800> line

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
that's easy there's an imaginary line

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.310 
that's easy there's an imaginary line
that<00:00:49.520> runs<00:00:49.700> here<00:00:50.000> parallel<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.870> side<00:00:51.110> and

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
that runs here parallel to the side and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.860 
that runs here parallel to the side and
the<00:00:51.470> sense<00:00:51.739> line<00:00:52.239> dividing<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.390> part<00:00:53.660> of<00:00:53.810> the

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
the sense line dividing that part of the

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.660 
the sense line dividing that part of the
arena<00:00:53.989> in<00:00:54.200> half<00:00:54.410> that's<00:00:54.770> called<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.280> quarter

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
arena in half that's called the quarter

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.030 
arena in half that's called the quarter
line<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.660> it<00:00:56.809> would<00:00:56.960> be<00:00:57.079> 5<00:00:57.380> meters<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.950> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
line and it would be 5 meters to the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.979 
line and it would be 5 meters to the
course<00:00:58.250> line<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.790> then<00:00:59.059> another<00:00:59.270> 5<00:00:59.540> meters

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
course line and then another 5 meters

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.350 
course line and then another 5 meters
and<00:01:00.020> center<00:01:00.530> line<00:01:00.649> because<00:01:01.130> we<00:01:01.280> know<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.760> if

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
and center line because we know that if

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.079 
and center line because we know that if
the<00:01:02.570> arena<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:03.020> 20<00:01:03.380> meters<00:01:03.680> wide<00:01:03.920> half<00:01:04.640> way<00:01:04.909> is

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
the arena is 20 meters wide half way is

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.990 
the arena is 20 meters wide half way is
10<00:01:05.299> meters<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.950> we've<00:01:07.250> got<00:01:07.399> an<00:01:07.490> imaginary<00:01:07.909> line

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
10 meters so we've got an imaginary line

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.969 
10 meters so we've got an imaginary line
running<00:01:08.390> down<00:01:08.570> here<00:01:08.869> now<00:01:09.079> that's<00:01:09.290> 5<00:01:09.530> meters

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
running down here now that's 5 meters

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.539 
running down here now that's 5 meters
there<00:01:10.189> quarter<00:01:10.610> line<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.780> as<00:01:11.930> we<00:01:12.079> come<00:01:12.290> round

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
there quarter line so as we come round

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.699 
there quarter line so as we come round
my<00:01:13.549> top<00:01:13.820> tip<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:14.390> get<00:01:15.139> in<00:01:15.319> and<00:01:15.979> get<00:01:16.280> out<00:01:16.509> so

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
my top tip is get in and get out so

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.859 
my top tip is get in and get out so
don't<00:01:18.709> leave<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.130> too<00:01:19.280> late<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.670> get<00:01:19.819> back<00:01:19.880> so

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
don't leave it too late to get back so

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.419 
don't leave it too late to get back so
as<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.109> get<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:21.560> corner<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
as you get to the corner and to the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:23.859 
as you get to the corner and to the
marker<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.090> need<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.329> be<00:01:23.420> coming<00:01:23.749> off<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
marker you need to be coming off the

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.169 
marker you need to be coming off the
track<00:01:24.259> pretty<00:01:25.039> much<00:01:25.249> straight<00:01:25.639> away<00:01:25.670> at<00:01:26.029> that

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
track pretty much straight away at that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.169 
track pretty much straight away at that
letter<00:01:26.420> M<00:01:26.689> you<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:27.740> curve<00:01:28.069> out<00:01:28.369> but<00:01:29.060> as

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
letter M you then curve out but as

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.809 
letter M you then curve out but as
you're<00:01:29.359> parallel<00:01:29.899> to<00:01:30.139> letter<00:01:30.350> B<00:01:30.649> you<00:01:31.609> then

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
you're parallel to letter B you then

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.349 
you're parallel to letter B you then
need<00:01:31.999> to<00:01:32.029> be<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.389> your<00:01:32.569> way<00:01:32.779> back<00:01:33.079> to<00:01:33.859> letter<00:01:34.069> F

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
need to be on your way back to letter F

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.789 
need to be on your way back to letter F
arriving<00:01:35.359> at<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.569> track<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:35.840> before<00:01:36.529> that

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
arriving at the track just before that

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.919 
arriving at the track just before that
letter<00:01:37.119> because<00:01:38.119> obviously<00:01:38.299> you've<00:01:38.630> got<00:01:38.659> the

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
letter because obviously you've got the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.830 
letter because obviously you've got the
next<00:01:39.289> corner<00:01:39.740> coming<00:01:39.950> up<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.729> as<00:01:41.630> you're

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
next corner coming up and as you're

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.019 
next corner coming up and as you're
doing<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.170> loop<00:01:42.380> you're<00:01:43.279> keeping<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.819> nice

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
doing the loop you're keeping a nice

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:47.440 
doing the loop you're keeping a nice
even<00:01:44.599> flow<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.380> Bend<00:01:45.729> but<00:01:46.729> this<00:01:46.880> corner<00:01:47.270> here

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
even flow and Bend but this corner here

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.489 
even flow and Bend but this corner here
is<00:01:47.569> a<00:01:47.599> lot<00:01:47.840> tighter

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
is a lot tighter

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.949 
is a lot tighter
and<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.099> need<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.459> get<00:01:49.609> back<00:01:49.759> early<00:01:50.539> in

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
and so you need to get back early in

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.649 
and so you need to get back early in
order<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.319> prepare<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.459> turn<00:01:52.729> after

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
order to prepare for the turn after

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.489 
order to prepare for the turn after
letter<00:01:54.169> F<00:01:55.270> if<00:01:56.270> you're<00:01:57.020> having<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.349> bit<00:01:57.469> of

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
letter F if you're having a bit of

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.069 
letter F if you're having a bit of
problem<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.249> finding<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.299> is<00:01:59.479> too

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
problem and finding that is too

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.319 
problem and finding that is too
difficult<00:02:00.319> your<00:02:01.249> horse<00:02:01.490> isn't<00:02:01.849> going<00:02:02.149> where

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
difficult your horse isn't going where

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.809 
difficult your horse isn't going where
it's<00:02:02.450> meant<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.749> be<00:02:02.899> going<00:02:03.130> we<00:02:04.130> can<00:02:04.310> put<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.520> pole

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
it's meant to be going we can put a pole

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.469 
it's meant to be going we can put a pole
on<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:05.659> quarter<00:02:06.469> line<00:02:06.649> parallel<00:02:07.609> to<00:02:07.789> the

on that quarter line parallel to the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.229 
on that quarter line parallel to the
left<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> side<00:02:09.369> measure<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.700> 5<00:02:11.000> meters

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
left of the side measure it in 5 meters

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.199 
left of the side measure it in 5 meters
from<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.750> side<00:02:12.020> or<00:02:12.290> maybe<00:02:12.620> five<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.160> half

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
from the side or maybe five and a half

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.180 
from the side or maybe five and a half
so<00:02:14.209> then<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.510> can<00:02:14.720> come<00:02:14.930> out<00:02:15.140> touch<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.980> pole

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
so then you can come out touch the pole

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.790 
so then you can come out touch the pole
and<00:02:16.550> get<00:02:17.090> back<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.569> side<00:02:17.810> gives<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.710> a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
and get back to the side gives you a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.430 
and get back to the side gives you a
good<00:02:18.950> indicator<00:02:19.460> of<00:02:19.790> how<00:02:20.180> quickly<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
good indicator of how quickly the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.710 
good indicator of how quickly the
movement<00:02:21.860> may<00:02:22.100> come<00:02:22.340> up<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.480> feel

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
movement may come up that as you feel

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.250 
movement may come up that as you feel
that<00:02:23.750> you're<00:02:24.020> just

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
that you're just

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.080 
that you're just
leaving<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> track<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.129> seems<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.549> be<00:02:25.640> time<00:02:25.879> to

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
leaving the track it seems to be time to

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.899 
leaving the track it seems to be time to
get<00:02:26.180> back<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.689> side<00:02:27.250> try<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.400> keep<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.730> nice

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
get back to the side try and keep a nice

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.720 
get back to the side try and keep a nice
even<00:02:29.269> suppleness<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.829> as<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.040> come<00:02:31.250> off<00:02:31.430> a

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
even suppleness so as you come off a

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.119 
even suppleness so as you come off a
slight<00:02:32.299> suppleness<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.110> inside<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.950> as

slight suppleness to the inside and as

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.630 
slight suppleness to the inside and as
you<00:02:34.280> go<00:02:34.400> back<00:02:34.930> maintain<00:02:36.069> not<00:02:37.069> as<00:02:37.220> suppleness

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
you go back maintain not as suppleness

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.179 
you go back maintain not as suppleness
to<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.970> outside<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.140> making<00:02:39.920> sure<00:02:40.069> you've

you're<00:02:43.760> traveling<00:02:44.239> then<00:02:44.900> making<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.379> even<00:02:45.739> and
