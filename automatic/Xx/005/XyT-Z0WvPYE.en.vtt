00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to do that so I actually came up with my

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.729 
to do that so I actually came up with my
own<00:00:49.350> invention<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.079> welcome<00:00:52.350> further

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
ideas i was going to think about trying

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
ideas i was going to think about trying
to<00:00:54.809> patent<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.890> know<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> point

to patent it but you know at this point
i<00:00:57.390> don't<00:00:58.199> think<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.670> enough

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
because you know it's just a prototype

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.990

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
do landscape or otherwise so let me show

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.970 
do landscape or otherwise so let me show
you<00:02:38.700> how<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:39.390> works<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.680> little

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
you how this works and we have little

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.839 
you how this works and we have little
rubber<00:02:44.329> rubber<00:02:45.329> here<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.310> something<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.670> keep

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
rubber rubber here or something to keep

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.610 
rubber rubber here or something to keep
it<00:02:48.060> from<00:02:49.310> getting<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.900> keep<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.349> place

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
it from getting to keep it in place

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.660 
it from getting to keep it in place
little<00:02:53.069> foam<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:55.530> actually<00:02:55.859> works<00:02:56.340> quite

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
little foam and it actually works quite

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.750 
little foam and it actually works quite
nicely<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:58.109> provides<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.310> nice<00:02:59.489> way

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
to hold it so you would take you know

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.559

it so on my wish list would be the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.950 
it so on my wish list would be the
ability<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.910> allow<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:25.920> charger<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:27.540> work

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
ability to allow the charger to work

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.170 
ability to allow the charger to work
with<00:04:28.380> another<00:04:28.800> part<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.250> my<00:04:29.340> wish<00:04:29.580> list<00:04:29.850> would

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
with another part of my wish list would

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.220 
with another part of my wish list would
be<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:32.510> should<00:04:33.510> have<00:04:33.570> planned<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:33.990> out<00:04:34.170> a

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
be to I should have planned this out a

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.920 
be to I should have planned this out a
little<00:04:34.350> better<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.880> now<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> can<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.420> charge

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
little better so now I can just charge

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.540 
little better so now I can just charge
and<00:04:37.820> be<00:04:38.820> attached<00:04:39.380> while<00:04:40.380> you're<00:04:41.130> recording

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
and be attached while you're recording

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.850 
and be attached while you're recording
another<00:04:42.300> part<00:04:42.690> would<00:04:42.960> be<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.350> make<00:04:43.500> it<00:04:43.650> thick

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
another part would be to make it thick

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.150 
another part would be to make it thick
enough<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:45.330> put<00:04:45.810> on<00:04:45.960> one<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.230> these<00:04:46.440> cases

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
enough to to put on one of these cases

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.650 
enough to to put on one of these cases
as<00:04:47.790> well<00:04:47.820> these<00:04:48.360> are<00:04:48.830> me<00:04:49.830> lay<00:04:50.010> or<00:04:50.370> mophie<00:04:51.240> you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
as well these are me lay or mophie you

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.920 
as well these are me lay or mophie you
know<00:04:51.780> cases<00:04:52.850> for<00:04:53.850> extra<00:04:54.330> battery<00:04:54.750> because

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
know cases for extra battery because

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.620 
know cases for extra battery because
battery<00:04:55.260> is<00:04:55.740> off<00:04:56.130> of<00:04:56.160> issues<00:04:56.850> are<00:04:57.000> always<00:04:57.450> an

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
battery is off of issues are always an

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.620 
battery is off of issues are always an
issue<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:59.310> need<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.700> make<00:04:59.760> this<00:05:00.090> thicker

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
issue so you need to make this thicker

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
issue so you need to make this thicker
in<00:05:01.080> order<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.830> do<00:05:02.010> that<00:05:02.190> now<00:05:02.700> while<00:05:03.120> I<00:05:03.150> was

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
in order to do that now while I was

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.830 
in order to do that now while I was
thinking<00:05:04.650> about<00:05:04.890> this<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:06.150> know<00:05:06.210> there<00:05:06.720> is<00:05:06.810> a

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
thinking about this you know there is a

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.870 
thinking about this you know there is a
video<00:05:07.440> out<00:05:07.500> there<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:08.010> says<00:05:08.220> oh<00:05:08.400> just<00:05:08.430> take<00:05:08.850> a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
video out there that says oh just take a

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.420 
video out there that says oh just take a
rubber<00:05:09.180> band<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.900> attach<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.350> and<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:11.370> know

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
rubber band and attach it and you know

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.840 
rubber band and attach it and you know
to<00:05:11.520> a<00:05:11.700> regular<00:05:12.390> tripod<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:13.370> don't<00:05:14.370> think<00:05:14.430> that

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
to a regular tripod I don't think that

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.740 
to a regular tripod I don't think that
works<00:05:15.720> but<00:05:16.200> I<00:05:16.230> do<00:05:16.350> think<00:05:16.890> you<00:05:17.790> what<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.450> could

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
works but I do think you what you could

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.940 
works but I do think you what you could
do<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.260> take<00:05:19.680> one<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:21.419> know<00:05:21.620> elegant<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.860> know

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
do is take one you know elegant you know

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:28.760 
do is take one you know elegant you know
sort<00:05:23.280> of<00:05:24.590> stick<00:05:25.590> with<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.930> screw<00:05:27.930> thing<00:05:28.560> in

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
sort of stick with the screw thing in

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.909 
sort of stick with the screw thing in
the<00:05:28.980> bottom<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.610> then<00:05:30.390> take<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:31.050> few<00:05:31.650> rubber

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
the bottom and then take a few rubber

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.470 
the bottom and then take a few rubber
bands<00:05:32.190> or<00:05:32.430> something<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:32.760> little<00:05:32.940> more<00:05:33.060> refined

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
bands or something a little more refined

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.230 
bands or something a little more refined
than<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.140> so<00:05:34.980> that<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.400> would<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.820> would<00:05:35.880> hold

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
than that so that it would it would hold

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.330 
than that so that it would it would hold
firm<00:05:36.630> in<00:05:36.930> place<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.710> stick<00:05:37.919> would<00:05:38.130> have<00:05:38.310> a

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
firm in place and the stick would have a

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.400 
firm in place and the stick would have a
flat<00:05:38.700> edge<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.780> i<00:05:39.840> don't<00:05:40.050> think<00:05:40.200> i'd<00:05:40.290> be

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
flat edge and i don't think i'd be

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.560 
flat edge and i don't think i'd be
comfortable<00:05:40.590> my<00:05:41.070> motorcycle<00:05:41.850> with<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.240> but

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
comfortable my motorcycle with that but

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.930 
comfortable my motorcycle with that but
i<00:05:42.780> do<00:05:43.140> think<00:05:43.260> that<00:05:43.560> that<00:05:43.830> is<00:05:44.070> a<00:05:44.490> fairly

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
i do think that that is a fairly

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.980 
i do think that that is a fairly
simplistic<00:05:45.480> you<00:05:46.020> know<00:05:47.510> solution<00:05:48.510> and<00:05:48.720> the

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
simplistic you know solution and the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.780 
simplistic you know solution and the
rubber<00:05:49.200> band<00:05:49.530> could<00:05:49.919> be<00:05:50.160> you<00:05:50.460> know<00:05:50.550> not<00:05:50.760> a

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
rubber band could be you know not a

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.600 
rubber band could be you know not a
rubberband<00:05:51.360> but<00:05:51.600> something<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:51.990> little<00:05:52.169> more

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
rubberband but something a little more

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.000 
rubberband but something a little more
secure<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:53.970> you<00:05:54.510> know<00:05:54.570> if<00:05:55.140> you<00:05:55.410> look<00:05:55.740> I've

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
secure so you know if you look I've

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.250 
secure so you know if you look I've
tried<00:05:56.340> literally<00:05:56.970> all<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.540> solutions<00:05:57.900> out

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
tried literally all the solutions out

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.810 
tried literally all the solutions out
there<00:05:58.320> for<00:05:59.150> four<00:06:00.150> tripods<00:06:00.690> for<00:06:01.580> iphones<00:06:02.580> and

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
there for four tripods for iphones and

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.630 
there for four tripods for iphones and
and<00:06:03.120> and<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.350> really<00:06:04.710> want<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:04.979> maximum

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
and and you really want the maximum

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.490 
and and you really want the maximum
benefit<00:06:06.150> be<00:06:06.390> able<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.690> record<00:06:06.990> from<00:06:07.229> both

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
benefit be able to record from both

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.760 
benefit be able to record from both
sides<00:06:07.860> you<00:06:08.820> know<00:06:08.850> be<00:06:09.630> able<00:06:09.750> to<00:06:09.960> utilize<00:06:10.380> other

attachments<00:06:11.640> yoona<00:06:11.970> pods<00:06:12.180> for<00:06:12.510> example<00:06:12.990> which

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
attachments yoona pods for example which

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.770 
attachments yoona pods for example which
i<00:06:13.229> use<00:06:13.410> a<00:06:13.440> lot<00:06:13.710> you<00:06:14.310> know<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.610> long<00:06:15.120> stick<00:06:15.510> that

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
i use a lot you know the long stick that

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.100 
i use a lot you know the long stick that
has<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.020> little<00:06:16.380> screw<00:06:16.740> that<00:06:16.919> enables<00:06:17.490> you<00:06:17.610> to

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
has a little screw that enables you to

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.500 
has a little screw that enables you to
go<00:06:19.110> up<00:06:19.229> and<00:06:19.380> down<00:06:19.500> so<00:06:20.070> i<00:06:20.310> think<00:06:20.640> this<00:06:20.880> isn't<00:06:21.270> bad

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
go up and down so i think this isn't bad

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.390 
go up and down so i think this isn't bad
and

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
and

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.740 
and
you<00:06:22.460> know<00:06:22.520> again<00:06:22.910> you<00:06:23.240> know<00:06:23.330> I<00:06:23.360> don't<00:06:23.600> think

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
you know again you know I don't think

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.629 
you know again you know I don't think
like<00:06:23.930> this<00:06:24.169> piece<00:06:24.470> is<00:06:24.740> needed<00:06:25.070> if<00:06:25.220> all<00:06:25.400> these

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
like this piece is needed if all these

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.969 
like this piece is needed if all these
other<00:06:25.850> pieces<00:06:26.090> were<00:06:26.419> really<00:06:26.750> strong<00:06:27.050> made<00:06:27.800> out

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
other pieces were really strong made out

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.469 
other pieces were really strong made out
of<00:06:28.100> metal<00:06:28.220> I<00:06:28.520> don't<00:06:28.729> think<00:06:28.880> you<00:06:28.970> need<00:06:29.090> this<00:06:29.270> one

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479
