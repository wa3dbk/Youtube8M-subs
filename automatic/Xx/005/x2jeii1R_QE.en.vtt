00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379

find this during one of my test flights
it's<00:03:22.069> awfully<00:03:22.370> convenient<00:03:22.819> yeah<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:23.629> know<00:03:23.780> it

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
it's awfully convenient yeah I know it

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.530 
it's awfully convenient yeah I know it
seems<00:03:24.769> got<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.069> limited<00:03:25.549> power<00:03:25.849> so<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.510> figured

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
seems got a limited power so I figured

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.229 
seems got a limited power so I figured
why<00:03:26.989> not<00:03:27.019> use<00:03:27.349> it<00:03:27.469> to<00:03:27.620> power<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.950> plane<00:03:28.310> simply

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
why not use it to power a plane simply

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.920 
why not use it to power a plane simply
