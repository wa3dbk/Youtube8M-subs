00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
 good of the tropic continues quite 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:05.700
 active we have the tropical storm of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.220
 ernesto and here they have the models but 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.570
 what is the official trajectory is I have 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 this and much more 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.610
 later in the time segment 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.310
 from london carlos maxwell telemundo 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.169
 good maxwell is far away 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.480
 floren is moving away and ernesto the one 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:26.009
 keep throwing joke here is closer 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.499
 the good good Caribbean tells us that it 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.419
 is moving away from our area but it is going 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.019
 to affect portion in Central America and 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.019
 also mexico 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.969
 how about a good afternoon and an afternoon 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.800
 pretty hot here in the south of the 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.289
 florida with good sunny moments but 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.570
 we have also had our storms 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.609
 we started talking about the region of 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.280
 tropic we have the tropical storm 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.350
 florent spring continues to move about 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.390
 waters of the Atlantic fine if it's not going to be 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.649
 a storm that threatens earth so 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.750
 is going to be what we 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.820
 meteorologists call a storm 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.530
 fisherwoman since it will remain on 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.539
 waters of the Atlantic meanwhile 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.940
 a little further east we notice a 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.340
 ernesto ernesto continues also as 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.340
 tropical storm and we can expect that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.409
 continue its course to the west 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.119
 Ernesto is currently quite 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.069
 disorganized but already during the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.200
 next days they will start to grab a 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.110
 little more of its structure or a little more 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.179
 of organization and we can expect that 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.720
 bring heavy rains to the region 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.310
 from jamaica in fact ernesto will be 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.890
 decreasing its speed bringing still 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.319
 more rains for the jamaica region and 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.299
 also for our friends in Honduras 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.549
 and in Nicaragua in fact here they continue 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.229
 some storm watches 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.650
 tropical so a lot of caution for 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.930
 now 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.540
 ernesto would be touching earth that 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.640
 Tuesday night on Wednesday at the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.740
 early morning over the region of the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.290
 Yucatan Peninsula between Belize and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.330
 Yucatan and already by the end of the week 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.240
 labor would possibly be like a 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.030
 Category 1 hurricane touching land nearby 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.530
 from the tampico region in mexico to 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.090
 our good region and a system of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.979
 high pressure but we still have 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.330
 a lot of moisture at medium levels and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.770
 high in the atmosphere so you have to 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.880
 be very careful as for 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.560
 Monday morning 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.410
 some showers are waiting for us and some 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.030
 storms for much of the day 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.800
 starting with these isolated downpours 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.090
 in the early hours of the morning so 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.760
 umbrella in hand for now the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.530
 conditions are quite calm 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.209
 well metropolitan portions some 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.700
 showers very scattered towards the sector 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.620
 from palm beach for now a system of 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.150
 high pressure will continue to govern our 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.800
 meteorological pattern but will be the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 local effects such as the breezes 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400
 marine high temperatures without much 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.350
 moisture which bring the showers 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.120
 for tomorrow Monday in the maritime sector 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.910
 the wind will be mostly from the east 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.770
 southeast between 10 to 14 knots a little more 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.959
 lifted the wind towards the current of 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.220
 gulf now for the rest of the week 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.990
 can work 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.080
 wait for the conditions little by little 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.060
 begin to improve as it comes haze and 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.470
 dust of the sahara the famous dust of the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.540
 Sahara which will bring us some 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.730
 haze for mid-week work 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.830
 will not be with us for much 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 time but if it's going to be calming the 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.210
 situation as far as the downpours though 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.860
 I do not rule out some downpours towards the 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.510
 interior in the afternoon thanks to 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.640
 the marine lists for Tuesday 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.800
 Wednesday and Thursday and Friday in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.840
 returns to the humidity the mist goes away and 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.850
 we will fall back into this pattern type 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.530
 summer with storms during the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.560
 course of the afternoon and towards the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.240
 interior and much more humidity is that one 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.709
