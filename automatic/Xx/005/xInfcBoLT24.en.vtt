physical shortage it's gonna join the
pipeline<00:03:13.639> exactly<00:03:14.299> correct<00:03:14.660> but<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.870> takes<00:03:15.109> so

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
pipeline exactly correct but it takes so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.530 
pipeline exactly correct but it takes so
long<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:15.709> these<00:03:16.130> things<00:03:16.370> change<00:03:16.760> if<00:03:17.090> you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
long for these things change if you

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.599 
long for these things change if you
close<00:03:17.780> down<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:18.079> mine<00:03:18.440> taking<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.100> long<00:03:19.340> time<00:03:19.549> to

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
close down a mine taking a long time to

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.150 
close down a mine taking a long time to
get<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:19.910> an<00:03:20.260> exploration<00:03:21.260> costs<00:03:21.889> are<00:03:21.980> being

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
get of an exploration costs are being

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.680 
get of an exploration costs are being
cut<00:03:22.370> yes<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:22.819> this<00:03:22.940> going<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.269> affect<00:03:23.329> the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
cut yes is this going to affect the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.180 
cut yes is this going to affect the
supply<00:03:23.900> demand<00:03:24.260> numbers<00:03:24.739> down<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.069> road

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
supply demand numbers down the road

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.280 
supply demand numbers down the road
absolutely<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.030> takes<00:03:26.269> time<00:03:26.569> for<00:03:26.600> all<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.109> to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
absolutely it takes time for all that to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.960 
absolutely it takes time for all that to
happen<00:03:27.440> but<00:03:28.010> yeah<00:03:28.190> there's<00:03:28.400> winding<00:03:28.790> down<00:03:28.910> I

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
happen but yeah there's winding down I

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.690 
happen but yeah there's winding down I
mean<00:03:29.590> everybody's<00:03:30.590> cutting<00:03:30.829> costs<00:03:31.370> because<00:03:31.670> I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
mean everybody's cutting costs because I

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.220 
mean everybody's cutting costs because I

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
silver producers as you say I can't make

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.210 
silver producers as you say I can't make
any<00:03:35.359> money<00:03:35.540> at<00:03:35.690> these<00:03:35.930> numbers<00:03:36.109> yeah<00:03:36.829> but

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
any money at these numbers yeah but

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.770 
any money at these numbers yeah but
people<00:03:37.370> forget<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.850> yes<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.239> prices<00:03:38.660> are

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
people forget is yes the prices are

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.629 
people forget is yes the prices are
still<00:03:38.959> higher<00:03:39.200> but<00:03:39.500> cost<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:40.040> going<00:03:40.160> like<00:03:40.370> this

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
still higher but cost of going like this

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.569 
still higher but cost of going like this
yeah<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:41.600> it's<00:03:42.410> affecting<00:03:42.920> everybody<00:03:43.190> and

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
yeah and it's affecting everybody and

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.069 
yeah and it's affecting everybody and
that's<00:03:43.670> why<00:03:43.910> there's<00:03:44.120> such<00:03:44.299> negativity<00:03:44.810> in

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
that's why there's such negativity in

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.349 
that's why there's such negativity in
our<00:03:45.200> sector<00:03:45.470> everybody<00:03:46.040> wants<00:03:46.400> out<00:03:46.519> and<00:03:46.850> of

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
our sector everybody wants out and of

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.580 
our sector everybody wants out and of
course<00:03:47.389> it's<00:03:47.780> going<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:47.959> this<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.410> how<00:03:48.530> you

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
course it's going to this is how you

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.890 
course it's going to this is how you
create<00:03:48.859> bottoms<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.700> regatta<00:03:50.359> comes<00:03:50.660> from

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
create bottoms and regatta comes from

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.199 
create bottoms and regatta comes from
these<00:03:51.049> artificially<00:03:51.799> low<00:03:51.980> prices<00:03:52.489> in<00:03:53.000> the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
these artificially low prices in the

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.789 
these artificially low prices in the
sense<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.540> what<00:03:53.690> they<00:03:53.840> really<00:03:54.019> should<00:03:54.349> be<00:03:54.530> and

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
sense of what they really should be and

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.589 
sense of what they really should be and
when<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.400> turns<00:03:55.639> it<00:03:55.849> will<00:03:55.970> be<00:03:56.060> something<00:03:56.299> else

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
when it turns it will be something else

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.690 
when it turns it will be something else
