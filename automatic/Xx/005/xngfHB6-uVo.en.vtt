00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.259 
thing and then I used wire to attach it
to<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.100> headband<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.940> would<00:02:24.060> actually

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269

balance<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.380> my<00:02:25.440> heads<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.250> that's<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.519> whole

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
balance on my heads and that's the whole

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.190 
balance on my heads and that's the whole
outfit<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.269> thing<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.810> about<00:02:27.840> this
