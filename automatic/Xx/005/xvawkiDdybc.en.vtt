00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
the chassis dyno one thing I do want to

the chassis dyno one thing I do want to
stress<00:00:52.570> though<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.410> we<00:00:53.530> have<00:00:53.710> our<00:00:53.739> table

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
stress though is that we have our table

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.400 
stress though is that we have our table
set<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.640> safe<00:00:54.850> zones<00:00:55.180> like<00:00:55.719> we<00:00:55.870> did<00:00:56.050> back<00:00:56.230> at
