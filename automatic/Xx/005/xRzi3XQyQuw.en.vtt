00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
now let's take the atypical way to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980 
now let's take the atypical way to
animate<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.699> example<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.359> show<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.900> how

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
animate for example and show you how

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.600 
animate for example and show you how
boring<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.039> let's<00:00:29.970> take<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.420> leg<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.610> down

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610

here at the time slider on your keyboard
kit<00:00:35.640> shift<00:00:36.360> eat<00:00:36.750> okay<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.700> let's<00:00:39.239> move<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
kit shift eat okay and let's move it to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.900 
kit shift eat okay and let's move it to
frame<00:00:41.420> 24<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.690> hit<00:00:43.050> shifty<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.430> keyed<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
frame 24 and hit shifty so I keyed it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.369 
frame 24 and hit shifty so I keyed it
and<00:00:45.030> pull<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.510> different<00:00:45.809> spots<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.260> way

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
and pull two different spots that way

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
and pull two different spots that way
the<00:00:46.500> loops<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.100> let's<00:00:47.820> move<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> arm<00:00:48.329> down

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the loops and let's move the arm down

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.790 
the loops and let's move the arm down
and<00:00:49.410> hit<00:00:49.710> shift<00:00:50.100> eat<00:00:50.719> okay<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.530> keyed

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and hit shift eat okay so we just keyed

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.400 
and hit shift eat okay so we just keyed
it<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.250> rotate<00:00:53.610> only<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.960> shifty

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it to rotate only that's what shifty

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
it to rotate only that's what shifty
does<00:00:55.730> now<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:57.059> kind<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> used<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.750> using

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
does now get kind of used to using

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.279 
does now get kind of used to using
shifty<00:00:58.530> because<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:01.079> use

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it's going to be rotate anyway with

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
it's going to be rotate anyway with
sometimes<00:01:13.520> translation<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.240> the

sometimes translation of you know the
route<00:01:15.570> bone<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.590> we'll<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.070> ways

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
route bone but we'll get into ways

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.840 
route bone but we'll get into ways
around<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.200> alright<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:19.650> yep<00:01:20.100> mmm-hmm

going<00:01:23.880> through<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.210> entire<00:01:24.570> character<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
going through the entire character and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
going through the entire character and
trying<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.939> let's<00:01:27.270> say<00:01:27.360> him

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
trying to do that like let's say him

walking or jumping up and down that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.560 
walking or jumping up and down that
would<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.930> tough<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:31.619> boring<00:01:32.509> okay<00:01:33.509> so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
would be tough and very boring okay so

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.109 
would be tough and very boring okay so
now<00:01:33.869> let's<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.320> rid<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.680> keys<00:01:34.950> cut<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you go to hyper graph hierarchy you'll

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.600 
you go to hyper graph hierarchy you'll
see<00:01:51.299> our<00:01:51.540> list<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.170> bones<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:53.100> zoomed<00:01:53.460> way

typed it earlier and I was playing

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.110 
typed it earlier and I was playing
around<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.420> droid<00:02:27.690> um<00:02:28.880> another<00:02:29.880> thing<00:02:30.090> is

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
around with droid um another thing is

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.970 
around with droid um another thing is
you<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.959> choose<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.470> want<00:02:31.739> cable

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
you have to choose what you want cable

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.570 
you have to choose what you want cable
do<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.400> want<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.790> cable<00:02:33.360> know<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:35.069> some<00:02:35.310> cases

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
do you want all cable know in some cases

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.089 
do you want all cable know in some cases
maybe<00:02:36.030> let's<00:02:36.959> say<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> very<00:02:37.560> stretchy

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
maybe let's say you have a very stretchy

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.580 
maybe let's say you have a very stretchy
character<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:39.030> something<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.140> know<00:02:40.170> kind<00:02:40.530> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
character or something you know kind of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.500 
character or something you know kind of
odd<00:02:40.800> where<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.610> character<00:02:42.209> kind<00:02:42.420> of

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
odd where the character kind of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.240 
odd where the character kind of
disappears<00:02:43.110> out<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.620> middle<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.890> nowhere

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
disappears out the middle of nowhere

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.710 
disappears out the middle of nowhere
then<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.970> would<00:02:45.120> want<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:46.459> but<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.420> have

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
then you would want that but what I have

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.620 
then you would want that but what I have
or<00:02:49.019> from<00:02:49.560> channel<00:02:49.890> box<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.970> very<00:02:51.299> tough

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
or from channel box this is very tough

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.420 
or from channel box this is very tough
this<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.290> kind<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.680> like<00:02:52.830> one<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.069> those<00:02:53.220> things

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
this is kind of like one of those things

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.520 
this is kind of like one of those things
where<00:02:53.610> we<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.750> choose<00:02:54.900> every<00:02:55.170> once<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.470> a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
where we get to choose every once in a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.100 
where we get to choose every once in a
while<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.819> can<00:02:57.090> forget<00:02:57.480> every<00:02:57.750> once<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
while and you can forget every once in a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020 
while and you can forget every once in a
while<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.560> i<00:02:58.799> would<00:02:59.069> highly<00:02:59.340> suggest<00:02:59.519> not

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.479 
doing this one I would suggest all
cables<00:03:03.420> subscale<00:03:04.049> invisibility<00:03:04.590> with

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
cables subscale invisibility with

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.250 
cables subscale invisibility with
something<00:03:05.849> exception<00:03:06.330> some<00:03:06.630> time<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:07.110> this

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

these you know as I said translate

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.849 
these you know as I said translate
probably<00:03:51.959> wouldn't<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> greatest<00:03:52.650> thing

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.900 
you would take all the translates out
except<00:04:02.040> for<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.630> translate<00:04:03.630> on<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.989> route
