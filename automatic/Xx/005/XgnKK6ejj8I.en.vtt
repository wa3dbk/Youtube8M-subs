00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and I'm going to put the darkest blue at

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.440 
and I'm going to put the darkest blue at
the<00:00:33.690> top<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> canvas<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.460> closest<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> us

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the top of the canvas it's closest to us

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.229 
the top of the canvas it's closest to us
we're<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> fade<00:00:37.680> down<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.370> white<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
we're going to fade down to white as it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.880 
we're going to fade down to white as it
gets<00:00:39.390> towards<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> horizon<00:00:39.930> line<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.680> makes

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
gets towards the horizon line that makes

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.709 
gets towards the horizon line that makes
the<00:00:41.040> sky<00:00:41.430> look<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.030> receding<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the sky look like it's receding and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.590 
the sky look like it's receding and
going<00:00:42.930> backwards<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> blue<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
going backwards so this is the blue that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.040 
going backwards so this is the blue that
they<00:00:45.930> love<00:00:46.170> blue<00:00:47.239> I'm<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> empty<00:00:48.870> my

they love blue I'm going to empty my
brush<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.680> onto<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> canvas<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.270> will

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
brush out onto the canvas and this will

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.990 
brush out onto the canvas and this will
serve<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.379> mixing<00:00:52.949> surface<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.789> we're

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
serve as a mixing surface and we're

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520 
serve as a mixing surface and we're
going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> pick<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.510> some<00:00:54.719> white<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.320> my

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
going to pick up some white with my

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
going to pick up some white with my
brush<00:00:55.829> without<00:00:56.129> washing<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.030> want

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
brush without washing it because I want

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360 
brush without washing it because I want
the<00:00:57.360> blue<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.870> blend<00:00:58.140> into<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.649> white<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.190> I'm

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the blue to blend into the white and I'm

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.119 
the blue to blend into the white and I'm
going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.609> take<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> white<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.530> into

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
going to take the white right up into

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.680 
going to take the white right up into
this<00:01:02.250> blue<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.030> gives<00:01:03.180> me<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> beautiful

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
this blue and it gives me a beautiful

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.380 
this blue and it gives me a beautiful
sky<00:01:04.350> color<00:01:04.680> working<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> two<00:01:05.610> colors<00:01:06.030> back

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
sky color working the two colors back

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.760 
sky color working the two colors back
and<00:01:06.600> forth<00:01:06.810> together<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> soft

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and forth together with the soft

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.660 
and forth together with the soft
blending<00:01:08.220> motion<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.710> towards<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.310> top

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
blending motion so I get towards the top

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.160 
blending motion so I get towards the top
of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.939> mountains<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> try

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
of the mountains I'm just going to try

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
of the mountains I'm just going to try
to<00:01:13.200> match<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.830> top<00:01:14.700> line<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> mountains

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to match the top line of the mountains

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.469 
to match the top line of the mountains
with<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:15.780> brush<00:01:16.170> stroke<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> down<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
with my brush stroke on up and down to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
with my brush stroke on up and down to
give<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> an<00:01:18.869> uneven<00:01:19.439> horizon<00:01:20.280> line<00:01:20.460> now<00:01:21.030> we're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
give it an uneven horizon line now we're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
give it an uneven horizon line now we're
going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.080> ground<00:01:22.380> portion<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
going to do the ground portion of the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.910 
going to do the ground portion of the
landscape<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.780> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> opposite

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
landscape and it's kind of the opposite

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
landscape and it's kind of the opposite
approach<00:01:26.549> where<00:01:27.509> you're<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
approach where you're going to have the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.319 
approach where you're going to have the
lightest<00:01:28.560> colors<00:01:28.979> towards<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> horizon<00:01:29.790> line

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
lightest colors towards the horizon line

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
lightest colors towards the horizon line
and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.170> you're<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.979> color

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and then you're going to have more color

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
and then you're going to have more color
saturation<00:01:32.939> as<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.720> towards<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.079> bottom

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
saturation as you get towards the bottom

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
saturation as you get towards the bottom
of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> campus<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.790> visually

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the campus which is actually visually

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
of the campus which is actually visually
closer<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.290> us<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> start<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
closer to us I'm going to start with a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.210 
closer to us I'm going to start with a
yellow<00:01:39.360> ochre<00:01:39.689> color<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.290> I'm<00:01:40.710> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.979> come

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
yellow ochre color and I'm going to come

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.610 
yellow ochre color and I'm going to come
right<00:01:41.250> below<00:01:42.030> or

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
right below or

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.350 
right below or
Mountain<00:01:43.250> line<00:01:45.670> I'm<00:01:46.670> going<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.940> add<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.060> little

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
Mountain line I'm going to add a little

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.520 
Mountain line I'm going to add a little
bit<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.690> white<00:01:48.370> in<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:50.660> background<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.500> that

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
bit of white in the background so that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.640 
bit of white in the background so that
it's<00:01:51.800> a<00:01:51.950> little<00:01:52.130> bit<00:01:52.280> faded<00:01:52.670> out<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.440> think

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
it's a little bit faded out and I think

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.990 
it's a little bit faded out and I think
I'll<00:01:54.770> put<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.950> little<00:01:55.160> bit<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.430> green<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.850> there

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
I'll put a little bit of green in there

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.600 
I'll put a little bit of green in there
too<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.620> this<00:01:57.620> green<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:57.920> going<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.250> be<00:01:58.370> in<00:01:58.460> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
too and this green is going to be in the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.180 
too and this green is going to be in the
very<00:01:58.820> foreground<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.380> still<00:02:00.740> blending<00:02:01.070> the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
very foreground and still blending the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.160 
very foreground and still blending the
colors<00:02:01.520> together<00:02:01.760> they'll<00:02:02.630> have<00:02:02.780> sort<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.050> a

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
colors together they'll have sort of a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.440 
colors together they'll have sort of a
brownish<00:02:03.770> tone<00:02:04.010> in<00:02:04.220> there<00:02:04.400> which<00:02:04.790> is<00:02:04.970> good<00:02:05.210> for

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
brownish tone in there which is good for

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.450 
brownish tone in there which is good for
landscape<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.530> next<00:02:06.800> thing<00:02:06.920> I'd<00:02:07.040> like<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.340> do

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
landscape the next thing I'd like to do

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.240 
landscape the next thing I'd like to do
is<00:02:07.700> demonstrate<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.540> tree<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.170> we're<00:02:09.950> going<00:02:10.190> to

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
is demonstrate a tree and we're going to

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.770 
is demonstrate a tree and we're going to
start<00:02:10.670> with<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.950> 1/2<00:02:12.950> inch<00:02:13.220> flat<00:02:14.060> brush<00:02:14.390> I'm

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
start with the 1/2 inch flat brush I'm

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.380 
start with the 1/2 inch flat brush I'm
going<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.710> use<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.070> brown<00:02:16.340> paint<00:02:16.730> I'm<00:02:17.090> going

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
going to use the brown paint I'm going

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.300 
going to use the brown paint I'm going
to<00:02:17.450> start<00:02:17.750> with<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.990> brush<00:02:18.200> very<00:02:18.500> flat<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
to start with the brush very flat and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.520 
to start with the brush very flat and
just<00:02:19.640> pull<00:02:19.910> up<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.510> as<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.780> get<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:20.990> I'm<00:02:21.320> going

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
just pull up and as I get up I'm going

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.140 
just pull up and as I get up I'm going
to<00:02:21.590> kind<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.830> twist<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.640> little<00:02:22.760> bit<00:02:22.910> so

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
to kind of twist it just a little bit so

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.460 
to kind of twist it just a little bit so
the<00:02:23.240> tree<00:02:23.450> trunk<00:02:23.690> can<00:02:23.840> get<00:02:24.050> narrower<00:02:24.380> and

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
the tree trunk can get narrower and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.260 
the tree trunk can get narrower and
there<00:02:24.770> always<00:02:24.920> would<00:02:25.130> go<00:02:25.280> up<00:02:25.490> next<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.180> I'm

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
there always would go up next so I'm

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.820 
there always would go up next so I'm
going<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.480> add<00:02:26.890> some<00:02:27.890> roots<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:29.830> some

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
going to add some roots and some

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.390 
going to add some roots and some
branches

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.309 

the<00:02:36.879> next<00:02:37.120> thing<00:02:37.269> I'd<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.690> demonstrate

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
the next thing I'd like to demonstrate

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.360 
the next thing I'd like to demonstrate
is<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.870> leaves<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.140> tree<00:02:41.379> starting<00:02:42.250> with

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
is the leaves of the tree starting with

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.309 
is the leaves of the tree starting with
some<00:02:42.550> green<00:02:42.790> paint<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.900> tapping

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
some green paint and just a tapping

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.380 
some green paint and just a tapping
motion<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:46.569> I'm<00:02:47.110> also<00:02:47.319> going<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.620> add<00:02:47.800> some

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
motion and I'm also going to add some

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.690 
motion and I'm also going to add some
lighter<00:02:49.390> green<00:02:49.750> paint<00:02:50.110> on<00:02:50.290> top<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.310> give<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.580> a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
lighter green paint on top to give it a

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.610 
lighter green paint on top to give it a
little<00:02:51.879> bit<00:02:52.090> more<00:02:52.239> dimension<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.900> those<00:02:53.349> are

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
little bit more dimension and those are

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.970 
little bit more dimension and those are
some<00:02:53.799> basic<00:02:53.920> landscape<00:02:54.459> tips
