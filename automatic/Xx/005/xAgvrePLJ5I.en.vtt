00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
train at the same time as the keystroke

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.799 
train at the same time as the keystroke
so<00:00:30.800> we're<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.010> say<00:00:32.189> okay<00:00:32.580> to<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
Engine so I'm skipping a bunch of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.850 
Engine so I'm skipping a bunch of
screens<00:00:48.839> to<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.080> to<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.290> meat<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.650> Thames

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860

screens to get to the meat of the Thames
this<00:00:50.369> is<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.519> lot<00:00:50.670> darker<00:00:50.909> on<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.210> video<00:00:51.540> camera

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
this is a lot darker on the video camera

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.930 
this is a lot darker on the video camera
than<00:00:52.080> it<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.409> on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> screen<00:00:52.979> and<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.760> know

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
than it is on the screen and to know

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
than it is on the screen and to know
performance<00:00:54.540> degradation<00:00:55.430> serious<00:00:56.430> gamers

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
performance degradation serious gamers

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.630 
performance degradation serious gamers
will<00:00:56.970> say<00:00:57.089> oh<00:00:57.119> yeah<00:00:57.360> probably<00:00:58.129> flags<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.430> little

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
will say oh yeah probably flags a little

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.579 
will say oh yeah probably flags a little
bit<00:00:59.850> there's<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.720> little<00:01:00.960> bit<00:01:01.049> right<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:03.589> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
bit there's a little bit right there and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.240 
bit there's a little bit right there and
you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.769> adjust<00:01:04.890> your<00:01:05.250> settings<00:01:05.489> down

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
you can adjust your settings down

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
you can adjust your settings down
so<00:01:08.250> basically<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:08.970> done<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.360> uh<00:01:09.390> I've

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so basically what I've done is uh I've

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.720 
so basically what I've done is uh I've
set<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:10.410> at<00:01:10.620> medium-high<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.580> back

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
set these at medium-high but I go back

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.720 
set these at medium-high but I go back
and<00:01:11.940> set<00:01:12.120> them<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.480> low<00:01:13.230> or<00:01:13.530> medium<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
and set them to low or medium and it

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.950 
and set them to low or medium and it
runs<00:01:14.850> even<00:01:14.970> better<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> again<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
runs even better and again the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.210 
runs even better and again the
brightness<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> looks<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> lot

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
brightness and all that looks a lot

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
brightness and all that looks a lot
better<00:01:17.370> when<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.000> looking<00:01:18.120> straight<00:01:18.690> ons

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
better when you're looking straight ons

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.190 
better when you're looking straight ons
of<00:01:19.290> an<00:01:19.710> angle<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.160> video<00:01:20.370> camera<00:01:21.200> Batman

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of an angle with the video camera Batman

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.390 
of an angle with the video camera Batman
runs<00:01:22.410> pretty<00:01:22.530> good<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.980> as<00:01:23.070> far<00:01:23.190> as<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
runs pretty good and as far as the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.980 
runs pretty good and as far as the
temperature<00:01:23.820> goes<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.210> everyone<00:01:24.510> over<00:01:24.660> 70

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
temperature goes in everyone over 70

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.910 
temperature goes in everyone over 70
degrees<00:01:25.260> Celsius<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:27.540> felt<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> bomb<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
degrees Celsius so I felt a bomb and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.370 
degrees Celsius so I felt a bomb and
laptop<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.520> seemed<00:01:29.730> fine<00:01:30.000> I'd<00:01:30.720> keep<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.050> monitor

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
laptop it seemed fine I'd keep a monitor

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.470 
laptop it seemed fine I'd keep a monitor
on<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.980> Batman<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.030> looks<00:01:33.300> like<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
on it but Batman it looks like the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.500 
on it but Batman it looks like the
Lenovo<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.260> run<00:01:34.530> some<00:01:34.770> games<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.880> another

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
Lenovo can run some games I have another

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.330 
Lenovo can run some games I have another
one<00:01:36.630> coming<00:01:37.080> up<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.230> Alan<00:01:37.740> Wake<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> show<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
one coming up with Alan Wake to show you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.990 
one coming up with Alan Wake to show you
why<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> can't<00:01:39.119> run<00:01:39.300> some<00:01:39.600> games<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.650> overall

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
why I can't run some games but overall

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
why I can't run some games but overall
there's<00:01:42.000> no<00:01:42.090> reason<00:01:42.420> why<00:01:42.510> you<00:01:42.540> can't<00:01:43.130> do<00:01:44.130> what

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
there's no reason why you can't do what

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.760 
there's no reason why you can't do what
you<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:44.550> you<00:01:44.640> need<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.150> far<00:01:45.330> as<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
you think you need to do as far as a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.170 
you think you need to do as far as a
solid<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> problem<00:01:47.550> with<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.880> space

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
solid there is a problem with this space

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
solid there is a problem with this space
though<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.320> noble<00:01:49.890> only

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
though because you know the noble only

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.620 
though because you know the noble only
comes<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.550> small<00:01:50.850> amount<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.240> space<00:01:51.420> but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
comes with a small amount of space but

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.290 
comes with a small amount of space but
later<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.080> can<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.290> expanded<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:54.060> for

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
later on that can be expanded but for

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.749 
later on that can be expanded but for
right<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.740> gameplay<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
right now I really like the gameplay and

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580 
right now I really like the gameplay and
