00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
but he breaks up the play and he can

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.109 
but he breaks up the play and he can
distribute<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> ball<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.000> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
distribute the ball and that is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.310 
distribute the ball and that is
important<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.630> two<00:01:48.780> thousand<00:01:49.079> coins<00:01:49.170> is
