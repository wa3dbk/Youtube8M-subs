Hi, this is Ayano from Eat more vegetable.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.880
This week, the recipe for mashed potatoes without using butter is going to be introduced.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.760
First, steam cut potatoes. You can also steam potatoes after peel a skin.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.580
Put cashew nuts and soybean milk in a food processor for making a paste.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.600
Cashew nut is soft and does not have a peculiar flavor, so that it can be used for a paste.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.920
Next, put steamed potatoes in a food processor.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.400
You should not put all potatoes at once, as all ingredients cannot be mixed well in a processor.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.460
If you put steamed potatoes through a sieve, it gains more smoothness.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.620
Sprinkle a pinch of salt to taste the dish. Put fried seasonal vegetable, balsamic vinegar and olive oil as toppings.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.060
The recipe is perfect if you think making an extra plate.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.940
The recipe is one of the menus from “One day café” that I used to organize.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:48.620
My mum used to cook mashed potatoes with butter and it was one of my favorite foods. However, if I put cashew nut in instead of butter, the flavor and taste have become richer and delicious.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:03:00.500
Although other nuts can be used, cashew nut is highly recommended as it does not have a peculiar flavor and it also turns the plate creamy.
