00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
big machines they're using usually for

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.560 
big machines they're using usually for
this<00:05:11.630> kind<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:11.930> research<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:12.760> we<00:05:13.760> got<00:05:13.910> quite<00:05:14.450> a

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.550 
the wheel spat which had a big rock
through<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.470> in<00:06:15.650> Antartica<00:06:16.040> and<00:06:17.350> some<00:06:18.350> bad

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
through it in Antartica and some bad

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.400 
through it in Antartica and some bad
fuel<00:06:18.970> actually<00:06:19.970> this<00:06:20.330> is<00:06:20.510> a<00:06:20.540> very<00:06:20.930> long<00:06:21.139> trip

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
fuel actually this is a very long trip

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.159 
fuel actually this is a very long trip
and<00:06:24.610> it's<00:06:25.610> not<00:06:25.880> possible<00:06:26.090> to<00:06:26.449> get<00:06:26.600> any<00:06:26.750> kind<00:06:26.960> of

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
and it's not possible to get any kind of

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.290 
and it's not possible to get any kind of
failure<00:06:27.470> on<00:06:27.620> an<00:06:27.680> engine<00:06:28.040> or<00:06:28.220> any<00:06:28.970> kind<00:06:29.210> of

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
failure on an engine or any kind of

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.830 
failure on an engine or any kind of
problem<00:06:29.630> with<00:06:29.720> aircraft<00:06:31.479> because<00:06:32.479> this<00:06:32.720> is

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
problem with aircraft because this is

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.420 
problem with aircraft because this is
really<00:06:33.139> demanding<00:06:33.320> trip<00:06:33.860> a<00:06:34.070> lot<00:06:34.280> of

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
really demanding trip a lot of

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.820 
really demanding trip a lot of
unexpected<00:06:35.240> situation<00:06:35.810> a<00:06:35.930> lot<00:06:36.110> of<00:06:36.199> turbulence

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
unexpected situation a lot of turbulence

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.219 
unexpected situation a lot of turbulence
is<00:06:37.040> a<00:06:37.160> lot<00:06:37.280> of<00:06:37.400> bad<00:06:37.610> runways<00:06:38.050> especially<00:06:39.050> like

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
is a lot of bad runways especially like

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.350 
is a lot of bad runways especially like
in<00:06:39.440> Antarctica<00:06:40.280> where<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.850> stone<00:06:41.060> comes

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
in Antarctica where the stone comes

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.719 
in Antarctica where the stone comes
inside<00:06:42.040> were<00:06:43.040> firing<00:06:43.310> can<00:06:43.729> blow<00:06:44.000> it<00:06:44.120> out<00:06:44.240> so

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
inside were firing can blow it out so

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.980 
inside were firing can blow it out so
things<00:06:46.729> actually<00:06:47.330> happen<00:06:48.229> so<00:06:49.660> it's<00:06:50.660> not

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
things actually happen so it's not

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.250 
things actually happen so it's not
necessary<00:06:51.530> to<00:06:51.830> to<00:06:52.750> find<00:06:53.750> out<00:06:53.990> who<00:06:54.169> is

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
necessary to to find out who is

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.440 
necessary to to find out who is
responsible<00:06:54.800> for<00:06:54.860> failure<00:06:55.520> or<00:06:55.669> something<00:06:56.120> but

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
responsible for failure or something but

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.990 
responsible for failure or something but
the<00:06:56.930> things<00:06:57.169> are<00:06:57.440> happening<00:06:57.470> so<00:06:57.950> we<00:06:58.880> are

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000

we have to change a little bit our
thoughts<00:07:27.349> because<00:07:27.889> maybe<00:07:28.490> this<00:07:28.729> was<00:07:28.940> the<00:07:28.970> kind

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300 
thoughts because maybe this was the kind

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.960 
thoughts because maybe this was the kind
kind<00:07:29.840> of<00:07:30.050> good<00:07:30.320> example<00:07:30.860> how<00:07:31.010> we<00:07:31.550> can<00:07:31.729> travel

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:31.970 
kind of good example how we can travel

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.210 
kind of good example how we can travel
in<00:07:32.150> future<00:07:32.539> not<00:07:32.780> using<00:07:33.169> only<00:07:33.530> big<00:07:33.889> machines

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.220 
in future not using only big machines

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.640 
in future not using only big machines
getting<00:07:34.760> bigger<00:07:35.210> and<00:07:35.330> bigger<00:07:35.389> more<00:07:36.139> powerful

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:36.650 
getting bigger and bigger more powerful

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.159 
getting bigger and bigger more powerful
more<00:07:36.830> rich<00:07:37.039> we<00:07:37.700> can<00:07:37.880> just<00:07:38.389> stick<00:07:38.599> to<00:07:38.780> the<00:07:38.930> small

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.169 
more rich we can just stick to the small

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:48.490 
more rich we can just stick to the small
things<00:07:39.590> and<00:07:39.860> small<00:07:46.930> gauge<00:07:47.930> thank<00:07:48.229> you<00:07:48.320> very

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:48.500 
things and small gauge thank you very
