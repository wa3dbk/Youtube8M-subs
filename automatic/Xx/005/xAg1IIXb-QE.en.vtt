with Gene stealer purple I'm basically
highlighting<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.620> do<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.370> off<00:03:20.550> can

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
highlighting and I do this off can

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.490 
highlighting and I do this off can
because<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.360> actually<00:03:21.750> paint<00:03:22.050> from<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> side

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
