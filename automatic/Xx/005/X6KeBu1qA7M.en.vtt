00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.939
 the question is that among other things 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.740
 we woke up this Monday realizing 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.320
 an embarrassing episode in the 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.690
 surroundings of the nation's congress 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.940
 university assembly intention of 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.110
 re-election for rubén alé or at most 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.760
 representative of the rectorship and groups 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.770
 socially attached to the left of the 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.020
 was directly confronted with the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.430
 police that had just fenced by 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.740
 security issues of the congress of 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.090
 the nation and that had just been 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.660
 chosen as a scenario so that nothing 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.149
 occur 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.519
 in fact doors inside the assembly 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.440
 carried forward and took for granted that 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.999
 rubén alice should remain the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.309
 Rector of the University of Buenos Aires 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:43.490
 these are the clashes this is 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.470
 one of the stories of the day 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.740
 where there were true ones in control in the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.000
 city of buenos aires that first 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.800
 it started being an interference the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.260
 transit somewhat accustomed among 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.260
 porteños after a pitched battle 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.409
 today is a black day a page 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.670
 black that has been written in history 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.469
 of the Argentine public university 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.380
 we imagine that something could 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:21.350
 do because some groupings were coming 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.840
 saying in the different media that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.710
 they were going to use any means to 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.710
 prevent the assembly 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.780
 I took the students repressing 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.160
 the congress of the nation promising that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.620
 I was going to democratize the university 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.180
 worrying is the methodology that they use 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.860
 but it seems that it is repudiable in 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.860
 any place and on any claim 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 and they will do everything possible to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.080
 stop the assembly 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.290
 there is a great anger with the rector to liu the 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.150
 promised that he would reform the statute 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.090
 This university business background 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.090
 the university federation of good 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.360
 aires fuba in addition to presenting a 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.990
 amparo appeal before the justice put 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.550
 in practice again the violent game 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.400
 to prevent a new election 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.160
 have actually happened measurement 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.750
 of violence that respond to what 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.460
 they had previously said what they were going to 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.030
 be the acts of violence that have 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.030
 passed today 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.480
 nothing justifies these things happening in 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.420
 a university family the way that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.420
 always chose the fuba was the violence 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.340
 systematically prevented during 2006 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.580
 the election of new authorities 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.799
 rubén a liu was dean of sciences 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.530
 veterinary and in the month of December 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.569
 he was elected rector of the uba in the middle of 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.250
 incidents between the police and 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.330
 students of the federation 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.720
 university this is not students 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:21.040
 They are delinquent gentlemen 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.120
 today he was reelected in his position with 144 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.120
 votes in favor 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.250
 for 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.929
 [Music] 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:56.500
 244 participatory votes ways 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:04:00.690
 [Applause] 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.690
 a negative vote abstentions 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.740
 while the assembly was developing 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.820
 lasted a brief 15 minutes in the 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.430
 congress 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.380
 the students faced the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.280
 police 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.600
 student driving 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.380
 mostly independent and of 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.280
 left does not want assembly and looks for a 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.200
 reform of the statute that increases the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.520
 representativeness of students in 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.620
 the governing bodies of the grape 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.840
 until Friday at 3 in the afternoon I 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.000
 could decide a change of venue if 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.889
 considered that in the national college 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.830
 of buenos aires were not given the 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.449
 security conditions and so I did 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.250
 summoning in the congress it seems to me that 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.979
 who carries all these elements does not 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.750
 I think he is not going to discuss or 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.879
 to dialogue I think that the mood is one 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.729
 just go to fight it seems to me that one 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.530
 can claim the right to claim what 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.539
 that one thinks that it is the right thing to do 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.340
 what you deserve beyond what 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.130
 think others and it 's unfortunate is 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.870
 sad I think many of those who 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.470
 there was at least that I saw and I doubt 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.389
 that they are university students I do not 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.389
 it seems he had not seen these things either 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.720
 you can discuss anything you 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.430
 can verbally discuss orally 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.870
 anything and you can not have a 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.370
 can be right can you argue 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.260
 on the basis of the statute if it 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.390
 modified or not in the case of rubén a 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.160
 liu he would be starting his second 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.040
 management period but it gives the feeling 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.360
 they are not students desks da 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.280
 the feeling that at least they are 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.740
 students that apply a logistics 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.620
 for violence, wear a rubber band 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.390
 talks about a prior logistics to take 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.340
 the initiative towards violence and 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.200
 cut an assembly that goes inside the 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.820
 democratic channels has been discussed that 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.470
 not all authorities 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.150
 universities that have a voice and votes 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.980
 to choose the rector had renewed 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.930
 his authorities and as a consequence this 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.450
 has gone over the statute and this 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.910
 is in the essence of what really 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.650
 It is debatable but in no way 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.390
 this justifies the level of 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.100
 confrontation in the morning and the 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.590
 break apart that this means cost 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.960
 that we also pay all of you all 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.940
 absolutely all unfortunately this 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.400
 happened in the vicinity of the congress 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.860
 Monday morning when the 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.150
 maximum authority in any case begins 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.150
 with its second management period
