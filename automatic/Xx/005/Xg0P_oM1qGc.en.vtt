this<00:00:59.460> year<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.879> changed<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.360> lower<00:01:00.540> motor

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840

mounts to steel instead of aluminum and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.520 
mounts to steel instead of aluminum and
that<00:01:03.360> actually<00:01:03.750> helped<00:01:04.020> the<00:01:04.110> comfort

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that actually helped the comfort
