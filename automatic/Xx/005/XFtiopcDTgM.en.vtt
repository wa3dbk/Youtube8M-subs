oh<00:00:00.060> good<00:00:00.650> okay<00:00:02.300> we'll<00:00:03.300> go<00:00:03.389> back<00:00:03.600> here<00:00:03.890> remember

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
oh good okay we'll go back here remember

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.970 
oh good okay we'll go back here remember
we<00:00:05.069> have<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.250> brachiocephalic<00:00:06.770> we<00:00:07.770> have<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
we have the brachiocephalic we have the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.400 
we have the brachiocephalic we have the
common<00:00:08.370> left<00:00:08.760> common<00:00:09.120> carotid<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:10.170> have

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
common left common carotid and we have

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.959 
common left common carotid and we have
the<00:00:11.210> subclavian<00:00:12.210> left<00:00:13.080> subclavian

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
the subclavian left subclavian

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.070 
the subclavian left subclavian
so<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:16.500> veins<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.670> veins<00:00:17.699> run<00:00:18.600> right

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
so the veins the veins run right

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.260 
so the veins the veins run right
alongside<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.920> arteries<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.119> only

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
alongside the arteries so the only

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.939 
alongside the arteries so the only
really<00:00:21.600> echo<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.960> half<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.380> stuff<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
really echo in half this stuff if you

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.140 
really echo in half this stuff if you
know<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> artery<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.550> probably<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
know the artery you probably know the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.279 
know the artery you probably know the
nearby<00:00:24.330> vein<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.390> we<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.570> quickly<00:00:27.779> figure<00:00:28.109> out

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
nearby vein so we can quickly figure out

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.790 
nearby vein so we can quickly figure out
which<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.800> brachiocephalic<00:00:29.220> vein

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
which is the brachiocephalic vein

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
which is the brachiocephalic vein
there's<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> video<00:00:32.099> cephalic<00:00:32.579> vein<00:00:32.850> right

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
there's the video cephalic vein right

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.069 
there's the video cephalic vein right
left<00:00:34.410> um<00:00:36.559> we<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.800> sit<00:00:38.100> there<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.430> go<00:00:38.899> we<00:00:39.899> can

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
left um we can sit there and go we can

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.950 
left um we can sit there and go we can
okay<00:00:40.770> common<00:00:41.280> carotid<00:00:41.600> here's<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.809> right

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
okay common carotid here's the right

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.310 
okay common carotid here's the right
common<00:00:43.320> carotid<00:00:43.440> left<00:00:44.430> common<00:00:44.789> carotid<00:00:46.430> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
common carotid left common carotid and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.720 
common carotid left common carotid and
then<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.469> course<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> jugular<00:00:50.520> veins

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
then of course we have the jugular veins

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
then of course we have the jugular veins
internal<00:00:51.510> jugular<00:00:51.809> goes<00:00:52.140> into<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> skull<00:00:52.800> or

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
internal jugular goes into the skull or

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.549 
internal jugular goes into the skull or
actually<00:00:53.850> comes<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> skull<00:00:54.600> external

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
actually comes out of the skull external

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
actually comes out of the skull external
those<00:00:55.860> externals<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.670> skull<00:00:57.079> internal

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
those externals of the skull internal

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.430 
those externals of the skull internal
external<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.559> internal<00:00:58.739> extra<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
external and internal extra so the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.969 
external and internal extra so the
jugulars<00:01:02.359> okay<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> vertebral<00:01:03.989> artery<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
jugulars okay the vertebral artery the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.789 
jugulars okay the vertebral artery the
vertebral<00:01:05.369> vein<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.720> don't<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> rib

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
vertebral vein we don't have the rib

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.060 
vertebral vein we don't have the rib
really<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.220> non<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.420> artery<00:01:09.890> will<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
really a non here the artery will go to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.810 
really a non here the artery will go to
the<00:01:11.189> subclavian

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the subclavian

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.480 
the subclavian
the<00:01:12.090> very<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:12.750> branch<00:01:13.080> after<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> common

this<00:01:16.950> goes<00:01:17.189> into<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> vertebra<00:01:17.939> we've<00:01:18.330> zoom

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
this goes into the vertebra we've zoom

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
this goes into the vertebra we've zoom
into<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> vertebra<00:01:19.200> deposit<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:19.950> blood<00:01:22.130> the

guess what the veins go right parallel
with<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:28.580> that's<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:30.090> are<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.650> arteries

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
with it so that's the are the arteries

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.979 
with it so that's the are the arteries
of<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> arm<00:02:34.190> okay<00:02:35.190> we'll<00:02:35.850> go<00:02:35.940> down<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.180> check

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
of the arm okay we'll go down here check

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.620 
of the arm okay we'll go down here check
out<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.290> your<00:02:37.590> des<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.950> follows<00:02:38.310> down<00:02:38.630> back

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
out the your des it follows down back

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.030 
out the your des it follows down back
here<00:02:39.900> behind<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.380> heart<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.860> thoracic

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
here behind the heart of the thoracic

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.270 
here behind the heart of the thoracic
aorta<00:02:41.930> then<00:02:42.930> at<00:02:43.080> Brant<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.560> comes<00:02:43.739> down<00:02:43.950> into

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
aorta then at Brant it comes down into

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.160 
aorta then at Brant it comes down into
the<00:02:44.400> abdominal<00:02:44.970> aorta<00:02:45.060> once<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.690> crosses<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
the abdominal aorta once it crosses the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.449 
the abdominal aorta once it crosses the
diaphragm<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.709> changes<00:02:47.070> names<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
diaphragm it changes names to the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.140 
diaphragm it changes names to the
abdominal<00:02:47.730> aorta<00:02:48.950> now<00:02:49.950> at<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.030> abdominal

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
abdominal aorta now at the abdominal

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.710 
abdominal aorta now at the abdominal
aorta<00:02:52.819> it's<00:02:53.819> got<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> few<00:02:54.360> things

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
aorta it's got a few things

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.290 
aorta it's got a few things
it's<00:02:54.959> got<00:02:55.230> here<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.980> celiac<00:02:56.430> trunk<00:02:56.550> it

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
it's got here the celiac trunk it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.920 
it's got here the celiac trunk it
branches<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:58.370> creates<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.459> celiac<00:02:59.790> drop<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
branches out creates a celiac drop the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.729 
branches out creates a celiac drop the
celiac<00:03:01.319> trunk<00:03:01.640> has<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:03.050> hepatic<00:03:04.050> artery<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
celiac trunk has a hepatic artery that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.740 
celiac trunk has a hepatic artery that
goes<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.160> liver<00:03:05.310> there's<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.150> patek<00:03:06.569> vein

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
goes to the liver there's a patek vein

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.729 
goes to the liver there's a patek vein
that<00:03:06.959> comes<00:03:07.170> from<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> liver

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
that comes from the liver

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.340 
that comes from the liver
it's<00:03:08.700> got<00:03:08.910> renal<00:03:09.269> arteries<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.840> go<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
it's got renal arteries that go to the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.910 
it's got renal arteries that go to the
kidneys<00:03:11.420> here<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.900> one's<00:03:13.079> better<00:03:13.260> renal

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
kidneys here this one's better renal

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.660 
kidneys here this one's better renal
artery's<00:03:14.250> renal<00:03:14.579> veins<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.360> kidneys<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
artery's renal veins to the kidneys and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.910 
artery's renal veins to the kidneys and
so<00:03:17.670> those<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> paddock<00:03:18.570> arteries<00:03:19.170> patek

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
so those are the paddock arteries patek

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.210 
so those are the paddock arteries patek

that's the selection now if we follow it
down<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> little<00:03:26.910> bit<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.630> have<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.989> superior

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
down a little bit we have the superior

down a little bit we have the superior
mesenteric<00:03:29.060> okay<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.269> is<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.870> model

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
mesenteric okay this is on this model

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.020 
mesenteric okay this is on this model
it's<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.620> little<00:03:31.860> one<00:03:32.010> sticks<00:03:32.370> out<00:03:32.519> there<00:03:32.760> comes

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it's a little one sticks out there comes

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.330 
it's a little one sticks out there comes
straight<00:03:33.329> off<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.660> artery<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.340> this

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
straight off the artery and this

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.520 
straight off the artery and this
supplies<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.359> blood<00:03:36.600> vessels<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.290> upper

inferior mesenteric artery comes down
off<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.709> here<00:03:45.709> now

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209

counterintuitive the gonad artery goes

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.830 
counterintuitive the gonad artery goes
to<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.320> testes<00:03:52.940> you'd<00:03:53.940> expect<00:03:54.359> testes<00:03:54.810> are

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
to the testes you'd expect testes are

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.069 
to the testes you'd expect testes are
way<00:03:55.079> down<00:03:55.260> here<00:03:56.180> you'd<00:03:57.180> expect<00:03:57.630> an<00:03:57.780> artery

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
way down here you'd expect an artery

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.229 
way down here you'd expect an artery
down<00:03:58.230> near<00:03:58.530> there

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
down near there

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.789 
down near there

note the tone an alarm because the
testes<00:04:02.220> started<00:04:02.640> inside<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.209> abdomen<00:04:03.600> and

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
testes started inside the abdomen and

extends down there's the left one here's
the<00:04:09.780> right<00:04:09.989> one<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.829> gonad<00:04:11.190> artery<00:04:11.609> is<00:04:11.730> this

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
the right one the gonad artery is this

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.300 
the right one the gonad artery is this
weird<00:04:12.269> one

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
weird one

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.289 
weird one
it<00:04:13.550> goes<00:04:13.730> really<00:04:14.000> far<00:04:15.549> that's<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.730> go<00:04:16.850> down<00:04:17.030> LRT

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
it goes really far that's to go down LRT

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.220 
it goes really far that's to go down LRT
um<00:04:18.940> then<00:04:19.940> we<00:04:20.120> can<00:04:20.269> move<00:04:20.420> down<00:04:20.660> here<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.959> the

um then we can move down here to the

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.490 
um then we can move down here to the

with<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.540> now<00:04:54.350> as<00:04:54.620> we<00:04:54.860> go<00:04:54.980> down<00:04:55.510> once<00:04:56.510> again

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
with it now as we go down once again

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.300 
with it now as we go down once again
just<00:04:57.050> like<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.320> arm<00:04:57.470> this<00:04:57.710> thing<00:04:57.919> changes

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
just like the arm this thing changes

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.070 
just like the arm this thing changes
names<00:04:58.580> goes<00:04:59.060> down<00:04:59.240> here<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.720> femur

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
names goes down here to the femur

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.490 
names goes down here to the femur
it's<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.410> femoral<00:05:00.800> artery<00:05:01.990> goes<00:05:02.990> here<00:05:03.230> past

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
it's the femoral artery goes here past

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
it's the femoral artery goes here past
the<00:05:03.680> populist<00:05:04.130> heel

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
the populist heel

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.510 
the populist heel
it's<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:04.850> popula<00:05:05.270> teo<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.870> then<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.130> splits

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
it's the popula teo and then it splits

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.870 
it's the popula teo and then it splits
to<00:05:07.790> become<00:05:08.530> posterior<00:05:09.530> tibial<00:05:09.890> anterior

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
to become posterior tibial anterior

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.740 
to become posterior tibial anterior
tibial<00:05:11.950> so<00:05:12.950> basically<00:05:13.430> just<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.300> same<00:05:14.330> thing

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
tibial so basically just the same thing

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.430 
tibial so basically just the same thing
