00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.949
 said when you want that the extensions 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.539
 of clip have a more average life or 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.699
 less than a year and a half if you use them 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.259
 regularly but with these cares and 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.630
 with what I'm going to tell you, it's going to be 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.519
 possible to lengthen them life as well as 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.960
 that they are healthier and brighter for more 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.060
 time especially if they are hair 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.350
 natural I feel that this video will be 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.330
 very useful to both girls who have 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.890
 extensions like those that do not have 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.170
 because they will realize if they take care of them 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.470
 would be his or just not so 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.470
 here we go 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.760
 I used a special site to 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.710
 extensions or good at least that 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.870
 have teeth separated or that is a 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.629
 comb this will help you prevent 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.600
 knots or that are mistreated brush the 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.399
 extensions gently and dry do not 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.320
 recommends brushing them when they're 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.440
 damp or wet because the hair is 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.900
 I would try to brush the always 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.509
 on a flat surface starting with 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.430
 the tips continuing with the means and 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.680
 finally in the top part that 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.659
 they have a pegadita to the clip be careful of 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.190
 they do not get caught too hard because I could 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.940
 climb the hair of the seam and 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.940
 detach what 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.570
 Nails natural hair extensions 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
 only when necessary is it not 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.220
 convenient that you do it every time 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.860
 you wear them always use warm water 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.650
 shampoo and conditioner in small 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.140
 amounts havana gently in a 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.740
 Container with water or directly under 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.900
 the key and rinse the very very well 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.950
 use a shampoo and conditioner 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.850
 moisturizers since they are soft in the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.850
 hair extensions 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.510
 the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.390
 maybe it will always be about the 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.760
 outdoor extensions if indeed 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.310
 you need to use the dryer 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.890
 use it with a medium heat or apply air 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.080
 cold and clear with protective products 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.930
 for heat so the extensions are 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.790
 will mistreat less when you use some 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.160
 electrical device in the extensions already 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.980
 be drier irons iron or pipes 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.870
 electric do not use their temperature 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.300
 maximum since it was applying excessive heat 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.730
 then mistreat them or even burn them 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.010
 always use always products 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.570
 protectors for the heat remember that 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.030
 Hair extensions should be 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.100
 completely dry before using them 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.810
 It is very important that you make sure that 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.000
 your extensions are natural hair 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.160
 so you can use them with devices 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.110
 electrical in case of being synthetic 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.010
 check the instructions well so that 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.010
 do not damage them 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.390
 applied a moisturizing treatment in 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.730
 hair extensions every five 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.960
 washed these treatments are applied 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.940
 about the extensions when 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.740
 they find wet they are played with water 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.130
 warm and then let air dry 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.130
 free 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.860
 If you choose the option to save them in 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.510
 the toilet drawer without its packing this 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.700
 it will cause knots to form and mistreat 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.830
 much faster so that's why 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.720
 It will be better than when you finish using them 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.670
 Brush them gently and keep them 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.210
 within a network or packaging in the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.210
 That they arrived 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.150
 If you want to dye the extensions, take it 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.830
 always with a professional stylist you 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.949
 recommends that they be dyed with a tone 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.600
 darker never in lighter shades and 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.250
 make sure the extensions are of 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.110
 natural hair and no extensions 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.979
 Synthetic is also not recommended 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.979
 decolorize 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.830
 and good girls decided vivid source 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.720
 of extensions is more or less like 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.370
 Take care of your natural hair even at 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.260
 sometimes they occupy even more fixed about 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.000
 all because the extensions are of hair 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.370
 natural, I understand that the 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.810
 synthetic last less or something like that but 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.430
 I really do not know much so if you 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.110
 you know something about synthetic extensions 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.610
 please comment me here below for 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.560
 then complete the video because I am 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.420
 an inexperienced with that stable serve 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.040
 a lot of tips so be careful my 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.840
 first extensions that I still have 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.550
 I bought them five years ago and they're in 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.680
 perfect state only that supporting the 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.600
 used because I take them a piece never the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.550
 use regularly but they kept 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.230
 healthy is still so bright ramÃ³n are 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.090
 as new unions that get damaged because it was 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.410
 little clip the cares me the 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.120
 they gave in the living room at the time 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.710
 I bought so I think that this 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.450
 will serve all of you for all 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.950

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.890
 take care they discovered if this is what 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.270
 yours or just how lazy you already know 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.740
