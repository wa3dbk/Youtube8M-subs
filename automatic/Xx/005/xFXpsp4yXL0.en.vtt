00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that 17 range all the Memphis Shades

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.169 
that 17 range all the Memphis Shades
kits<00:01:57.149> are<00:01:57.899> angle<00:01:58.740> adjustable<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.819> a<00:01:59.850> lot<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
kits are angle adjustable so a lot of

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.209 
kits are angle adjustable so a lot of
times<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.569> say<00:02:00.749> Matt<00:02:01.020> let's<00:02:01.469> say<00:02:01.619> he<00:02:01.829> fell<00:02:02.100> in

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
times I say Matt let's say he fell in

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.330 
times I say Matt let's say he fell in
the<00:02:02.310> 18<00:02:02.670> inch<00:02:02.909> range<00:02:03.530> 18<00:02:04.530> decides<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.159> we

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the 18 inch range 18 decides that we

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.129 
the 18 inch range 18 decides that we
only<00:02:05.490> make<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> sport<00:02:06.329> shield<00:02:06.539> category

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.139 
only make in the sport shield category

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:09.080 
only make in the sport shield category
so<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.859> a<00:02:08.160> lot<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.399> times<00:02:08.700> you're<00:02:08.880> not<00:02:08.910> going

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090
