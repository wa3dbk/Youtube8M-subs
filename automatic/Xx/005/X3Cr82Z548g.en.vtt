00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 is my game visca equal if suddenly 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.380
 I see tucked 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.380
 pupo 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.630
 to know if guys are welcome 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.180
 lining American this we are in 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.950
 a game called symbol timor e like 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.329
 you want to call it is a little bit that a 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.650
 subscriber you see that it just came out what 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.849
 have surely link to descriptions 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.289
 if it is not, the page is from kienholz 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.019
 where there are a lot of games these 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.279
 strange and good thing is that it has 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.419
 called attention because it's like a 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.879
 kind of bug with the adif this 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.320
 surely the miniature and I wanted 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.670
 play tell you good old man to see that 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.110
 I'm at the helm, I hope that 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.910
 I do not have many writings because I think that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.770
 it's the typical horror game that 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.270
 contains a lot of describe yes I think 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.820
 that I'm going to spend nothing so without more 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.899
 vou uu and vila look at each other fish 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 eat but I'm going to give 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.010
 crystallex and here the play is altered 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.920
 directly to see what I find says 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.390
 when people say that no pussy did not kill 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.430
 time or anything you should not put 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.140
 they love you in hell 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.260
 He loves you but you are not dead 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.690
 scam is going to fix this, okay, I think 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.490
 Mr. Timor is going to come for me says 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.229
 which gives the p to save the game 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.530
 I do the game, I will not do that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.680
 Suddenly, it's worth, it's worth taking it out of there 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.330
 is 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.910
 well we are in a kind of wedge and 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.410
 if these are on a wall we have 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.610
 different roads and I would say that as 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.500
 whenever he pulls forward he does not 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.030
 because it can be dt you find things 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.790
 strange we see here as there are 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.160
 half thrown things and hell we 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.869
 wants that 's a good excuse to 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.820
 hell loves you you 're not dead yet 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.100
 but we have a boy called rudder who 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.100
 is going to make you 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.100
 min 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 in this game or god this game 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.430
 or if it's been like that, here I can not 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.710
 enter no 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.900
 I do not know the shits that are going to leave me 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.670
 here but I come and I'm watching 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.180
 try to open a door that is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.180
 making a million 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.959
 this colorful game jumps trying 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.720
 open a door a wall is coming 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.099
 that has nothing else door here 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.270
 condis mystic gádor abismo is the wing 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.680
 the creeps 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.010
 it's worth it with a door to the one I've touched and 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.569
 like it has not opened 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.590
 so he has opened but I do not know how 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.780
 that my character has started to move 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.180
 from side to side Lord Rudder 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.670
 I do not want you to come for me I'm worth 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.040
 I am very well I am happy where I am 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.549
 people love me and here we see the typical 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.930
 of a damn key a damn key 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:39.519
 this is a key I think it is she is 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.079
 which is going to make me open 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.360
 the other door or decrease the same 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.690
 I'm super tense because he also heard 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.690
 Steps 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.190
 or if it has been good but has not reached 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.950
 I'm probably going to that line now 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:59.670
 like in an epic scare 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.200
 and here I am the blood walls of 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.760

 one 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.099

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.920

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.190

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.010
 in fact he keeps looking at me where I'm going 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.510

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.680

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.959
 sayings of the cojones 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.959

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.990

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.039
 game that I believe same that you are going to 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.280
 like everything is full of fears of 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.229
 these god of mine fuck the hitman if above 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.389
 my flashlight shines less than me 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.340
 I seem to have a turd in my hand 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.400
 because it is not fire a shit not 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.020
 I understand why they give me this internal 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.940
 nothing is really taking these 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.840
 dolls to me do not scare me as well 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.669
 I was saying I should be playing 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.530
 well my mini games my parkour 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.490
 quietly and not with these types of 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.830
 the balls that want to kill me 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.969
 oh my god I'm seeing he wanted a 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.889
 door 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.019
 sons of bitches put the sound on you 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.849
 right part so you think it's going 

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:10.849
 to go for you and see strange things 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.259
 in fact there are like two corridors 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:40.939
 Oh shit 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.390
 is the only person who passes it as the 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.390
 ass with these games 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.330
 let's see achieved the sun echoes 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.399
 determine this that I'm going to get to a 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.189
 part of the end what the fuck is this from 

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:02.469
 suddenly locked in a calf site of 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:05.300
 zero a square this is one is a ball 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:10.699
 it's a ball it's a ball it's a ball 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:12.710
 not only do not go 12 and not leave me peace 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.800
 I want to go I want to make it your 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.800
 friend 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.840
 7 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.250
 over in played of stripe in the way that 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.660
 carry a sign of balls and now it's over 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.670
 to catch that passion to shit 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.550
 do not take me out more than the doors this is 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.770
 the bathroom that may be in the bathroom because 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.180
 people come to shit and win and do 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.350
 things that are not done in a bathroom 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.510
 surely in this bathroom have a dead 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.160
 waiting to welcome me to the 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.960
 bathroom and they have to build a bathroom 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.340
 So I want to do who, because this son of 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.270
 bitch that as you can see there is someone stuck in 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.740
 the bathroom wants us to open the door 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.160
 because I think he needs us to pass him 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.160
 the toilet paper 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.340
 open the door 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.410
 so a lot of guys I'm going to leave 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.080
 here because I really screwed up the 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.040
 game has left me busted I hope that 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.120
 you liked it you know that leaving 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.980
 you like our comments of 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.390
 older a lot and that the game is 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.160
 call simón as well you are seeing in 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.620
 the title and surely to leave for the 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.120
 description so without further we see a 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.120
 big hug until the next 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.670
 A) Yes
