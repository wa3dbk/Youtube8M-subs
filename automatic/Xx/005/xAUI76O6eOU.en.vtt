00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
look natural alright so his cyber key

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.679 
look natural alright so his cyber key
power<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.960> least<00:02:01.290> he<00:02:01.439> stands<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.070> his<00:02:02.189> own

power at least he stands on his own
cyber<00:02:03.689> key<00:02:04.020> power

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
cyber key power

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.949 
cyber key power
I<00:02:09.259> see<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.280> plug<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.850> into<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.750> back

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
I see when you plug it into the back

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:22.720 
I see when you plug it into the back
here<00:02:15.980> these<00:02:16.980> blades<00:02:17.700> come<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:19.280> for<00:02:20.280> cutting

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
here these blades come out for cutting

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.400 
here these blades come out for cutting
it's<00:02:23.730> spring-loaded<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.959> every<00:02:25.290> other

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
it's spring-loaded like every other

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.970 
it's spring-loaded like every other
cyber<00:02:25.800> key<00:02:26.160> mechanism<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:30.110> they're<00:02:31.110> okay

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
cyber key mechanism and they're okay

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.120 
cyber key mechanism and they're okay
I<00:02:32.010> mean<00:02:32.550> how<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.630> use<00:02:33.959> these<00:02:34.290> when<00:02:35.040> you're

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
I mean how can you use these when you're

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.910 
I mean how can you use these when you're
flying<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> air

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.880 

I<00:02:41.480> don't<00:02:42.480> get<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:43.019> you're<00:02:43.380> gonna<00:02:43.500> Ram

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
I don't get it you're gonna Ram

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.140 
I don't get it you're gonna Ram
something<00:02:44.700> go<00:02:45.209> got<00:02:46.280> gangway<00:02:47.280> Burr<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.790> it's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
something go got gangway Burr and it's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.600 
something go got gangway Burr and it's
kind<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.480> more<00:02:51.690> useful<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.410> robot<00:02:52.830> mode<00:02:55.610> but

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
kind of more useful in robot mode but

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.930 
kind of more useful in robot mode but
not<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:58.010> animal<00:02:59.010> mode<00:03:01.190> all<00:03:02.190> right<00:03:02.370> let's<00:03:02.670> go

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
not on animal mode all right let's go

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.259 
not on animal mode all right let's go
into<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:04.069> transformation<00:03:09.440> as<00:03:10.910> we've<00:03:11.910> seen

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
into the transformation as we've seen

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.569 
into the transformation as we've seen
before<00:03:12.540> with<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.170> boot<00:03:13.410> leg

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.449 

it's<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.700> pretty<00:03:18.090> simple<00:03:18.530> transformation<00:03:19.530> just

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
it's a pretty simple transformation just

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.390 
it's a pretty simple transformation just
detach<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.390> back<00:03:21.600> leg<00:03:21.930> from<00:03:22.260> here<00:03:22.650> from<00:03:23.100> this

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
detach the back leg from here from this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.330 
detach the back leg from here from this
peg<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.150> was<00:03:24.359> there<00:03:24.680> then<00:03:25.680> bring<00:03:26.010> him<00:03:26.100> down

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
peg that was there then bring him down

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.660 
peg that was there then bring him down
around<00:03:28.340> forward<00:03:29.690> didn't<00:03:30.690> bring<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:31.049> down

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.880 

turn<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:36.000> facing<00:03:36.600> front<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:40.230> turned<00:03:40.650> this

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
turn this facing front that turned this

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.210 
turn this facing front that turned this
around<00:03:41.810> bring<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.989> beak<00:03:43.260> up<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:46.220> that

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
around bring the beak up that that

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.259 
around bring the beak up that that
there's<00:03:47.670> his<00:03:47.880> feet<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.950> we're<00:03:50.160> halfway<00:03:50.400> there

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:01.480 

there's<00:03:54.269> always<00:03:56.930> that's<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.079> little<00:03:58.350> too<00:03:58.709> high

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:09.140 

then<00:04:02.490> you<00:04:02.670> bring<00:04:02.910> down<00:04:02.970> his<00:04:03.360> robotic<00:04:04.140> arms<00:04:08.150> and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
then you bring down his robotic arms and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:23.290 
then you bring down his robotic arms and
bring<00:04:09.990> out<00:04:10.170> his<00:04:10.440> head<00:04:17.870> go<00:04:20.060> there<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.359> have

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
bring out his head go there we have

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.390 
bring out his head go there we have
Cybertron<00:04:25.760> brimstone<00:04:27.560> also<00:04:28.560> called<00:04:28.860> Tara
