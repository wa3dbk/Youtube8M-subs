00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.730 
this is your chance to hit them
now<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.460> time<00:01:23.730> he<00:01:24.000> does<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.420> lot<00:01:24.480> that<00:01:25.410> I

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
now this time he does it a lot that I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.190 
now this time he does it a lot that I
thought<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.730> was<00:01:26.850> hard<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.120> dodge<00:01:27.300> well<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
thought that was hard to dodge well I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.500 
thought that was hard to dodge well I
sure<00:01:28.410> didn't<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.610> time<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.090> makes<00:01:30.330> it

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
sure didn't but this time it makes it

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.180 
sure didn't but this time it makes it
even<00:01:30.630> harder<00:01:30.900> by<00:01:31.200> shooting<00:01:31.590> multiple<00:01:31.770> ones

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
even harder by shooting multiple ones

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.670 
even harder by shooting multiple ones
you<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.700> keep<00:01:32.880> moving<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.390> Dodger<00:01:33.680> just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you just keep moving the Dodger just

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
you just keep moving the Dodger just
keep<00:01:34.890> moving

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.990 

then<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.080> last<00:01:40.260> ones<00:01:40.560> huge<00:01:40.890> send<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.880> them

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
then the last ones huge send it to them

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.080 
then the last ones huge send it to them
that<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.510> he<00:01:42.630> won't<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.170> won't<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.500> yet
