prior to having this work done I

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.700 
prior to having this work done I

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
definitely felt self-conscious about my

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.640 
definitely felt self-conscious about my
smile<00:05:31.370> and<00:05:31.610> as<00:05:31.790> you<00:05:32.000> age<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:32.660> particular

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
smile and as you age in particular

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.920 
smile and as you age in particular
there's<00:05:34.370> something<00:05:35.120> that's<00:05:35.360> happening<00:05:35.780> with

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
there's something that's happening with

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.180 
there's something that's happening with
your<00:05:36.080> mouth<00:05:36.260> that<00:05:36.800> changes<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:38.660> and<00:05:39.620> it

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
your mouth that changes and and it

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.170 
your mouth that changes and and it
really<00:05:40.520> does<00:05:41.060> show<00:05:41.090> your<00:05:41.870> age<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.650> think<00:05:43.180> that

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
really does show your age I think that

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.890 
really does show your age I think that
in<00:05:44.770> having<00:05:45.770> my<00:05:46.220> teeth<00:05:46.490> straightened<00:05:47.270> there's

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
in having my teeth straightened there's

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.770 
in having my teeth straightened there's
there's<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:48.620> physical<00:05:48.800> part<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.550> changes

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
there's the physical part that changes

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.060 
there's the physical part that changes
but<00:05:50.780> there's<00:05:50.960> something<00:05:51.320> inside<00:05:51.500> that

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
but there's something inside that

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.890 
but there's something inside that
changes<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:52.760> you're<00:05:52.910> not<00:05:53.090> even<00:05:53.300> aware<00:05:53.540> of

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
changes that you're not even aware of

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.170 
changes that you're not even aware of
and<00:05:54.110> that<00:05:54.140> has<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.650> do<00:05:54.800> with<00:05:54.830> your<00:05:55.130> confidence

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
and that has to do with your confidence

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.500

know you look fine

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.670 
know you look fine
