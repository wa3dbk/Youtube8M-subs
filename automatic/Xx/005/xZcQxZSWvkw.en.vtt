brightening versus skin lightening now

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
brightening versus skin lightening now
those<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.470> two<00:01:04.830> words<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.640> often<00:01:06.030> used

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
those are two words that are often used

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
those are two words that are often used
interchangeably<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.470> they're<00:01:07.619> quite

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
interchangeably but they're quite

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
interchangeably but they're quite
different<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> they're<00:01:09.390> different

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
different and they're different

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.020 
different and they're different
I<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.619> physiologically<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
I think physiologically but there was a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.429 
I think physiologically but there was a
bit<00:01:12.150> different<00:01:12.330> legally<00:01:13.020> aren't<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.260> down

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
bit different legally aren't they down

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.380 
bit different legally aren't they down
there<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:13.619> skin<00:01:14.430> brightening<00:01:14.939> versus

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
there because skin brightening versus

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.359 
there because skin brightening versus
skin<00:01:15.659> lightening<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> travel<00:01:17.070> around<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
skin lightening when I travel around the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.310 
skin lightening when I travel around the
world<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.450> often<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.930> skin

Leitner's<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.549> does<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.119> mean<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
Leitner's what does that really mean and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.289 
Leitner's what does that really mean and
is<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.560> different<00:01:23.009> than<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.189> skin<00:01:23.580> brightener

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
is that different than a skin brightener

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.210 
is that different than a skin brightener
which<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.229> talk<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.040> talk<00:01:26.070> about

which we talk about when we talk about

chroma white TR excellent so what what
is<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> difference<00:01:29.340> between<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.700> truth<00:01:29.970> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
is the difference between the truth of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
is the difference between the truth of
the<00:01:30.210> matter<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.259> all<00:01:31.439> comes<00:01:31.680> down

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.180 
that came about is marketers realized
that<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.790> public<00:03:42.030> knew<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.410> brightening

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
that the public knew that brightening

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.270 
that the public knew that brightening
could<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:44.910> similar<00:03:45.620> equated<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.650> lightening

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
could be similar equated to lightening

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.789 
could be similar equated to lightening
and<00:03:47.459> whitening<00:03:48.209> without<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.290> cosmetic

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
and whitening without the cosmetic

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.920 
and whitening without the cosmetic
companies<00:03:50.220> calling<00:03:50.819> them<00:03:51.030> Leitner's<00:03:51.750> and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
companies calling them Leitner's and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.479 
companies calling them Leitner's and
whiteners<00:03:52.319> which<00:03:52.530> then<00:03:52.799> means<00:03:53.069> they<00:03:53.340> are

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
whiteners which then means they are

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.069 
whiteners which then means they are
drugs<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.030> they<00:03:54.090> can<00:03:54.269> only<00:03:54.389> use<00:03:54.569> hydroquinone

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
drugs and they can only use hydroquinone

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.140 
drugs and they can only use hydroquinone
so<00:03:55.799> if<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.010> wanted<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.370> go<00:03:56.549> down<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.940> road<00:03:57.120> of

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
so if you wanted to go down the road of

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.330 
so if you wanted to go down the road of
using<00:03:57.630> an<00:03:57.750> alternative<00:03:58.410> which<00:03:58.650> we<00:03:58.950> did<00:03:59.220> at

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
using an alternative which we did at

and the way companies have skirted the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.259 
and the way companies have skirted the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
what's really exciting to me as a

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.420 
what's really exciting to me as a
biochemist<00:05:29.990> because<00:05:30.320> up<00:05:30.710> till<00:05:30.890> five<00:05:31.130> years

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
biochemist because up till five years

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.540 
biochemist because up till five years
ago<00:05:31.730> all<00:05:32.120> we<00:05:32.180> had<00:05:32.780> in<00:05:33.080> our<00:05:33.500> capability<00:05:34.310> as

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
ago all we had in our capability as

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.820 
ago all we had in our capability as
cosmetic<00:05:35.120> formulators<00:05:35.690> was<00:05:36.140> to<00:05:36.320> address<00:05:36.530> the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
cosmetic formulators was to address the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.920 
cosmetic formulators was to address the
tyrosinase<00:05:37.400> enzyme<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:38.180> was<00:05:38.300> step<00:05:38.570> one<00:05:38.780> and

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
tyrosinase enzyme that was step one and

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.250 
tyrosinase enzyme that was step one and
two<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.710> multi-step<00:05:40.640> whole<00:05:41.210> process<00:05:42.110> of

making pigment we now have about six

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.560 
making pigment we now have about six
seven<00:05:45.680> different<00:05:45.950> sites<00:05:46.460> of<00:05:46.820> attack<00:05:47.150> that<00:05:47.450> we

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
seven different sites of attack that we

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.480 
seven different sites of attack that we
can<00:05:47.750> go<00:05:47.870> after<00:05:48.080> and<00:05:48.590> that's<00:05:49.040> what<00:05:49.310> we've<00:05:49.460> been

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
can go after and that's what we've been

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.790 
can go after and that's what we've been
focusing<00:05:50.090> on<00:05:50.240> with<00:05:50.419> these<00:05:50.540> alternatives<00:05:51.260> some

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
focusing on with these alternatives some

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.740 
focusing on with these alternatives some
of<00:05:51.950> these<00:05:52.070> like<00:05:52.310> the<00:05:52.450> glamoured<00:05:53.450> in<00:05:53.570> the

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
of these like the glamoured in the

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.140 
of these like the glamoured in the
active<00:05:54.200> fraction<00:05:54.680> in<00:05:54.800> liquorice<00:05:55.220> it<00:05:55.520> competes

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
active fraction in liquorice it competes

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.380 
active fraction in liquorice it competes
with<00:05:56.450> the<00:05:56.960> enzyme<00:05:57.470> on<00:05:57.830> the<00:05:58.280> substrate<00:05:58.850> so<00:05:59.060> it

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
with the enzyme on the substrate so it

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.200 
with the enzyme on the substrate so it
binds<00:05:59.810> up<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.320> enzyme<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.550> tyrosine

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
binds up the enzyme so that the tyrosine

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.760 
binds up the enzyme so that the tyrosine
the<00:06:02.510> amino<00:06:02.720> acid<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.140> leads<00:06:03.500> to

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
the amino acid that leads to

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.650 
the amino acid that leads to
pigmentation<00:06:04.490> cannot<00:06:05.060> bind<00:06:05.330> with<00:06:05.540> that

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
pigmentation cannot bind with that

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.720 
pigmentation cannot bind with that
enzyme<00:06:06.050> so<00:06:06.290> we<00:06:06.380> stopped<00:06:06.710> it<00:06:06.890> there<00:06:07.070> we<00:06:07.580> use

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
enzyme so we stopped it there we use

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.360 
enzyme so we stopped it there we use
niacinamide<00:06:08.360> in<00:06:08.810> glucosamine<00:06:09.500> that<00:06:09.710> prevents

those hormones with UV exposure so the

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:08.059 
those hormones with UV exposure so the
