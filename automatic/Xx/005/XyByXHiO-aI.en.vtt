00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.140
 talk separately about dlc to assassin's 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.019
 creed spiers buzzed all this clay 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.570
 and dressed and the cry of freedom we begin 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.149
 of course as you already understood with dlc 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.940
 both avile not to limit touched and both 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.690
 well then let's talk about it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 do and when i started the game i saw 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 Immediately similar gameplay to me 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.309
 this you can gameplay from the third part 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.940
 that is the gameplay that is me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.850
 like well, of course immediately became 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.340
 play because I knew that short on 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.609
 In fact, the game is not a game for a long time. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:04.070
 Bill is all very short and I think about running 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.450
 right now, his quick and important word 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.310
 my words now was exactly run 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:16.280
 because it's gone 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:19.670
 I just ran really I sat down pressed 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.660
 run button ran into the game in about 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.650
 an hour of it so that I remember 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.900
 the wood of this finish is nothing at all 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.390
 nothing to post pleased me graphics 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.070
 I was pleased to be surrounded by me 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.789
 pleased with the gameplay itself 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:44.930
 but your mother is 1 hour and 1 hour 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:48.770
 understand jogging run bitch by 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.800
 Know the location is not the original 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.930
 assassin's gameplay creed no it you 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.690
 just run here that's really squeezed 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.580
 With the button, many can run when even 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.590
 what are there moments somewhere somewhere hypotension 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.300
 it seems that she started here 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.580
 now you see everything on your screen 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.799
 further just really run all 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.320
 the game and it suddenly ends cool 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.739
 cool game suddenly ends rather 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.080
 what 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.750
 and to the storyline still just run out 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.830
 play all 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.030
 but I donâ€™t know it actually seemed to me 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.490
 actually gave such in my opinion 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.870
 because pay to do and bills 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.090
 money 15 dollars even at least yah 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.019
 so funny 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.180
 just laughter like the ugliness of paying death 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:41.340
 the sheer 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.459
 so yes now we talk about hellsing not 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.670
 and cry freedom yes let's give about it 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.730
 do or and what i want to say 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.590
 Regarding I cry freedom then this 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.590
 bezus didn't seem like much 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.970
 You have already looked clearly my opinion she 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.050
 original opinion and fastened input 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.810
 will be disappointing you understand 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.540
 what is the curve of the transaction that there 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.050
 how many sit there for three hours before it 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.030
 you can come in with the original gameplay 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.800
 these strange ships were but you just 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.860
 fucked up 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.870
 so i say i did not pass it did not pass 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.640
 why because it seemed to me 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.190
 Nainu days we pam boring and just pay 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.330
 Now this is my opinion I do not 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.250
 enjoyed doing everything and the servant up 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.920
 The purest fourth part is just 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.010
 played one of the characters part 4 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.970
 and it's far from cool because for that 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.920
 do everything you have to pay too 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.040
 ride for it and the dress would not 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.230
 you just need to sit down and play without 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.480
 problems might even play with 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.320
 pleasure but play bitch in one and the 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.890
 same game for some left 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:10.220
 clumsy missions and pay for it 15 or 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.930
 how many are there 12 dollars guys then 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.880
 really brute force is just brute force 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.289
 yubisoft went off hundred percent and here 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.780
 such is my opinion on 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.670
 is the secret of freedom 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.260
 and what is my opinion that is in both cases 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.270
 and because maybe some result 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.820
 let yes what worship or software 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.410
 okhuevshy fag I have an opinion because 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.139
 really but it is generally some kind for 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.260
 wildest bust to produce such 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.820
 you understand, you have to have it for money 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.130
 need to have a conscience 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.050
 because damn if you don't have 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.000
 on conscience can not do this to let 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.260
 if you entered the market at dow do 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.540
 good even dlc 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.300
 that's just call of duty who knew 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.980

 You understand not compare cards in call 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.220
 of duty and just a new location in 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.690
