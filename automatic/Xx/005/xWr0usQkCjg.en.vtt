00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.490 
hundred thousand views and about 2500 or
something<00:03:34.370> like<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.489> subscribers<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.510> I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
something like that subscribers and I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.370 
something like that subscribers and I
actually<00:03:37.280> got<00:03:37.639> partnered<00:03:38.090> by<00:03:38.209> tgn<00:03:38.780> another

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
actually got partnered by tgn another

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.460 
actually got partnered by tgn another
another<00:03:39.970> company<00:03:40.970> one<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.180> me<00:03:41.359> but<00:03:41.600> TGN<00:03:42.260> was

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
another company one of me but TGN was

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.979 
another company one of me but TGN was
probably<00:03:43.190> better<00:03:43.519> because<00:03:43.609> they<00:03:44.269> were<00:03:44.389> more<00:03:44.630> I

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
probably better because they were more I

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.479 
probably better because they were more I
guess<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:47.200> could<00:03:48.200> get<00:03:48.319> more<00:03:48.470> benefit<00:03:48.859> benefits

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
guess I could get more benefit benefits

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.190 
guess I could get more benefit benefits
from<00:03:49.790> TGN<00:03:50.269> that<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.510> would<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.019> other

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
from TGN that I would in the other

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.280 
from TGN that I would in the other
network<00:03:52.130> so<00:03:52.609> i<00:03:52.670> won't<00:03:52.850> be<00:03:52.910> CGN<00:03:53.359> but<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.870> waited

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
network so i won't be CGN but I waited

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.379

couldn't partner that channel because i

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.520 
couldn't partner that channel because i
