00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.230
 good guys the truth is that I have left 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:06.000
 amazed with the amount of questions 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.980
 that you have been sending me I have already 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.620
 hundreds of questions in the email and I 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.850
 they keep sending so I've decided 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.410
 put it in different blocks today by 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.420
 example let's talk about questions 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
 I will answer questions of the program 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 how has my experience been in the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.869
 program then I've had so many 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.029
 questions and I've decided to group them in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.340
 groups we started with the acne if 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.539
 andreas and vicente lorenzo that I 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.550
 question that when we recorded the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.619
 good programs the programs are already 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.910
 recorded and had to be recorded with a 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.590
 a little bit in advance because of course 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 it was live to record the tests 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.239
 by teams and all that is needed 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.300
 enough time then it is recorded with 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 in advance and then they ask me what 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.220
 who you like better than the jury of the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.930
 three judges with who has been 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.050
 with which he has felt more secure 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.760
 trust and support I believe that the three 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.340
 have been able to demonstrate those qualities in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 me that really so much for a few things or 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.050
 for others both samantha and pepe like 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.850
 jordi after all they made us 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 feel sure of ourselves though 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.140
 at first it did not look like it and well I 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.400
 I think that there is a sense of trust with the three 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.810
 If I had to stay with one 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.860
 surely I would stay with claudia fit 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.870
 where I would probably stay with Jordi 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.760
 I may have stayed with Jordi for the 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.190
 topic that has helped me a lot to know 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.420
 manage my nerves until the quiet 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.160
 and especially to know how good 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.229
 which is a contest and nothing more than 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.150
 you have to take it as such then it comes 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.880
 Miriam and she asks me to teach me how to cook 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.990
 the Japanese spring clear man I'm 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.490
 thinking even about doing a post about 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.630
 the Japanese spring so have the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 mind jordi asks me what I think 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.430
 have won the course the kitchen of him 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.810
 cordon bleu 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.200
 the truth is that it has been an experience 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.160
 unforgettable and that I will never forget 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.880
 things as they are 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.590
 it seems to me an experience worthy of not 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.600
 forget that he will be with me always and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.520
 is going to be something fantastic the course of 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.500
 cordon bleu it is going to be fantastic to me 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.030
 question of the idea that if I got angry with 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.830
 the steam what happened to the fish 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.360
 man the truth is that what happened with 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 the fish was funny but neither did 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.370
 upset things as they are no longer will it be 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.110
 in chorus then at least 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.320
 Monica asks me if I was planning to arrive 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.180
 so far the truth is that he did 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.030
 principle I sincerely fought for 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.470
 name first and then as I went 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.610
 advancing the programs and what truth that 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 I was getting a little more confident 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.860
 but I never imagined getting so far 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.260
 the truth tells me that sofía that with 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.430
 who made the richest in the program with 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.680
 the program has taken me very well 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.530
 with everyone but yes that is true 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.320
 that there have been people like efrén like 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.820
 clear as native that yes true that 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.830
 It takes me much better with them then 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.830
 they are with whom more friends do
