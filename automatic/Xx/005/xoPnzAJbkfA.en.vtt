00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.110
They used to be mad at me because
I noted everything that happened,

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:19.340
everything.

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:23.330
There were songs also,
each one of us had one.

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.138
How was your song?

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:28.052
- Mine?
- Yes.

00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:31.335
It was something like this:

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:34.924
"Pepe's father has a bar,
which is full flies,

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:37.799
that bar stinks,
it's way worse than Zito's feet,

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.996
there you poop on your plate,
and your eat in the chamber-pot!"

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:46.538
Then I used to get mad,
and they loved it.

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:48.985
There was a song like this:

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:53.824
"Menga slobberer!"

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.134
Because Menga used to slobber
whenever he was eating.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.066
Once he was served...

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.126
we were in a hotel
during one of our tours,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.987
and when we went to different places,
we used to order simple things,

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:13.105
and he ordered an omelet with peas.

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:15.407
We were wearing a tie,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.230
it was beige and it had
a small green pearl,

00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:23.961
a green pellet.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.261
After the lunch,

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:33.313
his pearl was gone,
he had eaten it along with the peas!

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.684
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:21.964
Are you okay?

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:23.378
- It's a pleasure to see you.
- The pleasure is mine!

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.558
Is it your birthday today?

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:25.099
How are you?

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.827
It is, I'm turning eighty.

00:02:27.828 --> 00:02:29.762
Happy birthday!

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.737
I've been booked twice!

00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:33.830
How are you?

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:36.932
I'm going to send him
to the bench, alright?

00:02:36.997 --> 00:02:39.742
He was not used to stay there!

00:02:41.116 --> 00:02:42.675
How are you?

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:44.819
You're getting older,
aren't you, Macia?

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:46.423
How are you doing?

00:02:46.424 --> 00:02:48.241
- I'm eighty now.
- Eighty?

00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:49.771
I've been booked twice.

00:02:49.772 --> 00:02:51.674
But you can still play!

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:55.171
You can take free-kicks,
at least!

00:02:55.172 --> 00:02:57.207
- Can you do that?
- I can!

00:03:39.797 --> 00:03:41.209
See you!
