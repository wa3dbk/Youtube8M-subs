 franck bertÃ³n 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.440
 we have the calendar application 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 which is very similar to the one that incorporates s10 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.510
 today we are going to learn how to forget an appointment 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.990
 for this we click on the application 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.480
 and we look 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.700
 the day 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.440
 where we're going to sign up for an event we're going to choose 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.270
 4 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.940
 February 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.630
 once chosen the day we click 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.870
 in it more than appears in the corner 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.110
 Upper right 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.110
 agreement 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670
 in that it seems 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.460
 fields 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 to fill 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.370
 let's start filling what we want we will use the keyboard 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.250
 we can also 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.610
 use 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 the place 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
 from momo sanz in this event we click 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.670
 get fat 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.070
 and we already have o puntano 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.610
 that we are going to install in zaragoza 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.220
 let's set 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.680
 the hours 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.470
 for this we click on the field 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.059
 discarded 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.259
 and we can move 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.539
 using your finger between 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.539
 different pure and minutes 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.120
 let's oppose 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.819
 that at 6 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.769
 we will start 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.299
 this couple 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.079
 and approximately we are going to finish 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.079
 at 8 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.979
 it's not a story 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.639
 if the task was a whole day 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.119
 we can activate the option through 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.759
 with which it would not be necessary 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.049
 change hours 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.049
 in our case we are interested in the hours we are going to leave the hours 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.069
 filling all this we click on save 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.039
 If we want to be notified, we will activate 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.079
 the notices five minutes 15 minutes before 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.029
 let's set 30 minutes before we click on save the process 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.389
 It is always the same 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.549
 and if we need to add some note this event we can use the field 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.409
 of notes to add any reminder 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.409
 our case we do not need anything else we give to save 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.039
 we give or what there is 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.849
 and they turn off percent 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.059
 we position ourselves on day 4 we will see 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:29.999
 our new event 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.689
 for six in the afternoon 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.750
 if we wanted to avoid the easy as selecting it 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.699
 it opens we click on 'edit 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.149
 and we have the possibility to eliminate it 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.769
 can change for example the hours we're going to put you that we started an hour 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.649
 before 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:51.999
 we click on save 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.029
 that does not stay 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.419
 we go back to the calendar 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.199
 and our house of wind has been totally modified 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:02.939
 very simple to use
