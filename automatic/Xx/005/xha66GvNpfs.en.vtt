00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
case on the phone so actually separates

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.460 
case on the phone so actually separates
out<00:00:20.100> you've<00:00:20.670> got<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:20.939> surfer<00:00:21.539> polycarbonate

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
out you've got this surfer polycarbonate

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.160 
out you've got this surfer polycarbonate
outer<00:00:22.820> as<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.269> see<00:00:24.390> they<00:00:24.539> lock<00:00:24.960> together

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
outer as you can see they lock together

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410 
outer as you can see they lock together
quite<00:00:25.590> well<00:00:25.769> which<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.039> always<00:00:26.220> good<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.300> then

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
quite well which is always good and then

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
quite well which is always good and then
you've<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> TPU<00:00:28.590> inner<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.220> actually

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
you've got a TPU inner this is actually

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.040 
you've got a TPU inner this is actually
still<00:00:29.699> quite<00:00:29.849> rugged<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.449> thick<00:00:30.689> though<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
still quite rugged and thick though so

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.860 
still quite rugged and thick though so
it's<00:00:31.199> not<00:00:31.289> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> psycho<00:00:31.800> over<00:00:32.009> time<00:00:32.870> we'll

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it's not going to psycho over time we'll

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.790 
it's not going to psycho over time we'll
just<00:00:34.020> take<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> s4<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.890> pop<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.710> you

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
just take the s4 and pop it in so you

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
just take the s4 and pop it in so you
can<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.280> alone<00:00:38.550> fits<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.090> nice<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
can see that alone fits on nice and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.690 
can see that alone fits on nice and
firmly<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> idea<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.550> just

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
firmly and then the idea is you just

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700 
firmly and then the idea is you just
take<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.030> part<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.570> lock<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
take this part and lock it on and the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.920 
take this part and lock it on and the
six<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> locking<00:00:44.700> points<00:00:47.629> clip<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> in

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
six kind of locking points clip that in

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.590 
six kind of locking points clip that in
place<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.489> start<00:00:50.969> by<00:00:51.090> showing<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
place so just start by showing you the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.029 
place so just start by showing you the
back<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.020> see<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.320> quite<00:00:52.440> taut<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
back you can see it's quite taut on the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.740 
back you can see it's quite taut on the
camera<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.430> LED<00:00:53.550> flash<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.270> doesn't<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.600> any

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
camera and LED flash that doesn't in any

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
camera and LED flash that doesn't in any
way<00:00:54.840> interfere<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> actual

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
way interfere with the with the actual

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
way interfere with the with the actual
camera<00:00:56.820> itself<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.539> obviously<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> good

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
camera itself which is obviously a good

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.380 
camera itself which is obviously a good
thing<00:00:58.520> there's<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.730> carrier<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> loud

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390

runs all the way around the front of the
phone<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.650> quite<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> firm<00:01:05.159> design<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
phone it's quite a firm design which is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.640 
phone it's quite a firm design which is
which<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> doesn't<00:01:07.140> sag<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.590> the

which is good it doesn't sag at the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.520 
which is good it doesn't sag at the
bottom<00:01:07.920> lock<00:01:08.070> some<00:01:08.340> looser<00:01:08.580> cases<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.530> show

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
four impact points in the corners you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.630 
four impact points in the corners you
also<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.619> extra<00:01:16.979> point<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.400> it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
also got this extra point here so it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
also got this extra point here so it
locks<00:01:17.909> over<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.450> such<00:01:18.689> I'll<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.560> quickly

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
locks over as such I'll just quickly

videos and then you want to do like that
and<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> folds<00:01:34.470> away<00:01:34.650> nice<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.220> easily<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and it folds away nice and easily it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.670 
and it folds away nice and easily it
does<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.390> stash<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.079> when<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> lock<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

does actually stash up when you lock it
in<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.950> well<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> noise<00:01:39.180> case<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> does

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
in as well so it's a noise case it does

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.210 
in as well so it's a noise case it does
actually<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.140> some<00:01:40.320> grip<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.009> cond

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840 
of while these run down here your
fingers<00:01:43.530> tend<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> fit<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.159> between<00:01:44.399> them
