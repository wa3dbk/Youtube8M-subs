00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.429
 i have the nintendo wii u console her 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:13.259
 see in the premium pack 32 gb and what at 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.170
 premium pack is still there 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.609
 nintendo land gets so directly 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.289
 Game with delivered there are still the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.279
 basic variant there but there 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
 unfortunately no game 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.390
 because you must first define one with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.240
 nintendo we have a couple of cool ones 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.189
 mini-games that are really cool 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.769
 and I'll show you each one then 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.370
 case also but here now only times 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.680
 the unboxing here at the side once 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.489
 Listed in the box is console 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.399
 game pad the various cables of the stands 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.800
 and the game that pack now 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.660
 she could also see that here no 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 wiimotes are so if they are with 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.420
 you want to play remotely then you have to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.440
 In any case, get additional 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.140
 but we still have many of you 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.750
 ne wii and can then just the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.420
 Take control with the wii 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.330
 came together and the content is in two 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.479
 cartons divided we have here once 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 the console and the gamepad and then 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.390
 here again the cables and the game 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.430
 also, of course, the manual 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 console we have the black version 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 nicely packed here so no here 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 fingerprints on it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.200
 Here's a look we 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.729
 then right now but now 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 of course we come to the special feature 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.170
 the ju this is the controller of the very 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.960
 is great as you can see 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 and if she does not know what's up 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.299
 yours is a big controller 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.130
 with touch screen 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.040
 then you have this in hand has the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.009
 analog sticks the buttons control cross 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320
 and here in the middle a resistive 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.750
 Touchscreen also a stylus 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.979
 but I show you then the gamepad on 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.869
 every case a bit 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.030
 in more detail we have here now 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.319
 even the unboxing shows you what else in 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.939
 the pack in it is okay 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:19.019
 we have here first the power supply that 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:28.840
 In any case , it's pretty big 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:29.620
 very much cable the power adapter and then 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.209
 we also have that here 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:41.290
 Charger for the gamepad weakness 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.370
 is not if this is mini usb is aiming 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.549
 but at first sight it is 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.959
 Not 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:52.840
 here still standing feet for the console to 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.579
 what to read manuals thw that will 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.730
 I think at a game console none 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.930
 that it definitely is very easy too 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.579
 to join 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.680
 a hdmi cable more feet and feet 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.109
 Stand for the service game pad and 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.769
 of course, the sensor bar the how 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.030
 they know from the normal way and that 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.340
 It was already more than in the box 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.079
 not inside 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.120

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.849
