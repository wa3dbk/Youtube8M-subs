00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
metal detectors enough I'm going to be

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.529 
metal detectors enough I'm going to be
trying<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.319> out<00:00:55.379> today<00:00:56.179> right<00:00:57.179> now<00:00:57.329> it's

as you can tell just the tip is gone
that's<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.389> it<00:02:57.420> otherwise<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:58.440> looking

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
that's about it otherwise it's looking

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.300 
that's about it otherwise it's looking
pretty<00:02:58.980> good<00:02:59.159> I<00:03:00.920> guess<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> little

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
pretty good I guess it is a little

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.420 
pretty good I guess it is a little
smaller<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:04.430> oh<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:09.000> know<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.299> don't<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
smaller but oh you know if you don't I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.379 
smaller but oh you know if you don't I
would<00:03:11.430> say<00:03:11.639> this<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.109> this<00:03:13.109> is<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:15.180> right

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
would say this is this is the the right

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.119 
would say this is this is the the right
hand<00:03:15.629> digging<00:03:15.840> tool<00:03:16.169> there's<00:03:16.470> nothing<00:03:16.889> really

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
hand digging tool there's nothing really

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.970 
hand digging tool there's nothing really
that<00:03:17.250> beats<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.299> although<00:03:18.840> I'm<00:03:19.049> kind<00:03:19.889> of

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
that beats it although I'm kind of

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.300 
that beats it although I'm kind of
curious<00:03:20.310> how<00:03:20.699> this<00:03:20.940> will<00:03:21.739> how<00:03:22.739> this<00:03:23.010> will

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
curious how this will how this will

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.180 
curious how this will how this will
change<00:03:24.180> my<00:03:24.480> mind<00:03:25.609> but<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:27.709> guess<00:03:28.709> we're<00:03:28.949> ready

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
change my mind but I guess we're ready

round<00:03:43.799> this<00:03:44.040> tree<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.720> think<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.989> old<00:03:46.849> wheel

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
round this tree I think this old wheel

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:54.949 
round this tree I think this old wheel
hub<00:03:48.680> wagon<00:03:49.680> wheel<00:03:49.829> hub<00:03:50.069> that's<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.519> cut<00:03:53.959> and

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
hub wagon wheel hub that's a cut and

there's<00:05:33.060> a<00:05:33.120> tree<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:38.400> Chipmunks

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
there's a tree that it the Chipmunks

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.590 
there's a tree that it the Chipmunks
there<00:05:39.120> they<00:05:39.330> have<00:05:40.039> some<00:05:41.039> some<00:05:41.340> place<00:05:41.600> there's

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
there they have some some place there's

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.270 
there they have some some place there's
a<00:05:42.750> red<00:05:43.350> wool<00:05:43.680> that<00:05:44.669> they're<00:05:44.880> finding<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:46.280> I'm

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
a red wool that they're finding and I'm

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.360 
a red wool that they're finding and I'm
hoping<00:05:47.669> it's<00:05:47.820> an<00:05:47.940> old<00:05:48.090> Indian<00:05:48.240> blanket<00:05:49.370> that's

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
hoping it's an old Indian blanket that's

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.080 
hoping it's an old Indian blanket that's
stuffed<00:05:50.760> up<00:05:50.970> in<00:05:51.150> one<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.389> these<00:05:51.570> trees<00:05:51.900> and

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090
