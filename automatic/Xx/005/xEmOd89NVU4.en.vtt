00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.380
 Now, my little friends, I'm the fairy, nothing's going 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.670
 to love the surprise that I bring you today 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:13.120
 viral already appears around here to those who 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.740
 you know is the lightning-friendly crane 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.990
 mcqueen in the Disney movie of 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.900
 karts have you seen that I 'm so cool 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.860
 I have really wheels to watch how 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.610
 spin at speed 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.470
 back forwards good good you 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.960
 I'm going to show what I have here because 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.780
 although this seems a fairy houses is 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.090
 much more is a very complete life 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.750
 so that we learn to distinguish 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.860
 antonyms is to say the opposite words 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.200
 sure when we see it inside 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.850
 you will understand it better I love how it is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.290
 open this story look has a kind 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.150
 Velcro that opens and closes it for 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.550
 close it up we put it like that and to open it 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.190
 we separate it a little and the wheels is 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.970
 what I like to see the most 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.730
 four is that he has four good then in 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.199
 the cover has a mate but inside a 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.390
 lots of very interesting things that 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.520

 I like and share with your friends

 so we will be more to play good then 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.080
 let's start now to see the inside of 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.970
 this pasta story to the original 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.690
 we open the first page 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.600
 and it's what I read if you want mate prefers to go 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.710
 Reverse when your engine is approaching 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.710
 it sounds back 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.570
 and then here on the next page 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.500
 tells us that fence is the opposite and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.480
 it means the opposite you see close by 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.090
 because we see it here very closely and 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.010
 away because you see there very tiny very 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.080
 tiny because we see because it is far 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.790
 it's not that it's smaller than this 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.030
 car actually have the same size 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.620
 but as one is closer to the other 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.610
 It seems that this one is smaller but not 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.410
 it weighs nothing 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.930
 you see well up close and far 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.370
 I for example see badly from afar and I have 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.960
 to wear glasses when I want to see 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.240
 far 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.180
 we continue with the story 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.620
 maybe mate is a bit rusty but 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.580
 lightning in many things has helped 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.299
 and then it teaches us that oxidized is 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.239
 how is it wrong t is the opposite of 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:32.450
 gleaming that is like this ray mcqueen 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.299
 you have seen mate is already rusty is 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.060
 old years have passed for him and that 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.799
 it is nevertheless noted as lightning mcqueen 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.659
 it's like when we're going to wash the car 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.280
 that comes out bright and shiny that 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.010
 is a mirror you can look at the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.280
 practically 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.370
 You see how many things we learn with faces 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.159
 well, we continue 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.020
 if a friend needs it mate there to be 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:03:02.270
 his word side will tow him 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.940
 long is the opposite shortly you see that a 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.620
 Sometimes there are very long things that are very long and 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.080
 there are things that are shorter and more 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.390
 little ones, as long is the opposite of 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.810
 short and this is taught to us by the book of 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.780
 karts and here we see mars towing 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.780
 your lightning friend mcqueen with the cable 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 amate loves to have fun and every day 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.020
 he likes to laugh and laugh and you see that this 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.950
 this page is very dark because 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.160
 because it's night 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.980
 then the book teaches us what day it is 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.989
 the opposite last night for the day is when 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.440
 It's sunny and we can go to the park to school 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.270
 to the beach to eat outside and at night 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.650
 we have to do to sleep because there 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.410
 darkness you can not do anything outside 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.050
 because you can not see anything, everyone goes 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.819
 to sleep and the lights go out and up 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.300
 that you do not feel again and you have to be 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.300
 at home 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.079
 to mate being cheerful is the most normal 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.349
 but when his friends leave, he feels sad 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:06.250
 and look bad how sad kissing the 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.250
 characters of all 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.690
 you know what is the opposite sad thing 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.129
 that does not say it clear happy sometimes we 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.639
 they say something we do not like and we 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.079
 we are as sad as him but the most 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.419
 nice is when they tell us something that we 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.650
 love and we are happy 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.650
 happy that is the same 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.290
 mate watches his friend pass if he drives 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.290
 fast lightning will win 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.849
 what is the opposite 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.849
 Quick 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.729
 slow very well you have guessed right 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.379
 yes 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.710
 radio magician and the truth is that it is very 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.710
 Quick 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.159
 we are already finishing the book 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.780
 look from here we have to amate inside 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.490
 a helicopter because his big dream was 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.780
 fly because in the end he has managed to fly 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.580
 since he has gotten inside the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.930
 helicopter but let's read the last 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.210
 page 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.490
 the helicopter lifts mate into the sky 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:14.669
 leaves ground and rises very high in its 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:16.500
 high flight is the opposite below true 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.120
 that there are people who are very high very 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.520
 high and other people who are smaller 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.040
 Well, one thing is high and another thing is 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.290
 low that is your opposite 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.330
 and we have finished the book now what 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.190
 we close and we see again the wheels that 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.770
 I like them 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.360
 we closed the Velcro up here 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.259
 we turn them 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.259
 and soon 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.540
 we have learned a lot of antonyms or 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.010
 be of opposite note with this book of 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.050
 houses that also serves to play 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.830
 to see how it goes like this is that it's a real 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:55.010
 I love car I hope that I have 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.900
 liked this book of karts us 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.890
 we see in the next videos of oils 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.930
