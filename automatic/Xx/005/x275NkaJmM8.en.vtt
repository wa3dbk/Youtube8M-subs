 after nice of the whole world were gathered to the same mission for a 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.860
 international piano competition 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 after a final between the 12 18 years on January 29 and 30 it's the 19 28 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.310
 years who faced each other last weekend 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.320
 in this category 54 candidates were selected and six were 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 selected for the final according to different criteria 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:31.330
 the girl 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.080
 give an overall score on the benefit 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.159
 sound quality 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.110
 the quality of interpretation the quality of the transmitted motion 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.880
 this year toddlers is also the story of each year's 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.880
 equally musical personalities that stands out from each camp 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.730
 created in 2006 the lagny sur marne piano competition became international 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.409
 two years ago 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.409
 its success is due to several factors 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.000
 the quality of the jury and the medef is important because the teachers 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.070
 who send their students are consented 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310
 a serious track 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.110
 compared to the game which is very important of course I think that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.939
 the show to death is a very welcoming city convenient to 1 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.160
 to reach a level of airports not far from paris 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.940
 mediametry also of strikers is important believe that the organization is 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.040
 also warm thanks to a very important volunteer committee who 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.240
 exists since the creation of the contest for six years 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.430
 and I think all this to create a little bit of a mood a 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.000
 atmosphere around the contest of the enemy who was beginning to say this 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.420
 that it is said that he wanted his little ones 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.009
 and so that things being said to each other we receive more and 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.920
 more files since there for the international competition have recorded 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.960
