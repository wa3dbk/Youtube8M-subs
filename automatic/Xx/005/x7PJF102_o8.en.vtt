here<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:40.170> messed<00:01:40.439> around<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.799> this

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
here I just messed around with this

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.310 
here I just messed around with this
memory<00:01:41.579> card<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.750> been<00:01:42.960> having

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
memory card because it's been having

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.700 
memory card because it's been having
some<00:01:43.590> issues<00:01:44.780> they<00:01:45.780> only<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> save<00:01:46.320> files<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
some issues they only to save files that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.850 
some issues they only to save files that
have<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.340> could<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
have I don't know if you could see it

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.069 
have I don't know if you could see it
I'm<00:01:49.860> super<00:01:50.189> smash<00:01:50.430> brothers<00:01:50.610> melee<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
I'm super smash brothers melee and the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.600 
I'm super smash brothers melee and the
resonable<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> system<00:01:55.100> that<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
resonable for the the system that up so

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
resonable for the the system that up so
see<00:01:57.509> try<00:01:58.350> zooming<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:58.979> bit

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.800 

yeah<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> don't<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.640> whether<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.570> being

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
yeah I don't know whether if it's being

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.090 
yeah I don't know whether if it's being
a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:03.960> blurry<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.440> whatever<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:04.800> anyway

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
a little blurry or whatever but anyway

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.260 
a little blurry or whatever but anyway
the<00:02:05.310> point<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:09.530> when<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.250> play<00:02:11.760> games

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
the point is that when you play games

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.410 
the point is that when you play games
and<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.140> save<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.440> GameCube<00:02:14.040> game<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.670> your<00:02:15.210> Wii

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and you save a GameCube game on your Wii

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.750 
and you save a GameCube game on your Wii
like<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.110> play<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> game<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.340> game<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.640> your

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
like if you play a game to game on your

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.700 
like if you play a game to game on your
Wii<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.480> put<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.930> your<00:02:18.960> GameCube<00:02:19.650> memory

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
Wii and you put in your GameCube memory

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.450 
Wii and you put in your GameCube memory
card<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.430> save<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.760> game<00:02:20.970> on<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:22.500> you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
card and you save a game on it if you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.280 
card and you save a game on it if you
switch<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.330> back<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.750> playing<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.170> your

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
switch it back to playing on your

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.210 
switch it back to playing on your
GameCube<00:02:25.920> console<00:02:27.530> there<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> don't<00:02:28.740> know<00:02:28.950> what

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
GameCube console there I don't know what

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.340 
GameCube console there I don't know what
it<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.490> exactly<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.180> something<00:02:30.780> about<00:02:30.900> it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
it is exactly but something about it

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.949 
it is exactly but something about it
will<00:02:32.190> corrupt<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.450> had<00:02:33.570> saved<00:02:33.840> it

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
will corrupt it because you had saved it

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.910 
will corrupt it because you had saved it
on<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> Wii<00:02:34.380> I'm<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:36.690> entirely<00:02:37.170> sure<00:02:37.440> why<00:02:37.860> it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
on the Wii I'm not entirely sure why it

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.770 
on the Wii I'm not entirely sure why it
does<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.220> but<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.380> think<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.500> true<00:02:40.709> because

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
does that but I think it's true because

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.940 
does that but I think it's true because
the<00:02:42.780> memory<00:02:43.050> card<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.440> should<00:02:43.620> ensuring

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the memory card that I should ensuring

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.870 
the memory card that I should ensuring
you<00:02:44.040> right<00:02:44.250> now

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
you right now

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.510 
you right now
had<00:02:45.840> my<00:02:46.080> most<00:02:46.290> important<00:02:46.680> files<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.370> and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
had my most important files on it and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.510 
had my most important files on it and
got<00:02:47.640> corrupted<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.709> believe<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.220> because

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
got corrupted and I believe it's because

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.449 
got corrupted and I believe it's because
I<00:02:50.550> did<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:51.030> because<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.690> had<00:02:52.410> after<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.220> week

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
I did that because I had after the week

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.300 
I did that because I had after the week
came<00:02:53.670> out<00:02:53.850> sort<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.209> playing<00:02:54.450> um<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:56.130> know

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
came out sort of playing um you know

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.949 
came out sort of playing um you know
some<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.580> my<00:02:56.640> GameCube<00:02:57.060> games<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:57.450> my<00:02:57.570> wii<00:02:57.720> like

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
some of my GameCube games on my wii like

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.920 
some of my GameCube games on my wii like
mail<00:02:58.230> i<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.709> example<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.540> bunch<00:03:00.840> more

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
mail i for example on my on a bunch more

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.760 
mail i for example on my on a bunch more
so<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:02.209> didn't<00:03:03.209> need<00:03:03.390> meta<00:03:03.810> play<00:03:04.320> my<00:03:04.470> game<00:03:04.620> key

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
so I didn't need meta play my game key

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.040 
so I didn't need meta play my game key
even<00:03:04.980> though<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.580> know

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
even though I you know

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.810 
even though I you know
bills<00:03:07.530> mainly<00:03:07.920> because<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.190> space<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.640> didn't

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
bills mainly because of space I didn't

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.130 
bills mainly because of space I didn't
have<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> space<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.300> hook<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.600> back<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.930> so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
have the space to hook it back up so

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.800 
have the space to hook it back up so
let's<00:03:10.650> play<00:03:10.739> number<00:03:10.950> my<00:03:11.160> wii<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.640> melee<00:03:12.540> auto

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
let's play number my wii and melee auto

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.540 
let's play number my wii and melee auto
seems<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.500> pretty<00:03:13.709> much<00:03:13.769> after<00:03:14.160> everything

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
seems like pretty much after everything

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.699 
seems like pretty much after everything
to<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:14.850> even<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.050> start<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.500> game<00:03:16.530> so

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
to do even if you just start the game so

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.430 
to do even if you just start the game so
I<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:18.360> one<00:03:18.540> day<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> had<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:18.989> went<00:03:19.200> back

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
I think that one day I had to went back

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.990 
I think that one day I had to went back
to<00:03:19.650> wanting<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.980> play<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.340> my<00:03:20.430> GameCube

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
to wanting to play on all my GameCube

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.180 
to wanting to play on all my GameCube
and<00:03:21.239> that's<00:03:22.019> what<00:03:22.200> corrupted<00:03:22.590> memory<00:03:22.860> cart

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
and that's what corrupted memory cart

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.190 
and that's what corrupted memory cart
because<00:03:23.360> when<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.420> really<00:03:24.660> think<00:03:24.900> about<00:03:24.989> it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
because when I really think about it

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.990 
because when I really think about it
memory<00:03:26.010> cards<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.370> didn't<00:03:26.640> get<00:03:26.700> corrupted

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
memory cards that didn't get corrupted

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.080 
memory cards that didn't get corrupted
in<00:03:27.269> mine<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.810> didn't<00:03:28.769> save<00:03:29.070> any<00:03:29.280> games<00:03:29.580> on<00:03:29.880> them

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
in mine I didn't save any games on them

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
in mine I didn't save any games on them
while<00:03:30.810> being<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.140> my<00:03:31.290> wii<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:32.660> what<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.690> did<00:03:33.840> to

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
while being on my wii so what I did to

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.759 
while being on my wii so what I did to
be<00:03:34.230> smart<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.600> use<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:37.019> GameCube<00:03:37.680> memory

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
be smart was to use that GameCube memory

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.310 
be smart was to use that GameCube memory
card<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.489> have<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.910> there<00:03:39.030> now<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.330> only<00:03:39.870> be

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.710 
card that I have in there now to only be
used<00:03:41.070> on<00:03:41.310> my<00:03:41.550> wii<00:03:41.790> because<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.330> already<00:03:42.600> got

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
used on my wii because it already got

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.100 
used on my wii because it already got
corrupted<00:03:42.870> twice<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.880> after<00:03:44.880> Korra<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.810> can

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
corrupted twice and after Korra it can

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.990
