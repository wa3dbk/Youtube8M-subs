okay that's easy put it down and just
flip<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.800> shouldn't<00:00:34.800> come<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.239> well

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

now comes up on wood because it has the
grooves<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> which<00:00:44.670> releases<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.539> air<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
grooves in it which releases the air it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
grooves in it which releases the air it
will<00:00:46.350> eventually<00:00:46.800> come<00:00:46.920> off<00:00:47.160> does<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.090> desk

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
does not come off on any granite or hard

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.420 
does not come off on any granite or hard
surface<00:00:59.520> such<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.359> granite<00:01:01.020> does<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.070> work<00:01:02.219> on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
surface such as granite does not work on

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
surface such as granite does not work on
cork<00:01:02.850> board<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> said<00:01:04.439> wood<00:01:04.799> does<00:01:05.640> not

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
cork board are you said wood does not

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.510 
cork board are you said wood does not
work<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.150> plastic<00:01:06.900> does<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.560> work<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.950> rounded

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
work on plastic does not work on rounded

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.899 
work on plastic does not work on rounded
objects<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.580> fairly

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
objects so this is a fairly

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.090 
objects so this is a fairly
straightforward<00:01:12.600> mount<00:01:12.810> only<00:01:13.229> used<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.799> like

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
straightforward mount only used for like

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.969 
straightforward mount only used for like
windows<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.820> things<00:01:15.049> but<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.290> works<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.830> it's

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
windows and things but it works and it's

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.289 
windows and things but it works and it's
a<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.250> amount<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.090> use<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:20.299> let's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
a good amount that you can use so let's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.060 
a good amount that you can use so let's
go<00:01:21.450> over<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.960> structure<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.920> all

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
go over the structure of this it's all

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
go over the structure of this it's all
plastic<00:01:23.340> except<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
plastic except for this which is just

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
plastic except for this which is just
rubber<00:01:25.830> stuff<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.590> sturdy<00:01:30.920> very<00:01:32.030> very

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
rubber stuff it's very sturdy very very

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.190 
rubber stuff it's very sturdy very very
sturdy<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.950> platform<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.840> where<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.960> put

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
sturdy the platform is where you put

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.740 
sturdy the platform is where you put
your<00:01:37.229> GoPro<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.040> got<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> regular<00:01:38.700> clip<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
your GoPro it's got the regular clip so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.490 
your GoPro it's got the regular clip so
that's<00:01:39.900> easy<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:41.909> loosen<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.110> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that's easy and you can loosen this and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.389 
that's easy and you can loosen this and
you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.329> move<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.860> rotate<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
you can move like this to rotate the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.170 
you can move like this to rotate the
platform

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
platform

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.420 
platform
so<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.900> can<00:01:50.110> get<00:01:50.260> different<00:01:50.440> angle<00:01:50.770> shots<00:01:51.070> and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
so you can get different angle shots and

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.790 
so you can get different angle shots and
to<00:01:51.730> add<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.240> when<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.110> unscrew<00:01:53.620> this

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
to add on to that when you unscrew this

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.150 
to add on to that when you unscrew this
bottom<00:01:54.220> screw<00:01:54.640> here<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:56.080> can<00:01:56.260> now<00:01:56.410> put<00:01:57.130> a

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
bottom screw here you can now put a

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.090 
bottom screw here you can now put a
different<00:01:57.610> angle<00:01:58.260> for<00:01:59.550> the<00:02:00.550> whole<00:02:00.940> arm<00:02:02.100> so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
different angle for the whole arm so

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.900 
different angle for the whole arm so
that<00:02:03.400> is<00:02:03.850> good<00:02:05.130> put<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.250> straight<00:02:06.460> back<00:02:06.670> up

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.390 

so<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:09.940> GoPro<00:02:10.530> clips<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:14.709> as<00:02:14.860> easily<00:02:15.070> as

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
so the GoPro clips in just as easily as

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.270 
so the GoPro clips in just as easily as
you<00:02:15.430> would<00:02:15.730> think<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:22.920> when<00:02:23.920> you're<00:02:24.040> putting

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
you would think so when you're putting

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.570 
you would think so when you're putting
it<00:02:24.459> on<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> surface<00:02:24.970> don't<00:02:25.959> just<00:02:26.280> plop<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.310> on

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
it on a surface don't just plop it on

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.720 
it on a surface don't just plop it on
there<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.800> not<00:02:29.950> wanting<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.370> come<00:02:30.550> up

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
there this is not wanting to come up

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.449 
there this is not wanting to come up
there<00:02:31.209> yeah<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:32.590> don't<00:02:32.739> just<00:02:32.980> plop<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.280> on

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
there yeah just don't just plop it on

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.010 
there yeah just don't just plop it on
