00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.009
 Welcome to planet 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.200
 today we are going to make a bucket and a shovel 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.180
 with a plastic bottle for it 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.049
 we're going to need a bottle of 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.309
 Large plastic or small insulating tape 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.309
 scissors and some bookbinders 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.200
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.689
 bottle and make an incision by the 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.500
 line that we see here is where the 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.320
 side lines 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.020
 we can use a knife asking 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.560
 help the parents or with scissors and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.560
 we cut 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.670
 with this part we would have made the cube 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.670
 and with this part we are going to make the shovel 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 for this we are going to cut until 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.910
 let's get to this line 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.030
 where the lines start again 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.030
 lateral 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.320
 we can also do this with a 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.280
 tiny bottle so that the shovel 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.280
 be more chiquitita 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.180
 to do the shovel what we're going to do 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.180
 is to cut a little bit of here 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.900
 and we would have the shovel and the bucket if 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.360
 we want the cube to have that which 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.440
 we would have to do is cut out of this 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 part that has left us a strip 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.020
 of the teacher that you want 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.840
 be your handle 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.200
 do not forget 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.579
 dry the bucket very well because if not 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.840
 now when trying to put the tape 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.840
 insulator would not stick 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.080
 now we take the insulating tape of 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.780
 color that you like the most and the first thing that 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.420
 let's do is 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.670
 wrap the edges because we can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.320
 be small and so that we do not 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.850
 cut and we would do the same with the shovel 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.920
 when we have it, we would have one thing 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.550
 like this one 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.010
 and the cube would not have stayed like that 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.590
 we in the area have put some 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.460
 binders is simply drilling 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.870
 the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.870
 and place it 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.780
 so we could move it from one place to another 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.849
 If you do not want to leave it fixed 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.849
 you just hit it 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.870
 and this is our craft today 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.090
 see you later planetaries if you liked 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.760
 this video as he did not study up 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.739
 I like you can also
