00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello today we will not you 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.559
 talk about the geo pro tried trial 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.360
 the report indicator engaged the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.370
 hi tech brand certainly the most 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 known from the market so it's a very small 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.270
 case 2 cm by 3 as you can 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
 see it that is fully molded into 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.609
 plastic that does not fear water 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.140
 nor the humidity 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.449
 you can ride in any weather 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 no problem this little case goes all 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 simply that you indicate the report 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.890
 who is engaged on your motorcycle during 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.720
 that you are rolling so 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.630
 finished trying to pass the seventh 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.200
 with this case or would not have it anymore 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.020
 worry then lilly has mainly two 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.180
 models first of all the gip rodez is this 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.640
 So that's the model that is reserved 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.570
 to the latest motorcycles 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.100
 why simply because they 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.170
 are equipped with a diagnostic socket must 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.340
 so the gie comes to connect on the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.680
 taking of the Gnostics of your motorcycle 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 the information goes through the cable so he 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.430
 only does the read it sends no 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 signal to your photo and report 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.579
 engaged comes on the box 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.940
 So that's a little bit 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.350
 fifteen minutes 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.390
 you have everything you need to go 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.640
 with our slow crises to secure the cable 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 and the small double- sided to stick it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 simply level your meter 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 as we can see we're going to say a quarter 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.330
 time is half an hour without problems 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.530
 according to you have the second model 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.090
 for motorcycles a little bit more 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.950
 old or not equipped with 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.380
 taken from the Gnostics so this is the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.110
 gip rouis style then on this one 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 you have on one side the small display 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.729
 here on the other hand the beam 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.000
 so the beam is very simple to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.520
 ascend 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 you have a catch that gets on the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.930
 taking the speed sensor of your 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.270
 motorcycle that's click clack that there are these plug 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 and play and then you have two 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 So small son a son who logs 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.460
 on your diet son so there is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.500
 nothing to cut orassou which you have 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.750
 small clubs to connect the wire and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.220
 put in proper contact and you 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 so on some models it depends 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.520
 marks a son to put 12 volts 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.799
 that's all so it shows up we're going 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.360
 say in a little longer a 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.600
 half an hour an hour depending on whether you are 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.009
 a good handyman or not we are asked 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.570
 often how it is setting itself 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 very very simple so the first thing 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.630
 to do is to watch if it is in mode 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.369
 learning or if there is already 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 parameterized so for that just 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.810
 put the ignition on and watch how 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.569
 He counts 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.890
 1 2 3 4 5 6 he counts at the place so 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.500
 when comtal king that means he 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.780
 already has a setting in mind so 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.060
 normally there is nothing to do there 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.500
 only to roll here if ever when 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 you roll you realize that the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.130
 speeds are poorly set and you 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.560
 so you want to be able to reprogram it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.630
 it must be reset to zero 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.250
 so the method is simple you put 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.010
 contact and when the giro arrives on 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.430
 four five or six you cut the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.230
 contact 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.470
 now you're six times 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.799
 if I can contact a little hard 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:49.890
 up so the second time in second 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:52.209
 times fourth times some times 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.920
 sixth time normally it should be 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.330
 good the gie pro will have to be reset 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.380
 so how was she 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.799
 because when I'm going to put the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.330
 contact 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.170
 instead of counting to the place 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.220
 6 he will count upside down 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.830
 6 5 4 3 2 1 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.660
 here and after the little she who 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.640
 blink it means learning so 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.110
 learning so here I like it 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.030
 reset to zero there is more than 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.019
 set up now we're going to go 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.120
 the setting itself 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.769
 so there everything is ready the flashes 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.600
 so the giro is in learning mode 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.280
 I just have to start the bike 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.910
 then the gie pro will ask me to 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.010
 shift the gears 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.660
 one by one to memorize them so 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.640
 when he will not ask me to spend the 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.799
 speeds so I will pass them and I 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.319
 will hold the gas between 2000 and 3000 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.790
 rounds or so that will allow him 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.530
 in fact to memorize the speed that's 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.120
 it's the only thing to do then 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.120
 first thing I start the bike 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.700
 start 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.340
 COQUILLAT 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.739
 ask me to spend one 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.830
 I pass one and I come between two 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.830
 and three thousand rounds 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.830
 and 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.490
 here 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.340
 now gives it Wednesday three thousand 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.340
 words 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.170
 maurice edu 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.170
 3 at the paz 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.430
 ago 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.229
 Yes 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.380
 because and it's m 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.560
 I could but when on the bike 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.560
 mohamed amor 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.560
 here is the setup of the gie pro is 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.580
 over it's absolutely all there is 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.580
 to do it's very simple
