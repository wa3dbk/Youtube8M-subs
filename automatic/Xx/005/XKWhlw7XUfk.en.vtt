00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.110
 red and you did signs and wonders 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.009
 persecutors you threw in the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 depths like a stone in 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.080

 night to light them the way by 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.190
 where they had to go and on the mountain of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.630

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.940
 straight judgments true laws and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.430
 good statutes and commandments and they 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.620
 you ordered the holy Sabbath for you 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.080
 and by the hand of Moses your servant 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.570
 prescribes this statutes command and 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.910

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.190
 hungry and in their thirst for sacks of water from 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.440

 own the land by which you raise 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.580
 hand and you swore that you would give it more 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.860
 serious and our parents were 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.990
 proud and hardened their service and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.120
 they did not obey your commands not 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.830
 they wanted to hear and they did not remember your 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.350
 wonders that you had done with them 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.240
 before they hardened their service and in 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.670
 his rebellion thinking about putting caudillo 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.200
 to return to his servitude but you 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.630
 you are god that you forgive 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.910
 merciful and pious slow to anger and 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.470
 great in mercy because not the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.450
 leave this one 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.790
 also when they made themselves for the hill 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.010
 of casting and they said this studies that 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.010
 he brought you up from Egypt and they committed 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.380
 great abominations you with everything 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.080
 His many mercies do not abandon them 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.150
 even in the desert the column of 9 does not 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.470
 He left them by day to guide them 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.840
 down the road 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.300
 the pillar of fire to light them the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.770
 path by which they had to go and 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.200
 You sent your good spirit to 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.290
 teach them and do not withdraw from your hand your 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.120
 mouth and water you gave them for their thirst 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.280
 sustains this forty years in the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.380
 desert of nothing had 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.350
 need your clothes do not 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.600
 they grew old and their feet did not swell and 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.180
 You gave them kingdoms and peoples and 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.090
 distributed by districts and owned the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.030
 earth wishes the land of the king loft and 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.020

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.530
 stars of the sky and brings them to the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.260
 land of which you had told your 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.360
 parents who were to enter to possess her and 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.459
 the children came and they owned the land 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.920
 and humiliated I spent in front of them to the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.990
 dwellers of the country to the Canaanites the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.480
 which you delivered in your hand and to your 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.030
 kings and the peoples of the earth for 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.190
 that they did of them as they wanted and 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.739
 they took fortified cities and land 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.980
 fertile and inherited houses full of everything 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.530
 well cisterns made vineyards and olive groves and 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.270
 many fruit trees ate 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.290
 they satiated and delighted in your great 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.240
 goodness 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.490
 but they gave you guidance and you 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.620
 rebelled against you and threw out your law 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.450
 behind their backs and killed your 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.490
 prophets who were protesting against them 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.220
 to convert them to you and they did 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.350
 great abominations then the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.870
 You handed over to your enemies the 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.210
 which afflicted them but in time 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.700
 of their tribulation they cried to you and you 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.230
 from the heavens you gave and according to your 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.330
 great mercy you sent them 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.820
 liberators so that you save them in de 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.950
 hand of his enemies but once he 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.870
 they had ace they did the wrong thing again 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.730
 in front of you whereby the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.250
 you abandoned brother of his enemies that 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.650
 they dominated them but they came back and clamored 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.350
 again to you and you from the heavens 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.410
 you heard and according to your mercies many 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.540
 Sometimes the alive ones warn you 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.640
 they went back to your law plus they 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.830
 They filled with arrogance and did not see your 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.020
 commandments but they sinned against your 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.600
 judgments which if the man did 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.090
 in them he will live they rebelled 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.030
 they hardened their service and did not listen 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.980
 you stand for you for many years and 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.590
 testify this with your spirit through 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.300
 of your prophets but they did not listen 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.640
 whereupon you gave them into the hand of 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.860
 the people of the mountains more for your 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.200
 many mercies you did not consume 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.740
