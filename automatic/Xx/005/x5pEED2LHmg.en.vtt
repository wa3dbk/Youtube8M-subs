 It's a feeling like that, so it 's a feeling like a decent rabbit ASCII mode 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.190
 The memory is not made because the hard disk also has no buffer. 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.280
 The only thing behind is Scream Every 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:30.150
 Ten gorgeous Japanese characters 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.150
 In other words , it can hold 300 bits of memory 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.550
 Even if you say what you can do, firstly from a

 Cool and various 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:56.250
 After that, when you press the button normally, it will become such a letter 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:00.870
 While standing on this pressure sensitive plate 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.909
 If you press the button , that male button will be capitalized 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.210

 My head hurts because this was the most awkward 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.689
 Because various things are happening
