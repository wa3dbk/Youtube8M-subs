00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.780
 while every painter awards an elitist bridge and the big differences 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.340
 between these two Argentina but what the playful potential possesses 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.019
 also the philosophy gives us have big winners Â»brought open 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.400
 Defender and a man of it with 700 game of the favorite initially too 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.209
 to destroy 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.960
 and that is then largely built in Argentina 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.500
 Hardly a lot of space It was hard but he needed to be ranked 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 Played for 18 minutes 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 the first chance but decimated 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.989
 one in seven 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.070
 he waits for some of the regulars a luxury problem but he sees it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 ready 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.420
 44 7 points 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.920
 like Ackermann the place 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.630
 he never gave up 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.620
 was embossed now to beech 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.750
 for a break 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.670
 second round Greece progress on this own counterattack 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.740
 Meadow no chance 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.950
 and they got shortly after the break that's Samaras after 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.400
 Error of the thefts is Samaras 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 "That's what's going on by the only striker 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.140
 had in the square 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.260
 Of course I have a single action Argentina also dominated in the second 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.400
 Passage qualifies 30 but 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.970
 It did not want to get out of the game 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.050
 the standard situation Dirk Maass 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.800
 it costs you are loud 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.390
 Martin Willich LS is that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.390
 That's what we say at this World Cup 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 el-sabeh Chile's reporter made his own extra shot 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.480
 5 1 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.910
 this task especially Messi 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.850
 finally wanted his first wm-goal scored 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.470
 he wanted it by force four minutes before the end 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.170
 that's what we are at the SCP 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.410
 two days 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.800
 by 20 4% for the first time captain of the specially for guests or wanted 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.990
 also until the end of this gate 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.220
 but make sure from then as must 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.350
 at Palermo 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.590
 With the decision you want to also this minute the 2 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.380
 while he himself is also the "world mirror" Aerts I just that 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.409
 Task of all the Argentines drive the face with 2 0 won 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.329
 the resulting wm-from the Greeks but probably also the end of Otto 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.929
 Rehhagel more critical after nine years 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:25.059
 National coach Dr, however, may continue to dream of the title Argentina 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:27.219
 sovereign winner of the group remained
