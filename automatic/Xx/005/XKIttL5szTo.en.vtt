00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.999
 ah 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.620
 It is impressive as day to day 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.690
 advances of science surprises us this 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.580
 once a team of 90 seconds witnessed 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.400
 from an operation to the brain with 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.380
 local anesthesia in which after nine 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.630
 hours the patient went walking to her 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.579
 house the report on this historic 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.400
 fact that achieved the first radiosurgery 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.400
 in our country it's Raquel Salazar 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.790
 and he tried to be strong he knew how his 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.800
 parents and his grandmother whom he left in the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.170
 waiting room that the operation that you 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.330
 they were going to do it was difficult but also 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.960
 I knew it was the only possibility of 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.960
 save his life 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.010
 that's why he submitted to the first 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.690
 brain radiosurgery that has been done in 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.969
 Peru 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.860
 when all my part how is the 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.070
 I know that everything will work out well 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.839
 with God's blessing she suffered from 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.969
 frequent headaches to the 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.100
 that gave them little importance only the 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.259
 sudden contraction of his face makes 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.140
 two years reflected the seriousness of his evil 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.180
 the diagnosis was a cerebral aneurysm 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.670
 that it was impossible to operate with the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.680
 conventional surgery since then 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.479
 abandoned all physical activity and had 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.479
 little hope that your situation 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.430
 improve but last Saturday a group of 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.270
 specialists who was interested in your case 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.039
 side but doctors aldo berti and 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.710
 Andress Placencia were trying 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.020
 reassure her was the time to fix 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.270
 on his head a metal frame that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.470
 would allow to locate the precise place of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.470
 where was the aneurysm 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.549
 the same year located almost in the center 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.310
 of his brain could only be 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.440
 disintegrated by radiation is something 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.380
 that demanded great precision to not 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.780
 open your skull in this case by the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.259
 location is very close to the area 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.539
 Motor produced a hemiparesis 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.000
 paralysis of the left side of the body 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.890
 her parents prayed for her but her 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.970
 evident nervousness broke for some 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 instants the psychic 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.780
 a sophisticated origin system 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.330
 Brazilian process the first images 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.910
 of the aneurysm obtained through a 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.080
 tomography to then confront the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.330
 an examination of veins and arteries 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.320
 then at the radiosurgery institute 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.510
 del pacÃ­fico 'the pool of neurosurgeons 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.790
 Oncologists and physical doctors could with 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.730
 all these data point out exactly 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.470
 the location and extension of the area towards 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.800
 where the radiation would point 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.780
 ionizing thousands of mega electrons 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.130
 volts that should disintegrate the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.040
 aneurysm radiosurgery is defined 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.400
 by the direction of a radiant to 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.910
 that acts on fabric and produces 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.040
 biological effects in an area 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.010
 trying as much as possible the preservation 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.959
 of neighboring tissues once the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.420
 doctors defined precisely towards 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.709
 where they would point the radiation to the day 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.750
 they reported that the time had come 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.190
 of the main intervention in his 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.790
 brain 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.300
 what I like dancing the dances 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.300
 folkloric hair 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:23.500
 yes a dream of my whole life that always 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.270
 I wanted to know that longing 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.610
 bayon 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.380
 already in the room the doctors applied 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.040
 half an hour of radiation on the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.870
 aneurysm inside the brain of the day 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.150
 everything was monitored by the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.090
 specialists and nervous parents 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.329
 of the young woman's accuracy depended on her 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.329
 lifetime 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.150
 two 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.100
 that half hour of radiation was the end 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.830
 of the twelve intense hours that lasted 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.830
 intervention which was successful 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.140
 First of all I want to thank God 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.480
 I will have allowed myself 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.120
 go from this bitch 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.060
 thanks to you who are some people 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.740
 so humanitarian 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.060
 and they will see in your room or appear the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.889
 emotion also invaded the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.960
 specialists proud to have 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.030
 saved a life by applying a technique 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.710
 that I had never used before 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.690
 and it will not have to be operated 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.280
 again, because radiosurgery is 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.740
 definitive and has no effect 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.080
 secondary a revolutionary system 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.540
 that today marked a milestone in the 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.420
 Peruvian medical history and in the life of the 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.180
 day let's take care of a lot we're going to 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.880
 monitor a lot we are going to do studies 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.910
 Serials to see how it is closing 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.890
 little by little the malformation like this is 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.050
 young girl left the clinic the same 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.150
 day of his intervention and soon 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.730
 You can dance again its seafaring 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.100
 great passion and above all return to 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.080
 smile calmly and gratitude for 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.270
 after the operation not only your 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.620
 brain came out strengthened but also 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.750
 your heart 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.260
 Raquel Salazar 90 seconds first in 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.260
 the news
