00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.439
 hello youtube friends we are going to bring you 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.840
 a new video on how to make a siphon 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:15.920
 for a fish tank 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:18.910
 the materials a plastic with its lid 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.910
 a sandpaper 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.179
 exact 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.189
 I did not say 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.750
 and had long 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 the Mayans 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.930
 a daughter 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.600
 a guard 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.920
 a hot rubber 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.390
 clear pen 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:07.660
 like in my little fish tanks 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.660
 that's why I chose a pushchair bottle 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.740
 watch out 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 the growth 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.430
 first step 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 is 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.500
 cut the bottle 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.280
 in half and the exact 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.020
 well I did it 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.020
 and this part is not important the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 activity 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.040
 if this is needed 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.530
 be very careful when controlling it 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.340
 with the exact and the sky even greater than 18 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.340
 family years 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.890
 the second step is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.420
 a fact around 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.520
 open an egg 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.740
 in the lid 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.480
 in the stage 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.450
 of the bottle and I did it because of that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.720
 I 'm not going to do it and the gap has to 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.790
 be tight so you can 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.790
 put the bucket easily 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.540
 this mind 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.210
 the third step is a sandpaper 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.670
 let's sand 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:48.870
 with edge 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:56.780
 of art already so that they can not be 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.780
 hurt the fish already there or not 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.250
 the fourth step 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.280
 with the two meshes 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.540
 with a mesh 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.120
 we cut a part 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.720
 the center in the center we cut the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.990
 center a little bit 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.390
 the center has to be 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.780
 it has to be adjusted so that it can be 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.780
 to put 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.200
 that it got 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:37.599
 already got in and the space the other is 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.019
 so that the judges can not get 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.519
 in the bottle and there is no problem 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.519
 that can be hurt 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:54.620
 yes it is and paste 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.270
 hot rubber that has not hit you because 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.630
 I have not put my pieces of 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.630
 start 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.659
 the second 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.580
 maya was to cut a bit 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.170
 tiny 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.990
 so for 3 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.990
 the tube s when you already take out 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:25.060
 and they liked it here 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:29.960
 that is, do not try to leave it out 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:35.650
 and that you can not enter and paste with 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:38.040
 like hot but for that 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.320
 is for 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.600
 I do not know if it 's yours 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.070
 little ones that can not be entered for 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.680
 the tube and you can die 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:54.400
 so they do not get in there type 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.400
 they can not be seen 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.650
 and we have us going to try it 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.930
 I will remove the meshes 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:25.129
 because I do not have pesos 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:27.649
 the way I have it there in another basic 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.840
 I was eating the light water of the 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:32.419
 fishbowl 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.520
 but it's important if you have the 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.740
 fish in the fish tank that you put the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.910
 meshes because if you do not put the mesh 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.550
 they could hurt a lot 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.210
 and if you could put your voice you can 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.210
 have a die 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:56.860
 in the other we are going to do it like this 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.840
 and the other end is a tube 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.200
 tube is not so important to use it 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.560
 because I put it because I had nothing 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.190
 what to do I put design but if you 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.190
 they do not want and if they have that 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.500
 we could not take it they do not want it 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.150
 If you do not want to put it on, I will not put it on 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.849
 there if I want to do as I put 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.510
 do what 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.969
 the 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.079
 the last 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.079
 step is 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.010
 suck 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.590
 suck here here so that the 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.970
 Water 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.970
 I'm going to sit down 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:44.199
 as exalted water from the fish tank 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.009
 I'm coming out of the first and last thing what 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.009
 good i want 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.220
 and below the water wench 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:29.169
 and that was all youtube friends I hope 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:32.029
 that you liked it, I like it if 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:34.839
 their offspring and if they have not done so and until 

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:34.839
 the next video
