show you how to put on some brakes when

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.130 
show you how to put on some brakes when
doing<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.180> I'm<00:00:18.300> gonna<00:00:18.390> put<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.720> my<00:00:18.750> front

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
doing so I'm gonna put on my front

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.189 
doing so I'm gonna put on my front
brakes<00:00:19.410> which<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.840> similar<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> back

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
brakes which is similar to the back

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.630 
brakes which is similar to the back
brakes<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.800> there's<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.160> few<00:00:23.369> slight

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
brakes but it's there's a few slight

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.710 
brakes but it's there's a few slight
differences<00:00:23.850> which<00:00:24.269> I'll<00:00:24.420> show<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.600> later

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
differences which I'll show you later

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.359 
differences which I'll show you later
but<00:00:25.230> for<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.439> purpose<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.890> demonstration

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
but for the purpose of demonstration

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.460 
but for the purpose of demonstration
I'll<00:00:26.939> show<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> front<00:00:27.779> today<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
I'll show you on the front today the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
I'll show you on the front today the
first<00:00:28.710> step<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.039> putting<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.429> brakes<00:00:30.029> would<00:00:30.390> be

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
first step to putting on brakes would be

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.299 
first step to putting on brakes would be
to<00:00:30.630> put<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> brakes<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> brake<00:00:31.920> mounts

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
to put the brakes on to the brake mounts

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
to put the brakes on to the brake mounts
putting<00:00:32.700> Lube<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> mounts<00:00:33.480> inside<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
putting Lube on the mounts inside and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.370 
putting Lube on the mounts inside and
out

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
out

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
out
helps<00:00:34.649> reduce<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.219> friction<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.180> help

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
helps reduce the friction and can help

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
helps reduce the friction and can help
your<00:00:36.450> brakes<00:00:36.630> work<00:00:36.840> better<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> long<00:00:37.500> run

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
your brakes work better in the long run

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.110 
your brakes work better in the long run
now<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> mounts<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.640> prepped<00:00:38.879> it's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
now that the mounts are prepped it's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.840 
now that the mounts are prepped it's
time<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.390> actually<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> arms<00:00:40.200> on

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
time to actually put the arms on

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
time to actually put the arms on
obviously<00:00:41.850> each<00:00:42.030> arm<00:00:42.680> belongs<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.890> its

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
obviously each arm belongs on its

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.090 
obviously each arm belongs on its
respective<00:00:44.520> side<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.379> they<00:00:46.379> should<00:00:46.590> slide<00:00:46.890> on

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
respective side and they should slide on

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
respective side and they should slide on
fairly<00:00:47.879> easily<00:00:48.030> make<00:00:48.510> sure<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:48.930> keep

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
fairly easily make sure you also keep

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.310 
fairly easily make sure you also keep
the<00:00:49.410> respective<00:00:49.890> hardware<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.550> each<00:00:50.940> side

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
the respective hardware on each side

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
the respective hardware on each side
it's<00:00:52.320> very<00:00:52.559> important<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> mess<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it's very important not to mess up the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.660 
it's very important not to mess up the
springs<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.199> each<00:00:55.590> spring<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> specific

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
springs because each spring is specific

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
springs because each spring is specific
to<00:00:56.699> its<00:00:57.149> own<00:00:57.300> side<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.079> next<00:00:58.379> step<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
to its own side the next step is to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.740 
to its own side the next step is to
tighten<00:00:59.399> down<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> spring<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> hardware

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
tighten down the spring and the hardware

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
tighten down the spring and the hardware
onto<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> mount<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.550> next<00:01:02.789> step<00:01:02.910> after<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
onto the mount the next step after you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.329 
onto the mount the next step after you
have<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> arms<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.140> spring<00:01:04.769> tension<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
have the arms on is spring tension and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
have the arms on is spring tension and
spring<00:01:05.850> tension<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.450> important

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
spring tension is really important

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.300 
spring tension is really important
because<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.290> actually<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> what

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
because it's actually what you what

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.969 
because it's actually what you what
makes<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.670> brakes<00:01:08.880> work<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.390> key<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.659> have

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
makes your brakes work it's key to have

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.560 
makes your brakes work it's key to have
equal<00:01:10.979> tension<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.549> both<00:01:11.580> sides<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.360> have

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
equal tension on both sides if you have

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
equal tension on both sides if you have
unequal<00:01:13.200> tension<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.189> when<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.490> brakes

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
unequal tension that's when your brakes

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
unequal tension that's when your brakes
will<00:01:14.939> pull<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.540> side<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> other<00:01:16.280> tab

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
will pull to one side or the other tab

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.499 
will pull to one side or the other tab
your<00:01:17.430> brakes<00:01:17.610> work<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> best<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.420> them

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
your brakes work the best you want them

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
your brakes work the best you want them
both<00:01:18.659> pulling<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.920> same<00:01:20.130> time<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
both pulling at the same time and

to<00:01:56.850> keep<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.119> tension<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.659> place<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.619> now

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to keep your tension in place so now

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.200 
to keep your tension in place so now
that<00:01:58.799> you've<00:01:59.040> set<00:01:59.219> your<00:01:59.340> spring<00:01:59.610> tension<00:01:59.969> it's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that you've set your spring tension it's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.060 
that you've set your spring tension it's
time<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> adjust<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.020> brake<00:02:01.200> pads<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.860> first

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
time to adjust the brake pads the first

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.560 
time to adjust the brake pads the first
step<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.399> adjusting<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.880> brake<00:02:03.060> pads<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
step in adjusting the brake pads is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
step in adjusting the brake pads is
lining<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.799> perfectly<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> rim

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
lining them up perfectly on the rim

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.719 
lining them up perfectly on the rim
loosen<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> brake<00:02:06.600> pad<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.489> line<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.520> up

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
loosen up the brake pad and line it up

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.050 
loosen up the brake pad and line it up
so<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.090> hits<00:02:09.270> evenly<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
so it hits evenly on the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.330 
so it hits evenly on the
tighten<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.750> down<00:02:10.780> all<00:02:11.410> right<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:11.860> now<00:02:12.190> we<00:02:12.250> have

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
tighten it down all right so now we have

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.760 
tighten it down all right so now we have
the<00:02:12.490> brakes<00:02:12.670> attached<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:14.230> next<00:02:14.440> step<00:02:14.620> is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the brakes attached and the next step is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.470 
the brakes attached and the next step is
to<00:02:14.890> attach<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.310> lever<00:02:15.520> I<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:16.060> go<00:02:16.210> ahead<00:02:16.300> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
to attach the lever I can go ahead and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.020 
to attach the lever I can go ahead and
find<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> right<00:02:17.440> spot<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:17.800> my<00:02:18.130> comfort<00:02:18.550> zone

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
find the right spot for my comfort zone

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.450 
find the right spot for my comfort zone
which<00:02:19.990> looks<00:02:20.230> about<00:02:20.440> right<00:02:20.800> there<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.280> usually

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
which looks about right there I usually

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.580 
which looks about right there I usually
like<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.850> keep<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.420> little<00:02:23.320> bit<00:02:23.410> off<00:02:23.560> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
like to keep it a little bit off the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.890 
like to keep it a little bit off the
bend<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.220> because<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.820> makes<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.690> lever

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
bend just because that makes the lever

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.590 
bend just because that makes the lever
give<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.709> max<00:02:26.920> amount<00:02:27.160> of<00:02:27.310> reach<00:02:27.490> again<00:02:28.270> where

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
give the max amount of reach again where

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.090 
give the max amount of reach again where
you<00:02:28.720> put<00:02:28.900> your<00:02:28.990> lever<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.410> sort<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.680> personal

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
you put your lever is sort of personal

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.340 
you put your lever is sort of personal
preference<00:02:30.520> but<00:02:30.610> typically<00:02:31.600> near<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.140> grip

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
preference but typically near the grip

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.630 
preference but typically near the grip
because<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.680> don't<00:02:32.860> want<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.070> grip<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.459> move

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
because you don't want the grip to move

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.880 
because you don't want the grip to move
in<00:02:33.820> or<00:02:34.030> out<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.810> once<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:35.260> have<00:02:35.350> my<00:02:35.470> lever<00:02:35.680> in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
in or out so once I have my lever in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.740 
in or out so once I have my lever in
place<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.459> lock<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.120> down<00:02:37.270> with<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.630> allen

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
place I lock it down with the allen

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.840 
place I lock it down with the allen
wrench<00:02:37.930> cool<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.040> now<00:02:39.130> we<00:02:39.190> have<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.459> lever<00:02:39.640> on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
wrench cool so now we have the lever on

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.120 
wrench cool so now we have the lever on
and<00:02:40.090> it's<00:02:40.209> time<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.510> install<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.840> cable<00:02:41.290> so

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
and it's time to install the cable so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.590 
and it's time to install the cable so
when<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.489> first<00:02:42.610> take<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> brake<00:02:43.090> cable<00:02:43.420> out<00:02:43.510> of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
when you first take a brake cable out of

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.880 
when you first take a brake cable out of
the<00:02:43.660> package<00:02:44.020> you'll<00:02:44.290> notice<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.739> it's

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
the package you'll notice that it's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.530 
the package you'll notice that it's
probably<00:02:45.280> way<00:02:45.489> longer<00:02:45.940> than<00:02:46.090> what<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.360> need

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
probably way longer than what you need

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.510 
probably way longer than what you need
now<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> good<00:02:47.739> thing<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.100> you

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
now this is a good thing because you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.680 
now this is a good thing because you
never<00:02:48.850> know<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:49.239> you're<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.540> need

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
never know when you're going to need

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.330 
never know when you're going to need
extra<00:02:50.080> piece<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> cable<00:02:50.560> or<00:02:50.770> an<00:02:50.890> extra<00:02:51.160> piece

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
extra piece of cable or an extra piece

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.860 
extra piece of cable or an extra piece
of<00:02:51.489> housing<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.450> good<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.600> keep<00:02:52.810> that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
of housing so it's good to keep that

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.160 
of housing so it's good to keep that
stuff<00:02:53.200> around<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:53.920> first<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.030> all<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:56.050> we

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
stuff around but first of all what we

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.780 
stuff around but first of all what we
want<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.410> do<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.770> measure<00:02:57.010> up<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.459> cut<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
want to do is measure up the cut the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.790 
want to do is measure up the cut the
size<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.270> cable<00:02:58.630> before<00:02:59.260> we<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.650> measure

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
size of the cable before we can measure

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.410 
size of the cable before we can measure
up<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.100> cable<00:03:00.430> we<00:03:00.580> need<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.820> insert<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.270> cable

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
up the cable we need to insert the cable

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660 
up the cable we need to insert the cable
into<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> lever<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.440> want<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.400> make<00:03:03.520> sure

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
into the lever you want to make sure

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.949 
into the lever you want to make sure
that<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:03.940> leave<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.239> barrel<00:03:04.450> adjuster<00:03:04.630> on

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
that you leave the barrel adjuster on

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
after that's hooked it threads through

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.360 
after that's hooked it threads through
the<00:04:31.610> bridge<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.180> then<00:04:32.780> finally<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:34.220> other

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
the bridge and then finally the other

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.490 
the bridge and then finally the other
end<00:04:34.640> is<00:04:34.790> threaded<00:04:35.180> through<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.510> lock<00:04:35.810> nut<00:04:36.080> all

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
end is threaded through the lock nut all

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.960 
end is threaded through the lock nut all
right<00:04:36.710> so<00:04:37.010> now<00:04:37.100> we<00:04:37.160> have<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.430> brakes<00:04:37.640> set

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
right so now we have the brakes set

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.790 
right so now we have the brakes set
there's<00:04:38.630> two<00:04:38.840> more<00:04:39.050> steps<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.500> we<00:04:39.620> need<00:04:39.650> to

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
there's two more steps that we need to

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.680 
there's two more steps that we need to
do<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.160> make<00:04:40.310> this<00:04:40.430> process<00:04:40.610> complete<00:04:41.270> one

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
do to make this process complete one

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.510 
do to make this process complete one
step<00:04:41.990> would<00:04:42.140> be<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.320> clip<00:04:42.650> any<00:04:42.830> excess<00:04:43.280> cable

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
step would be to clip any excess cable

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.640 
step would be to clip any excess cable
that's<00:04:43.880> hanging<00:04:44.210> off<00:04:44.330> your<00:04:44.480> bike<00:04:44.690> in<00:04:45.260> addition

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
that's hanging off your bike in addition

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.900 
that's hanging off your bike in addition
to<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.040> want<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.250> make<00:04:46.340> sure<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.610> cut<00:04:46.790> it

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
to that you want to make sure you cut it

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.030 
to that you want to make sure you cut it
well<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.330> cover<00:04:47.540> it<00:04:47.720> with<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.870> cable<00:04:48.260> end<00:04:48.410> to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
well and cover it with a cable end to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.850 
well and cover it with a cable end to
keep<00:04:49.190> them<00:04:49.310> from<00:04:49.490> getting<00:04:49.640> frayed<00:04:50.140> so<00:04:51.140> last

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
keep them from getting frayed so last

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.410 
keep them from getting frayed so last
but<00:04:52.010> not<00:04:52.070> least<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.460> can<00:04:52.580> do<00:04:52.670> any<00:04:52.910> last-minute

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
but not least you can do any last-minute

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.480 
but not least you can do any last-minute
fine-tuning<00:04:54.170> using<00:04:54.590> these<00:04:54.710> barrel<00:04:55.040> adjusters

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
fine-tuning using these barrel adjusters

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.430 
fine-tuning using these barrel adjusters
and<00:04:55.730> these<00:04:56.570> work<00:04:56.750> great<00:04:56.990> for<00:04:57.230> getting<00:04:57.410> your

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
and these work great for getting your

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.910 
and these work great for getting your
brakes<00:04:57.710> exactly<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.400> way<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.580> want<00:04:58.850> them
