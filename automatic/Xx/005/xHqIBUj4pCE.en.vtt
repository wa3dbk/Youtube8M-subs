want to start buying lots of things that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
want to start buying lots of things that
you've<00:01:09.390> been<00:01:09.420> craving<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you've been craving but we know that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.730 
you've been craving but we know that
happiness<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.270> quickly<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.590> we

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
happiness can go up quickly and then we

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710 
happiness can go up quickly and then we
get<00:01:13.890> used<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> question<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.450> how

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
get used to it so the question was how

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
get used to it so the question was how
do<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.960> space<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.740> over<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.670> long<00:01:17.909> time<00:01:18.150> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
do you space it out over a long time so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
do you space it out over a long time so
I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.590> how<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> think

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I think it's really about how to think

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.010 
I think it's really about how to think
about<00:01:21.619> money<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> tool<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.810> buying

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
about money as a tool to buying

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.469 
about money as a tool to buying
happiness<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.369> our<00:01:26.729> intuitions<00:01:27.360> about

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
happiness and what our intuitions about

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.700 
happiness and what our intuitions about
the<00:01:27.750> relationship<00:01:28.259> with<00:01:28.380> money<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the relationship with money and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
the relationship with money and
happiness<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> cases<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:29.970> it's

money after you have to spend it and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.060 
money after you have to spend it and
whether<00:02:09.630> that's<00:02:09.930> paying<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.350> college<00:02:10.500> buying

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
whether that's paying for college buying

business so I would say not to be afraid
to<00:02:15.180> spend<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.200> best<00:02:16.440> money<00:02:16.710> advice<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.130> got

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
to spend it the best money advice I got

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.940 
to spend it the best money advice I got
was<00:02:17.910> ironically<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.600> worst<00:02:18.900> money<00:02:19.500> advice<00:02:19.770> I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
was ironically the worst money advice I

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.150 
was ironically the worst money advice I
got<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.730> was<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.540> constant<00:02:22.230> refrain

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
got and that was this constant refrain

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.730 
got and that was this constant refrain
we<00:02:23.490> hear<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:24.000> stop<00:02:24.540> spending<00:02:24.810> money<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.200> lattes

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.390 
we hear of stop spending money on lattes
and<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.850> heard<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.210> over<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.380> over<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.160> over

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and I heard it over and over and over

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.610 
and I heard it over and over and over
from<00:02:29.640> everyone<00:02:30.210> in<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> media<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.350> thought

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
from everyone in the media and I thought

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.580 
from everyone in the media and I thought
this<00:02:32.160> must<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.490> true<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.020> tried<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.320> cut

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
this must be true and so I tried to cut

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.850 
this must be true and so I tried to cut
back<00:02:34.830> on<00:02:35.160> all<00:02:35.640> these<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:35.970> things<00:02:36.650> buying<00:02:37.650> a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
back on all these little things buying a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500 
back on all these little things buying a
small<00:02:38.160> coke<00:02:38.460> instead<00:02:38.820> of<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:38.970> large<00:02:39.180> coke

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
small coke instead of a large coke

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.260 
small coke instead of a large coke
cutting<00:02:40.080> back<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.410> morning<00:02:41.010> coffee<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.550> really

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
cutting back on morning coffee I really

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.060 
cutting back on morning coffee I really
tried<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.170> never<00:02:43.440> worked<00:02:43.740> for<00:02:43.830> me<00:02:43.950> I

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
tried and it never worked for me I

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.530 
tried and it never worked for me I
started<00:02:44.340> feeling<00:02:44.400> guilty<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:45.030> would<00:02:45.270> yo-yo

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
started feeling guilty I would yo-yo

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.000 
started feeling guilty I would yo-yo
back<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.900> forth<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.830> when<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
back and forth and that's when I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.670 
back and forth and that's when I
realized<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:48.660> everyone<00:02:49.110> says<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
realized just because everyone says a

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.290 
realized just because everyone says a
certain<00:02:50.070> type<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.220> advice<00:02:50.550> doesn't<00:02:51.180> mean

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
certain type of advice doesn't mean

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.430 
certain type of advice doesn't mean
they've<00:02:51.420> actually<00:02:51.810> tested<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.260> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
they've actually tested it and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.920 
they've actually tested it and
ironically<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.340> bad<00:02:53.940> advice<00:02:54.150> led<00:02:54.570> me<00:02:54.750> to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
ironically that bad advice led me to

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.750 
ironically that bad advice led me to
learn<00:02:55.110> about<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.800> psychology<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.370> money<00:02:56.610> in

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
learn about the psychology of money in

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.970 
learn about the psychology of money in
the<00:02:56.880> psychology<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.420> human<00:02:57.690> behavior<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.230> so

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the psychology of human behavior and so

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.460 
the psychology of human behavior and so
that<00:02:59.220> terrible<00:03:00.210> terrible<00:03:00.480> advice<00:03:00.810> actually

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
that terrible terrible advice actually

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.620 
that terrible terrible advice actually
brought<00:03:01.709> me<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.070> learn<00:03:02.670> what<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:02.970> know<00:03:03.390> now

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630
