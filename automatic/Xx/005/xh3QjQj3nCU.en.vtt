double<00:03:15.799> shift<00:03:16.189> dang<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.469> car<00:03:18.709> is

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
tuning very fast cuts on stage one sorry

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.700 
tuning very fast cuts on stage one sorry
if<00:04:48.380> this<00:04:48.620> isn't<00:04:49.070> what<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:50.020> like<00:04:51.020> be<00:04:51.229> doing<00:04:51.530> but

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
if this isn't what you like be doing but

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.909 
if this isn't what you like be doing but
hey<00:04:52.669> it'll<00:04:53.090> be<00:04:53.300> interesting<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:54.169> see<00:04:54.470> the

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
hey it'll be interesting to see the

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.330 
hey it'll be interesting to see the
progress<00:04:55.220> as<00:04:55.639> we<00:04:55.690> trap<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:58.070> different

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
progress as we trap and the different

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.330 
progress as we trap and the different
powers<00:04:58.849> things<00:04:59.270> put<00:04:59.539> in<00:04:59.690> I<00:05:00.190> find<00:05:01.190> that

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
powers things put in I find that

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.189 
powers things put in I find that
sometimes<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:02.060> little<00:05:02.210> boring<00:05:02.449> myself<00:05:02.690> let<00:05:03.110> me

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
sometimes a little boring myself let me

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.040 
sometimes a little boring myself let me
like<00:05:03.349> really<00:05:03.710> you're<00:05:04.039> going<00:05:04.340> through<00:05:04.610> and

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
like really you're going through and

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.469 
like really you're going through and
putting<00:05:06.250> parts<00:05:07.250> on<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.760> that's<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.270> what

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
putting parts on that that's like what

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.629 
putting parts on that that's like what
everyone<00:05:08.810> can<00:05:08.990> do<00:05:09.169> but<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.650> know<00:05:10.099> some<00:05:10.610> people

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
everyone can do but I know some people

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.600 
everyone can do but I know some people
might<00:05:11.030> find<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.389> interesting<00:05:12.430> probably<00:05:13.430> the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
might find it interesting probably the

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.279 
might find it interesting probably the
most<00:05:13.789> interesting<00:05:14.300> one<00:05:14.419> is<00:05:14.449> probably<00:05:14.780> maxing

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
most interesting one is probably maxing

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.409 
most interesting one is probably maxing
it<00:05:15.349> out<00:05:15.530> because<00:05:15.919> then<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:16.190> can<00:05:16.370> assess<00:05:17.180> my

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
it out because then you can assess my

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.430 
it out because then you can assess my
judgment<00:05:18.080> on<00:05:18.229> how<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.650> cheer<00:05:19.509> but<00:05:20.509> yeah<00:05:20.870> tunis

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
judgment on how to cheer but yeah tunis

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.879 
judgment on how to cheer but yeah tunis
it's<00:05:21.849> obviously<00:05:22.849> fairly<00:05:23.240> simple<00:05:23.659> until<00:05:24.110> well

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
it's obviously fairly simple until well

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.469 
it's obviously fairly simple until well
you<00:05:25.010> can<00:05:25.159> make<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.520> as<00:05:25.639> simple<00:05:25.880> as<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.270> want

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
you can make it as simple as you want

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.650 
you can make it as simple as you want
really

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
really

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.250 
really
my<00:05:28.320> technique<00:05:28.830> usually<00:05:29.330> usually<00:05:30.330> if<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.050> don't

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
my technique usually usually if I don't

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.280 
my technique usually usually if I don't
know<00:05:31.700> anyone<00:05:32.700> who<00:05:32.880> has<00:05:33.300> posted<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.870> mac<00:05:34.020> setup

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
know anyone who has posted the mac setup

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.070 
know anyone who has posted the mac setup
I<00:05:34.710> usually<00:05:35.640> just<00:05:35.670> look<00:05:36.000> for<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.510> most<00:05:36.690> talk

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
I usually just look for the most talk

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.590 
I usually just look for the most talk
with<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:37.800> lease<00:05:37.980> power<00:05:38.310> gain<00:05:38.580> which<00:05:39.480> is

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
with the lease power gain which is

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.830 
with the lease power gain which is
obviously<00:05:40.410> power-to-weight<00:05:40.860> ratio<00:05:41.370> which

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
obviously power-to-weight ratio which

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.020 
obviously power-to-weight ratio which
probably<00:05:42.840> most<00:05:43.140> people<00:05:43.260> do<00:05:43.610> but<00:05:44.610> with<00:05:44.790> turf

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
probably most people do but with turf

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.280 
probably most people do but with turf
tuning<00:05:45.510> I'm<00:05:45.660> trying<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:47.030> assess<00:05:48.030> it<00:05:48.270> and<00:05:48.300> it

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
tuning I'm trying to assess it and it

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.630 
tuning I'm trying to assess it and it
looks<00:05:49.590> like<00:05:50.600> you<00:05:51.600> put<00:05:51.840> on<00:05:52.340> selected<00:05:53.340> parts

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
looks like you put on selected parts

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.640 
looks like you put on selected parts
only<00:05:53.820> as<00:05:54.060> in<00:05:54.270> ok<00:05:54.990> I've<00:05:55.200> grade<00:05:55.500> the

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.990 

I'm<00:06:18.930> one<00:06:19.290> person<00:06:19.470> who<00:06:19.800> does<00:06:20.220> put<00:06:20.550> nice<00:06:20.760> on

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
I'm one person who does put nice on

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.570 
I'm one person who does put nice on
every<00:06:21.240> car<00:06:21.480> like<00:06:22.080> this<00:06:22.710> one<00:06:22.950> obviously<00:06:23.100> won't

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
every car like this one obviously won't

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.770 
every car like this one obviously won't
be<00:06:23.880> too<00:06:24.450> competitive<00:06:25.280> but<00:06:26.280> it'll<00:06:27.270> be<00:06:27.300> good<00:06:27.390> to

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
be too competitive but it'll be good to

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:35.090 
be too competitive but it'll be good to
use<00:06:27.960> it<00:06:28.230> and<00:06:29.120> I<00:06:30.120> spent<00:06:30.960> at<00:06:31.020> least<00:06:31.050> be<00:06:34.100> so

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
use it and I spent at least be so

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.990 
use it and I spent at least be so
obviously<00:06:35.340> it's<00:06:35.520> going<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.700> be<00:06:35.760> a<00:06:35.790> fairly

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
obviously it's going to be a fairly

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.030 
obviously it's going to be a fairly
cheap<00:06:36.300> card<00:06:36.570> to<00:06:36.900> max<00:06:37.110> out<00:06:37.260> which<00:06:37.620> is<00:06:37.650> good<00:06:38.010> for

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
cheap card to max out which is good for

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.210 
cheap card to max out which is good for
me<00:06:38.190> I'm<00:06:38.520> probably<00:06:38.910> going<00:06:39.150> to<00:06:39.270> start<00:06:39.510> another

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
me I'm probably going to start another

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.650 
me I'm probably going to start another
coin<00:06:41.220> farm<00:06:41.520> soon<00:06:41.700> I<00:06:41.850> haven't<00:06:42.030> actually<00:06:42.120> done<00:06:42.450> a

coin farm soon I haven't actually done a

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.380 
coin farm soon I haven't actually done a
