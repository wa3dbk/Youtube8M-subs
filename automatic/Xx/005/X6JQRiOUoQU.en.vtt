00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.010
 inconvenience in mine and cheap 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.680
 so to speak because it is not a 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.080
 inconvenience indeed who now I explain to you 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.560
 or in the municipality of Campobasso 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.840
 the mayor decided not to reopen the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.720
 schools in fact all the schools of the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.020
 common of the cap of the molise had one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.170
 reopening today ie September 11th though 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.899
 the mayor of Campobasso has decided to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.399
 pay the schools closed as not 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 I am up to standard 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:50.399
 the fire prevention system and then up to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.530
 20 Molise schools except 5 that is the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:02.650
 my art school scientific high school 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:04.930
 agrarian via ie professional class 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.350
 crafts remained open because a 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.820
 norm or a total bad luck while I today 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.550
 I woke up at a quarter past seven 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.620
 to prepare for school 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.900
 some of my friends who didn't give high school 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.590
 scientific those schools that are 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.240
 remained open are beautiful 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.880
 bed to sleep peacefully a 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.740
 in the meantime we have to do weight loss 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.720
 everyone will have the initial all of them 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.560
 we should face this new year 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.810
 school 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:39.280
 call to talk about the kg and news 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.360
 of a few days the new iphone will have the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.640
 Universal technology 4g lte 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.740
 for those who do n't know the technology 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.800
 4g lte or long term evolution is the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.970
 kind of broadband connectivity already 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.590
 available in various countries can 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.219
 to allow 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.420
 download up to 100 mbps and an upload 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.720
 up to 500 560 mbps 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.519
 the video I wanted to make today is precisely 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.379
 talk about when we could have 4g 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.080
 therefore Italy 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.680
 then let's start with talking about the manager 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.870
 tim and vodafone as they were i 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.720
 first of all managed the projects of the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.330
 4g functions such as to put in Italy and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.780
 let's say around April of this year 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.079
 they said that by the end of the always 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.209
 2012 will be five major elements 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.880
 Italian cities so I think the various 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.190
 regional capitals with the addition 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.890
 of the type of turin that in short is not the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.670
 these things, however, are the capital city 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.950
 so 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.379
 by the end of the year they should have 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.959
 the filippi vita 4g knows that maybe not 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.329
 will begin to put 4g connectivity 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.410
 with the exit of the iPhone that this does not 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:03.930
 it is known and by the end of 2013 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.319
 numerous other cities and in many others 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.579
 countries so we talk about countries will be 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.859
 all equipped with 4g technology 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.280
 so we have to wait at least for trouble 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.560
 bolts I think I end of the year to put 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.989
 Italy end 2013 inter inter italy 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.560
 2014 2015 we always talk about now 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.590
 manager 3 italy then they did 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.739
 to know that they too by the end of the year 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.720
 will experiment with these new technologies 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:41.690
 and as tim vodafone, instead, you enter 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.260
 1013 all the main Italian cities 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.480
 will be covered by this technology e 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.230
 have arranged that precisely in the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.020
 2013-2014 two-year period 98 percent of the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.070
 population will be covered precisely by 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.490
 this collectivity pathology 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.190
 so this was a little what they have 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.910
 in other words words must then be seen 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.760
 the facts 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.620
 therefore according to these intro descriptions 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.709
 2000 otherwise civil in Italy will be 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.350
 fully appreciated from here from 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.420
 these satellite dishes that 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.730
 will send the 4g 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:26.140
 I remember before leaving that 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:29.390
 tomorrow at 7 pm 19 on the site 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.880
 www.livenation.it a and I will do mine 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.419
 livestream on the presentation of the new one 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.460
 iphone follow if you want children in yourself 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.620
 to the temptation of the new iphone and who knows 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.600
 that if they will also present the ipod e 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.680
 new imac 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.680
