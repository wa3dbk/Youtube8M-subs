 today there will be another unpacking 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.370
 Of course it will not be as big as 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.120
 the previous one I had a bunch of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.920
 problems that I flooded for two days 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.680
 and not flooded the final i just come out 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.619
 minutes 3 4 so spend your minutes 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.570

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:53.730

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780
 behind 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.000
 but I think this comic 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.680
 some big too compared to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.670

 and then in general 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.880
 I bought it not in order to read 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.570

 I like this funny spoon 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:58.080
 but even in the last issue was a poster with 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.630

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.550

 for some reason is 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.000
