00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
straight upgrade to the weapon when you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.959 
straight upgrade to the weapon when you
infuse<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:36.009> with<00:01:36.070> lightning<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.610> scaling

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
infuse it with lightning the scaling

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.490 
infuse it with lightning the scaling
changes<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.360> bit<00:01:37.539> in<00:01:37.719> the<00:01:37.990> physical<00:01:38.320> and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500
