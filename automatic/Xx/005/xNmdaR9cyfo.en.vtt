00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.149 
like typically I can't work dressed like
this<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.270> i<00:01:21.659> don't<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.320> defined

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this because i don't have a defined

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
waist line so i just look like a stick
but<00:01:25.500> because<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.310> draws<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:26.909> eyes<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
but because it draws your eyes in a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.940 
but because it draws your eyes in a
little<00:01:27.960> bit<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> gives<00:01:28.409> me<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.860> an

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
