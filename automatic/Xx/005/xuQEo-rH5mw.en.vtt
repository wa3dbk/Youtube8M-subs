00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.030
 hello friends with you again I 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.560
 Eugene Bogla Facebook Designer 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 today I will tell you about one more 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.040
 group of exercises for the face that we have 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.810
 will be no less effective than 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.810
 dynamically these are static exercises 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.610
 low load is when we are straining 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.680
 muscles and for some time held in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.320
 this state static load 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.720
 helps us work our muscles 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.250
 more in depth and accordingly it 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.050
 gives us a stable and deep result 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.030
 what exercises we will have I 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 I will show today three exercises in one 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.269
 exercise we will work none 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.000
 muscle immediately several this first 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.159
 will save your time and it will be easier for you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.920
 fit them into your routine workout schedule 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.199
 and so we first do with you first 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.080
 exercise it is called everything from the center 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.140
 how we do it we put our palms on 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.080
 forehead hold eyebrows well and now 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 we raise our eyebrows at the same time 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 straining dinner already with you we can do it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.090
 do and wide open eyes 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.490
 it turns out that the upper part of the face we are all 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 pull from the center back and up we 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.020
 freeze in this position and hold though 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.610
 10 seconds we try together we press 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.259
 good eyebrows as much as possible raise and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 raise eyebrows and open eyes wide 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.240
 imagine at this moment that you are all 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.640
 stretches back and up like your face 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.710
 pulls hold even at least 5 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 seconds nothing relax eyes not 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.490
 morgan and let you go at that moment 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.930
 muscles should strain even more than 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.970
 during dynamic loading 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 maximally-maximally compress and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.680
 hold try together again 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.049
 palms hold eyebrows as much as possible 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.579
 raised eyebrows pulled back already opened 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.880
 eyes are very wide 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.070
 all tense and hold if your hair 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.509
 collected in the tail you will be easier steel 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.630
 what is your hair pulling back and up 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.610
 keep still a little bit and all relaxed 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.690
 when you relax your muscles you should 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.320
 feel a surge of heat in the whole head in 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.760
 the back of the head and the top of our face 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.920
 the next exercise is called y 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.910
 We all contrary to the center as we 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 we do 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 Letyagin's mouth has been and we are trying 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.010
 as much as possible 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.620
 all the muscles that separate us from the mouth 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.870
 how to stretch and slightly strain it 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.510
 exercise is very useful for those who 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.200
 pronounced nasolabial creases 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:50.159
 or creases near the mouth try together 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:53.010
 straining and letting go is very important to 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.510
 you are not wrinkled upper lip and to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.940
 the entire center of the face was 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.129
 completely smoothed out you should 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.140
 physically feel like all the muscles 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.720
 you stretch and straighten 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:11.760
 try again pull the mouth to the center 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:13.290
 and everything is relaxing if you have stress 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.120
 during this excessively you can 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.250
 relax your face like we used to do 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.620
 inflate the cheeks and relax all the muscles of you 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.359
 immediately relax and we still have 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.340
 one exercise to be 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.739
 pull us our lower face 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.720
 we make it so understand slightly 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.000
 chin up 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.129
 lips stretch out and slightly 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.670
 up as if turning them around like 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.230
 gramophone and so here at this moment you 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.829
 must feel the tension throughout 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:51.060
 lower part of the face of the neck and contour try 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:52.919
 stretch together and relax everything 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.109
 tension should be strong enough 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.109
 and try again together you threw and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.650
 all relax you see exercises 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.440
 very simple and do not take much 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.989
 time so if you have no time 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.069
 perform our entire set of exercises 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.169
 which we have learned in past classes 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.389
 you can limit yourself to static 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.400
 exercises and this will give you a very 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.120
 good positive effects can also 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.579
 combine 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 do some dynamic first 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.990
 exercise then add ethical and 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.419
 training will also come out very 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.550
 effectively also very helpful 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.349
 alternate dynamic load first 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.810
 then static so your 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.599
 muscles do not get used to the same type of load 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.130
 they know how to work you in different ways also 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.159
 during these exercises we have 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.930
 blood flow increases in the face and everything 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.840
 exchange processes take place faster 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.620
 and I wish you successful training good luck 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.620
 you work on yourself
