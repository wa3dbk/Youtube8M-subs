dedicated to a friend Beth so first up

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:31.790 
dedicated to a friend Beth so first up
what<00:00:17.470> we<00:00:17.620> do<00:00:17.740> is<00:00:17.980> we<00:00:18.310> draw<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.550> rectangle

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.040 

and<00:00:32.490> then<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.760> draw<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.090> circles

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.590 

this<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> wheels<00:00:41.090> just<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.240> a<00:00:42.270> guide

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this will be the wheels just as a guide

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.400 
this will be the wheels just as a guide
and<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:42.990> what<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.280> take

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
and then what we do is we just take

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.700 
and then what we do is we just take
curved<00:00:46.410> line<00:00:46.740> up<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.870> top<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.230> round<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
curved line up to the top and round it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.650 
curved line up to the top and round it
off<00:00:51.650> just<00:00:52.650> at<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.130> line<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> line<00:00:56.660> then

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
off just at this line and that line then

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.140 
off just at this line and that line then
we<00:00:57.750> round<00:00:58.020> off<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.350> corner<00:00:58.650> here<00:00:59.040> and<00:00:59.280> round

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
we round off the corner here and round

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.560 
we round off the corner here and round
off<00:01:00.330> the<00:01:00.450> corner<00:01:00.720> here<00:01:00.990> and<00:01:01.580> again<00:01:02.580> just<00:01:03.300> round

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
off the corner here and again just round

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010 
off the corner here and again just round
off<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.900> corner<00:01:04.230> yet<00:01:05.510> then<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.780> wheels

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
off that corner yet then with the wheels

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
off that corner yet then with the wheels
we<00:01:07.980> just<00:01:08.220> take<00:01:08.430> another<00:01:08.990> half<00:01:09.990> circle<00:01:10.590> around

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
we just take another half circle around

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.540 
we just take another half circle around
the<00:01:11.160> top<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.500> wheels<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.920> curve<00:01:14.220> that

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
the top of the wheels and in curve that

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.940 
the top of the wheels and in curve that
corner<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> side<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
corner and do the same on the side of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
corner and do the same on the side of
the<00:01:17.160> corner<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:20.820> half<00:01:21.030> circle<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.660> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the corner and a half circle around the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.920 
the corner and a half circle around the
top<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> wheel

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.820 

we<00:01:26.930> draw<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.140> line<00:01:27.640> that's<00:01:28.640> three<00:01:29.560> Thea<00:01:30.560> like

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
we draw a line that's three Thea like

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.820 
we draw a line that's three Thea like
that<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:35.870> again<00:01:36.080> at<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.260> top<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.740> we

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
that and then again at the top here we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.180 
that and then again at the top here we
drew<00:01:36.950> another<00:01:37.190> line<00:01:38.560> it's<00:01:39.560> kind<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.830> meeting

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
drew another line it's kind of meeting

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.360 
drew another line it's kind of meeting
with<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:41.080> curve<00:01:42.080> just<00:01:42.410> starts<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.920> have<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.190> the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
with it curve just starts to have in the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.910 
with it curve just starts to have in the
air<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:44.420> then<00:01:44.810> we<00:01:45.260> just<00:01:45.440> want<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.620> bring<00:01:45.770> that

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
air and then we just want to bring that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.110 
air and then we just want to bring that
up<00:01:46.130> slightly<00:01:47.030> from<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.600> curve<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:53.090> that

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
up slightly from that curve so that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.560 
up slightly from that curve so that
those<00:01:53.450> are<00:01:53.479> guidelines<00:01:53.810> for<00:01:54.229> our<00:01:54.440> windows<00:01:55.570> so

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
those are guidelines for our windows so

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.390 
those are guidelines for our windows so
the<00:01:56.690> end<00:01:56.810> for<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.050> main<00:01:57.290> driver's<00:01:57.890> window

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.930 

bring<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.759> line<00:02:02.600> down<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:03.310> rip<00:02:04.310> I'm<00:02:04.460> sorry<00:02:04.880> I

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
bring a line down I rip I'm sorry I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.490 
bring a line down I rip I'm sorry I
cross<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.509> down<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.320> just<00:02:06.470> curve<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.000> here

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
cross and down and just curve it here

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.220 
cross and down and just curve it here
then<00:02:09.500> bring<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.830> down<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.130> with<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:11.230> slightly

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
then bring it down to with it slightly

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.710 
then bring it down to with it slightly
curved<00:02:12.530> line<00:02:12.739> starts<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.280> happen<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.600> we<00:02:14.690> just

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
curved line starts to happen and we just

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.990 
curved line starts to happen and we just
give<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.800> air<00:02:15.920> take<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.550> straight<00:02:16.790> out<00:02:19.000> in

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
give it the air take it straight out in

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.420 
give it the air take it straight out in
for<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.330> one<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.440> leave<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.800> little<00:02:21.950> bit

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
for this one we just leave a little bit

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.900 
for this one we just leave a little bit
of<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:23.320> gap<00:02:24.320> here<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.950> then<00:02:25.190> curve<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.880> line

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
of a gap here and then curve the line

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.340 
of a gap here and then curve the line
across<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.450> top<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:28.250> curve<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.880> air<00:02:29.350> we

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
across the top and curve it the air we

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.570 
across the top and curve it the air we
just<00:02:30.530> want<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.709> work<00:02:30.799> out<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.070> size<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.459> our

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
just want to work out the size of our

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.680 
just want to work out the size of our
windows<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:33.370> bring<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.400> line<00:02:34.640> down<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.239> then<00:02:35.299> we

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
windows so bring a line down and then we

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.130 
windows so bring a line down and then we
leave<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> bit<00:02:36.080> of<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.290> get<00:02:37.180> another<00:02:38.180> line<00:02:38.510> down<00:02:38.540> a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
leave a bit of a get another line down a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.000 
leave a bit of a get another line down a
bit<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:40.370> another<00:02:41.000> line<00:02:41.299> down<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.830> bit

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
bit of a get another line down and a bit

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.259 
bit of a get another line down and a bit
of<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.190> get<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.519> what's<00:02:46.670> going<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.880> happen<00:02:46.940> with

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
of a get so what's going to happen with

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.789 
of a get so what's going to happen with
this<00:02:47.450> window<00:02:47.720> here<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.470> curve

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
this window here is it's going to curve

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.460 
this window here is it's going to curve
up<00:02:49.900> enjoying<00:02:51.580> this<00:02:52.580> other<00:02:52.940> line<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:54.170> other

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
up enjoying this other line the other

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.180 
up enjoying this other line the other
point<00:02:55.930> just<00:02:56.930> like<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.680> then<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:57.950> curve

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
point just like that and then we curve

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.970 
point just like that and then we curve
that<00:02:58.459> line<00:02:58.959> bring<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.049> across<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.410> top<00:03:00.590> and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
that line bring it across the top and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.430 
that line bring it across the top and
then<00:03:01.880> again<00:03:02.330> we<00:03:02.570> just<00:03:02.720> do<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> same<00:03:03.080> here

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
then again we just do the same here

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.920 
then again we just do the same here
except<00:03:04.070> we<00:03:04.190> keep<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.820> lines<00:03:05.030> straight<00:03:05.239> on

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
except we keep the lines straight on

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.530 
except we keep the lines straight on
this<00:03:06.140> guide<00:03:06.440> line<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.940> curve<00:03:08.269> the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
this guide line and just curve the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.690 
this guide line and just curve the
corners

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.979 

thank<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.879> in<00:03:14.940> for<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.239> one<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.690> then<00:03:15.810> this

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
thank you in for that one and then this

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.360 
thank you in for that one and then this
one<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.349> back<00:03:16.620> window<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:16.980> I'll<00:03:17.129> just<00:03:17.220> go

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
one is the back window so I'll just go

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.140 
one is the back window so I'll just go
straight<00:03:17.730> out<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.440> back<00:03:19.890> but<00:03:20.760> just<00:03:20.790> curve

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
straight out to the back but just curve

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.800 
straight out to the back but just curve
these<00:03:21.390> corners<00:03:21.950> yeah<00:03:23.269> now<00:03:24.269> for<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.599> lights

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
these corners yeah now for the lights

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.110 
these corners yeah now for the lights
we're<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.440> draw<00:03:25.620> an<00:03:25.890> oval<00:03:26.120> here

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
we're just going to draw an oval here

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.990 
we're just going to draw an oval here
and<00:03:27.420> then<00:03:27.540> another<00:03:27.690> little<00:03:27.930> over<00:03:28.200> there<00:03:29.000> and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
and then another little over there and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.630 
and then another little over there and
for<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.239> front<00:03:30.510> headlights<00:03:31.129> and<00:03:32.129> over<00:03:32.430> there

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
for the front headlights and over there

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.210 
for the front headlights and over there
a<00:03:33.000> little<00:03:33.780> oval<00:03:34.140> next<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.860> then<00:03:35.040> just

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
a little oval next to it and then just

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.170 
a little oval next to it and then just
one<00:03:35.400> down<00:03:35.610> here<00:03:38.030> we<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.239> give<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.810> bus<00:03:40.440> a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
one down here we want to give the bus a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.349 
one down here we want to give the bus a
slight<00:03:42.180> wing<00:03:42.599> more<00:03:42.870> oh<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.549> we<00:03:44.549> use<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.150> line

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
slight wing more oh so we use that line

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.550 
slight wing more oh so we use that line
as<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> guide<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.769> take<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> rectangle<00:03:48.560> up

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
as a guide and just take a rectangle up

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.089 
as a guide and just take a rectangle up
to<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.750> then<00:03:53.390> angled<00:03:54.390> line<00:03:54.629> here<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.440> then

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
to it and then angled line here and then

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.569 
to it and then angled line here and then
just<00:03:56.340> straight<00:03:58.640> onto<00:03:59.640> it<00:04:00.480> with<00:04:00.629> a<00:04:01.579> very

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
just straight onto it with a very

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.569 
just straight onto it with a very
elongated<00:04:03.980> rectangle<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.159> just<00:04:05.220> slightly

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
elongated rectangle and just slightly

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.369 
elongated rectangle and just slightly
curved<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.090> India<00:04:06.480> where<00:04:06.629> it<00:04:06.720> dreams<00:04:07.019> onto

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
curved the India where it dreams onto

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.699 
curved the India where it dreams onto
the<00:04:07.500> bus<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:09.060> then<00:04:09.599> we'll<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:09.840> smooth<00:04:10.440> those

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
the bus and then we'll just smooth those

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.220 
the bus and then we'll just smooth those
points<00:04:11.129> out<00:04:11.280> there<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.720> that's<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.049> wing

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
points out there so that's the wing

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.190 
points out there so that's the wing
mower<00:04:13.459> now<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.519> show<00:04:14.849> glass<00:04:15.269> it's<00:04:15.750> pretty<00:04:15.989> cool

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
mower now to show glass it's pretty cool

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.839 
mower now to show glass it's pretty cool
just<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.769> UM<00:04:18.500> put<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.560> couple<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.979> lines<00:04:20.400> just

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
just to UM put a couple of lines just

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.050 
just to UM put a couple of lines just
quite<00:04:21.060> randomly<00:04:21.419> on<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:22.250> windows<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.789> this

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
quite randomly on the windows and this

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.969 
quite randomly on the windows and this
just<00:04:24.240> gives<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.539> hint<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:24.870> is<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.410> slight

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
just gives the hint that is a slight

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.300 
just gives the hint that is a slight
reflection<00:04:26.580> there<00:04:26.789> without<00:04:27.599> a<00:04:27.750> thing<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.320> do

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
reflection there without a thing to do

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.279 
reflection there without a thing to do
too<00:04:29.580> much<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.210> yeah<00:04:30.479> that's<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.870> great<00:04:31.020> way<00:04:31.260> of

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
too much so yeah that's a great way of

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.600 
too much so yeah that's a great way of
showing<00:04:31.440> glass<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:33.080> cartoons<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:34.979> then<00:04:35.250> we<00:04:35.490> go

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
showing glass and cartoons so then we go

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.400 
showing glass and cartoons so then we go
back<00:04:35.789> down<00:04:35.940> and<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.120> finish<00:04:36.360> off<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.690> wheels

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.990 

so<00:04:40.410> just<00:04:40.590> draw<00:04:40.710> two<00:04:41.039> circles<00:04:41.070> slightly

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
so just draw two circles slightly

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.529 
so just draw two circles slightly
smaller<00:04:42.270> within<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.949> main<00:04:44.220> circles<00:04:44.789> and<00:04:45.449> then

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
smaller within the main circles and then

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.050 
smaller within the main circles and then
again<00:04:45.840> just<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.349> center<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.800> air<00:04:47.060> another

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
again just in the center the air another

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.990 
again just in the center the air another
so-called<00:04:48.919> another<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.099> called<00:04:50.340> then<00:04:50.880> I'm

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
so-called another so called then I'm

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.339 
so-called another so called then I'm
just<00:04:51.090> going<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.590> dice<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.620> there<00:04:53.960> by<00:04:54.960> adding<00:04:55.260> a

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
just going to dice it there by adding a

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.110 
just going to dice it there by adding a
line<00:04:55.590> in<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.010> middle<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.490> then<00:04:56.669> down<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.090> the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
line in the middle and then down in the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.659 
line in the middle and then down in the
middle<00:04:57.419> and<00:04:57.630> then<00:04:58.440> just<00:04:58.470> add<00:04:58.919> some<00:04:59.099> ovals<00:04:59.520> in

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
middle and then just add some ovals in

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.730 
middle and then just add some ovals in
there

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.800 

just<00:05:03.130> like<00:05:03.370> that<00:05:03.639> just<00:05:04.150> stick<00:05:04.360> up<00:05:04.449> the<00:05:04.600> wheels

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
just like that just stick up the wheels

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.219 
just like that just stick up the wheels
a<00:05:04.960> bit<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:06.210> texture<00:05:09.090> cool<00:05:10.090> then<00:05:10.810> what<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:11.050> do<00:05:11.199> is

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
a bit of texture cool then what we do is

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.810 
a bit of texture cool then what we do is
we<00:05:11.440> just<00:05:11.470> grab<00:05:11.800> our<00:05:11.919> black<00:05:12.130> pins<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.580> go<00:05:12.639> back

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
we just grab our black pins and go back

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:45.260 
we just grab our black pins and go back
in<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.090> Hank<00:05:13.240> in<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.479> pencil<00:05:13.810> lanes

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.399 

can<00:05:46.270> we<00:05:46.330> just<00:05:46.479> go<00:05:46.569> back<00:05:46.749> in<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.020> double<00:05:47.199> up<00:05:47.289> the

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
can we just go back in and double up the

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.719 
can we just go back in and double up the
thickness<00:05:47.710> of<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.949> main<00:05:48.159> parts<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.580> the

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
thickness of the main parts of the

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.129 
thickness of the main parts of the
illustration<00:05:49.300> to<00:05:49.419> make<00:05:49.539> it<00:05:49.689> look<00:05:49.810> even<00:05:49.930> more

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
illustration to make it look even more

00:05:50.139 --> 00:06:21.790
