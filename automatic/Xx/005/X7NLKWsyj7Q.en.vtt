00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
i think it's so useful for more than

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.590 
i think it's so useful for more than
than<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.810> halloween<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.520> then<00:01:14.540> this<00:01:15.540> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
remember the number right now I think

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.080 
remember the number right now I think
it's<00:01:23.340> labels<00:01:23.880> 10<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> could<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.650> wrong<00:01:26.090> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it's labels 10 but I could be wrong so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.670 
it's labels 10 but I could be wrong so
first<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> want<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.110> add<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> little

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
first thing I want to do is add a little

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.969 
first thing I want to do is add a little
bit<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:30.200> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> grab<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.740> black

pen<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.020> think<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.170> needs<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.680> little

pen here I think it just needs a little

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.240 
pen here I think it just needs a little
border<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.079> it<00:01:37.079> stands<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.829> little<00:01:38.040> bit
