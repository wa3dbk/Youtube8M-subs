00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.869
 Hello Goodnight 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.440
 days or whatever 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.770
 I am in defense of windows 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.680
 to get started 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.360
 the only sure thing in this world is the certainty of death and that prices 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.749
 rise faster than salaries 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:18.499
 let's touch five critical points to windows number one windows is insecure 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.199
 number 2 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.179
 windows is unstable 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.210
 number 3 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.339
 windows is for fools 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.410
 Number 4 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.069
 windows consumes many resources 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.089
 number 5 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.089
 windows gets corrupted and you have to format it every so often 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.440
 point number one 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.440
 windows is insecure because it may have design flaws 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.580
 I linux also has them 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.000
 both take parts 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.030
 but the difference is marked by users 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.350
 Windows users do not care about security 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.380
 Microsoft had the blaster and sasser patches available months before the 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.530
 propagation 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.370
 windows fault that is insecure 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.560
 blame for users who are not able to remove the mule five minutes to 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.240
 download a patch 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.930
 the user of windows however seems allergic to the letters 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.060
 no matter how many times you notice windows that activex control can 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.940
 Be dangerous 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.030
 to check if it's from a trusted organization 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.740
 but none of those messages 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 they give him to accept without reading if he is signed by micro mide or by his 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.720
 loss of porn 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 windows usually warn 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.990
 it is the user's problem not to read igarle will accept all epileptic mind 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.140
 for watching porn if nobody pays attention 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.120
 Who is to blame for this 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.730
 the windows programs that are made by useless that program with 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.170
 the ass in visual perisic 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.780
 many of the windows problems do not come from the operating system 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 but of the programs that are installed on him 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.000
 the clumsy programmers on windows are not able to work in an environment 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 of user 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.530
 they insist on touching the windows folder using strange dlls 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.240
 modify the whole system 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.130
 etc 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.869
 but the fault is of programs made by useless that are not capable of 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.030
 operate as a limited user 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.330
 in linux thanks to thousands of eyes can see your code 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.500
 these pseudo programmers would be the laughingstock of the community 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.529
 point number 2 windows is unstable 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:16.099
 windows is much more sensitive than linux to jaguar defects 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.389
 machines that cause crashes 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.999
 even the impossibility of installing windows work with linux 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.379
 perfectly 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.180
 If your pc fails often 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.609
 maybe you have some bad piece 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.939
 if our favor works perfectly that these have to look for other causes 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.769
 guilty 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.669
 the programs insist on touching the registry 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.959
 uninstaller is that they do not work modify the common lls of the system 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.589
 the useless programmers of visual veissid do not learn that a program 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:49.209
 should be with everything you need in a folder and not touch the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.379
 rest of the system 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.239
 some programs are spread all over the pc as a cancer 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.290
 neither should we forget the ugly habit that programs have of believing themselves 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.290
 navel of the world and run at the beginning 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:05.639
 i real player 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.719
 quick time 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.680
 and etcetera all insist on running at the beginning of the installation 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.079
 by default which is what most people do and it turns out that we have 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.739
 lost almost half of our team's resources before we can 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.639
 start using it even and we have the taskbar full of icons 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.709
 useless 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.689
 Due to this loss of resources, the stability and response of the system 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.249
 see compromised 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.400
 the users 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.360
 that install everything that falls into their hands without thinking that they saturate the equipment 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.890
 with programs of more than dubious origin and the only button that they see 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.379
 it is next to finish 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.110
 the easiest way to demonstrate the stability of windows or the lack of 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.579
 this is looking for a machine that we know that your jaguar works 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.299
 point number 3 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.489
 windows is for fools 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.450
 I do not think windows is for fools or linux paraja kers the fool is the person 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.269
 not the tool 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.930
 windows emphasizes the ease of use of windows 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.519
 colorines and assistants 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.190
 but beneath the beautiful surface rests one more operating system 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.219
 interesting and complex than it seems 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:10.629
 point number 4 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.859
 windows consumes many resources 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.000
 but removing all the habits 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.690
 effects 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.420
 Xp antics and sounds and leaving it with the bare appearance of windows 2000 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.699
 I am able to run it on a p3 500 with 128 megabytes it was quite light 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.560
 days ago install a fedora 3 specify is 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.300
 3 in one direction or 2200 with 256 megawatts and apart from that the 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.760
 life to boot was going to jerks and just turn on the machine and run a geek 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.030
 he said he had used 205 megawatts of memory 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.030
 when windows had used 79 megaval c's 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.519
 the fault of the consumption of resources of windows they return to have also the 

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.769
 programs that run at the beginning that almost nobody uses and consume precious 

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:57.620
 megabytes and processor time 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.389
 many teams that read coughs and heavy 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.000
 they seem new after running, many trust in the beginning of the beginning 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.069
 point number five windows gets corrupted and you have to format it every so often 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.300
 here I will talk about my personal experience 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.080
 used xp since almost came out I changed equipment about four times 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:17.599
 plate change 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.819
 de anda intel different graphic cards and I have never formatted 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.199
 the only time it was six months after having xp because of a hard disk that 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:26.689
 failure 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.610
 my team with windows xp is currently about three years without knowing what 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:31.689
 which is a format 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:33.659
 I've never had a virus problem 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.449
 no strange things 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.289
 those that corrupt the system are the badly programmed applications and the 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.139
 clumsy users 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.819
 conclusions 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.889
 the main problem of windows is the people around it programmers and 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.330
 users who do not do things well 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.479
 some do not know how to program in conditions and others do not care about ko and give 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.020
 your team to know him 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.560
 by using it correctly 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.560
 they just want to go to the carrefour and buy an appliance 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.560
 that allows them to download music and movies 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.050
 I use windows only for what it is 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.229
 oo a platform to use my favor in a friendly way a support for my 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.270
 programs 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.720
 the only proprietary software that runs on my machine is windows the rest is 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.159
 free software 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.419
 I think windows used with free software and by users with a bit of 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.429
 concern for your machine can be a great platform to work 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.509
 so my recommendations is do not visit porn pages 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:31.270
 it already hurts your mental health 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.659
 do not install so much games on your pc 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.159
 better get to play on play 3 or xbox or better read a book 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.300
 uninstall unnecessary programs 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.800
 install updates regularly that does not cost you not to install transform 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.099
 and sens pax that the only thing that does is to encourage the whole system 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.550
 it is understood 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.379
 good as I got tired of talking and since I'm very sleepy I'm leaving 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.669
 see you in another video of the story 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.249
 have a good night 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.319
 goodbye 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.789
