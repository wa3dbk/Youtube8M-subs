00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.629
 Greetings to Ebert Etailer 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.729
 Today we look at the FMA and in general 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:11.379
 So without skill emphasis 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.410
 Generally speaking, datum has neither Marner nor energy nor 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.359
 Woodgate next to Ronan 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.640
 The Mannomann portrait can see two bleeders and two frosts around 32 Euros 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.039
 here has a separate cooldown 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.519
 and it further builds similar anger percent Ronan opens up 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.519
 which you can then use for other technology so NDR cost technique may take 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 single or multiple Hodea 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.140
 just without night 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.560
 he to start 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.120
 If you do not have many techniques, you have a death grip on it 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.920
 Gamer get dressed 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 Cannes Emma demonstrate it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.340
 they are so gray now 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.660
 is going pretty fast 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.460
 In that case Vienna has the only contact 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.450
 in such shock and in the blood fall 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.329
 the only touch raises one of the percent 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.200
 Two of the major diseases from such a fall triggered another 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.640
 Illness out 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.369
 So once the Frosty do not correct the only touch and once 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
 Heavy weight of his blood has just that 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.770
 SÃ¼dmersen both time local time around 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.990
 the blood should also be taken care of that percent Mattner Schanz 25% percent 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.880
 despite 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.300
 be made by the enemy 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.840
 it also takes a more practical one percent so you need to do that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.580
 most techniques percent 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.690
 more harm if the diseases has on the NATO outside so 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.170
 and she starts a fight with a glimpse of the two diseases first 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.780
 Set goal 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.350
 so the ember fall costs the blood push Cosse DC one 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.420
 Blood or 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.030
 and then do more damage now, for example 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.880
 that makes 55 percent weapon damage +65 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 and then there's bonus damage for any disease the ATR ripped up 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 that means we put on our kids 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.860
 icy touch such bump 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.680
 Blood fall deluge fall still unholy so again such shock 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.529
 Once again she has already fainted a bit 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.499
 to cover the gold 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.829
 the gold cost 40 how to bring and makes 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.089
 the federal money, however, not particularly effective 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.069
 you have to say that 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.730
 Years later there's still the presence needed later a higher one 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.639
 Value has seen next to Accord better 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.899
 so far only the blood presence 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.359
 He also increased the damage by 15 percent and Heitmann 2% 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.039
 Fat of the damage caused 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.749
 yes this is the blood sample but as I said we still look at others 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.859
 later 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.980
 yes, that was first of all little bit under Flight the single Skillung 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.419
 of course for me too 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.419
 And also the drinking behavior that is very interesting for many 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.119
 So then 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.949
 Until next time
