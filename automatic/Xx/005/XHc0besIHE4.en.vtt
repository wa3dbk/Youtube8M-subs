are<00:04:41.079> very<00:04:41.289> limited<00:04:41.619> I'm<00:04:42.399> not<00:04:42.969> sure<00:04:43.269> if<00:04:43.419> these

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
are very limited I'm not sure if these

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.029 
are very limited I'm not sure if these
were<00:04:43.779> limited<00:04:44.259> or<00:04:44.409> not<00:04:45.929> but<00:04:46.929> I'm<00:04:47.469> glad<00:04:47.679> I<00:04:47.799> got

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
were limited or not but I'm glad I got

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:58.679 
were limited or not but I'm glad I got
my<00:04:48.189> hands<00:04:48.639> on<00:04:48.869> a<00:04:49.869> pair<00:04:55.529> and<00:04:56.529> not<00:04:57.489> only<00:04:57.669> do<00:04:57.999> I

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
my hands on a pair and not only do I

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.709 
my hands on a pair and not only do I
think<00:04:59.649> that<00:04:59.829> these<00:05:00.039> were<00:05:00.519> the<00:05:00.729> last<00:05:00.969> beat<00:05:01.449> ones

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
think that these were the last beat ones

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.839 
think that these were the last beat ones
made<00:05:02.079> I<00:05:02.109> don't<00:05:02.619> think<00:05:02.829> they're<00:05:02.979> making<00:05:03.339> the

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
made I don't think they're making the

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:09.209 
made I don't think they're making the
LeBron<00:05:04.269> be<00:05:04.569> ones<00:05:05.249> period<00:05:06.249> anymore<00:05:06.549> so<00:05:07.949> these<00:05:08.949> I

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
LeBron be ones period anymore so these I

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.729 
LeBron be ones period anymore so these I
guess<00:05:09.489> and<00:05:10.059> all<00:05:10.539> the<00:05:10.749> other<00:05:10.929> sooner<00:05:11.529> or<00:05:11.589> later

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:11.739 
guess and all the other sooner or later

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:19.169 
guess and all the other sooner or later
are<00:05:12.189> going<00:05:12.729> to<00:05:12.969> be<00:05:17.519> possibly<00:05:18.519> tough<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:18.999> get
