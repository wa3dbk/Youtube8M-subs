00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.420
 I want to show you there, I'll like it. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:13.400
 it is on sale in the open market 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.400
 This one has eight months of use. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:25.160
 the temperature goes from 90 to 210 is then 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.810
 Why do fast food restaurants have to be? 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.059
 bars snack bars 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 if you have a relative movement 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.230
 great 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.129
 it's very worth this very much 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.120
 fast 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:48.300
 you may be using that oil 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
 oil and solid you put it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.710
 melts in there 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 or it may be conventional soybean oil 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.100
 vegetable, that's okay 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.820
 only that the ideal would really be the vegetable 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.820
 solid is much more economical 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.600
 heats up a lot faster 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.780
 it is practically brand new the reason 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.080
 to be selling is that our 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080
 movement 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.740
 she is not big is very big so 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:33.570
 we had to buy a chair 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:39.630
 professional business three months of 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.780
 warranty used for eight months but is 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.250
 a great companion during all this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 recommended time if you can buy 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 one new 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.759
 I also recommend it just as it is. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.390
 semi new you're paying too much 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.390
 cheaper 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.869
 so this one is just for you 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.630
 such voltage 210 it okay if if you 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.590
 We wish we could be 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.209
 making available 220 we have others 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.970
 drawings of 2010 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.150
 but there it would be under consultation you ask 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.209
 it's because we're seeing another model 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.900
 that she is a little 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.480
 she has this detail is that the side to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.420
 another does not have a strip of wood 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.830
 we improvise then this is a 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.519
 little younger 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.000
 in this sense then so it is before 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:54.350
 buy you let us know if you want 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.030
 110 or 220 and then we will see the 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:03.739
 availability of her shipment 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.620
 then this sale is exclusive to the market 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:12.070
 free 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.070
 so we have only two pieces 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.489
 thank you
