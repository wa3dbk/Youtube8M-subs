00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
repulsor blasts accessory you can see

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.660 
repulsor blasts accessory you can see
here<00:02:53.630> it's<00:02:53.840> attached<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.440> his<00:02:55.150> wrist<00:02:56.150> here<00:02:56.720> and

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
here it's attached to his wrist here and

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.060 
here it's attached to his wrist here and
to<00:02:58.670> simulate<00:02:58.970> him<00:02:59.450> firing<00:03:00.080> out<00:03:00.230> his<00:03:00.500> repulsor

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
to simulate him firing out his repulsor

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.990 
to simulate him firing out his repulsor
blasts<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:02.320> made<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.620> harder<00:03:04.250> plastic

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
blasts and it's made of a harder plastic

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.690 
blasts and it's made of a harder plastic
I<00:03:05.360> was<00:03:05.959> expecting<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.590> soft<00:03:06.950> rubber<00:03:07.250> plastic

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
I was expecting a soft rubber plastic

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.520 
I was expecting a soft rubber plastic
but<00:03:08.209> now<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.540> one's<00:03:08.780> actually<00:03:08.959> pretty<00:03:09.140> hard

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
but now this one's actually pretty hard

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.460 
but now this one's actually pretty hard
so<00:03:10.520> it's<00:03:10.970> like<00:03:11.180> pretty<00:03:11.840> interesting<00:03:12.470> on<00:03:13.430> there

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
so it's like pretty interesting on there

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.060 
so it's like pretty interesting on there
shooting<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.680> out<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:18.070> attaches

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
shooting it out and it just attaches

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.090 
shooting it out and it just attaches
like<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.300> like<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.330> clip<00:03:20.750> there<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.680> think<00:03:22.010> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
like a like a clip there so I think this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.420 
like a like a clip there so I think this
is<00:03:22.250> actually<00:03:22.400> rather<00:03:23.180> nice<00:03:23.480> accessory<00:03:24.430> taking

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
is actually rather nice accessory taking

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.820 
is actually rather nice accessory taking
a<00:03:25.489> look<00:03:25.610> at<00:03:25.760> our<00:03:26.120> man<00:03:26.690> himself

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
a look at our man himself

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.460 
a look at our man himself
this<00:03:28.160> figure<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.700> actually<00:03:29.060> nice<00:03:29.470> nicely

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
this figure is actually nice nicely

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.699 
this figure is actually nice nicely
painted<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.519> it's<00:03:31.760> nice<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.030> clean<00:03:32.709> compared

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
painted and it's nice and clean compared

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.280 
painted and it's nice and clean compared
to<00:03:33.830> some<00:03:34.040> of<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.250> Iron<00:03:34.550> Man<00:03:34.790> 2<00:03:35.060> figures<00:03:35.300> were

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
to some of the Iron Man 2 figures were

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.190 
to some of the Iron Man 2 figures were
the<00:03:36.620> red<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.340> gold<00:03:37.580> are<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.910> little<00:03:38.540> spotty<00:03:38.989> in

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
the red and gold are a little spotty in

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.690 
the red and gold are a little spotty in
places<00:03:39.769> but<00:03:39.950> this<00:03:40.070> one's<00:03:40.250> actually<00:03:40.370> rather

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
places but this one's actually rather

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.420 
places but this one's actually rather
clean<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.570> only<00:03:41.780> places<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.290> noticed<00:03:42.680> was<00:03:43.190> over

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
clean the only places I noticed was over

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.030 
clean the only places I noticed was over
here<00:03:43.850> at<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.840> elbow<00:03:45.080> joint<00:03:45.530> where<00:03:45.830> some<00:03:46.010> of

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
here at the elbow joint where some of

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.030 
here at the elbow joint where some of
the<00:03:46.190> red<00:03:46.480> bled<00:03:47.480> through<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.380> gold<00:03:48.620> but

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
the red bled through to the gold but

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.890 
the red bled through to the gold but
other<00:03:49.190> than<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.239> really<00:03:50.660> nice

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
other than that this is a really nice

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.070 
other than that this is a really nice
one<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.260> don't<00:03:51.500> know<00:03:51.590> if<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.739> just<00:03:51.920> picked<00:03:52.130> a

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
one I don't know if I just picked a

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.229 
one I don't know if I just picked a
really<00:03:54.080> well<00:03:54.680> painted<00:03:55.100> figure<00:03:55.430> or<00:03:55.610> not<00:03:55.820> but

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
really well painted figure or not but

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.690 
really well painted figure or not but
this<00:03:57.200> one's<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:58.100> liked<00:03:58.580> very<00:03:59.299> much<00:04:00.549> you<00:04:01.549> could

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
this one's I I liked very much you could

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.360 
this one's I I liked very much you could
see<00:04:01.940> these<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.600> armor<00:04:03.140> designs<00:04:03.530> throughout

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
see these the armor designs throughout

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.210 
see these the armor designs throughout
the<00:04:04.580> body<00:04:04.790> throughout<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.540> body<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.230> I'm<00:04:06.920> not

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
the body throughout the body and I'm not

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.699 
the body throughout the body and I'm not
sure<00:04:07.489> what<00:04:07.760> version<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.750> armor<00:04:09.200> this<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.680> I

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
sure what version of armor this is I

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.370 
sure what version of armor this is I
haven't<00:04:10.340> been<00:04:10.580> following<00:04:10.940> up<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.600> Iron

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
haven't been following up on the Iron

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.610 
haven't been following up on the Iron
Men<00:04:12.650> in<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.950> comics<00:04:13.870> I've<00:04:14.870> heard<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.440> there

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
Men in the comics I've heard it there

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.840 
Men in the comics I've heard it there
was<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:16.570> extra<00:04:17.570> extra<00:04:18.320> armor

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
was the extra extra armor

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.330 
was the extra extra armor
but<00:04:20.180> I<00:04:20.360> thought<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:20.840> one<00:04:21.110> in<00:04:21.260> series<00:04:21.590> 2<00:04:21.980> was

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
but I thought the one in series 2 was

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.820 
but I thought the one in series 2 was
the<00:04:22.700> extremist<00:04:23.390> armor<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.050> I'm<00:04:24.170> not<00:04:24.350> sure<00:04:24.410> what

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
the extremist armor so I'm not sure what

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.090 
the extremist armor so I'm not sure what
version<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:26.690> here<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.200> just<00:04:27.680> really

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
version this is on here I just really

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.350 
version this is on here I just really
like<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.460> detail<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.510> here<00:04:29.780> and<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.800> noticed

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
like the detail on here and I noticed

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.930 
like the detail on here and I noticed
his<00:04:33.280> waist<00:04:34.280> area<00:04:34.760> here<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.090> a<00:04:35.360> little<00:04:36.170> thin

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
his waist area here is a little thin

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.260 
his waist area here is a little thin
especially<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.630> classic<00:04:39.400> armored<00:04:40.400> version

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
especially the classic armored version

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.670 
especially the classic armored version
of<00:04:41.420> Iron<00:04:41.600> Man<00:04:41.780> from<00:04:42.140> the<00:04:42.290> Marvel<00:04:42.620> Universe

that<00:04:43.220> one<00:04:43.400> is<00:04:43.550> just<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.880> super<00:04:44.300> thin<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:45.440> this

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
that one is just a super thin and this

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.530 
that one is just a super thin and this
one's<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:46.010> looks<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.670> little<00:04:46.790> thicker<00:04:47.150> but<00:04:47.390> it's

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
one's a looks a little thicker but it's

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.340 
one's a looks a little thicker but it's
still<00:04:47.870> not<00:04:48.260> quite<00:04:49.300> thick<00:04:50.300> enough<00:04:50.570> for<00:04:50.930> my

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
still not quite thick enough for my

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.240 
still not quite thick enough for my
tastes

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
figures a little thicker in the waist on

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.920 
figures a little thicker in the waist on
there<00:04:59.470> so<00:05:00.470> but<00:05:01.370> going<00:05:01.580> over<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.970> articulation

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
there so but going over the articulation

there so but going over the articulation
for<00:05:03.740> this<00:05:04.550> figure<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.990> head<00:05:06.140> goes<00:05:06.410> all<00:05:06.950> the

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
for this figure the head goes all the

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.530 
for this figure the head goes all the
way<00:05:07.100> around<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:08.230> does<00:05:09.230> go<00:05:09.590> up<00:05:10.430> just<00:05:11.120> very

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
way around and does go up just very

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.470 
way around and does go up just very
little<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.470> very<00:05:13.190> little<00:05:13.430> going<00:05:13.850> down<00:05:14.120> which

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
little and very little going down which

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.900 
little and very little going down which
is<00:05:14.630> kind<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:15.080> disappointing<00:05:15.260> because<00:05:15.980> a<00:05:16.370> lot

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
is kind of disappointing because a lot

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.300 
is kind of disappointing because a lot
of<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.180> flight<00:05:17.450> poses<00:05:17.990> he<00:05:18.110> really<00:05:18.410> can't<00:05:18.680> have

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
of the flight poses he really can't have

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.260 
of the flight poses he really can't have
his<00:05:19.490> head<00:05:19.700> pointing<00:05:20.480> up<00:05:20.630> so<00:05:20.830> he's<00:05:21.830> not<00:05:22.270> seeing

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
his head pointing up so he's not seeing

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.240 
his head pointing up so he's not seeing
where<00:05:23.540> he's<00:05:23.720> going<00:05:24.080> unless<00:05:24.680> he's<00:05:24.920> got<00:05:25.040> some

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
where he's going unless he's got some

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.580 
where he's going unless he's got some
sort<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.460> radar<00:05:25.760> on<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:25.940> top<00:05:26.090> of<00:05:26.240> his<00:05:26.360> head<00:05:26.590> and

sort of radar on the top of his head and
the<00:05:28.250> arms<00:05:29.240> do<00:05:29.480> go<00:05:29.660> all<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.260> way<00:05:30.290> around<00:05:30.500> and

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
the arms do go all the way around and

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.480 
the arms do go all the way around and
they<00:05:31.880> do<00:05:31.940> go<00:05:32.300> out<00:05:32.570> a<00:05:32.600> little<00:05:33.080> bit<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:33.620> back

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
they do go out a little bit and back

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.180 
they do go out a little bit and back
down<00:05:34.850> and<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.690> shoulder<00:05:36.200> guard<00:05:36.440> is

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.230 
detachable here so without the shoulder
guard<00:05:41.540> his<00:05:41.960> arm<00:05:42.410> can<00:05:42.710> go<00:05:42.740> up<00:05:43.220> a<00:05:43.460> lot<00:05:43.700> higher<00:05:43.880> on

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
guard his arm can go up a lot higher on

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.410 
guard his arm can go up a lot higher on
there<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.890> elbows<00:05:46.760> do<00:05:47.240> Bend<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:48.910> they<00:05:49.910> rotate

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
there the elbows do Bend and they rotate

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.090 
there the elbows do Bend and they rotate
but<00:05:50.630> not<00:05:50.750> all<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.020> way<00:05:51.110> around<00:05:51.530> because<00:05:51.680> the

but not all the way around because the

articulation in the hands one hand is

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.810 
articulation in the hands one hand is
open<00:06:05.480> to<00:06:06.200> fire<00:06:06.410> the<00:06:06.590> repulsor<00:06:07.130> blasts<00:06:07.400> and<00:06:07.730> the

open to fire the repulsor blasts and the
other<00:06:08.120> hand<00:06:08.420> is<00:06:08.600> a<00:06:08.630> fist<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:10.550> torso<00:06:11.270> bins<00:06:11.630> or

other hand is a fist the torso bins or

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.530 
other hand is a fist the torso bins or
yeah<00:06:12.620> it<00:06:12.710> does<00:06:12.860> Bend<00:06:13.100> up<00:06:13.640> and<00:06:13.880> down<00:06:14.030> and<00:06:14.390> also

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
yeah it does Bend up and down and also

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:21.790 
yeah it does Bend up and down and also
rotates<00:06:15.110> all<00:06:15.530> the<00:06:15.770> way<00:06:15.890> around<00:06:17.260> the<00:06:19.270> legs<00:06:20.800> do

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
rotates all the way around the legs do

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.600 
rotates all the way around the legs do
go<00:06:22.040> up<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:23.360> down<00:06:23.780> not<00:06:24.620> to<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.860> back<00:06:25.070> but<00:06:25.520> they

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
go up and down not to the back but they

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.409 
go up and down not to the back but they
do<00:06:25.670> go<00:06:25.880> out<00:06:26.030> to<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.300> side<00:06:26.600> and<00:06:27.190> there's<00:06:28.190> no

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
do go out to the side and there's no

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.480 
do go out to the side and there's no
articulation<00:06:29.419> and<00:06:29.930> there's<00:06:30.890> only<00:06:31.130> a<00:06:31.220> single

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
articulation and there's only a single

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.710 
articulation and there's only a single
join<00:06:31.940> up<00:06:32.150> being

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
join up being

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.810 
join up being
a<00:06:32.750> lot<00:06:33.470> of<00:06:33.500> the<00:06:33.740> other<00:06:33.890> Marvel<00:06:34.340> Universe

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
a lot of the other Marvel Universe

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.660 
a lot of the other Marvel Universe
figures<00:06:35.150> have<00:06:35.360> double<00:06:35.690> joints<00:06:36.080> I<00:06:36.200> noticed<00:06:36.670> and

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
figures have double joints I noticed and

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.600 
figures have double joints I noticed and
the<00:06:38.240> feet<00:06:38.570> do<00:06:39.200> rotate<00:06:40.010> all<00:06:40.280> the<00:06:40.310> way<00:06:40.520> around

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
the feet do rotate all the way around

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.820 
the feet do rotate all the way around
but<00:06:41.480> barely<00:06:42.230> bend<00:06:42.980> up<00:06:43.220> and<00:06:43.400> down<00:06:44.050> on<00:06:45.050> here<00:06:45.410> so

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
but barely bend up and down on here so

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.940 
but barely bend up and down on here so
overall<00:06:46.610> I'm<00:06:47.570> really<00:06:47.630> impressed<00:06:48.110> with<00:06:48.350> the

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:48.950 
overall I'm really impressed with the

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.480 
overall I'm really impressed with the
paint<00:06:49.250> application<00:06:49.610> of<00:06:50.300> this<00:06:50.390> figure<00:06:51.070> not<00:06:52.070> so

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
paint application of this figure not so

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.780 
paint application of this figure not so
much<00:06:52.700> with<00:06:52.820> the<00:06:52.970> articulations<00:06:53.870> it's<00:06:54.320> just

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
much with the articulations it's just

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.330 
much with the articulations it's just
the<00:06:55.790> articulation<00:06:56.630> is<00:06:56.810> pretty<00:06:57.230> pretty<00:06:58.040> good

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
the articulation is pretty pretty good

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.460 
the articulation is pretty pretty good
there<00:06:58.580> just<00:06:58.790> in<00:06:59.030> certain<00:06:59.540> areas<00:06:59.900> their<00:07:00.140> words

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
there just in certain areas their words

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.440 
there just in certain areas their words
are<00:07:00.800> restricted<00:07:01.550> which<00:07:02.030> I'm<00:07:02.210> kind<00:07:02.420> of

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
are restricted which I'm kind of

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.220 
are restricted which I'm kind of
disappointed<00:07:02.750> with<00:07:04.330> but<00:07:05.330> I<00:07:05.360> still<00:07:05.870> like<00:07:06.080> this

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230 
disappointed with but I still like this

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.020 
disappointed with but I still like this
figure<00:07:06.620> I<00:07:06.920> don't<00:07:07.160> like<00:07:07.460> the<00:07:07.550> price<00:07:07.760> for<00:07:07.970> the

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
figure I don't like the price for the

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.750 
figure I don't like the price for the
figures<00:07:08.330> but<00:07:08.890> hopefully<00:07:09.890> these<00:07:10.340> would<00:07:10.520> go<00:07:10.610> on

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
figures but hopefully these would go on

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.570 
figures but hopefully these would go on
sale<00:07:11.090> or<00:07:11.660> I<00:07:12.350> guess<00:07:12.740> I'll<00:07:12.920> get<00:07:13.040> used<00:07:13.100> to<00:07:13.310> paying

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
sale or I guess I'll get used to paying

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.510 
sale or I guess I'll get used to paying
