00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.529
 the exhibition is organized by section 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:35.440
 thematic that allows to understand all the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.210
 evolutions of sawyers because sawyers 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.820
 a painter who sees the p2 as in 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.640
 narrative and therefore is a painter who 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.430
 tend to take pictures a 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.800
 years distance daughter in second 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.720
 version is this we have it 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.970
 identified by placing photos that 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.239
 show the image below 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.100
 when the case is in drawings and for 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.250
 this gave great importance to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.280
 drawings are 64 are not drawings for 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 years the one in the section called from 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.330
 triptych but they are drawings from the work 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.659
 drawings that allow him to rethink 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.869
 his image of reworking it and of 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.689
 have a kind of visual laboratory 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.700
 I am also drawing here which he has 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.610
 given great importance because when 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.890
 presented personal king within 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.759
 a big show here I sent four o 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.100
 five oils and twelve drawings saying i 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.560
 drawings are a complement that 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.049
 allow me to better understand my work 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.109
 so importance went to the drawing 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.780
 thematic organizations in ten 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:49.179
 sequences that allow us to understand not 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.819
 only technical revolution but 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.459
 the affirmation of pantheism in 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.549
 segantini we see that naturalism is 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:01.240
 pantheism are two terms of the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.659
 same equation and then you go there from 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.119
 a vision more naturalistic a vision 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.509
 increasingly symbolist through the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.459
 works that show in the same rooms 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.600
 this evolution often with the same 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.810
 subjects 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.270
 in these 20 years he has expressed all 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.660
 the trends of the moment of symbolism 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.330
 of the naturalism of divisionism la 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.060
 recovery of ancient techniques and therefore 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.690
 this from an evolution of works that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.680
 spectacular if ghedini someone has 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.920
 wanted to find himself in nature that is he 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.940
 look first for the place where he paints 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.840
 in a certain way 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.700
 and in fact love for a nature and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.040
 dominant because nature is for him 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.710
 mother and stepmother together 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.020
 so he always says I didn't look 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.890
 a god outside of myself knew that 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.830
 every being has some of it 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.900
 nature and wine in that direction and then 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.730
 this pantheism that in sin form 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.380
 from the beginning his relationship with the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.540
 nature if it contains someone who has lost 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.810
 the mother at the age of 7 who has it 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.410
 known only sick and therefore this 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.410
 has made a kind of transfer on 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.680
 nature as a mother and therefore for that 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.600
 that he always looked for a place more 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.600
 high in the mountain 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.719
 there are many works in all of them 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.969
 variations or evolutions of young people 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:56.250
 segantini however I would say that just the 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.920
 return of the forest we see 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.280
 that image really this contact 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.680
 very realistic imprint 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.170
 impressionistic with nature where he has 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.049
 just launched the style of the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.500
 divisionism that is also seen in this 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.459
 framework where the application by colors 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.130
 very well then never mixed on 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.310
 this palette is really let's say the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.440
 brand what we love so much 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.440
 in the art of sawing the brightness
