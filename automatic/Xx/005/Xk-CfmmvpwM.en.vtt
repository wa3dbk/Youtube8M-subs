like buff built tattoos piercings and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.710 
like buff built tattoos piercings and
you<00:01:19.259> start<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.420> this

you start going I don't know about this

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
you start going I don't know about this
like<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.430> figure<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.850> slowly<00:01:24.150> as

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
like and then we figure it out slowly as

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.520 
like and then we figure it out slowly as
everybody<00:01:24.659> started<00:01:24.930> coming<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.409> was

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
everybody started coming in but it was

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.520 
everybody started coming in but it was
pretty<00:01:26.189> much<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> gang<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.270> then<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
pretty much a gang and then and then I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.200 
pretty much a gang and then and then I
think<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.310> least<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:32.090> do<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
think the least is just like do you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.760 
think the least is just like do you
think<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.259> company

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.600
