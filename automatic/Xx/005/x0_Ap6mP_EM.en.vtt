00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.260 
guys my question to you guys is do you
think<00:02:43.180> they're<00:02:43.330> really<00:02:43.480> stealthy<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.290> mean

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
think they're really stealthy I mean

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.580 
think they're really stealthy I mean
it'd<00:02:46.270> be<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> lot<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.690> fun<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.080> drive<00:02:47.230> one<00:02:47.560> of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
it'd be a lot of fun to drive one of

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
it'd be a lot of fun to drive one of
these<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.040> it'd<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.280> trade-off<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.819> know

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
you've just got to decide whether you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.729

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you can see my VW Cabriolet it's a

Westphalia<00:03:31.420> z--<00:03:31.480> I<00:03:31.720> think<00:03:32.320> like<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.470> said<00:03:32.590> it's

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950

Westphalia z-- I think like I said it's
just<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.280> trade-off<00:03:33.549> between<00:03:33.989> something

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
just a trade-off between something

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.900 
just a trade-off between something
that's<00:03:35.140> cool<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.250> case<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.730> West

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
that's cool and in the case of the West

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
that's cool and in the case of the West
Valley<00:03:37.120> or<00:03:37.299> something<00:03:37.660> that's<00:03:37.750> potentially

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
Valley or something that's potentially

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.660 
Valley or something that's potentially
more<00:03:38.440> comfortable<00:03:38.950> with<00:03:39.100> all<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.400> amenities

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
more comfortable with all the amenities

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.970 
more comfortable with all the amenities
and<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.840> case<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.350> Chevy<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:41.860> know

and in the case of this Chevy you know

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.039 
and in the case of this Chevy you know
something<00:03:42.400> very<00:03:42.579> unique<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:43.269> trade-off

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
something very unique a trade-off

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.160 
something very unique a trade-off
between<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.269> stealth<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.780> being<00:03:47.049> able

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
between that and stealth and being able

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.759 
between that and stealth and being able
to<00:03:47.519> camp<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:48.700> places<00:03:49.180> for<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.140> long<00:03:50.320> period<00:03:50.709> of
