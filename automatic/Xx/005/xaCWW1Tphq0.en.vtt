00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
okay we only have two things more to go

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.540 
okay we only have two things more to go
and<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.930> hook<00:00:07.259> in<00:00:07.440> these<00:00:07.710> two<00:00:08.099> power

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
and that is to hook in these two power

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.100 
and that is to hook in these two power
connectors<00:00:09.240> don't<00:00:09.540> forget<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:09.929> there's

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
connectors don't forget that there's

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.629 
connectors don't forget that there's
going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> be<00:00:10.380> at<00:00:10.559> least<00:00:10.590> two<00:00:11.099> on<00:00:11.340> most

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
going to be at least two on most

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.930 
going to be at least two on most
motherboards<00:00:12.080> these<00:00:13.080> days<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.309> big<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:14.670> is

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
motherboards these days the big one is

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.050 
motherboards these days the big one is
we<00:00:15.509> saw<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.109> floor<00:00:16.379> goes<00:00:16.680> up<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.250> snaps

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
we saw the floor goes up here and snaps

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.650 
we saw the floor goes up here and snaps
in<00:00:19.100> one<00:00:20.100> be<00:00:20.220> careful<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.970> knock<00:00:21.210> out<00:00:21.449> any

in one be careful not to knock out any

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750 
in one be careful not to knock out any
of<00:00:21.900> those<00:00:21.990> other<00:00:22.350> tables<00:00:23.160> that's<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
of those other tables that's one of the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.900 
of those other tables that's one of the
hazards<00:00:23.910> when<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:24.750> these<00:00:25.019> wires

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
hazards when you get all these wires

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.160 
hazards when you get all these wires
around<00:00:26.910> everywhere<00:00:27.359> we're<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> clean

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
around everywhere we're going to clean

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
around everywhere we're going to clean
these<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> little<00:00:28.680> later<00:00:29.070> after<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.330> if

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
these up a little later after we see if

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
these up a little later after we see if
everything's<00:00:30.840> working<00:00:31.579> then<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.759> other

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
everything's working then this other

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.970 
everything's working then this other
power<00:00:33.390> connector<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.170> has<00:00:34.230> eight<00:00:34.620> pins

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
power connector that has eight pins

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
power connector that has eight pins
always<00:00:35.940> plugs<00:00:36.239> into<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> motherboard

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
always plugs into the motherboard

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.860 
always plugs into the motherboard
somewhere<00:00:37.410> near<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.070> processor<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.600> this

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
somewhere near the processor and so this

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.500 
somewhere near the processor and so this
this<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.530> blue<00:00:40.890> connector<00:00:41.850> right<00:00:42.149> up

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this is this blue connector right up

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.930 
this is this blue connector right up
here<00:00:43.129> beside<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.399> processor

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.030 

yeah<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.870> these<00:00:49.989> kind<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.260> clip<00:00:50.530> all<00:00:50.739> in<00:00:50.890> with

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
yeah and these kind of clip all in with

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.340 
yeah and these kind of clip all in with
a<00:00:51.100> little<00:00:51.310> snap<00:00:54.000> okay<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.480> that's<00:00:55.690> on<00:00:55.960> there

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
a little snap okay so that's on there

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.920 
a little snap okay so that's on there
good<00:00:56.700> again<00:00:57.700> this<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:57.970> really<00:00:58.300> ugly<00:00:58.510> messy

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
good again this is a really ugly messy

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.320 
good again this is a really ugly messy
case<00:00:59.320> I'm<00:01:00.070> gonna<00:01:00.250> clean<00:01:00.640> these<00:01:00.820> up<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.210> use

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
case I'm gonna clean these up and use

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.960 
case I'm gonna clean these up and use
some<00:01:01.450> cable<00:01:01.780> ties<00:01:01.960> later<00:01:02.379> but<00:01:03.129> now<00:01:03.309> we've<00:01:03.640> got

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
some cable ties later but now we've got

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.640 
some cable ties later but now we've got
everything<00:01:04.570> hooked<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.199> let's<00:01:05.350> just<00:01:05.500> run

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
everything hooked in so let's just run

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.830 
everything hooked in so let's just run
through<00:01:05.830> our<00:01:05.860> checklist<00:01:06.160> real<00:01:06.550> quickly<00:01:06.840> we

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
through our checklist real quickly we

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.830 
through our checklist real quickly we
put<00:01:08.800> our<00:01:08.920> processor<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:09.790> our<00:01:10.000> cooling<00:01:10.510> fan<00:01:10.690> on

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
put our processor and our cooling fan on

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.750 
put our processor and our cooling fan on
the<00:01:10.930> motherboard<00:01:11.170> we<00:01:11.890> installed<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.430> memory

installed the power supply that was the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.330 
installed the power supply that was the
very<00:01:57.399> first<00:01:57.459> thing<00:01:57.789> we<00:01:57.819> did<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:59.170> think<00:02:00.009> we're

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
very first thing we did I think we're

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.510 
very first thing we did I think we're
ready<00:02:00.429> to<00:02:00.580> go<00:02:00.759> now<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:05.520> pistou

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
ready to go now here is the the pistou

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.830 
ready to go now here is the the pistou
result<00:02:06.899> resistance<00:02:07.899> or<00:02:08.170> whatever<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.840> plugged

beeps at us and gives us some errors if
it<00:02:57.530> starts<00:02:57.830> beeping<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.610> nothing<00:02:59.120> comes<00:02:59.360> on

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
it starts beeping and nothing comes on

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.680 
it starts beeping and nothing comes on
the<00:02:59.690> screen<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.880> means<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.270> have<00:03:02.360> some<00:03:02.540> kind

the screen that means we have some kind
of<00:03:02.750> problem<00:03:03.170> or<00:03:04.210> if<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:05.330> screen<00:03:05.570> comes<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.050> it

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
of problem or if the screen comes on it

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.960 
of problem or if the screen comes on it
might<00:03:06.470> tell<00:03:06.650> us<00:03:06.710> about<00:03:07.010> some<00:03:07.220> problems<00:03:07.670> so

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
might tell us about some problems so

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.760 
might tell us about some problems so
we'll<00:03:08.120> see<00:03:08.270> what<00:03:08.390> happens<00:03:08.720> here<00:03:08.900> let's<00:03:09.230> see<00:03:09.710> if

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
we'll see what happens here let's see if

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.530 
we'll see what happens here let's see if
this<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.160> power<00:03:10.370> station<00:03:10.880> maybe<00:03:11.240> that's<00:03:11.450> a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
this is the power station maybe that's a

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.480 
this is the power station maybe that's a
reset<00:03:11.870> switch<00:03:14.950> there's<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.040> switch<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
reset switch there's a switch on the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.550 
reset switch there's a switch on the
power<00:03:16.640> supply<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.450> was<00:03:17.930> turned<00:03:18.110> off<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.500> think

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
power supply that was turned off I think

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.580 
power supply that was turned off I think
so<00:03:18.920> let's<00:03:19.010> try<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.310> again

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
so let's try this again

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.870 
so let's try this again
all<00:03:21.590> right<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:28.100> green<00:03:28.370> light<00:03:28.610> down<00:03:28.820> here

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
all right the green light down here

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.040 
all right the green light down here
telling<00:03:29.450> us<00:03:29.570> that<00:03:29.720> there's<00:03:29.900> power<00:03:34.900> let's<00:03:35.900> see

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
telling us that there's power let's see

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.330 
telling us that there's power let's see
what<00:03:36.200> happens<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.070> film<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.240> screen<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.960> see

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
what happens so film the screen and see

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.790 
what happens so film the screen and see
so<00:03:40.340> we're<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.720> computer<00:03:42.080> posting

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800

I<00:04:38.860> miss<00:04:39.460> my<00:04:39.640> keyboard<00:04:40.120> here<00:04:43.200> okay<00:04:44.200> so<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.440> did<00:04:44.590> it

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
I miss my keyboard here okay so I did it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.450 
I miss my keyboard here okay so I did it
hit<00:04:45.130> f1<00:04:45.520> let's<00:04:46.420> recognize<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.080> keyboard<00:04:47.530> so

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
hit f1 let's recognize the keyboard so

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.090 
hit f1 let's recognize the keyboard so
here's<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.150> nice<00:04:49.360> fancy<00:04:49.810> bias<00:04:50.440> screen<00:04:50.830> it's

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
here's a nice fancy bias screen it's

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.250 
here's a nice fancy bias screen it's
telling<00:04:51.550> me<00:04:51.760> about<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.420> things<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:53.140> have

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
telling me about the things that have

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.220 
telling me about the things that have
been<00:04:53.290> hooked<00:04:53.590> up<00:04:54.480> it's<00:04:55.480> telling<00:04:55.840> me<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:56.080> one

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
been hooked up it's telling me that one

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.110 
been hooked up it's telling me that one
of<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.380> fans<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:56.950> going<00:04:57.220> slow<00:04:57.640> for<00:04:58.030> the

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
of the fans is going slow for the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.000 
of the fans is going slow for the
attendant<00:04:58.510> down<00:04:58.630> on<00:04:58.780> low<00:04:58.990> power<00:04:59.020> that's<00:04:59.650> fine

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
attendant down on low power that's fine

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.820 
attendant down on low power that's fine
but<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.760> means<00:05:00.940> what's<00:05:01.150> working<00:05:01.830> the

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
but that means what's working the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.410 
but that means what's working the
voltages<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.490> CPU<00:05:04.980> CPU<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.670> of<00:05:07.330> the

voltages of the CPU CPU and of the

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.600 
voltages of the CPU CPU and of the
motherboard<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.930> it's<00:05:10.930> given<00:05:11.200> me<00:05:11.230> about<00:05:11.890> 55

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
motherboard and it's given me about 55

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.300 
motherboard and it's given me about 55
options<00:05:13.450> it's<00:05:14.110> asking<00:05:14.530> me<00:05:14.590> what<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:14.860> want<00:05:15.160> to

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
DVD first and then harddrive that's what

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.500 
DVD first and then harddrive that's what
I<00:05:20.320> want<00:05:20.620> because<00:05:20.890> we're<00:05:21.250> going<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.430> set<00:05:22.360> up

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
I want because we're going to set up

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.980 
I want because we're going to set up
Windows<00:05:23.050> 7<00:05:23.470> on<00:05:23.590> this<00:05:23.800> from<00:05:24.100> the<00:05:24.130> DVD<00:05:24.490> player

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
Windows 7 on this from the DVD player

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.750 
Windows 7 on this from the DVD player
later<00:05:25.990> on<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:28.810> looks<00:05:29.290> like<00:05:29.760> everything

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
later on and so it looks like everything

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.480 
later on and so it looks like everything
is<00:05:30.940> working<00:05:30.970> fine<00:05:31.540> so<00:05:31.930> far<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:33.220> this<00:05:33.370> has

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
is working fine so far and so this has

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.860 
is working fine so far and so this has
been<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.670> pretty<00:05:33.940> successful<00:05:35.490> basic<00:05:36.490> build<00:05:37.420> of

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
been a pretty successful basic build of

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.050 
been a pretty successful basic build of
a<00:05:37.990> computer<00:05:38.530> not<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:38.980> whole<00:05:39.220> lot<00:05:39.400> fancy<00:05:39.850> going

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
a computer not a whole lot fancy going

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.970 
a computer not a whole lot fancy going
on<00:05:40.180> so<00:05:40.780> what<00:05:40.930> I'm<00:05:41.020> going<00:05:41.170> to<00:05:41.200> do<00:05:41.290> now<00:05:41.470> is<00:05:41.740> just

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
on so what I'm going to do now is just

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.430 
on so what I'm going to do now is just
use<00:05:42.130> some<00:05:42.310> cable<00:05:42.640> ties<00:05:42.850> to<00:05:43.420> organize<00:05:44.230> these

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
use some cable ties to organize these

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.620 
use some cable ties to organize these
cables<00:05:44.920> a<00:05:45.010> little<00:05:45.250> bit<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.670> make<00:05:46.120> sure<00:05:46.360> that

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
cables a little bit and make sure that

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.620 
cables a little bit and make sure that
these<00:05:46.750> cables<00:05:47.260> don't<00:05:47.410> hit<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:48.400> fans<00:05:48.670> and<00:05:49.180> make

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
these cables don't hit the fans and make

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.990 
these cables don't hit the fans and make
noise<00:05:49.900> and<00:05:50.320> slow<00:05:50.710> everything<00:05:50.980> down<00:05:51.130> but

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
noise and slow everything down but

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.760 
noise and slow everything down but
otherwise<00:05:52.270> I<00:05:52.630> think<00:05:52.690> we're<00:05:52.960> done<00:05:53.080> it's<00:05:53.560> a

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
otherwise I think we're done it's a

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.030 
otherwise I think we're done it's a
pretty<00:05:54.100> pretty<00:05:54.520> successful<00:05:55.150> build<00:05:56.040> Austin

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040

all the fans seem to be working and the

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.720 
all the fans seem to be working and the
computer<00:06:07.900> posted<00:06:08.560> that<00:06:09.130> just<00:06:09.340> means<00:06:09.520> that

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
computer posted that just means that

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
this came up successfully and we didn't

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.130 
this came up successfully and we didn't
get<00:06:11.890> any<00:06:12.070> error<00:06:12.280> beeps<00:06:12.610> so<00:06:13.510> everything's<00:06:13.900> fine

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
get any error beeps so everything's fine

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.380 
get any error beeps so everything's fine
so<00:06:14.380> this<00:06:14.500> is<00:06:14.620> Berkey<00:06:14.920> academy<00:06:15.400> signing<00:06:16.240> off
