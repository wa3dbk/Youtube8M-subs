whatever she doesn't use she expels out
the<00:02:03.490> other<00:02:03.640> end<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.600> need<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.869> do<00:02:04.990> something

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
the other end and I need to do something

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.730 
the other end and I need to do something
with<00:02:05.500> that

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
with that

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.609 
with that
so<00:02:06.460> we<00:02:07.240> manage<00:02:07.689> that<00:02:07.960> manure

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
so we manage that manure

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.250 
so we manage that manure
and<00:02:09.340> that's<00:02:09.610> another<00:02:09.940> driving<00:02:10.450> system<00:02:10.959> on<00:02:11.080> my

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and that's another driving system on my

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.830 
and that's another driving system on my
dairy<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.800> methane<00:02:12.459> digester<00:02:13.150> handles<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.629> lot

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
dairy a methane digester handles a lot

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.199 
dairy a methane digester handles a lot
of<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.459> material<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.610> turns<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.120> into

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
of that material and turns it into

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.030 
of that material and turns it into
things<00:02:16.629> that<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.810> can<00:02:17.080> use<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.500> my<00:02:17.620> farmers

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
things that I can use that my farmers

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.220 
things that I can use that my farmers
can<00:02:18.250> use<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.269> cow<00:02:19.420> can<00:02:19.660> reuse<00:02:20.050> in

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
can use and that the cow can reuse in

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.140 
can use and that the cow can reuse in
the<00:02:20.319> end<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.800> think<00:02:21.280> gas<00:02:21.489> is<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> exact<00:02:22.000> same

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
the end I think gas is the exact same

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.790 
the end I think gas is the exact same
thing<00:02:22.209> as<00:02:22.480> natural<00:02:22.840> gas<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.200> I'll<00:02:23.260> spark<00:02:23.620> that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
thing as natural gas and I'll spark that

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.150 
thing as natural gas and I'll spark that
methane<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.900> turn<00:02:26.080> an<00:02:26.260> engine<00:02:26.590> these<00:02:26.890> large

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
methane to to turn an engine these large

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.430 
methane to to turn an engine these large
engines<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.849> turn<00:02:28.120> run<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> generator<00:02:28.870> which

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
engines in turn run a generator which

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.070 
engines in turn run a generator which
creates<00:02:29.739> electricity<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:31.090> converted

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
creates electricity so I have converted

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.369 
creates electricity so I have converted
