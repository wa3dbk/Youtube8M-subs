you<00:01:36.540> will<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.200> very<00:01:37.409> cool<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.770> charging<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you will it's very cool for charging and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.710 
you will it's very cool for charging and
we<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.430> did<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> video<00:01:38.850> demo<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
we actually did a video demo on this and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.910 
we actually did a video demo on this and
I'll<00:01:39.780> put<00:01:39.930> an<00:01:40.020> annotation<00:01:40.079> right<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.890> there

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
I'll put an annotation right up there

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.929 
I'll put an annotation right up there
move<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> side<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.490> our<00:01:44.820> new

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
move to the side and we have our new

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.700 
move to the side and we have our new
nano<00:01:45.210> SIM<00:01:45.509> tray<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> different<00:01:46.530> SIM

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
nano SIM tray so it is a different SIM

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.219 
nano SIM tray so it is a different SIM
card<00:01:46.920> than<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.220> standard<00:01:47.430> micro<00:01:48.299> SIM<00:01:48.720> that's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
card than your standard micro SIM that's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.560 
card than your standard micro SIM that's
kind<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.470> cool<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.850> coming<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> top<00:01:51.420> we

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
kind of cool then coming to the top we

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.450 
kind of cool then coming to the top we
have<00:01:51.720> our<00:01:51.750> power<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.680> power<00:01:52.710> off<00:01:53.100> button

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
have our power on and power off button

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.850 
have our power on and power off button
and<00:01:53.490> then<00:01:53.880> nothing<00:01:54.149> else<00:01:54.420> over<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:54.860> so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and then nothing else over here so

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.350 
and then nothing else over here so
another<00:01:56.009> important<00:01:56.460> face<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:56.969> phone<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
another important face on this phone is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
another important face on this phone is
the<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.049> they<00:01:58.140> did<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> lot<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.740> cool

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the back and they did a lot of cool

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.649 
the back and they did a lot of cool
things<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> back<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.299> like

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
things to the back in which I do like

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.749 
things to the back in which I do like
with<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> 8<00:02:01.710> megapixel<00:02:02.219> camera<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.549> didn't

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
with the 8 megapixel camera it didn't

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.459 
with the 8 megapixel camera it didn't
change<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.119> terms<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.450> megapixels<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
change in terms of megapixels but it is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.800 
change in terms of megapixels but it is
made<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.799> sapphire<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> LED

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
made out of sapphire we have the LED

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.169 
made out of sapphire we have the LED
there<00:02:07.290> LED<00:02:07.770> flash<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.090> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
there LED flash and then we have this

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
there LED flash and then we have this
kind<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> black<00:02:09.780> slate<00:02:10.140> backing<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.860> see

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
kind of black slate backing you can see

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
kind of black slate backing you can see
how<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.220> two-tone<00:02:11.610> from<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.910> black<00:02:12.270> to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.580 
how it's two-tone from a black to
aluminum<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.349> 2

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
aluminum and this is 2

the aluminum is supposed to do is keep

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.509 
the aluminum is supposed to do is keep
it<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:27.810> bit<00:02:28.080> more<00:02:28.200> safe<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.190> report

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
it a little bit more safe but one report

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.490 
it a little bit more safe but one report
is<00:02:29.670> saying<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.450> aluminum<00:02:30.780> scratch<00:02:31.049> is<00:02:31.230> easier

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
is saying the aluminum scratch is easier

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.500 
is saying the aluminum scratch is easier
so<00:02:31.860> there's<00:02:32.700> pros<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:32.910> cons<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.269> everything

comment<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.620> really<00:02:46.829> have<00:02:47.040> about<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> back

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
comment I really have about the back

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.160 
comment I really have about the back
it's<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.299> fact<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> grease<00:02:49.140> monkey

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
it's the fact that it's a grease monkey

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
it's the fact that it's a grease monkey
and<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.709> picks<00:02:49.920> up<00:02:50.099> every<00:02:50.370> single<00:02:50.519> fingerprint

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
and it picks up every single fingerprint

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.120 
and it picks up every single fingerprint
I<00:02:51.209> put<00:02:51.599> on<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> guess<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:52.890> get

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
I put on it but I guess I can just get

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.880 
I put on it but I guess I can just get

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
you set as time goes on in the fact that

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.309 
you set as time goes on in the fact that
it<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.430> new<00:02:56.670> iPhone<00:02:57.209> 5<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.079> if<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.230> guys
