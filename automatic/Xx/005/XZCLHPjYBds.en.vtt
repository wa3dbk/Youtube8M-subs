00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
everybody what this enables you to do is

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.650 
everybody what this enables you to do is
this<00:03:25.100> turn<00:03:25.370> your<00:03:25.519> fan<00:03:25.730> off<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.180> it's<00:03:26.329> running

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
this turn your fan off if it's running

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.599 
this turn your fan off if it's running
you're<00:03:26.870> about<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.140> go<00:03:27.260> go<00:03:27.739> in<00:03:27.920> deep<00:03:28.100> mud<00:03:28.370> or

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
you're about to go go in deep mud or

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:35.080 
you're about to go go in deep mud or
water<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:30.709> also<00:03:30.890> allows<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:33.850> cut<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.880> off

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
water it also allows you to cut it off

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.729 
water it also allows you to cut it off
if<00:03:35.299> you're<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.600> a<00:03:35.690> hole<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:36.049> for<00:03:36.319> some<00:03:36.500> reason

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
if you're in a hole in for some reason

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.949 
if you're in a hole in for some reason
it<00:03:36.859> kicked<00:03:37.069> on<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:38.090> basically<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.720> theory

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
it kicked on so basically the theory

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.050 
it kicked on so basically the theory
behind<00:03:39.109> it<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.739> that<00:03:39.950> when<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.640> cut<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:40.970> in

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
behind it is is that when you cut it in

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.340 
behind it is is that when you cut it in
four-wheel<00:03:41.299> drive<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.810> go<00:03:41.900> through<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.139> mud

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
four-wheel drive to go through the mud

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.890 
four-wheel drive to go through the mud
you<00:03:42.650> cut<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:43.310> switch<00:03:43.549> off<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.660> then<00:03:44.810> they

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
you cut this switch off and then they

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.569 
you cut this switch off and then they
cut<00:03:45.079> your<00:03:45.200> fan<00:03:45.440> power<00:03:45.680> otherwise<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.430> leave

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
cut your fan power otherwise you leave

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.819 
cut your fan power otherwise you leave
it<00:03:46.700> on<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.269> your<00:03:47.359> fan<00:03:47.569> kicks<00:03:47.840> on<00:03:48.049> as<00:03:48.230> normal<00:03:48.440> so

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
it on and your fan kicks on as normal so

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.750 
it on and your fan kicks on as normal so
it'll<00:03:49.549> still<00:03:49.760> use<00:03:50.000> your<00:03:51.310> you'll<00:03:52.310> still<00:03:52.489> use

it'll still use your you'll still use

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.149 
it'll still use your you'll still use
your<00:03:52.970> factory<00:03:53.390> relay<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:54.379> switch<00:03:54.620> on<00:03:54.830> whenever

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.950 
pancakes all for this light will go off
with<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.430> powers<00:04:40.910> running<00:04:41.300> from<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.660> relay

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
with the powers running from the relay

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.200 
with the powers running from the relay
through<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:42.980> wire<00:04:43.160> they<00:04:43.430> touch<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.790> panel

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
through the wire they touch the panel

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.560 
through the wire they touch the panel
just<00:04:44.690> like<00:04:44.930> now<00:04:45.400> so<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.520> goes<00:04:46.730> one<00:04:47.030> as<00:04:47.300> long<00:04:47.480> as

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
just like now so it goes one as long as

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.460 
just like now so it goes one as long as
you<00:04:47.690> leave<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.990> on<00:04:48.110> when<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.440> temperature

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
you leave it on when the temperature

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.890 
you leave it on when the temperature
gives<00:04:49.070> up<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.520> fan<00:04:50.060> will<00:04:50.270> cut<00:04:50.420> it<00:04:50.510> off<00:04:50.630> if<00:04:50.780> you

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
gives up the fan will cut it off if you

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900 
gives up the fan will cut it off if you
leave<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.110> off<00:04:51.410> when<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.310> temperature<00:04:52.730> gets

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
leave it off when the temperature gets

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.760 
leave it off when the temperature gets
there<00:04:53.180> it'll<00:04:53.480> light<00:04:53.690> up<00:04:53.720> but<00:04:54.170> it<00:04:54.260> will<00:04:54.380> not<00:04:54.560> cut

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
there it'll light up but it will not cut

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.470 
there it'll light up but it will not cut
off<00:04:54.950> so<00:04:55.520> if<00:04:55.610> you're<00:04:55.640> going<00:04:55.850> through<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:56.090> muddle

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
off so if you're going through a muddle

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.620 
off so if you're going through a muddle
light<00:04:56.930> up<00:04:57.200> your<00:04:57.890> temperatures<00:04:58.460> out<00:04:58.700> goes<00:04:59.420> up

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
light up your temperatures out goes up

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.360 
light up your temperatures out goes up
so<00:05:00.230> you<00:05:00.290> get<00:05:00.470> out<00:05:00.590> of<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.710> muddle<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.130> flip<00:05:01.340> it

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
so you get out of the muddle you flip it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.910 
so you get out of the muddle you flip it
on<00:05:01.610> your<00:05:01.850> thing<00:05:02.180> comes<00:05:02.450> on<00:05:02.600> this<00:05:03.440> keeps<00:05:03.800> on

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
on your thing comes on this keeps on

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.120 
on your thing comes on this keeps on
breaking<00:05:04.100> example<00:05:04.790> ease<00:05:04.910> off
