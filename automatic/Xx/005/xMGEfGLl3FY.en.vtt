 most impressive fashion shows 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.860

 here accompanied to make the review of 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.900

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.670
 sponsored by nextel with oscar de la 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.570

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.840
 gonzález and many more designers 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 nobody reads what was your favorite look in 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.430
 catwalk because I think all those who 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.340
 they had hats they were my favorites and 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.520
 also all those who brought as a blazer 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.010
 and the skirt that was creek 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.660
 to the knee they were incredible is something 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.060
 very interesting that we saw on the catwalk 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.040
 the incredibly oscar dresses of the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.260
 rent with these Andalusian style shoulders 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.570
 with the taunts they give a masculine touch 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.489
 that now must go to look sublime 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.110
 what do you think about candice swanepoel with 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 this set of striped dots 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.450
 incredible apart from the triples 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.040
 velvety of damn and totally 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.400
 it shows that it is called victory 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.440
 secrets from the walk all feel is 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.990
 the present that is made has been in 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.460
 the best parades something also very 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.490
 interesting fashionable friends in the city 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.410
 is that the fabrics there is something that is not 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.280
 can explain when you see a parade 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.690
 where the designer included fabrics 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.880
 incredibly expensive 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.950
 the feeling of luxury that you transmit or 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.980
 let's talk about the dresses with pallets 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.250
 with finished sequins good 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.780
 It was amazing what I had with 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.740
 bright from here up to down 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.750
 j 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.500
 I'm incredible incredible or is it really 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.330
 you realize when they put their 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.520
 his civilians and put the fabrics 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.440
 fabrics were as impeccable silhouettes 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.260
 They were impeccable everything was like 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.060
 flattering for the girls that to me 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.280
 loved it I can not say no to nothing 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 good that I do not like so much 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.340
 of course as Oscar said of the rent 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.990
 at the press conference wants to dress 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.730
 all mexicanas all mexicanas 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.130
 let's hope they have the money to use 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.140
 Oscar from the rent something also very very 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.060
 interesting in the parade was this 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.560
 viewer collection no other for those who do not 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.100
 they are familiar we already had 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.620
 commented 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.870
 earlier are collections made for 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.300
 the vacationers are obviously not 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.460
 talking about a select elite group of 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.850
 the jet-set that spends money on having a 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.560
 wardrobe of between seasons that 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.480
 many joys are wearing the garments 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.490
 from the resort collection to give it as 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.500
 a little bit of freshness these looks that 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.840
 we already saw on the catwalk and they are very 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.190
 seen not of the season another thing very 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.420
 interesting was the purple dress 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.760
 It was totally for sale 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.430
 remember that it has an incredible cauda 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.290
 that you thought was incredible, not the truth 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.900
 it was quite an experience to see these 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.270
 wishes to see this parade to the skin 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.320
 is subject with successes to the fall of the 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.210
 cloth all all super father the feet is 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.220
 another very important point the silhouettes 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.830
 with jerseys and belts that were 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.450
 totally preppy and very glamorous not 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.870
 We're talking to Oscar de la Renta 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.370
 has been the dictator of the group 's 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.980
 new york luxury together with carolina 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.410
 guevara who have truly contributed 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.960
 a very glamorous aesthetic vision of what 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.700
 that is a sophisticated woman to the 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.060
 dresses that have like this 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.360
 integration of the jersey from this point with 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.540
 skirt were fabulous hats 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.360
 the shoes were real good and you go 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.860
 the platforms totally is something very 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.440
 interesting you see a collection 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.300
 congruent and that is something that sometimes does not 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.220
 we see a lot on the catwalks that yes 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.380
 strange to see in Mexico not like all 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.390
 we are now with the internet it is impossible 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.920
 enter of what is given in the world and of 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.930
 suddenly sitges 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.599
 and a congruent look from head to toe and 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.790
 that the rent does not come out we saw more than 50 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.260
 lux consistent from head to toe the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.190
 male models that are not like 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.989
 our favorite thing not even the 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.310
 true this is definitely going to be 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.069
 a parade that will mark history in 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.739
 the income country of the rent but give us 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.290
 an idea of why it is to rent oscar 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.300
 apart from other guys the designers 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.760
 that are just beginning and that have 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.210
 a very bad attitude they would have to put 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.510
 attention on this in the chain this gentleman 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.510
 he still does not really know if he is where he is 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.970
 but it is where it was because that is how it is 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.430
 they should learn a lot from him and to 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.310
 I was like part of always I've 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.130
 looked but now to know it is to be 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.110
 a much more admirable person is something 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.580
 very important not the same young people 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.770
 these people that are more related to 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.540
 avant-garde tendencies or with silhouettes 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.430
 a little bit more constructive and everything 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.220
 that made the oscar of the rent see a 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.330
 impeccable complexion a textile choice 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.699
 that leaves you 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.759
 without breathing and in the end the casting of 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.099
 models is another thing that you appreciate a lot 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:10.240
 in a parade see models that carry the 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:12.639
 silhouettes as they should take them very nice 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.590
 I really loved it and in the end we 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.969
 we are left with that and more the city as 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.189
 always the best moments most 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.509
 dawn accompanying us and good I want 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.069
 thanks to alfredo martínez with my 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.110
 tie and in person also by me 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.599
 jacket are two designers of 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.280
 Guadalajara incredible young people nobody reads 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.900
 She is a great stylist who works with 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.580
 many young designers as you see 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.830
 now that sight looking for the rent in 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.240
 catwalk the young design market in 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.190
 mexico the truth all are now in 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.860
 Mexico like things are happening 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.560
 bad there are many people who are doing 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.139
 that things happen but eye that they have 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.210
 to see that with the confection is 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.819
 super super super important can you 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.789
 be a dress but if the thread is 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.560
 is going out halfway through the middle of the catwalk and 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.689
 they are making a proposal of a cloth 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.279
 very expensive and selling the most expensive 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.399
 obviously it will follow you with a 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.569
 designer that I know that if you exhibit it the 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:06.659
 pity you do not see 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.299
 I will not mention names but 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.769
 you lost or if you realize that you see 

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:14.799
 Other prices from other designers 

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:18.819
 young and they are super badly made 

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:20.199
 and it's not something that says super original anymore 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.610
 it's not worth it they have to sound the 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.459
 attention in everything that is the confection 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.590
 is very very very important and see that the 

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:31.260
 fall fabric you have to give 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.080
 As it moves the fabric is more stable than 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.930
 that we saw right now that is the fabric was moving 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.690
 but it seemed like it was part of the 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.920
 girls exactly good at the end all 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.900
 we want our money to be good 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.400
 inverted and not feeling stolen is not 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.350
 something very important when you spend money 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.300
 in fashion you always want to feel that you 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.130
 you were the one who made the good choice 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.780

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.600
