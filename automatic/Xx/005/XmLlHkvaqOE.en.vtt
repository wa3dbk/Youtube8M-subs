00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.520 
sec since the half 9-3 to Black Edition
isn't<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.630> different<00:01:18.990> from<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
isn't actually that different from the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.410 
isn't actually that different from the
regular<00:01:19.680> half<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.939> more<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
regular half this is going to be more of

special highlight on the features that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859 
special highlight on the features that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that is one of the key differences other

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
that is one of the key differences other
than<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> case<00:01:33.240> looks<00:01:33.600> pretty<00:01:34.229> much<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
than that the case looks pretty much the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
than that the case looks pretty much the
same<00:01:34.650> from<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> outside<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.759> we'll<00:01:35.939> start<00:01:36.090> on

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
same from the outside so we'll start on

for a 230 millimeter fan or you have
support<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.560> dual<00:01:52.920> 120<00:01:53.850> millimeter<00:01:54.479> fans<00:01:54.990> so

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
support for dual 120 millimeter fans so

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499

why<00:04:01.989> don't<00:04:02.140> we<00:04:02.170> start<00:04:02.620> from<00:04:03.180> front<00:04:04.260> or<00:04:05.260> rather

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
why don't we start from front or rather

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.259 
why don't we start from front or rather
from<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.650> side<00:04:05.890> ok<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.760> first<00:04:06.910> thing<00:04:07.060> we

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
from the side ok so the first thing we

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.790 
from the side ok so the first thing we
see<00:04:07.420> here<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.840> GPU<00:04:08.290> duct

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
see here is a GPU duct

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.220 
see here is a GPU duct
alright<00:04:09.640> that's<00:04:09.880> fairly<00:04:10.239> obvious<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.989> does

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
alright that's fairly obvious it does

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.050 
alright that's fairly obvious it does
come<00:04:11.560> out<00:04:11.739> if<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.190> don't<00:04:12.340> want<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.700> use<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.030> so

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
come out if you don't want to use it so

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.670 
come out if you don't want to use it so
there's<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.420> couple<00:04:13.570> thumb<00:04:13.870> screws<00:04:14.200> holding<00:04:14.530> it

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
there's a couple thumb screws holding it

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.220 
there's a couple thumb screws holding it
in<00:04:14.800> but<00:04:15.430> it's<00:04:15.760> there<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.630> guess<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.049> might

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
in but it's there so I guess you might

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.960 
in but it's there so I guess you might
as<00:04:17.380> well<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.919> might<00:04:18.070> as<00:04:18.190> well<00:04:18.250> make<00:04:18.459> use<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.730> it

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
as well you might as well make use of it

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.430 
as well you might as well make use of it
it<00:04:19.479> looks<00:04:19.539> like

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.309 

you<00:04:25.440> can<00:04:25.650> probably<00:04:26.009> put<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> fan<00:04:26.879> in<00:04:26.910> there<00:04:27.300> yep

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
you can probably put a fan in there yep

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.320 
you can probably put a fan in there yep
it's<00:04:28.710> got<00:04:28.919> mounting<00:04:29.280> holes<00:04:29.460> for<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.729> 120

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
it's got mounting holes for a 120

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.180 
it's got mounting holes for a 120
millimeter<00:04:30.870> fan<00:04:31.139> so<00:04:31.620> that's<00:04:31.800> going<00:04:31.979> to<00:04:32.039> give

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
millimeter fan so that's going to give

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.610 
millimeter fan so that's going to give
you<00:04:32.310> airflow<00:04:32.819> directly<00:04:33.750> over<00:04:33.990> your<00:04:34.139> graphics

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
you airflow directly over your graphics

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.110 
you airflow directly over your graphics
cards<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.159> make<00:04:35.280> sure<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.669> they<00:04:35.789> do<00:04:35.849> not

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
cards to make sure that they do not

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.820 
cards to make sure that they do not
overheat<00:04:36.449> in<00:04:36.690> any<00:04:36.810> way<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.199> mean<00:04:37.560> you've<00:04:37.680> also

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
overheat in any way I mean you've also

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.460 
overheat in any way I mean you've also
got<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.490> 230<00:04:39.300> millimeter<00:04:39.720> fan<00:04:39.960> here<00:04:40.259> at<00:04:40.349> the

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
got a 230 millimeter fan here at the

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.320 
got a 230 millimeter fan here at the
front<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.889> case<00:04:41.069> but<00:04:41.580> what<00:04:41.729> this<00:04:41.909> does<00:04:41.970> is

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
front of the case but what this does is

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.740 
front of the case but what this does is
it<00:04:42.449> just<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:43.800> provides<00:04:44.610> a<00:04:44.729> push-pull<00:04:45.300> scenario

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
it just it provides a push-pull scenario

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.999 
it just it provides a push-pull scenario
so<00:04:45.960> where<00:04:46.110> if<00:04:46.199> you<00:04:46.289> have<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> ton<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.710> drives

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
so where if you have a ton of drives

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.279 
so where if you have a ton of drives
here<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.400> it's<00:04:47.520> a<00:04:47.639> restricted<00:04:48.330> space<00:04:48.810> you're

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
here and it's a restricted space you're

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.480 
here and it's a restricted space you're
going<00:04:49.319> to<00:04:49.470> be<00:04:49.590> able<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.860> force<00:04:50.159> more<00:04:50.430> air

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
going to be able to force more air

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.980 
going to be able to force more air
through<00:04:50.819> the<00:04:50.909> front<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.240> case<00:04:51.419> directly

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
through the front of the case directly

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.409 
through the front of the case directly
over<00:04:52.379> the<00:04:52.500> GPU<00:04:52.979> by<00:04:53.400> setting<00:04:53.729> up<00:04:53.879> both<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.330> those

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
over the GPU by setting up both of those

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.020 
over the GPU by setting up both of those
fans<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.080> speaking<00:04:55.319> of<00:04:55.560> drives<00:04:56.460> we<00:04:56.759> have

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
fans so speaking of drives we have

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.620 
fans so speaking of drives we have
support<00:04:57.599> for<00:04:57.990> five<00:04:59.060> three<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.210> half<00:05:00.360> inch

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
support for five three and a half inch

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.770 
support for five three and a half inch
drives<00:05:00.960> we<00:05:01.259> have<00:05:01.500> one<00:05:02.009> SSD<00:05:02.729> rail<00:05:02.970> here<00:05:03.599> and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
drives we have one SSD rail here and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.890 
drives we have one SSD rail here and
then<00:05:04.590> supposedly<00:05:05.550> support<00:05:06.060> for<00:05:06.240> another<00:05:06.449> SSD

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
then supposedly support for another SSD

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.029 
then supposedly support for another SSD
somewhere<00:05:07.259> but<00:05:07.380> I'll<00:05:07.470> have<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.620> figure<00:05:08.009> out

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
somewhere but I'll have to figure out

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.730 
somewhere but I'll have to figure out
where<00:05:08.909> that<00:05:09.120> is<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.360> little<00:05:09.750> bit<00:05:09.870> later<00:05:10.319> on<00:05:10.560> in

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
where that is a little bit later on in

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.129 
where that is a little bit later on in
the<00:05:10.830> process<00:05:11.069> here<00:05:11.550> because<00:05:11.849> I<00:05:12.030> don't<00:05:12.389> see<00:05:12.990> it

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
the process here because I don't see it

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.899 
the process here because I don't see it
yet<00:05:14.389> interesting<00:05:15.389> okay<00:05:16.169> down<00:05:17.099> here<00:05:17.460> we've<00:05:17.699> got

up<00:07:03.640> with<00:07:03.670> hardwire<00:07:04.180> hardware<00:07:04.780> so<00:07:05.230> it<00:07:05.260> does

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
up with hardwire hardware so it does

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.950 
up with hardwire hardware so it does
come<00:07:05.860> we<00:07:06.190> have<00:07:06.280> casters<00:07:06.910> so<00:07:07.120> that<00:07:07.660> you<00:07:07.750> don't

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
come we have casters so that you don't

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.910 
come we have casters so that you don't
have<00:07:08.260> trouble<00:07:08.620> moving<00:07:09.190> it<00:07:09.550> around<00:07:10.710> all<00:07:11.710> right

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:11.920 
have trouble moving it around all right

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.160 
have trouble moving it around all right
other<00:07:12.070> features<00:07:12.490> let's<00:07:13.390> see<00:07:13.540> yeah<00:07:13.690> we're

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.170 
other features let's see yeah we're

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.630 
other features let's see yeah we're
getting<00:07:14.380> pretty<00:07:14.530> close<00:07:14.740> so<00:07:14.980> here's<00:07:15.190> our<00:07:15.460> other

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
getting pretty close so here's our other

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.120 
getting pretty close so here's our other
230<00:07:16.390> millimeter<00:07:16.780> fan<00:07:17.020> this<00:07:17.200> is<00:07:17.320> not<00:07:17.530> an<00:07:17.680> LED

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
230 millimeter fan this is not an LED

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.970 
230 millimeter fan this is not an LED
one<00:07:18.280> the<00:07:18.430> one<00:07:18.580> in<00:07:18.670> the<00:07:18.790> front<00:07:18.940> however<00:07:19.570> is<00:07:20.140> we

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980 
one the one in the front however is we

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.970 
one the one in the front however is we
do<00:07:21.100> have<00:07:21.220> a<00:07:21.280> CPU<00:07:21.870> cutout<00:07:22.870> so<00:07:23.440> what<00:07:23.620> that<00:07:23.740> means

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980 
do have a CPU cutout so what that means

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.620 
do have a CPU cutout so what that means
is<00:07:24.190> that<00:07:24.220> you<00:07:24.460> can<00:07:24.670> swap<00:07:24.970> your<00:07:25.030> CPU<00:07:25.570> cooler

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630 
is that you can swap your CPU cooler

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.720 
is that you can swap your CPU cooler
even<00:07:26.200> without<00:07:26.620> taking<00:07:27.010> out<00:07:27.130> the<00:07:27.250> motherboard

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730 
even without taking out the motherboard

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.970 
even without taking out the motherboard
even<00:07:28.210> if<00:07:28.330> it<00:07:28.480> uses<00:07:28.750> a<00:07:28.780> backplate<00:07:29.290> you've<00:07:29.830> got

even if it uses a backplate you've got
your<00:07:30.130> standard<00:07:30.400> spot<00:07:30.940> for<00:07:31.330> your<00:07:31.450> IO<00:07:31.630> here<00:07:32.380> and
