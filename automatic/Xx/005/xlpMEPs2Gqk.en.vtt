00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
see the expression when they hop off the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
see the expression when they hop off the
bike<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.460> summit's<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.240> acceleration<00:01:31.020> that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
bike the summit's the acceleration that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.960 
bike the summit's the acceleration that
just<00:01:31.410> blows<00:01:31.619> their<00:01:31.920> mind<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.670> others

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
just blows their mind and for others

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630 
just blows their mind and for others
it's<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> braking<00:01:34.200> performance<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.009> then

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it's the braking performance and then

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
it's the braking performance and then
for<00:01:35.940> others<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> feeling<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.050> using<00:01:37.380> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
for others just the feeling of using the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.190 
for others just the feeling of using the
quick<00:01:37.649> shift<00:01:37.950> system<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.610> amazing<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:39.390> yeah

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
quick shift system is amazing so yeah

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.469 
quick shift system is amazing so yeah
we're<00:01:40.410> here<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.920> show<00:01:41.729> customers<00:01:42.300> how

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the bikes work on a great race track you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
the bikes work on a great race track you
can't<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:46.080> get<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.440> quality<00:01:47.009> test<00:01:47.490> ride<00:01:47.759> on

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
can't really get a quality test ride on

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
can't really get a quality test ride on
the<00:01:48.570> road<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> dealership<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.890> pretty

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the road out of a dealership it's pretty

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.499 
the road out of a dealership it's pretty
tricky<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> bike<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.179> level<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
tricky with a bike with this level of

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.719 
tricky with a bike with this level of
performance<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.289> we<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.070> set<00:01:53.310> up<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.580> day

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
performance so we really set up the day

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.350 
performance so we really set up the day
so<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.210> safe<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:55.289> fun<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.729> everyone<00:01:57.060> has<00:01:57.330> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
so it's safe it's fun and everyone has a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
so it's safe it's fun and everyone has a
ball

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.740 

the<00:02:09.069> experience<00:02:09.640> they<00:02:09.789> get<00:02:10.119> when<00:02:10.360> they<00:02:10.390> ride

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
the experience they get when they ride

the experience they get when they ride
the<00:02:10.959> bike<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.319> this<00:02:11.470> situation<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:12.160> very

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
the bike in this situation is very

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.890 
the bike in this situation is very
powerful<00:02:12.940> they<00:02:13.120> hop<00:02:13.330> off<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.690> bike<00:02:13.870> and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
powerful they hop off the bike and

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.839 
powerful they hop off the bike and
they've<00:02:14.290> never<00:02:14.500> felt<00:02:14.920> those<00:02:15.190> feelings<00:02:15.220> of

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
they've never felt those feelings of

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.360 
they've never felt those feelings of
acceleration<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.989> breaking<00:02:17.650> they've<00:02:18.190> never

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
acceleration of breaking they've never

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.000 
acceleration of breaking they've never
felt<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.730> quick<00:02:18.970> shift<00:02:19.209> before<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.290> they<00:02:20.800> live

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
felt a quick shift before so they live

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.220 
felt a quick shift before so they live
here<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.849> excited<00:02:22.420> they<00:02:22.599> probably<00:02:22.810> half<00:02:23.200> of

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
here so excited they probably half of

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.750 
here so excited they probably half of
them<00:02:23.500> are<00:02:23.620> probably<00:02:23.739> thinking<00:02:24.099> about<00:02:24.519> how<00:02:24.700> to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
them are probably thinking about how to

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.839 
them are probably thinking about how to
sell<00:02:25.090> their<00:02:25.630> current<00:02:26.050> bike<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.730> know

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
sell their current bike and you know

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.670 
sell their current bike and you know
think<00:02:28.120> about<00:02:28.330> getting<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.630> boom<00:02:28.810> w<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.349> you

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
think about getting a boom w and you

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.050 
think about getting a boom w and you
know<00:02:29.800> that's<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> bad<00:02:30.459> thing<00:02:30.489> that's<00:02:30.910> why

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
know that's not a bad thing that's why

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.089 
know that's not a bad thing that's why
we're<00:02:31.239> here<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.660> was<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.769> immense

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
we're here I was just just the immense

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.800 
we're here I was just just the immense
amount<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.550> power<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.209> handling<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
amount of power and the handling the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.720 
amount of power and the handling the
braking<00:02:35.290> look<00:02:35.500> everything<00:02:35.950> he<00:02:36.069> just<00:02:36.099> works<00:02:36.580> so

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
braking look everything he just works so

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.160 
braking look everything he just works so
well<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:37.390> make<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.630> hard<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.050> back

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
well it's just make it hard to get back

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.780 
well it's just make it hard to get back
onto<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.440> original<00:02:38.739> box<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:39.459> selling<00:02:39.730> it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
onto the original box I'm selling it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.300 
onto the original box I'm selling it
tomorrow<00:02:40.030> okay<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:43.090> got<00:02:43.239> plenty<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.630> power

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
tomorrow okay it's got plenty of power

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.250 
tomorrow okay it's got plenty of power
the<00:02:45.310> electronic<00:02:45.790> shift<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.569> pretty<00:02:46.870> good<00:02:46.989> it's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
the electronic shift is pretty good it's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.020 
the electronic shift is pretty good it's
it's<00:02:47.769> an<00:02:47.860> excellent<00:02:48.130> way<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.370> change<00:02:48.730> gears

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
it's an excellent way to change gears

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.210 
it's an excellent way to change gears
it's<00:02:49.269> really<00:02:49.870> really<00:02:50.590> quick<00:02:50.799> and<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.040> probably
