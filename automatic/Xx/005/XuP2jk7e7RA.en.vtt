improve their mapping system that one's

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:08.699 
improve their mapping system that one's
kind<00:01:07.719> of<00:01:07.749> relevant<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.200> lot<00:01:08.319> of<00:01:08.380> people<00:01:08.560> don't

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:08.709

kind of relevant a lot of people don't
want<00:01:08.859> that<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.429> that's<00:01:09.670> how<00:01:09.759> you<00:01:09.819> turn<00:01:09.939> it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
want that on and that's how you turn it

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.359 
want that on and that's how you turn it
off<00:01:10.179> and<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:11.799> pretty<00:01:11.920> much<00:01:12.009> it<00:01:12.100> for<00:01:12.189> that

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
off and that's pretty much it for that

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.580 
off and that's pretty much it for that
it's<00:01:13.149> a<00:01:13.240> really<00:01:13.420> interesting<00:01:13.590> interesting

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
it's a really interesting interesting

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.769 
it's a really interesting interesting
concept<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.639> would<00:01:16.240> definitely<00:01:16.359> ferment

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:16.779 
concept I would definitely ferment

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:18.179 
concept I would definitely ferment
actually<00:01:17.049> turning<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:17.380> off<00:01:17.590> just<00:01:17.829> because<00:01:18.009> I

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
actually turning it off just because I

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.489 
actually turning it off just because I
don't<00:01:18.369> really<00:01:18.459> see<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:19.149> a<00:01:19.450> ton<00:01:19.869> of<00:01:19.899> use<00:01:20.139> for<00:01:20.409> it

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
don't really see the a ton of use for it

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.440 
don't really see the a ton of use for it
and<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:21.039> actually<00:01:21.130> takes<00:01:21.490> up<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.909> quite<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.299> bit

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
and it actually takes up a quite a bit

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.629 
and it actually takes up a quite a bit
of<00:01:22.539> your<00:01:22.630> battery<00:01:23.049> it's<00:01:23.319> not<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.469> ton<00:01:23.829> but<00:01:23.859> it<00:01:24.520> is

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
of your battery it's not a ton but it is

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.340 
of your battery it's not a ton but it is
