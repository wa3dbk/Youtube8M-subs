00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
first the limit screws the thing to know

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.589 
first the limit screws the thing to know
about<00:00:10.710> these<00:00:10.950> limit<00:00:11.400> screws<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.450> they

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
about these limit screws is that they

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.509 
about these limit screws is that they
actually<00:00:12.840> do<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> name<00:00:13.769> implies<00:00:13.980> that

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
actually do what the name implies that

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.480 
actually do what the name implies that
they<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:15.690> determine<00:00:15.929> how<00:00:16.500> far<00:00:16.830> sideways

and<00:00:31.650> I'll<00:00:31.710> show<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.189> does<00:00:32.540> we<00:00:33.540> turn

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and I'll show you what it does we turn

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
and I'll show you what it does we turn
it<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.110> you'll<00:00:34.469> notice<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.070> pulley

it in you'll notice that that pulley
moves<00:00:35.880> inboard<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.739> when<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.860> let<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.219> out<00:00:38.340> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
moves inboard and when we let it out of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.970 
moves inboard and when we let it out of
course<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> moves<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> other<00:00:39.570> way<00:00:42.559> okay<00:00:43.559> let's

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
course it moves the other way okay let's

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.250 
course it moves the other way okay let's
do<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> real<00:00:44.370> live<00:00:44.579> adjustment<00:00:45.210> notice<00:00:46.110> how

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
do a real live adjustment notice how

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.590 
do a real live adjustment notice how
this<00:00:46.440> bike<00:00:46.649> shifts<00:00:47.219> we've<00:00:47.730> set<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.450> it's

leave you eight that by adjusting the
high<00:00:55.440> gear<00:00:55.770> limits<00:00:56.340> group<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:57.629> let<00:00:57.809> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
high gear limits group will let this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
high gear limits group will let this
screw<00:00:58.289> out<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.739> bit<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.460> will<00:00:59.579> allow

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
screw out a little bit and it will allow

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
screw out a little bit and it will allow
the<00:00:59.910> derailleur<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> move<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:01.109> farther

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the derailleur to move a little farther

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950

outboard<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> carry<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> chain<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
outboard and carry the chain with it and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640 
outboard and carry the chain with it and
it'll<00:01:04.080> shift<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.920> crisply<00:01:06.650> now

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it'll shift a little more crisply now

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.289 
it'll shift a little more crisply now
we've<00:01:07.830> set<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> derailleur<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
we've set up the derailleur so that it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.090 
we've set up the derailleur so that it
won't<00:01:09.390> shift<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> low<00:01:10.260> gear<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.710> big

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
won't shift into the low gear or big

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
won't shift into the low gear or big
 just<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.510> did<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> high

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
 just like we did with the high

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
 just like we did with the high
gears<00:01:13.439> we'll<00:01:13.920> let<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> low<00:01:14.369> gear<00:01:14.640> screw<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
gears we'll let the low gear screw out a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.880 
gears we'll let the low gear screw out a
little<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.110> derailleur<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.710> move

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
little and the derailleur will move

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
little and the derailleur will move
farther<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.490> board<00:01:17.790> carrying<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> chain<00:01:18.810> with

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
farther in board carrying the chain with

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.120 
farther in board carrying the chain with
it<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> onto<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> big<00:01:19.950> cog<00:01:21.710> now<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.979> we've

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it and onto the big cog now here we've

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
it and onto the big cog now here we've
set<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.580> scenario<00:01:23.729> where<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.450> derailleur

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
set up a scenario where the derailleur

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.530 
set up a scenario where the derailleur
moves<00:01:24.960> too<00:01:25.470> far<00:01:25.710> inboard<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.759> problem<00:01:27.210> here

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
moves too far inboard the problem here

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.330 
moves too far inboard the problem here
is<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> derailleur<00:01:28.560> moves<00:01:28.590> too<00:01:29.040> far

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
is that if the derailleur moves too far

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.580 
is that if the derailleur moves too far
in<00:01:29.549> board<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.240> will<00:01:30.329> overshoot<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> cog<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
in board it will overshoot the cog and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.679 
in board it will overshoot the cog and
throw<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> chain<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> spokes<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.329> we'll

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
throw the chain into the spokes so we'll

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.510 
throw the chain into the spokes so we'll
prevent<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> problem<00:01:34.470> by<00:01:34.950> turning<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.369> low

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
prevent that problem by turning the low

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
prevent that problem by turning the low
gear<00:01:35.700> screw<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:37.170> will<00:01:37.350> stop<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.920> limit

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
gear screw in this will stop or limit

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
gear screw in this will stop or limit
the<00:01:38.729> inboard<00:01:39.150> travel<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> derailleur<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the inboard travel of the derailleur and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.960 
the inboard travel of the derailleur and
prevent<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.009> throwing<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> chain<00:01:41.759> off

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
prevent it from throwing the chain off

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.639 
prevent it from throwing the chain off
you'll<00:01:42.570> notice<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> screw<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you'll notice that when the screw is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
you'll notice that when the screw is
properly<00:01:44.070> set<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.700> top<00:01:44.939> pulley<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.450> the

derailleur<00:01:46.049> will<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.590> directly<00:01:46.950> below<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
derailleur will be directly below the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
derailleur will be directly below the
center<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> big<00:01:48.030> cog<00:01:48.299> that's<00:01:48.930> how<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
center of the big cog that's how you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.389 
center of the big cog that's how you
know<00:01:49.409> when<00:01:49.530> you've<00:01:49.649> got<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.950> adjustment

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
know when you've got the adjustment

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.800 
know when you've got the adjustment
right<00:01:52.729> okay<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.790> let's<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> part<00:01:54.600> two<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
right okay so let's go to part two of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
right okay so let's go to part two of
our<00:01:55.049> discussion<00:01:55.110> which<00:01:55.829> has<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
our discussion which has to do with the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.370 
our discussion which has to do with the
barrel<00:01:56.880> adjuster<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.600> barrel<00:01:58.290> adjuster

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
barrel adjuster the barrel adjuster

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.709 
barrel adjuster the barrel adjuster
affects<00:01:59.130> any<00:01:59.430> shifting<00:01:59.909> problems<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.600> are

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
affects any shifting problems that are

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.270 
affects any shifting problems that are
going<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> middle<00:02:01.680> range<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
going on in the middle range of the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520 
going on in the middle range of the
cassette<00:02:02.869> here's<00:02:03.869> how<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.170> supposed<00:02:04.469> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
cassette here's how it's supposed to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.000 
cassette here's how it's supposed to
look<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> shifting<00:02:05.399> right

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
look when a shifting right

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.890 
look when a shifting right
you<00:02:06.580> run<00:02:06.790> through<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.000> gears<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.480> see<00:02:07.690> if<00:02:07.750> it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
you run through the gears and see if it

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.350 
you run through the gears and see if it
shifts<00:02:08.350> crisply<00:02:08.860> going<00:02:09.490> down<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.880> range<00:02:10.090> as

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
shifts crisply going down the range as

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.440 
shifts crisply going down the range as
well<00:02:10.540> as<00:02:10.600> up<00:02:10.960> and<00:02:11.730> you'll<00:02:12.730> notice<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.210> have

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
well as up and you'll notice if you have

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.300 
well as up and you'll notice if you have
problems<00:02:13.960> because<00:02:14.200> either<00:02:14.620> it'll<00:02:14.800> hesitate

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
problems because either it'll hesitate

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.800 
problems because either it'll hesitate
to<00:02:15.460> shift<00:02:15.730> or<00:02:15.910> it'll<00:02:16.060> shift<00:02:16.210> more<00:02:16.510> than<00:02:16.660> one

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
to shift or it'll shift more than one

tension<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.900> cable<00:02:29.610> we'll<00:02:30.610> check<00:02:30.820> it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
tension on that cable we'll check it

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.280 
tension on that cable we'll check it
through<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> whole<00:02:31.360> range<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.870> see<00:02:32.050> how<00:02:32.200> it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
through the whole range and see how it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.800 
through the whole range and see how it
behaves<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:34.030> we<00:02:34.120> can<00:02:34.240> see<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.540> need<00:02:34.660> an

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
behaves but we can see we need an

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.630 
behaves but we can see we need an
adjustment<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.530> we'll<00:02:36.100> make<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.310> on<00:02:36.520> this

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
adjustment and we'll make it on this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.910 
adjustment and we'll make it on this
barrel<00:02:37.000> adjuster<00:02:37.420> we'll<00:02:38.020> add<00:02:38.200> tension<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.770> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
barrel adjuster we'll add tension to the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.320 
barrel adjuster we'll add tension to the
cable<00:02:39.250> by<00:02:39.370> turning<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.850> barrel<00:02:40.180> adjuster

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
cable by turning the barrel adjuster

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.990 
cable by turning the barrel adjuster
counterclockwise<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.860> then<00:02:42.670> we'll<00:02:42.820> check

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
counterclockwise and then we'll check

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.270 
counterclockwise and then we'll check
the<00:02:43.150> shifting<00:02:43.570> again<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.140> notice<00:02:45.100> we'll

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
the shifting again and notice we'll

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.760 
the shifting again and notice we'll
check<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.210> load<00:02:46.420> gear<00:02:46.690> range<00:02:47.020> as<00:02:47.320> well

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
check it on the load gear range as well

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.430 
check it on the load gear range as well
as<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.010> high<00:02:48.280> one<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:49.060> when<00:02:50.050> we<00:02:50.170> have<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
as the high one and when we have the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.140 
as the high one and when we have the
adjustment<00:02:50.800> right<00:02:51.040> it'll<00:02:51.340> shift<00:02:51.550> crisply

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
adjustment right it'll shift crisply

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.420 
adjustment right it'll shift crisply
through<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> range<00:02:52.750> both<00:02:53.740> going<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.190> up<00:02:54.280> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
through the range both going it up and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.449 
through the range both going it up and
going<00:02:55.150> down<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:58.140> here's<00:02:59.140> our<00:02:59.290> final<00:02:59.530> check<00:02:59.920> we

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
going down and here's our final check we

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.040 
going down and here's our final check we
want<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:00.850> sure<00:03:01.030> that<00:03:01.240> these<00:03:01.390> pulley<00:03:01.720> wheels

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
want to be sure that these pulley wheels

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.140 
want to be sure that these pulley wheels
are<00:03:02.470> lined<00:03:02.770> with<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.130> COG<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> chain<00:03:03.970> is
