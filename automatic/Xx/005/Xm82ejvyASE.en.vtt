00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.500
 hello everyone how they are first 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.269
 apologize for the lighting I do not know if 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.639
 It will be good when I know how it will be 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.520
 end it happens that I start no longer 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.619
 I saw almost nothing and we are just in 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.039
 February so I really do not know what 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.210
 make my recording in winter because 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.269
 my house is not going to see absolutely 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.759
 nothing I'm sure so I had to 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.029
 come to the dining room to record and I think that 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.589
 I do not care but not today as 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.390
 You can see by the title of this video 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.159
 here below I bring the review 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.400
 corresponding to the reading club of 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.379
 february that since it was February I 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.750
 romantic and I do not know who we wanted to read 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.670
 one of the most romantic basics and that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.559
 for my part I love them I'm 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.260
 talking about pride and written prejudice 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.159
 by jane austen this novel is from my 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.470
 favorite literary classics I love 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.799
 much as he writes who you are 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:05.780
 one of his most recognized works written 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:08.270
 between thousand 796 and in 1797 around 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.070
 but the funny thing is that it was not published 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.860
 Until 1813, yes, I think it happened with 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.820
 some books that are now classics 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.979
 bettcher 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.990
 in the first instance it was rejected 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:26.479
 with an editorial and it was not until 1813 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 when they received the manuscript for 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.380
 be able to publish it for the first time 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.520
 'pride and prejudice' tells the story 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.820
 of five sisters who are jane elizabeth 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.890
 lidia mary and katie or kitty 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.960
 bennett that are some girls that live in 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.810
 a field very close to london that 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.300
 called forsythe or as it was pronounced the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.920
 name of the place and is located in the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.869
 18th century change to the 19th century over there like 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.600
 you already have to know this is a novel 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.069
 which it is well known for everyone 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.350
 have made series have been made 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.420
 film adaptations and others 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.340
 books or other series have been inspired 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.190
 of this story to create another 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.739
 similar story or similar I do not know if 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.490
 He pulled a lot talking about the plot in 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.170
 general 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.360
 but here it goes like a mini summary 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.700
 short are these five sisters the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.070
 come on this to her mother the lady come to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.350
 that all you're looking for is that you're 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.720
 five daughters marry a good match 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.550
 have a lot of money and if you want 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.900
 that has properties and horses and everything 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.310
 that and it's one day you rent one of the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.140
 larger nations of the place where 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.240
 they live and it's about a young 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.580
 single from london who is the one 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.530
 rent this place that comes with 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.970
 from a retinue of other people who 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.490
 they come from london among them comes the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.870
 Mr. such if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.920
 bennet are the protagonists of this 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.160
 history and basically goes about their 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.400
 first impressions they have of each 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.840
 one as a separate piece of information is one of the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.850
 first titles he had 'pride and 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.280
 Prejudice 'before being called that was 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.490
 first impressions and I think Chinese 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.680
 Stern wanted was pretty sure what 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.270
 I wanted to show because as I told you 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.590
 this story is basically about 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.330
 the first impressions they had 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.850
 these two characters about 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.620
 one of them elizabeth bennet finds 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.040
 that Mr. Darcy is a person 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.630
 proud smug and can not 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.410
 talk to anyone other than your 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.380
 Circle of friends and Mr. Darcy the 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.360
 find her following a very person 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.160
 intelligent and that has beautiful eyes 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.570
 because what he emphasizes most in the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.480
 the beginning of the story are its beautiful 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.670
 eyes and still prejudice and from there 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.650
 against social networks very well not the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.710
 prejudice about the classes 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.540
 social is because they were 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.370
 in different social classes this 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.470
 prejudice that existed of emparentarse 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.100
 with people who were of a lower class than 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.910
 his was what he was facing in 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.410
 first instance the infatuation between 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.630
 elizabeth and mister darcy on behalf of 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.880
 Mr. Darcy, this story is one of my 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.190
 favorite classics as I already told you and the 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.080
 I really want to tell you 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.390
 about literary study that can be 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.730
 make this time beyond the plot 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.350
 or something like that because the other guys that 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.700
 they are going to make videos also about this 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.850
 book imagine they are going to talk 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.620
 about the characters and about all of that 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.660
 this book we can take many topics 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.250
 literary and one of them would be the fake 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.290
 modesty that can be represented by 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.270
 some characters from these books already 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.310
 be Mr. calling be so that not 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.200
 have read the book the Lord with that is 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.900
 the cousin of the vedettes that would come 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.430
 being the male relative closest to 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.980
 them and he's going to keep all the 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.080
 inheritance of the see is when the lord 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.450
 bennett dies because how was the 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.340
 tradition you know the daughters could not 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.720
 inherit nothing but it would have to be a 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.370
 male 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.500
 this character if he has the fake 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.630
 modesty according to me and what could 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.940
 study through time in this 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.430
 novel since it is a character that 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.960
 He is studying their manners even much much 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.330
 is what it says in a part of the book and 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.360
 they scatter in the movie and that 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.820
 study means before giving a 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.260
 fulfilled a woman so that's one 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.760
 of the interesting points that 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.660
 has this novel that can be studied 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.910
 beyond reading it as a novel 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.700
 Romantic classic can be realized 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.860
 literary studies 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.300
 of what is written here and that's why 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.480
 but me calls me much the 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.160
 attention is a novel that although it is 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:33.700
 old or is it written in the 1700 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.230
 It has a difficult language to read no no 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.610
 has had the opportunity to read the 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.110
 book in English but the translation in 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.590
 Spanish why I bumped me not 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.750
 they have that old Spanish language like 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.310
 other classic books that could be for 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.710
 example I bought for the things he owns 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.390
 a much heavier language for 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.370
 people who are not used to reading 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.350
 about it so I think it's not going 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.870
 to be very difficult to read this novel 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.640
 this classic and if you have not read it 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.620
 I recommend it because it's a story 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.500
 romantic but that goes beyond the 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.810
 passionate romance itself to which we are 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.960
 accustomed but that it is a 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.600
 history of learning to fall in love with 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.820
 another one with its virtues and its defects already 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.070
 I know that this is not a review like the one 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.990
 I usually do books but it's 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.430
 because it 's how I like it so much 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.670
 like to talk 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.700
 of the subject beyond the plot and the 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.430
 narration of the novel and up to here 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.740
 would this review a little strange but 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.300
 I wanted more than anything to talk about the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.700
 book and tell them that I do not have him 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.590
 fear of classics there are classics 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.900
 very very well written very good 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:41.470
 obviously that reading is not for all 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.510
 people keep reading and I think that 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.310
 that's all do not forget that as 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.410
 I will always leave all the links here 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.030
 down to social networks I have I think 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.030
 a review on the blog about this book 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.560
 If I'm not mistaken and I hope that is 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.730
 very good we'll see you in a next video 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.880
 goodbye 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.880
 bye
