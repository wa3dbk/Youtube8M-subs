it's such a spectacular road and I think
the<00:02:33.129> cool<00:02:33.310> part<00:02:33.519> about<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.849> we've<00:02:34.060> only<00:02:34.180> got

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the cool part about it is we've only got

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.089 
the cool part about it is we've only got
what<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.659> mile<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> half<00:02:35.290> or<00:02:35.470> two<00:02:35.500> miles<00:02:35.860> of

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
what a mile and a half or two miles of

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.369 
what a mile and a half or two miles of
it<00:02:36.220> here<00:02:36.370> yeah<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:37.000> go<00:02:37.090> under<00:02:37.599> rocks<00:02:37.959> you

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
it here yeah and you go under rocks you

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.559 
it here yeah and you go under rocks you
go<00:02:38.530> through<00:02:38.980> tunnels<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> trees<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.450> then

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
go through tunnels in the trees and then

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.490 
go through tunnels in the trees and then
you<00:02:40.659> burst<00:02:40.989> out<00:02:41.230> into<00:02:41.500> these<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.980> big<00:02:42.670> open

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
you burst out into these like big open

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.880 
you burst out into these like big open
you<00:02:44.500> know

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.650 

what<00:02:47.430> we're<00:02:47.580> doing<00:02:47.730> basically<00:02:47.850> right<00:02:48.330> now<00:02:48.480> in

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
what we're doing basically right now in

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.050 
what we're doing basically right now in
Mulholland<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.640> setting<00:02:50.640> up<00:02:50.730> kind<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
Mulholland is setting up kind of the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.820 
Mulholland is setting up kind of the
first<00:02:51.390> angle<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.140> little<00:02:52.380> bit<00:02:52.500> weird<00:02:52.709> to

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
first angle it's a little bit weird to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.410 
first angle it's a little bit weird to
get<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.730> remote-control<00:02:54.569> helicopter<00:02:55.260> pilot

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
get a remote-control helicopter pilot

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.960 
get a remote-control helicopter pilot
camera<00:02:57.420> operator<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.319> on<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.100> chopper

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
camera operator on the on the chopper

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.600 
camera operator on the on the chopper
and<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:01.230> know<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.350> car<00:03:01.709> drifting<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> road

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and you know a car drifting on a road

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.940 
and you know a car drifting on a road
nobody's<00:03:03.090> seen<00:03:03.270> before<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.830> know

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
nobody's seen before to have you know

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.370 
nobody's seen before to have you know
exact<00:03:05.400> timing<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.390> pretty<00:03:06.690> much<00:03:06.840> every<00:03:07.140> car

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
exact timing so pretty much every car

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.960 
exact timing so pretty much every car
guy<00:03:07.410> on<00:03:07.800> earth<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.220> gonna<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.730> go<00:03:08.940> I

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
guy on earth is gonna see this and go I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.000 
guy on earth is gonna see this and go I
want<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.450> shut<00:03:09.660> down<00:03:09.690> Mulholland<00:03:10.470> Drive<00:03:10.500> so

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
want to shut down Mulholland Drive so

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.260 
want to shut down Mulholland Drive so
what<00:03:11.160> are<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> what's<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.670> logistical

your average everyday TC no this car is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.640 
your average everyday TC no this car is
um<00:03:22.730> highly<00:03:23.730> modified<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.690> cars<00:03:24.959> got<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> TRD

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
um highly modified this cars got a TRD

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.970 
um highly modified this cars got a TRD
motor<00:03:25.920> it's<00:03:26.130> got<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.360> NASCAR<00:03:27.590> motor<00:03:28.590> out<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.800> the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
motor it's got a NASCAR motor out of the

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.890 
motor it's got a NASCAR motor out of the
NASCAR<00:03:29.400> Truck<00:03:29.610> Series<00:03:29.850> nice<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.690> that

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
NASCAR Truck Series nice and that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.570 
NASCAR Truck Series nice and that
started<00:03:31.350> out<00:03:31.440> at<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:31.650> 800<00:03:32.160> plus<00:03:32.340> horsepower

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
started out at like 800 plus horsepower

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.729 
started out at like 800 plus horsepower
we've<00:03:33.120> detuned<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.989> got<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.260> power<00:03:34.440> band

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
we've detuned it and got the power band

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.940 
we've detuned it and got the power band
down<00:03:35.720> that's<00:03:36.720> not<00:03:37.019> something<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.530> hear<00:03:37.560> very

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
down that's not something you hear very

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.680 
down that's not something you hear very
often<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.400> drifting<00:03:38.850> why'd<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
often in drifting why'd you do to it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.509 
often in drifting why'd you do to it
reliability<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.860> know<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> thing<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.310> with

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
reliability you know the thing is with

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.009 
reliability you know the thing is with
the<00:03:41.610> NASCAR<00:03:41.940> guys<00:03:42.150> they're<00:03:42.360> doing<00:03:42.690> whatever

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
the NASCAR guys they're doing whatever

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.360 
the NASCAR guys they're doing whatever
muck<00:03:43.350> ninety<00:03:43.739> two<00:03:43.890> hundred<00:03:43.950> miles<00:03:44.220> an<00:03:44.310> hour

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
muck ninety two hundred miles an hour

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.830 
muck ninety two hundred miles an hour
late<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.940> engines<00:03:45.269> getting<00:03:45.450> all<00:03:45.540> kinds<00:03:45.810> of

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
late so the engines getting all kinds of

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.960 
late so the engines getting all kinds of
cooling<00:03:46.170> we<00:03:46.860> just<00:03:47.040> don't<00:03:47.190> get<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.400> cuz<00:03:47.760> we're

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
cooling we just don't get that cuz we're

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.210 
cooling we just don't get that cuz we're
sideways<00:03:48.510> yeah<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.260> still<00:03:49.620> revving<00:03:50.100> high

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
sideways yeah it's still revving high

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.880 
sideways yeah it's still revving high
rpm<00:03:50.640> though<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.870> really<00:03:52.170> had<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.320> detune<00:03:52.680> it

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
rpm though so I really had to detune it

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.199 
rpm though so I really had to detune it
it's<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.100> thirteen<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.820> half<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:54.180> one

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
it's a thirteen and a half to one

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.569 
it's a thirteen and a half to one
compression<00:03:54.780> how's<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.500> reliability<00:03:56.430> been

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
compression how's the reliability been

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.509 
compression how's the reliability been
this<00:03:56.730> season<00:03:56.970> uh<00:03:57.600> knock<00:03:58.140> on<00:03:58.290> wood<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.400> you

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
this season uh knock on wood this is you

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.100 
this season uh knock on wood this is you
know<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.940> same<00:04:00.150> engine<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.510> we<00:04:00.810> started

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
know the same engine that we started

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.620 
know the same engine that we started
with<00:04:01.230> yeah<00:04:01.530> all<00:04:02.130> right<00:04:02.310> there<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.640> go<00:04:02.730> it's

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
with yeah all right there you go it's

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.420 
with yeah all right there you go it's
all<00:04:03.780> good<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.170> what's<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.500> life<00:04:04.709> expectancy

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
all good and what's the life expectancy

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.250 
all good and what's the life expectancy
of<00:04:05.519> this<00:04:05.610> kind<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.880> engine<00:04:06.000> well<00:04:06.780> nobody's<00:04:07.140> use

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
of this kind of engine well nobody's use

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.470 
of this kind of engine well nobody's use
it<00:04:07.410> for<00:04:07.560> drifting<00:04:07.890> before<00:04:08.280> yeah<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:09.090> who<00:04:09.239> knows

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it for drifting before yeah so who knows

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.110 
it for drifting before yeah so who knows
I<00:04:09.720> mean<00:04:09.870> they<00:04:10.200> run<00:04:10.530> 600<00:04:11.370> miles<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.880> ninety

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
I mean they run 600 miles and ninety

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.850 
I mean they run 600 miles and ninety
four<00:04:12.299> hundred<00:04:12.450> rpm<00:04:12.959> okay

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
four hundred rpm okay

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.190 
four hundred rpm okay
this<00:04:14.010> motor<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> drift<00:04:15.540> weekend<00:04:15.989> what

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
this motor and on a drift weekend what

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.560 
this motor and on a drift weekend what
is<00:04:16.320> what's<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.739> equivalent<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.489> mean<00:04:18.209> we<00:04:18.390> like

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
is what's the equivalent I mean we like

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.219 
is what's the equivalent I mean we like
running<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.200> couple<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:20.370> know<00:04:20.459> 50<00:04:20.940> miles<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.570> 10

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
running a couple you know 50 miles it 10

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.380 
running a couple you know 50 miles it 10
dozen<00:04:22.410> rpm<00:04:22.890> yeah<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:23.640> mean<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.970> front<00:04:24.210> tires

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
dozen rpm yeah I mean the front tires

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.159 
dozen rpm yeah I mean the front tires
are<00:04:24.570> probably<00:04:24.840> doing

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
are probably doing

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.020 
are probably doing
yeah<00:04:26.060> like<00:04:27.060> 440<00:04:27.900> yeah<00:04:28.169> yeah<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:29.250> it's<00:04:29.430> just<00:04:29.610> run

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
yeah like 440 yeah yeah so it's just run

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.250 
yeah like 440 yeah yeah so it's just run
until<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.330> breaks<00:04:30.539> then<00:04:30.840> build<00:04:31.020> a<00:04:31.050> new<00:04:31.080> one

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
until it breaks then build a new one

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.990 
until it breaks then build a new one
pretty<00:04:31.500> much<00:04:31.650> okay<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.100> mean<00:04:32.550> we've<00:04:32.850> already

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
pretty much okay I mean we've already

pretty much okay I mean we've already
got<00:04:33.180> another<00:04:33.360> one<00:04:33.539> built<00:04:33.750> oh<00:04:33.960> okay<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.530> we're
