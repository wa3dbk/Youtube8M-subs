00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.410
 hello new video videos girls today was 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 how do I scrub my lips a little 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 days ago I posted a photo on 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 instagram is on facebook and in many 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 you asked me to do just that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.340
 the video of how he prepares it now I tell you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 immediately that the ingredients that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.720
 used had him at home and I have 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.439
 thought if I scrub that for example 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 of lush they put in the sugar and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.570
 various oils I thought I make one 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 combination of what I have at home in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.320
 so that I go and flip the lips 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.469
 but at the same time I go anyway 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.539
 so sweeten them and treat them myself 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.000
 I used three ingredients that are 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.850
 the white granulated sugar the oil of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.620
 almonds and acacia honey of course 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 you can use the ingredients 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.789
 which you prefer I had these at home and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 I tried I tried to do this 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.480
 experiment he tried on mine 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.840
 lips and I must say that the result is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.030
 very very comfortable because it goes either 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.040
 to browse the lips, however, is inside 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.049
 the almond oil that goes exactly to 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 moisturize and by way of hunting that goes 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.680
 soften them so I must say that it is me 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.939
 absolutely loved it as a scrub so yes 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 they also save money 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.080
 because anyway from leave or other scrubs 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 they always tend to cost around 9 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.990
 10 euros 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.100
 making two calculations the only ingredient 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.750
 which costs more is the essential oil that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.360
 we are going to put in our 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.700
 scrubs if we increase the doses anyway 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 we can also make a great one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.400
 body scrub 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.990
 however if you are interested in these 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.390
 types of videos obviously do it 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.729
 to know below in the comments that I will make others 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.770
 video types of this type 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.110
 now follow me to the kitchen and we'll see each other 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.910
 immediately after 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.370
 to make the scrub serve sugar 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.640
 semolina white almond oil 100 per 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.200
 100 natural and acacia honey start 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.760
 taking a jar of this type 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.760
 and I fill it with sugar 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.550
 after the verse in a container e 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.710
 I add 4 teaspoons of oil of 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.710
 sweet almonds 100 per 100 natural 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.230
 there he is 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.709
 the honey time I add two 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.709
 tsp 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.730
 and then I mix everything together 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.420
 after mixing for good I have to 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.770
 get a compound of this type e 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.770
 I'm going to fill the container 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.720
 and that 's what you need to get 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.680
 no girls is as simple as 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.990
 you have seen it really takes 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 very little time the only thing much 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.800
 fundamental is precisely going to put 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.430
 the right amounts of both sugar and 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.260
 of oil that indeed of honey 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.580
 of course let me know if the video there 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.890
 liked us see you next 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:29.410
 time and let me know if you have tried 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.410
