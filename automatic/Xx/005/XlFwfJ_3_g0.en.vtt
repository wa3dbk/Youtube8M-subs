00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
back the way you came and down these

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.780 
back the way you came and down these
stairways<00:07:01.450> out<00:07:02.380> into<00:07:02.740> this<00:07:02.860> open<00:07:03.280> area<00:07:03.490> and

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790 
stairways out into this open area and

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:10.610 
stairways out into this open area and
you're<00:07:04.120> gonna<00:07:04.360> want<00:07:04.630> to<00:07:04.690> head<00:07:04.900> to<00:07:05.110> the<00:07:05.230> right

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.130 

now<00:07:11.620> this<00:07:11.920> is<00:07:12.160> a<00:07:12.190> central<00:07:12.820> area<00:07:13.150> that<00:07:13.900> you'll

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
now this is a central area that you'll

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.410 
now this is a central area that you'll
need<00:07:14.350> to<00:07:14.410> phase<00:07:15.010> walk<00:07:15.370> and<00:07:15.610> go<00:07:15.730> back<00:07:16.000> in<00:07:16.210> time

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.420 
need to phase walk and go back in time

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.150 
need to phase walk and go back in time
and<00:07:16.720> basically<00:07:17.080> the<00:07:17.350> phase<00:07:17.560> walk<00:07:17.890> is<00:07:18.130> just

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
and basically the phase walk is just

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.270 
and basically the phase walk is just
like<00:07:18.730> the<00:07:19.000> void<00:07:19.500> one<00:07:20.500> where<00:07:20.800> you<00:07:20.920> go<00:07:21.040> through

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
like the void one where you go through

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.950 
like the void one where you go through
the<00:07:21.370> portals<00:07:21.760> you<00:07:22.060> know<00:07:22.330> you<00:07:22.450> can<00:07:22.600> see<00:07:22.780> that

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
the portals you know you can see that

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.780 
the portals you know you can see that
they're<00:07:23.110> green<00:07:23.440> now<00:07:23.680> and<00:07:24.070> so<00:07:24.400> when<00:07:24.550> you<00:07:24.640> go

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:24.790 
they're green now and so when you go

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.250 
they're green now and so when you go
through<00:07:24.940> them<00:07:25.090> you'll<00:07:25.270> go<00:07:25.420> back<00:07:25.690> in<00:07:25.840> time<00:07:26.020> or

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.260 
through them you'll go back in time or

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.530 
through them you'll go back in time or
forward<00:07:26.680> in<00:07:26.830> time<00:07:27.100> but<00:07:27.880> this<00:07:28.180> is<00:07:28.300> where<00:07:28.420> I'm
