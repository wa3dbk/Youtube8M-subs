up<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.780> brilliant<00:01:19.229> idea<00:01:19.850> well<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.150> got

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
up with this brilliant idea well I got

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
up with this brilliant idea well I got
interested<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.290> electricity<00:01:22.710> after<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> was

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
interested in electricity after I was

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.969 
interested in electricity after I was
nearly<00:01:23.970> electrocuted<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
nearly electrocuted in this one and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.179 
nearly electrocuted in this one and
thereafter<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.259> decided<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> find<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
thereafter I decided to find out what it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.109 
thereafter I decided to find out what it
was<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.400> shocked<00:01:29.850> me

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
was that shocked me

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.260 
was that shocked me
and<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:31.380> completion<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:32.240> secondary<00:01:33.240> education

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and on completion of secondary education

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.770 
and on completion of secondary education
I<00:01:33.990> went<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.979> West<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.310> Nairobi<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.479> study

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I went in West of Nairobi to study

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.830 
I went in West of Nairobi to study
electricity<00:01:37.530> electrical<00:01:38.130> engineering<00:01:38.549> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
electricity electrical engineering and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.219 
electricity electrical engineering and
really<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> interests<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:41.549> electricity

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
really the interests in electricity

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
really the interests in electricity
continued<00:01:43.229> rising<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.040> how<00:01:44.909> long<00:01:45.149> does<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
continued rising the how long does it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.670 
continued rising the how long does it
take<00:01:45.960> before<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.470> car<00:01:47.130> has<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.549> charged

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
take before this car has to be charged

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.139 
take before this car has to be charged
when<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> charge<00:01:50.040> fully<00:01:50.540> Iran<00:01:51.860> for<00:01:52.860> 50<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.970> 80

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
when you charge fully Iran for 50 for 80

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.139 
when you charge fully Iran for 50 for 80
kilometers<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.759> recharge

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
kilometers and then you have to recharge

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.770 
kilometers and then you have to recharge
and<00:01:58.130> recharging<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.250> take<00:01:59.490> say<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.240> hour<00:02:00.420> if
