idea of the kind of mood we're looking
for<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.890> other<00:00:20.039> thing<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.340> note<00:00:20.520> is

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
for here the other thing to note is

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.370 
for here the other thing to note is
right<00:00:21.090> under<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> first<00:00:21.660> bar<00:00:21.869> you've<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
right under the first bar you've got the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
right under the first bar you've got the
instruction<00:00:23.160> LV<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.090> stands<00:00:24.359> for<00:00:24.480> let's<00:00:24.720> say<00:00:24.840> V

play<00:00:25.289> basically<00:00:26.039> means<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> sands

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
play basically means that all the sands

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
play basically means that all the sands
ring<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.769> much<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:32.279> main

you've<00:00:34.620> got<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.890> tune<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.460> very<00:00:35.700> long<00:00:35.940> notes

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you've got this tune in very long notes

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.799 
you've got this tune in very long notes
in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.350> top<00:00:37.800> part<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.329> an<00:00:39.329> accompaniment

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
in the top part and an accompaniment

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.350 
in the top part and an accompaniment
which<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.100> resonant<00:00:41.550> supportive<00:00:42.149> sort

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
which is a very resonant supportive sort

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.049 
which is a very resonant supportive sort
of<00:00:42.450> sound<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.020> actually<00:00:43.620> originally<00:00:44.219> wrote<00:00:44.910> the

stroke<00:00:47.460> study<00:00:48.590> nowadays<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.680> tend<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> play<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
stroke study nowadays I tend to play it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.930 
stroke study nowadays I tend to play it
with<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.149> fingers<00:00:52.050> playing<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.920> top<00:00:53.699> line

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
with the fingers playing the top line
with<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> tune<00:00:54.510> playing<00:00:54.840> red<00:00:55.079> stroke<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
with the tune playing red stroke and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
with the tune playing red stroke and
then<00:00:56.250> converting<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> free<00:00:57.239> stroke<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.750> all

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
then converting to free stroke for all

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.360 
then converting to free stroke for all
the<00:00:58.050> accompanying<00:00:58.530> parts<00:00:59.160> and<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.960> keep<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
the accompanying parts and to keep that

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.390 
the accompanying parts and to keep that
resonant<00:01:02.370> cross<00:01:02.579> string<00:01:02.879> effect<00:01:04.280> for<00:01:05.280> your

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
resonant cross string effect for your

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:27.260 
resonant cross string effect for your

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
left hand and opportunities to think

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.710 
left hand and opportunities to think
about<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.630> quite<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:29.450> for<00:01:30.450> your

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
about that quite a lot and for your

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.609 
about that quite a lot and for your
right<00:01:30.990> hand

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
right hand

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.300 
right hand
it's<00:01:32.400> about<00:01:33.409> organizing<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.500> fingers<00:01:34.890> so

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's about organizing your fingers so

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
it's about organizing your fingers so
that<00:01:35.340> they're<00:01:36.030> basically<00:01:36.360> allocated<00:01:37.079> finger

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that they're basically allocated finger

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
that they're basically allocated finger
to<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> string<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> finger<00:01:39.299> tends<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> play

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to a string so a finger tends to play

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.020 
to a string so a finger tends to play
the<00:01:39.960> top<00:01:40.290> E<00:01:40.320> string<00:01:43.189> plays<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> g<00:01:44.490> string<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the top E string plays the g string and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.319 
the top E string plays the g string and
that<00:01:45.780> actually<00:01:46.170> changes<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.369> bar<00:01:47.670> 12<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that actually changes in bar 12 the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.810 
that actually changes in bar 12 the
whole<00:01:48.479> lot<00:01:48.720> moves<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.829> string<00:01:50.159> sideways<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
whole lot moves one string sideways and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.090 
whole lot moves one string sideways and
then<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> moves<00:01:51.630> back<00:01:52.079> again<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.439> bar<00:01:52.619> 14

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
then it moves back again in bar 14

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.410 
then it moves back again in bar 14
having<00:01:56.100> said<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.759> piece<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> marked

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
having said that the piece is marked

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.440 
having said that the piece is marked
lvls<00:01:58.049> AV<00:01:58.380> Bray<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:59.670> suggest<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.210> think

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
lvls AV Bray I would suggest you think

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.139 
lvls AV Bray I would suggest you think
about<00:02:00.659> when<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> bass<00:02:01.140> note<00:02:01.439> changes<00:02:02.149> for

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
about when the bass note changes for

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.929 
about when the bass note changes for
example<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> goes<00:02:04.170> from<00:02:04.979> by<00:02:05.189> 8<00:02:05.369> 2<00:02:05.549> bar<00:02:05.729> 9

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
example when it goes from by 8 2 bar 9

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.789 
example when it goes from by 8 2 bar 9
and<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> good<00:02:07.409> idea<00:02:07.530> if

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and so on it's actually a good idea if

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.609 
and so on it's actually a good idea if
you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.360> just

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
you can just

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.220 
you can just
those<00:02:09.799> bass<00:02:10.099> notes<00:02:10.369> ringing<00:02:10.989> either<00:02:11.989> by

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
those bass notes ringing either by

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.869 
those bass notes ringing either by
jumping<00:02:12.739> your<00:02:12.860> thumb<00:02:13.010> back<00:02:13.190> or<00:02:13.310> sometimes<00:02:13.670> by

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
jumping your thumb back or sometimes by

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.229 
jumping your thumb back or sometimes by
letting<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.390> back<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.049> your<00:02:15.140> thumb<00:02:15.349> on<00:02:16.239> after

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
letting the back of your thumb on after

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.220 
letting the back of your thumb on after
what<00:02:17.420> you're<00:02:17.569> looking<00:02:17.780> at<00:02:17.900> there<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
what you're looking at there is a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.399 
what you're looking at there is a
harmonic<00:02:18.709> change<00:02:19.989> indicated<00:02:20.989> by<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.170> bass

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
harmonic change indicated by the bass

which is always recessed very much in

which is always recessed very much in
the<00:03:37.440> background<00:03:37.850> almost<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.940> kind<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.240> misty

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
the background almost a kind of misty

the background almost a kind of misty
sort<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.080> resonance<00:03:41.010> going<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:41.520> there<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.270> of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
sort of resonance going on there and of

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.940 
sort of resonance going on there and of
course<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.600> dynamics<00:03:43.080> are<00:03:43.260> really<00:03:43.440> important

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
course the dynamics are really important

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.790 
course the dynamics are really important
because<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:45.720> notice<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.140> goes<00:03:46.530> all<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.710> way

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
because you notice it goes all the way

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.890 
because you notice it goes all the way
