00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
good so it is and yeah the fact that the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.799 
good so it is and yeah the fact that the
generate<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> same<00:00:46.260> emotion<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.570> we

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
generate the same emotion or you know we

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.029 
generate the same emotion or you know we
were<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.829> slightly

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
were to do this but it's slightly

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.970 
were to do this but it's slightly
different<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.730> do<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.559> does<00:00:52.770> make

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
different or do that that that does make

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
different or do that that that does make
it<00:00:53.039> difficult<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.270> guess<00:00:54.870> that's<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> art

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
it difficult and I guess that's the art

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
it difficult and I guess that's the art
of<00:00:55.469> acting<00:00:55.649> that's<00:00:55.949> why<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.370> after<00:00:56.879> doing

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of acting that's why I have after doing

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.400 
of acting that's why I have after doing

it a couple times I have a lot of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.110 
it a couple times I have a lot of
respect<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.920> actors<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.430> able<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> do

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
respect for actors for able to do

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.820

going into the into the movie and I

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.450 
going into the into the movie and I
think<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.229> they're<00:01:26.380> going<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.680> be<00:01:26.920> enormous

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
think that they're going to be enormous

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.210 
think that they're going to be enormous
stars<00:01:27.970> I<00:01:28.330> told<00:01:29.200> them<00:01:29.380> not<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.710> forget<00:01:30.100> about

them without Holly with their shots

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.090 
them without Holly with their shots

Jacob<00:02:19.959> was<00:02:20.160> really<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> sympathetic<00:02:21.580> character

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150

much<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.290> mind<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:39.790> pretty<00:02:40.000> twisted

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
much of a mind and it's pretty twisted

intelligence<00:02:56.440> no<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.990> don't<00:02:58.990> know<00:02:59.050> what<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.770> you

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
think that kind of helps it or hurts the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.550 
think that kind of helps it or hurts the
movie<00:03:01.300> like<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.080> other<00:03:02.230> audience

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
movie like it's like the other audience

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.530 
movie like it's like the other audience
can<00:03:02.710> you<00:03:02.740> do<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.130> crossover<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:04.000> don't<00:03:04.420> know

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
can you do like a crossover I don't know

can you do like a crossover I don't know
and<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:04.990> think<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:05.350> walk<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.620> bit<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:06.010> a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
and I do think you walk a bit of a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.060 
and I do think you walk a bit of a
certain<00:03:06.370> line<00:03:06.490> yeah<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.120> know<00:03:08.070> especially

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
certain line yeah you know especially

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.280 
certain line yeah you know especially
because<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:10.420> know<00:03:10.510> there<00:03:11.140> they<00:03:11.260> are

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
because you know there they are

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.260 
because you know there they are
different<00:03:11.740> products<00:03:12.130> just<00:03:12.370> understand<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.210> I

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
different products just understand and I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.550 
different products just understand and I
realized<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:13.960> is<00:03:14.050> going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.350> some

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
realized that there is going to be some

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.860 
realized that there is going to be some
crossover<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.990> know<00:03:17.110> they<00:03:17.290> argue

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
crossover but you know they argue

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.090 
crossover but you know they argue
frankly<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.080> not<00:03:20.230> all<00:03:20.380> or<00:03:20.740> cancer

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
frankly and not all or cancer

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.230 
frankly and not all or cancer
or<00:03:24.100> again<00:03:24.550> there's<00:03:24.760> going<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.030> some

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
or again there's going to be some

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.510 
or again there's going to be some
crossover<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:26.530> yeah<00:03:26.830> I<00:03:26.890> don't<00:03:27.100> know<00:03:27.160> how<00:03:27.280> much

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
crossover but yeah I don't know how much

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
SEDs Jacob apart from other slasher

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.270 
SEDs Jacob apart from other slasher
heroes<00:03:36.340> like<00:03:36.580> Freddy<00:03:37.240> or<00:03:37.450> Jason<00:03:37.870> well<00:03:38.770> you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
heroes like Freddy or Jason well you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.340 
heroes like Freddy or Jason well you
know<00:03:39.370> what's<00:03:40.180> cool<00:03:40.330> about<00:03:40.390> Freddy<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:41.050> he<00:03:41.200> was

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
know what's cool about Freddy is he was

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.580 
know what's cool about Freddy is he was
a<00:03:41.380> smart<00:03:42.070> aleck<00:03:42.400> right<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:43.060> know<00:03:43.150> that's<00:03:43.590> I

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
a smart aleck right you know that's I

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.130 
a smart aleck right you know that's I
think<00:03:45.400> what<00:03:45.820> sets<00:03:46.060> shake<00:03:46.330> up<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.630> bit<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:46.960> part

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
think what sets shake up a bit of part

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.960 
think what sets shake up a bit of part
is<00:03:47.350> fact<00:03:47.710> that<00:03:47.860> he<00:03:47.920> does<00:03:48.130> have<00:03:48.370> some

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
is fact that he does have some

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.780 
is fact that he does have some
personality<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:50.050> know<00:03:50.170> you<00:03:50.410> guys<00:03:50.790> there's

personality you know you guys there's

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.340 
personality you know you guys there's
probably<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.570> little<00:03:52.750> more<00:03:52.870> depth<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.290> the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
probably a little more depth to the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.920 
probably a little more depth to the
character<00:03:53.860> them<00:03:54.130> than<00:03:54.520> there<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:54.700> with<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930

up you know I remember a couple times

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.520 
up you know I remember a couple times
two<00:04:15.700> movies<00:04:16.030> he<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.870> know<00:04:16.989> he<00:04:17.140> would<00:04:17.290> be<00:04:17.380> like

two movies he you know he would be like

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.770 
two movies he you know he would be like
the<00:04:17.650> only<00:04:17.860> one<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.940> would<00:04:19.060> get<00:04:19.150> scared<00:04:19.510> too

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the only one that would get scared too

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.690

you know something that happened so in

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.370 
you know something that happened so in
that<00:04:24.880> respect<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.390> think<00:04:25.420> Jacob<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:26.020> different

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.780 
that respect I think Jacob is different
than<00:04:26.470> like<00:04:26.620> you're<00:04:26.830> you're<00:04:27.070> Michael<00:04:27.400> Myers

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.010 

he's<00:04:30.790> probably<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.270> bit<00:04:31.420> more<00:04:31.630> actually

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.940 

it's<00:04:34.830> bigger<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:39.780> maybe<00:04:40.050> he's<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> bit<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:40.890> a

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
it's bigger so maybe he's a bit of a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.270 
it's bigger so maybe he's a bit of a
