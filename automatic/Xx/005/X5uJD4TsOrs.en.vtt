perform 15 reps with relative ease and
you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.320> simply<00:01:22.920> adjust<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.549> weight<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you can simply adjust the weight to the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.780 
you can simply adjust the weight to the
next<00:01:24.600> level<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.680> also<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.400> unique

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
next level up you also have this unique

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.780 
next level up you also have this unique
feature<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.619> allows<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.670> adjust

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
feature here that allows you to adjust

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.640 
feature here that allows you to adjust
the<00:01:30.329> way<00:01:30.479> by<00:01:30.689> seven<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.229> half<00:01:31.259> pound

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the way by seven and a half pound

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.990 
the way by seven and a half pound
increments<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.759> nice<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
increments which is really nice so

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.170 
increments which is really nice so
you'll<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.540> pull<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> pop<00:01:34.140> pin<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:35.009> top<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you'll just pull the pop pin up top and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.890 
you'll just pull the pop pin up top and
you'll<00:01:36.360> slide<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> down<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> there<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> rests

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you'll slide it down so there it rests

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
you'll slide it down so there it rests
on<00:01:39.990> top<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> other<00:01:40.619> weights<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.460> easy

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
on top of the other weights really easy

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.730 
on top of the other weights really easy
so<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> don't<00:01:42.509> necessarily<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.470> make

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so you don't necessarily have to make

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.090 
so you don't necessarily have to make
that<00:01:43.950> big<00:01:44.220> 15<00:01:44.729> pound<00:01:45.119> jump<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.140> usually

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that big 15 pound jump you can usually

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.749 
that big 15 pound jump you can usually
adjust<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.149> by<00:01:48.299> using<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.460> again

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
adjust it by using this which is again

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.719 
adjust it by using this which is again
it<00:01:51.000> only<00:01:51.210> seven<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.810> half<00:01:51.840> pounds<00:01:52.670> okay<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it only seven and a half pounds okay to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
it only seven and a half pounds okay to

on the floor some of you are going to

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.340

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
footrest and then you're going to drive

the<00:03:48.859> weight<00:03:49.040> straight<00:03:49.489> up<00:03:50.200> exhale<00:03:51.200> as<00:03:51.350> you

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
the weight straight up exhale as you

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.930

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.370 
push don't let the weight bottom out
good<00:03:55.940> rule<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.239> thumb<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.690> when<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.079> flex

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
good rule of thumb is that when you flex

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.020 
good rule of thumb is that when you flex
your<00:03:57.500> elbows<00:03:57.620> they<00:03:58.040> should<00:03:58.280> be<00:03:58.430> in<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.850> down

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
your elbows they should be in the down

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.289 
your elbows they should be in the down
position<00:03:59.060> flex<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.079> about<00:04:00.230> 90<00:04:00.620> degrees<00:04:01.299> that's

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
position flex to about 90 degrees that's

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.090 
position flex to about 90 degrees that's
a<00:04:02.450> good<00:04:02.750> rule<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:02.989> thumb<00:04:03.140> that's<00:04:03.590> still<00:04:03.950> going

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
a good rule of thumb that's still going

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.210 
a good rule of thumb that's still going
to<00:04:04.190> stress<00:04:04.819> your<00:04:05.000> pectoral<00:04:05.690> region<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.230> not

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
to stress your pectoral region and not

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.590 
to stress your pectoral region and not
