post one point 08 gameplay I just

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.860 
post one point 08 gameplay I just
recorded<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.790> right<00:02:13.000> now<00:02:13.150> fresh<00:02:13.450> hot

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
recorded this right now fresh hot

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.420 
recorded this right now fresh hot
the<00:02:13.959> presses<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:15.299> it<00:02:16.299> has<00:02:16.629> been<00:02:17.069> reduced<00:02:18.069> the

meaning that the crosshairs are going to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.380 
meaning that the crosshairs are going to
move<00:02:23.769> faster<00:02:24.370> towards<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.879> center<00:02:25.239> now<00:02:25.360> I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
move faster towards the center now I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.850 
move faster towards the center now I
initially<00:02:26.019> thought<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.379> this<00:02:26.500> would<00:02:26.680> be

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
initially thought that this would be

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.100 
initially thought that this would be
more<00:02:27.340> trouble<00:02:27.670> than<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.000> was<00:02:28.030> worth<00:02:28.150> as

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
more trouble than it was worth as

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.800 
more trouble than it was worth as
opposed<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.560> just<00:02:29.700> removing<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.120> sway

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
opposed to just removing the the sway

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.470 
opposed to just removing the the sway
altogether<00:02:32.440> but<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.430> after<00:02:33.940> I've<00:02:34.180> had<00:02:34.329> some

altogether but as after I've had some

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.759 
altogether but as after I've had some
time<00:02:34.629> with<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.870> again<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:35.079> haven't<00:02:35.409> had<00:02:35.500> time<00:02:35.560> to

definitely it's definitely intriguing i
will<00:03:20.500> say<00:03:20.739> that<00:03:20.769> as<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.549> see<00:03:21.819> when<00:03:22.540> you

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
will say that as you can see when you

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.990 
will say that as you can see when you
when<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.840> scope<00:03:23.319> in<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.950> first<00:03:24.250> zoom<00:03:24.639> at

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
when you scope in on the first zoom at

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.849 
when you scope in on the first zoom at
least<00:03:25.269> mid-range<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.930> is<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.349> is<00:03:26.470> as<00:03:26.620> though

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
least mid-range it is it is as though

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.800 
least mid-range it is it is as though
the<00:03:27.310> off-center<00:03:27.700> scope<00:03:28.060> isn't<00:03:28.329> really<00:03:28.540> there

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
the off-center scope isn't really there

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.949 
the off-center scope isn't really there
because<00:03:29.049> your<00:03:29.530> time<00:03:29.859> to<00:03:30.669> to<00:03:31.150> get<00:03:31.419> to<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.750> to

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
because your time to to get to the to

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.720 
because your time to to get to the to
the<00:03:31.989> idle<00:03:32.410> sway<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.680> don't<00:03:33.040> hold<00:03:33.190> breath<00:03:33.459> for<00:03:33.700> a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
the idle sway I don't hold breath for a

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.420 
the idle sway I don't hold breath for a
bunch<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.060> these<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.799> is<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.129> to<00:03:36.280> see

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
bunch of these and this is just to see

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.710 
bunch of these and this is just to see
how<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.639> works<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.970> do<00:03:37.030> start<00:03:37.299> holding<00:03:37.540> my

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
how it works I do start holding my

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.119 
how it works I do start holding my
breath<00:03:37.930> later<00:03:38.470> on<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.799> video<00:03:38.889> or<00:03:39.099> I

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
breath later on in the video or I

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.000 
breath later on in the video or I
believe<00:03:39.220> right<00:03:39.370> now<00:03:39.519> but<00:03:40.169> it<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.590> time<00:03:41.859> it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
believe right now but it the time it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.059 
believe right now but it the time it
takes<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.310> get<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.609> just<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.000> idle<00:03:43.329> sway<00:03:43.690> is

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
takes to get to just the idle sway is

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.640 
takes to get to just the idle sway is
almost<00:03:45.069> negligible<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.389> so<00:03:47.230> on<00:03:47.379> the<00:03:47.470> first

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
almost negligible and so on the first

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.860 
almost negligible and so on the first
zoom<00:03:47.980> on<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.220> variable<00:03:48.669> zoom<00:03:48.819> it<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.720> is

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
zoom on the variable zoom it is it is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.659 
zoom on the variable zoom it is it is
definitely<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.590> can<00:03:50.620> see<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.069> difference<00:03:51.310> in

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
definitely you can see a difference in

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.979 
definitely you can see a difference in
the<00:03:51.819> patch<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.449> i<00:03:52.540> will<00:03:52.720> show<00:03:52.930> you

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
the patch and and i will show you

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.530 
the patch and and i will show you
towards<00:03:53.379> the<00:03:53.500> end<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.709> this<00:03:53.769> video<00:03:53.949> some<00:03:54.760> pre

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
towards the end of this video some pre

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.780 
towards the end of this video some pre
one<00:03:55.810> point<00:03:56.079> oh<00:03:56.169> eight<00:03:56.199> gameplay<00:03:56.799> right<00:03:57.489> back

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
one point oh eight gameplay right back

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.750 
one point oh eight gameplay right back
up<00:03:58.000> against<00:03:58.500> someone<00:03:59.500> point<00:04:00.250> oh<00:04:00.370> eight<00:04:00.400> and

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
up against someone point oh eight and

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.360 
up against someone point oh eight and
and<00:04:01.090> after<00:04:01.480> one<00:04:02.019> point<00:04:02.230> oh<00:04:02.290> eight<00:04:02.319> gameplay<00:04:02.919> so

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
and after one point oh eight gameplay so

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.949 
and after one point oh eight gameplay so
you<00:04:03.430> can<00:04:03.669> really<00:04:04.000> see<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.329> difference<00:04:04.480> but

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
you can really see the difference but

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.089 
you can really see the difference but
that<00:04:05.290> will<00:04:05.379> come<00:04:05.500> at<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.709> end<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.949> the<00:04:06.010> video

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
that will come at the end of the video

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.509 
that will come at the end of the video
and<00:04:06.780> as<00:04:07.780> for<00:04:08.260> as<00:04:08.560> for<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:08.889> second<00:04:09.250> zoom<00:04:09.370> i

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
and as for as for the second zoom i

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.500 
and as for as for the second zoom i
don't<00:04:09.669> show<00:04:09.819> you<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:10.000> regular<00:04:10.299> scope

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
don't show you the regular scope

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.970 
don't show you the regular scope
obviously<00:04:11.019> because<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.290> second<00:04:11.709> zoom<00:04:11.859> and

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
obviously because the second zoom and

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.199 
obviously because the second zoom and
the<00:04:12.040> regular<00:04:12.310> scope<00:04:12.519> are<00:04:12.639> pretty<00:04:12.970> much<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
the regular scope are pretty much the

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.740 
the regular scope are pretty much the
same<00:04:13.569> thing<00:04:14.040> all<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.340> variable<00:04:15.819> zoom<00:04:15.940> does<00:04:16.510> is

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
same thing all the variable zoom does is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.270 
same thing all the variable zoom does is
give<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.169> option<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.739> third<00:04:17.979> zoom

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
give you the option of that third zoom

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.390 
give you the option of that third zoom
and<00:04:18.489> that<00:04:18.940> first<00:04:19.299> zoom<00:04:19.810> but<00:04:20.799> as<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:21.070> can<00:04:21.190> see

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
and that first zoom but as you can see

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.659 
and that first zoom but as you can see
on<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.870> second<00:04:23.260> zoom<00:04:23.469> mid-range<00:04:24.099> and<00:04:24.370> and

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
on the second zoom mid-range and and

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.490 
on the second zoom mid-range and and
long<00:04:24.969> range<00:04:25.210> it's<00:04:25.510> definitely<00:04:25.870> there's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
long range it's definitely there's

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.460 
long range it's definitely there's
definitely<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:27.130> chain

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
definitely a chain

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.250 
definitely a chain
it's<00:04:27.830> noticeable<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.670> and<00:04:29.510> after<00:04:30.050> playing
