we<00:00:41.790> first<00:00:42.000> need<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.300> establish<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.989> these

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
we first need to establish what these

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
we first need to establish what these
Pokemon<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.829> based<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.640> order<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.210> a

Pokemon are based on in order to get a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.600 
Pokemon are based on in order to get a
better<00:00:45.480> understanding<00:00:46.070> according<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.309> Bubba

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
better understanding according to Bubba

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.369 
better understanding according to Bubba
pedia<00:00:47.940> both<00:00:48.210> Nero<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.720> are<00:00:48.840> known<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
pedia both Nero and are known as the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.069 
pedia both Nero and are known as the
poison<00:00:49.800> pin<00:00:50.010> Pokemon<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> by<00:00:51.449> their<00:00:51.660> design

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
poison pin Pokemon and by their design

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
poison pin Pokemon and by their design
they<00:00:52.379> seem<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> resemble<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.370> sort<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
they seem to resemble some sort of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.270 
they seem to resemble some sort of
rodent<00:00:53.909> that's<00:00:54.570> right<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.589> it's<00:00:56.010> safe<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
rodent that's right I think it's safe to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740 
rodent that's right I think it's safe to
assume<00:00:56.519> that<00:00:56.790> they're<00:00:57.059> both<00:00:57.300> based<00:00:57.600> on

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
assume that they're both based on

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.460 
assume that they're both based on
rabbits

thanks to their big ears and teeth even
Bubba<00:01:00.960> pedia<00:01:01.379> seems<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.860> agree<00:01:02.040> with<00:01:02.159> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Bubba pedia seems to agree with this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
Bubba pedia seems to agree with this
observation<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.150> mentions<00:01:03.780> how<00:01:03.899> they<00:01:04.050> are

observation and mentions how they are

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.109 
observation and mentions how they are
most<00:01:04.379> likely<00:01:04.769> based<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.339> Amami<00:01:05.670> rabbit

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
most likely based on the Amami rabbit

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.240 
most likely based on the Amami rabbit
which<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.750> native<00:01:06.899> to<00:01:07.050> Amami<00:01:07.530> Oshima

which is one of the SATs soon in islands

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.230 
which is one of the SATs soon in islands
I<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.289> well<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> resemblance<00:01:11.160> there<00:01:11.580> but

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I can well see the resemblance there but

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.880 
I can well see the resemblance there but
now<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.539> we<00:01:12.660> have<00:01:12.690> established<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.740> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
now that we have established that it is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
now that we have established that it is
still<00:01:14.100> hard<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.670> why<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.910> moonstone<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
still hard to see why a moonstone is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.510 
still hard to see why a moonstone is
required<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.350> Pokemon<00:01:16.800> to<00:01:16.920> evolve

required for this Pokemon to evolve

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
required for this Pokemon to evolve
