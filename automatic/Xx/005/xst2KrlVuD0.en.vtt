00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.800
 now in germany she is besieging 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.380

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.059
 thief money led from the south very hot 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.650
 air to us and so we have only the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.590
 case that hungary in central europe 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.029
 temperatures between 30 and 35 degrees 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.039
 to be achieved that they recognize here 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.230
 on the red color and this red 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.449
 Symbolic temperatures over 35 degrees 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.640
 and those temperatures we will become 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.809
 today, above all things in the middle and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 direction north 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.420
 there it goes up to 36 partly to 38 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 grad and the air is very humid 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.920
 that means we can really get it right 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 Everyone is really lucky when they sweat 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.510
 who has an air conditioner in the office 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
 in the east a lot of sunshine in the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.500
 south and west, on the other hand, individual 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.539
 Showers and thunderstorms become the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.850
 Afternoon more often there can also 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.809
 Heavy hail and hail

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.350
 reached to 30 degrees 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.479
 The coming night will be tropical again 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.760
 that means becoming genitive in many ways 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.830
 not under 20 degrees back in part 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.409
 today after temperatures in the rhine prayer 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 in the Rhine Valley around 24 degrees as the lowest 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.890
 value otherwise 20 to a maximum of 18 degrees 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 hereby the chancellor 15 degrees 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.650

 Thunderstorm thursday then brings 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.590
 again a heat peak but only 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.020
 for the east 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.299
 Here it is again up to 37 degrees 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.400
 hot in the west but there 10 thunderstorms 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.380
 up and they can do it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.810
 Often, they are outrageous 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.430
 on friday and saturday there are still 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 single showers and thunderstorms have one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.960
 cool and part strong off and the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.240
 highest scores are only 21 on Saturday 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.829

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.509
 pleasant area and you can do that 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.670
 Apartment finally airing again 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.920
 and the trend for next week is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.140
 remains changeable and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.619
 Temperatures oscillate around 20 degrees 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.689
 on 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.430
 and with these prospects I wish 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.869

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.869
