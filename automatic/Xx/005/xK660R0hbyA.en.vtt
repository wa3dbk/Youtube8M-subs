00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
all of those mini locks watch timer I'm

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
all of those mini locks watch timer I'm
not<00:00:20.100> sure<00:00:20.250> what<00:00:20.430> they're<00:00:20.580> supposed<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.270> but

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
not sure what they're supposed to be but

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.009 
not sure what they're supposed to be but
they<00:00:21.689> put<00:00:21.930> more<00:00:22.199> time<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.310> clock<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:24.019> time

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
they put more time on the clock in time

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.210 
they put more time on the clock in time
is<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.710> essence<00:00:27.230> there's<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.529> far<00:00:28.920> above

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
is of the essence there's one far above

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.069 
is of the essence there's one far above
here<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.550> thought<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.120> could<00:00:33.450> reach<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.840> by

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
here and I thought I could reach it by

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.410 
here and I thought I could reach it by
getting<00:00:34.410> hurt<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.040> making<00:00:35.430> Mario<00:00:35.760> bounce<00:00:36.090> up

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
getting hurt in making Mario bounce up

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.700 
getting hurt in making Mario bounce up
to<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> ceiling<00:00:38.120> yeah<00:00:39.120> yeah<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.870> didn't<00:00:40.649> get

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to the ceiling yeah yeah I didn't get

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
to the ceiling yeah yeah I didn't get
hurt<00:00:40.950> accidentally<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> was<00:00:42.059> purposely

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
hurt accidentally I was purposely

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
hurt accidentally I was purposely
getting<00:00:43.140> hurt<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.649> Mario<00:00:44.010> would<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.579> high

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
getting hurt so Mario would be as high

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.779 
getting hurt so Mario would be as high
as<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.480> clock<00:00:45.840> high<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.379> air<00:00:46.789> yeah

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.590 
challenge is much much simpler than last
time<00:02:32.090> because<00:02:33.049> we<00:02:33.200> don't<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.680> any<00:02:34.100> enemies

area

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.309 

why

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.990 

timer<00:02:50.319> over<00:02:50.800> there<00:02:51.010> on<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> right<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:54.879> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
timer over there on the right it in the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.949 
timer over there on the right it in the
timer<00:02:56.819> makes<00:02:57.819> more<00:02:58.300> cloud<00:02:58.660> Mario<00:02:59.080> powers<00:03:00.959> and

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
timer makes more cloud Mario powers and

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.900 
timer makes more cloud Mario powers and
I<00:03:02.050> don't<00:03:02.379> see<00:03:02.530> any<00:03:02.680> other<00:03:02.860> timers<00:03:03.310> which<00:03:03.519> must

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
I don't see any other timers which must

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.490 
I don't see any other timers which must
mean<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.150> have<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.569> get<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.959> top<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.410> this

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
mean I have to get to the top of this

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.530 
mean I have to get to the top of this
area<00:03:06.840> I've<00:03:07.840> got<00:03:08.110> another<00:03:08.379> timer<00:03:08.799> now<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:10.269> note

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
area I've got another timer now and note

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.729 
area I've got another timer now and note
that<00:03:10.569> my<00:03:10.989> time<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.349> about<00:03:11.769> 40<00:03:12.430> seconds<00:03:13.739> 38

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
that my time is about 40 seconds 38

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.039 
that my time is about 40 seconds 38
seconds<00:03:15.220> now<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:17.879> point<00:03:18.879> this<00:03:19.030> out<00:03:19.239> because<00:03:19.480> in

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
seconds now I point this out because in

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.500 
seconds now I point this out because in
case<00:03:20.379> you<00:03:20.590> die<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.610> restart<00:03:22.299> from

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
case you die you have to restart from

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.069 
case you die you have to restart from
this<00:03:22.720> area<00:03:23.140> at<00:03:23.470> 30<00:03:24.010> seconds<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.690> it's

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
this area at 30 seconds so it's

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.710 
this area at 30 seconds so it's
definitely<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.010> time-saver<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.000> die<00:03:28.180> you

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
definitely not a time-saver to die you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.309 
definitely not a time-saver to die you
lose<00:03:28.959> about<00:03:29.260> six<00:03:29.650> seconds<00:03:30.010> if<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.220> die<00:03:34.319> ok

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
lose about six seconds if you die ok

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.250 
lose about six seconds if you die ok

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
have those boiling flames of lava which

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.050 
have those boiling flames of lava which

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
come out of the lava pits so those won't

I'm<00:03:55.379> kind<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.799> cutting<00:03:56.010> out<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.340> time<00:03:56.580> it's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
