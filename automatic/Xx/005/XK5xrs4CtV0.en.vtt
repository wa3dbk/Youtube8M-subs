 1 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.119
 at the concert it's two piano shops 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.470
 on paris so one in the xiiie 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.690
 borough near the library 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.210
 FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and one in the 17th 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.080
 right next to the triumphal arch are 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.020
 used naf piano dealers 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.809
 here we do not do restoration 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.640
 full of instruments it's a job 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.769
 totally apart from all the pianos 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.350
 Used cars that pass by us are 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.489
 revised at the setting the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.710
 technician who was dealing with this 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.460
 mechanical sanding hammer heads 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.440
 and therefore to remove the estrie that lies 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.720
 on the point of striking 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.299
 we could see the marking of 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.140
 strings which is quite significant 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.140
 a piano that played a lot 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.400
 we have two big families the most 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.740
 important are the right worshiping piano 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.840
 of course know that a upright piano 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.630
 announcement does not have the right and right foot 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.030
 its mechanics in that sense while a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.610
 grand piano and horizontal circle la 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.229
 mechanical works by gravity on the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.580
 grand piano while on the piano 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.300
 law 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.360
 we have to adapt other forces of others 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.360
 systems 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.510
 it's the European piano and the piano 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.340
 Asian 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.290
 so the Chinese feet the pianos 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.300
 Japanese for example who have 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.980
 sounds for his Asian pianos 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.780
 pretty clear pretty fairly standardized 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.659
 as often after you have the piano 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.909
 European Dutch Czech French and 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.250
 especially German they were not 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.650
 much rounder a quality of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.909
 really more craft making this 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.480
 which is the big difference with the 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.430
 Asian piano is the artisanal side 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.040
 the piano factor trade in these 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.380
 European countries then 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.410
 holland france-germany really from 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.560
 craft tradition European piano is 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.620
 more a piano we will really speak 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.590
 the quality of the piano will make a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.690
 pianist will be able to sublimate his game goes 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.980
 to express oneself 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.970
 that's the term expressing himself to buy 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.320
 a digital piano 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.780
 we could as well see a 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.000
 acoustic piano that we buy from 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.960
 we either already have the house and the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.660
 get installed is what's called a 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.190
 silent system of the blow the systems where 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.440
 we insert numerical mechanism in the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.930
 acoustic piano in order to pass 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.930
 in silent mode to play the headphones 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.350
 for example the differences between 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.180
 some brands 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.840
 some do a lot of communication 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.760
 they are really known for their name 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.870
 marketing is done behind for a 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.590
 only country like Germany France 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.080
 europe in general 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.690
 apart from Japanese pianos one has to 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.070
 to be on a more than a fortnight of 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.070
 brands 15 20 different brands including 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.320
 10 15 highly reputed our idea received the 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.870
 size of the piano the Japanese pianos by 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.190
 example have a drying time at 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.740
 wood level of the soundboard 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.770
 which is very very short so the piano and 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.810
 not wet but a drying time 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.090
 much shorter that is to say that the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.160
 piano needs to be much bigger for 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.070
 to be able to ring against the piano 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.530
 German even small qualities of 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.670
 materials that are extremely good at 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.620
 drying time of the wood that is 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.660
 much longer so that the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.450
 resonance is increased on the pianos 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.460
 of European German origin so a 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.930
 small size of piano may be 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.970
 give exactly the same sound 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.980
 the sound amplitude that a Japanese piano 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.840
 who has a huge soundboard he does not 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.180
 do not confuse the digital piano 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.810
 with the acoustic piano even in piano 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.859
 of studies of small invoice a piano 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.050
 Chinese acoustics is going to be much more 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.050
 profitable in pupils who to piano 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.990
 digital as good as it is digital 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.540
 we do not replace the touch the sound the 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.260
 sensation vibrations sensation 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:39.870
 to push a real piano mechanics 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:41.580
 level of the fingers game a thing to 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.380
 know about the age of the pianos 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.680
 because we do not do the piano early 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.390
 of the century pianos 1900 1920 1930 name 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.080
 will rather be in the pianos that according to 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.240
 what would be called what is 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.430
 therefore interesting for its 60 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.440
 early 70 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.210
 here it is we have all the pianos you go 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.810
 have a store to know that a piano 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.400
 opportunities very well made 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.880
 Europeans for the best known 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.330
 and the most qualitative ones 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.250
 according to the say are better than 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.490
 some new pianos that would be of 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:19.170
 lower quality of an invoice less 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:21.240
 prestigious we are all starting from 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.430
 dude technicians know we are here 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.670
 a training school in invoice 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.780
 instrumental the item and all the 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.910
 technicians all people 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.250
 working here without exception are 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.470
 piano technicians whatever their 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.000
 position of responsibility have a 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.920
 technician training 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.210
 so we always talk about things we 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.790
 know when someone asking us 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.210
 advice on a piano we have inevitably seen 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.160
 that we are all musicians also an aspect 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:52.010
 very human very musical 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.260
 every customer who arrives will see request 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.190
 specific will see in needs 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.030
 specific 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.930
 we will try to show him enough 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.270
 quickly the different ranges of 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.870
 piano then realize that according to the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.350
 piano mark that's going to have the sound is 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.060
 very different to be able to compare that 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.480
 we have sectorized a little in the store 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.640
 the different piano to say test the 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.260
 Japanese piano that is here to iron on 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.390
 the German piano ironing on the piano 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.500
 Japanese once we make the 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:27.620
 budget synthesis what we would like 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:31.070
 granted to the piano budget level etc 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.630
 etc we come to a kind of compromise 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.050
 it's not a thought obligation 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.550
 a lot of money for a piano if the 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.870
 need is specific 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.870
 we will try to go to the piano the most 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.870
 specific 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:50.259
 in general we propose the 10 times without 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:52.509
 fresh for example that pretty much appreciated 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.909
 has all that is water formula access 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:57.399
 lease purchase option are a form 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:58.139
 credit neither more nor less or the credit 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.789
 classical 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.459
 here are several payment facilities and 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:06.399
 piano at their concerts are guaranteed 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:08.800
 10 years key is whether opportunities 

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:10.929
 we have guarantees of recovery of 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.899
 guarantees fail if people stop 

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:15.849
 guarantees evolution is ironed from a 

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.800
 small piano a piano of superior range 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:21.009
 we take back the former under some 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.779
 conditions obviously but we arrange 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:25.330
 for if the person wants to take a 

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:26.379
 other piano that's easy 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.619
 interesting 

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:31.539
 the goal being to have several ranges of 

00:07:29.619 --> 00:07:33.479
 piano with us to start with a 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.679
 little piano to go on our ways 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.839
 leave to finish on the grand piano if he 

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:42.059
 must accompany the person 

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:42.059
 during his piano progression
