00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
okay now we're going to take this and do

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.660 
okay now we're going to take this and do
it<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.530> other<00:00:11.559> way<00:00:11.770> now<00:00:12.070> it's<00:00:12.280> starting<00:00:12.550> with

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
it the other way now it's starting with

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.950 
it the other way now it's starting with
your<00:00:12.790> fourth<00:00:13.030> finger<00:00:13.090> on<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.480> eighth<00:00:13.720> fret

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
your fourth finger on the eighth fret

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.300 
your fourth finger on the eighth fret
I'm<00:00:14.350> just<00:00:14.500> going<00:00:14.620> to<00:00:14.650> do<00:00:14.800> it<00:00:14.830> a<00:00:14.980> little<00:00:15.070> bit

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.310 
I'm just going to do it a little bit

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.370 
I'm just going to do it a little bit
faster<00:00:15.790> so<00:00:15.970> play<00:00:16.450> along<00:00:16.540> if<00:00:16.810> you<00:00:16.900> can<00:00:17.110> and<00:00:17.349> just

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
faster so play along if you can and just

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.960 
faster so play along if you can and just
remember<00:00:17.770> to<00:00:17.800> do<00:00:18.010> it<00:00:18.130> slow<00:00:18.340> at<00:00:18.490> first<00:00:18.520> and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
remember to do it slow at first and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.490 
remember to do it slow at first and
build<00:00:19.150> yourself<00:00:19.240> up<00:00:19.630> to<00:00:19.779> speed<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.290> it'll<00:00:20.410> be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
build yourself up to speed and it'll be

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:34.830 
build yourself up to speed and it'll be
cool<00:00:20.710> here<00:00:21.400> we<00:00:21.490> go

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.210 

so<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:35.900> guess<00:00:36.050> with<00:00:36.230> this<00:00:36.350> remember<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.860> faster

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
so I guess with this remember the faster

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.890 
so I guess with this remember the faster
your<00:00:37.340> practice<00:00:37.790> that<00:00:38.390> just<00:00:38.420> meaning<00:00:38.780> about

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
your practice that just meaning about

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.490 
your practice that just meaning about
the<00:00:39.020> practice<00:00:39.380> is<00:00:39.559> long<00:00:44.200> okay<00:00:45.200> now<00:00:45.379> we're

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
the practice is long okay now we're

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.110 
the practice is long okay now we're
going<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.650> talk<00:00:45.860> about<00:00:46.129> basic<00:00:46.550> slap<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.059> pop

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
going to talk about basic slap and pop

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.360 
going to talk about basic slap and pop
this<00:00:47.809> is<00:00:47.960> really<00:00:48.170> popular<00:00:48.410> technique<00:00:49.070> used<00:00:49.340> by

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
this is really popular technique used by

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.430 
this is really popular technique used by
a<00:00:49.489> lot<00:00:49.699> of<00:00:49.730> bass<00:00:49.970> players<00:00:50.019> there's<00:00:51.019> really<00:00:51.140> two

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
a lot of bass players there's really two

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.960 
a lot of bass players there's really two
motions<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.340> that's<00:00:52.460> with<00:00:52.640> your<00:00:52.730> right

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
motions to it and that's with your right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.240 
motions to it and that's with your right
hand<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.780> first<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.199> a<00:00:54.230> slap<00:00:54.590> and<00:00:55.040> what<00:00:55.160> we're

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
hand the first is a slap and what we're

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.890 
hand the first is a slap and what we're
gonna<00:00:55.370> do<00:00:55.610> is<00:00:55.790> deal<00:00:56.000> with<00:00:56.059> our<00:00:56.239> E<00:00:56.390> string<00:00:56.420> right

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
gonna do is deal with our E string right

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.780 
gonna do is deal with our E string right
now<00:00:57.080> just<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.440> get<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.680> technique<00:00:58.040> down<00:00:58.100> all

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
now just to get the technique down all

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.490 
now just to get the technique down all
you're<00:00:58.970> gonna<00:00:59.059> do<00:00:59.330> is<00:00:59.780> take<00:01:00.019> your<00:01:00.110> thumb<00:01:00.350> and

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
you're gonna do is take your thumb and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.140 
you're gonna do is take your thumb and
kind<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.680> relax<00:01:00.890> your<00:01:01.100> arm<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.640> you're<00:01:02.059> gonna

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
kind of relax your arm and you're gonna

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.490 
kind of relax your arm and you're gonna
hit<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.449> string<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:02.989> get<00:01:03.110> your<00:01:03.260> thumb<00:01:03.470> off

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
hit the string and get your thumb off

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.740 
hit the string and get your thumb off
really<00:01:04.129> fast<00:01:04.430> because<00:01:05.000> if<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.330> hold<00:01:05.570> your

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
really fast because if you hold your

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.300 
really fast because if you hold your
thumb<00:01:05.960> down<00:01:06.200> on<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.619> string<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:06.890> mute<00:01:07.220> it

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
thumb down on the string you mute it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.580 
thumb down on the string you mute it
from<00:01:07.460> playing<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.149> it's<00:01:08.270> just<00:01:08.330> like<00:01:08.479> this

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.139 

that's<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.649> slap<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.580> seems<00:01:13.759> like<00:01:13.910> an<00:01:14.000> easy

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
that's a slap it seems like an easy

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.460 
that's a slap it seems like an easy
enough<00:01:14.450> thing<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:15.050> just<00:01:15.229> when<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:15.410> start

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
enough thing it's just when you start

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.380 
enough thing it's just when you start
switching<00:01:16.039> it<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.190> other<00:01:16.399> strings<00:01:16.850> now<00:01:17.240> it

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
switching it to other strings now it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.270 
switching it to other strings now it
gets<00:01:17.479> more<00:01:17.690> difficult<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.740> when<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:18.950> switch<00:01:19.160> to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
gets more difficult so when I switch to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.190 
gets more difficult so when I switch to
my<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.399> string<00:01:19.940> you<00:01:20.450> have<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.720> keep<00:01:20.869> your<00:01:21.020> E

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
my a string you have to keep your E

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.529 
my a string you have to keep your E
string<00:01:21.229> from<00:01:21.649> muting<00:01:22.009> from<00:01:22.610> playing<00:01:23.420> from

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
string from muting from playing from

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.270 
string from muting from playing from
ringing<00:01:23.840> out<00:01:24.020> while<00:01:24.229> you're<00:01:24.380> hitting<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.830> so

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
ringing out while you're hitting it so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.859 
ringing out while you're hitting it so
I'm<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:25.789> sometimes<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:26.390> use<00:01:26.539> my<00:01:26.690> thumb

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
I'm you sometimes I use my thumb

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.660 
I'm you sometimes I use my thumb
actually<00:01:27.050> over<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.560> top<00:01:27.740> on<00:01:27.920> my<00:01:27.950> left<00:01:28.250> hand<00:01:28.490> to

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
actually over the top on my left hand to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.490 
actually over the top on my left hand to
mute<00:01:28.850> my<00:01:29.000> E<00:01:29.030> string<00:01:29.539> and<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.200> hold<00:01:30.350> my

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
mute my E string and I just hold my

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.930 
mute my E string and I just hold my
other<00:01:30.680> strings<00:01:31.039> lightly<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.820> won't

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
other strings lightly so that it won't

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.730 
other strings lightly so that it won't
ring<00:01:32.240> because<00:01:32.780> usually<00:01:32.960> are<00:01:33.289> hitting<00:01:33.619> more

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
ring because usually are hitting more

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.320 
ring because usually are hitting more
than<00:01:33.890> one<00:01:34.009> string<00:01:34.310> when<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.580> slap<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.180> this

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
than one string when you slap so this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.649 
than one string when you slap so this
one's<00:01:35.539> like<00:01:35.720> this

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.250 

you

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
you

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.380 
you
so<00:01:40.980> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.190> see<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.060> bit

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
so you can see how it's a little bit

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.000 
so you can see how it's a little bit
difficult<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:43.080> kind<00:01:43.260> of<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.590> between<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
difficult to kind of get in between the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.500 
difficult to kind of get in between the
strings<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.460> thumb<00:01:44.760> accurately<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
strings with your thumb accurately and

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.940 
strings with your thumb accurately and
that<00:01:45.540> does<00:01:45.780> take<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> little<00:01:46.200> practice<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that does take a little practice and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.410 
that does take a little practice and
generally<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:47.970> only<00:01:48.120> going<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.360> be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
generally you're only going to be

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
generally you're only going to be
slapping<00:01:49.050> on<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.320> ena<00:01:49.770> strings<00:01:50.190> for<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:50.970> D

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
slapping on your ena strings for your D
