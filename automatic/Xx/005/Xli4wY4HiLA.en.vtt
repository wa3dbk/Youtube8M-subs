 N / A 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.100
 in Windows 7 there is the possibility of own programs and devices under 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.319
 Windows XP to start 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.570
 Please note 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.869
 The Windows XP Not is only beautify in the Windows 7 Medical Lampre 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.210
 a bag of rice and Artie Mac available 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.990
 In addition, the processor used by your PC must 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 Support virtualization technologies 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.249
 Please make sure if this was the case during your process 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.779
 We recommend a look at the pages of the manufacturer 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.000
 the manufacturer has a feature called this feature 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.360
 at Intel Nikci 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.490
 if your processes support virtualization then this feature only has to work 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.090
 still be activated in Piraeus 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.830
 Naturally, running virtual machines is a spokesperson 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.970
 intensive roadway is recommended to use only with sufficient 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.059
 from 2 who has baptism 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.510
 and save for enough disks 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.680
 your PC should meet the above requirements 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.350
 so nothing stands in the way of using the Windows XP Motets 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 Please visit first the official Microsoft websites 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.680
 Windows Virtual PC marriages 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.840
 There you can choose in the first step if you want a 32-bit or 64-bit 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 and select the appropriate language 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.590
 in the second step they will then be the latest version of Windows Virtual PC 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.070
 down 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.010
 this program allows you a second on Reiner software basis 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 To install the operating system within Windows 7 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.750
 In the last step, they will suffer from Windows XP Not 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.030
 This is a special Windows XP he manages for free from 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.180
 Microsoft is provided 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.479
 because this file is over 400 feet in size 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.920
 They should spend some time on the internet depending on their internet connection 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.570
 Schedule download

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.669
 Set operating system 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.649
 We also recommend that you also activate Tomato snapped x 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.129
 then your new Windows XP will be set up for first use 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.199
 finished is the virtual keyboard 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.689
 These clock-set virtual machines run with the full 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.019
 Functional range of a normal PC and caught the submission under Windows XP test 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.169
 off 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.469
 new is only the menu bar that appears at the top of the window 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.789
 There they can change settings under Teck Street 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.639
 and perform other actions 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.939
 particularly interesting is the point where it is the 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.569
 the councils listed there are inside the virtual machine 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.059

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.489
 associations 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.730
 By the way, all programs can do it in their windows xp virtual mode 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.149
 to install 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:15.779
 then directly via the start menu of your Windows 7 PC 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.279
 be executed 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.729
 without first calling the virtual desktop every time 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.449
 Just click on all programs 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.619
 and where Anderson really see Germans 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.009
 There you will find applications for all the applications they are on the virtual 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.089
 Machine installed 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:37.299
 when they start a program from this list it will work within Windows 7 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.629
 opened a new window with this application 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.260
 in the background it uses a virtual Windows XP get it 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.249
 as a user hardly with 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.219
 nothing to see from the virtual machine yesterday
