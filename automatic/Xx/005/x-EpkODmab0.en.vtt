00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
video and you'll understand exactly the

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.449 
video and you'll understand exactly the
process<00:00:13.629> that<00:00:14.080> takes<00:00:14.260> unlock<00:00:14.650> any<00:00:14.920> Rogers

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459

process that takes unlock any Rogers
Motorola<00:00:15.969> phone

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.920 

so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
so

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
so
we<00:00:22.020> need<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> get<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.440> IMEI<00:00:22.890> number<00:00:23.520> which<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
we need to get the IMEI number which is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.360 
we need to get the IMEI number which is
used<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> calculate<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.110> unlock<00:00:25.410> code<00:00:25.440> right

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
used to calculate the unlock code right

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.860 
used to calculate the unlock code right
so<00:00:26.550> now<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.790> get<00:00:27.030> it<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.240> notice<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.690> says

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
so now to get it you notice it says

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.720 
so now to get it you notice it says
insert<00:00:28.290> sim<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.800> also<00:00:28.980> notice<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.580> when<00:00:29.700> I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
insert sim you also notice that when I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.130 
insert sim you also notice that when I
press<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.940> button<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.270> says<00:00:30.420> emergency<00:00:30.930> calls

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
press a button it says emergency calls

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.050 
press a button it says emergency calls
only<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.010> can<00:00:32.099> ignore<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> emergency

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
only so you can ignore the emergency

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.100 
only so you can ignore the emergency
calls<00:00:33.330> only<00:00:33.630> type<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.440> star<00:00:34.830> pound<00:00:35.340> zero<00:00:36.110> six

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
calls only type in star pound zero six

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
calls only type in star pound zero six
pound<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.940> number<00:00:39.120> will<00:00:39.300> come<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.690> your

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
screen now when you go to global mouth

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.890 
screen now when you go to global mouth
comm<00:00:41.850> you're<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> enter<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.690> number

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
comm you're going to enter this number

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.100 
comm you're going to enter this number
into<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.699> let's<00:00:44.699> call<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> IMEI<00:00:45.360> number

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
into here let's call the IMEI number

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.500 
into here let's call the IMEI number
now<00:00:46.470> each<00:00:46.739> unlock<00:00:47.190> code<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.670> unique<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.449> each

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
now each unlock code is unique to each

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
now each unlock code is unique to each
phone<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:49.199> what<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> enter<00:00:50.010> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
a not allowed SIM card in what in our

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.510 
a not allowed SIM card in what in our
lab<00:01:16.170> SIM<00:01:16.409> card<00:01:16.620> is<00:01:16.710> basically<00:01:17.159> any<00:01:17.370> other

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
lab SIM card is basically any other

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
lab SIM card is basically any other
network<00:01:18.030> than<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.300> original<00:01:18.750> network<00:01:19.050> this

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
network than the original network this

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.250 
network than the original network this
is<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.710> Rogers<00:01:20.280> bone<00:01:20.760> so<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.869> reading<00:01:22.110> is

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
is a Rogers bone so what I'm reading is

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.680 
is a Rogers bone so what I'm reading is
I'm<00:01:22.380> putting<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.830> t-mobile<00:01:23.310> SIM<00:01:23.790> card<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
I'm putting a t-mobile SIM card in it

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.050 
I'm putting a t-mobile SIM card in it
Rogers<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.740> Canada<00:01:26.070> t-mobile's<00:01:26.550> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.790> US

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
Rogers and Canada t-mobile's in the US

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.630 
Rogers and Canada t-mobile's in the US
it<00:01:27.240> doesn't<00:01:27.570> matter<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.990> network<00:01:28.520> now<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it doesn't matter what network now it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
it doesn't matter what network now it
doesn't<00:01:29.820> necessarily<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.570> be<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.080> sim

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
doesn't necessarily have to be the sim

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
doesn't necessarily have to be the sim
card<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
card that you're going to use with the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.380 
card that you're going to use with the
phone

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
phone

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780 
phone
like<00:01:34.080> for<00:01:34.440> example<00:01:34.470> t-mobile<00:01:35.070> SIM<00:01:35.369> card<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:35.610> put

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
like for example t-mobile SIM card I put

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.160 
like for example t-mobile SIM card I put
in<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.090> does<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.479> doesn't<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.960> live

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
in actually does it doesn't have a live

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.100 
in actually does it doesn't have a live
line<00:01:37.440> on<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:38.940> work<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.390> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
line on it but it will work so this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.810 
line on it but it will work so this
point<00:01:40.350> you've<00:01:40.470> gone<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.830> global<00:01:41.130> off<00:01:41.310> comm

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
point you've gone to global off comm

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
point you've gone to global off comm
you've<00:01:42.149> got<00:01:42.330> your<00:01:42.509> unlock<00:01:42.810> code<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.950> are

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you've got your unlock code and you are

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.090 
you've got your unlock code and you are
ready<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.580> go<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.780> couple<00:01:46.440> things<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.830> make<00:01:47.070> a
