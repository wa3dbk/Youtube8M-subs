two<00:00:59.969> different<00:01:00.000> software<00:01:00.690> programs<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.140> help

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
two different software programs to help

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.789 
two different software programs to help
launch<00:01:01.590> between<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:03.270> kill<00:01:03.660> stuff<00:01:03.799> so

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
launch between the two and kill stuff so

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.399 
launch between the two and kill stuff so
I<00:01:05.460> use<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> program<00:01:06.360> called<00:01:06.540> Windows<00:01:07.020> hotkey

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
I use a program called Windows hotkey

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.219 
I use a program called Windows hotkey
which<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.860> listen<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.000> IR<00:01:09.240> part<00:01:09.570> well

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
which will listen on the IR part well

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
which will listen on the IR part well
actually<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> keyboard<00:01:10.799> command<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
actually it's a keyboard command you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
actually it's a keyboard command you
keep<00:01:12.090> working<00:01:12.240> around<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.630> f12<00:01:13.080> it'll

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
keep working around like f12 it'll

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.039 
keep working around like f12 it'll
launch<00:01:13.470> an<00:01:13.560> application<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:15.330> script<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
file or something like that so I used

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.420 
file or something like that so I used
that<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.630> map<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.170> keyboard<00:01:19.770> commands<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that to map the keyboard commands to the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
that to map the keyboard commands to the
Harmony<00:01:20.820> remote<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.259> press<00:01:22.409> um<00:01:22.890> let's
