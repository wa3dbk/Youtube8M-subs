00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 one of the most common 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.680
 non-injection options 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.990
 mesotherapy 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.269
 is an electroporation technique 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.639
 delivery of active substances into the skin cells 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.590
 using electromagnetic waves in front 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.750
 the beginning of the procedure gently cleaned and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.000
 tones the skin applied to the skin 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
 specially selected drugs or their 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 mix and cocktails 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 after which the desired area is processed 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 electromagnetic pulses under 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.300
 the action of such pulses is temporarily 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.160
 pores open and enlarge 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 cell membrane permeability 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.020
 resulting in drugs without problems 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.200
 fall from the subcutaneous layers and then 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.890
 directly into the cells using 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.110
 electroporation can be performed 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.340
 rejuvenation of any skin area as well 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.110
 cellulite treatment and stretch marks 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 then apply the drug and selected by 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.879
 skin type and inject them with 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 ultraphonophoresis surface layer of skin 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.410
 while providing a deeper 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.480
 penetration previously entered 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.969
 components using electroporation 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.890
 enhance the metabolic processes in the skin with 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.890
 using a cold blue photon 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.210
 for complete absorption of used 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.750
 drugs we use alginate 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.479
 masks 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.000
 active ingredients that moisturize 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.810
 nourish the skin and promote flowing in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.810
 her exchange processes 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.830
 complete the procedure with a moisturizer 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.960
 by skin type as is the case with normal 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.940
 meso-therapy to achieve a pronounced 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.470
 effect will need to complete a course of 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.119
 eight ten sessions 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.119
 beautician consultation needed 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.429
 waiting for you at street lake 19
