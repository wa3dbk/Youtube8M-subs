confusing because there's so many
different<00:00:36.930> symbols

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
different symbols

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.360 
different symbols
it's<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.250> film<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.000> tough<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.950> I<00:00:40.950> want<00:00:41.280> to

explain to you some of some more of
these<00:00:43.170> symbols<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:44.730> already<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.180> hopefully

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
these symbols you already know hopefully

that<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.200> squiggly<00:00:46.649> thing<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> G<00:00:47.640> clef

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
that this squiggly thing is a G clef

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.439 
that this squiggly thing is a G clef
because<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> points<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> us<00:00:50.640> where<00:00:50.969> G<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
because it points out to us where G is

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.040 
because it points out to us where G is
on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.110> staff<00:00:52.410> where<00:00:52.739> G<00:00:52.949> lives<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.870> the

us where G lives she lives on the second

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.789 
us where G lives she lives on the second
line<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.579> marked<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.359> purple<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.619> it's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
line and I marked it with purple so it's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.460 
line and I marked it with purple so it's
G<00:01:04.979> note<00:01:05.780> yes<00:01:06.780> another<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:08.299> GGG<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.689> one

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
ledger line going through it so it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
ledger line going through it so it's
easy<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> recognize<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.150> below<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.200> the

easy to recognize and it's below all the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.760 
easy to recognize and it's below all the
five<00:01:25.619> lines<00:01:25.950> yes<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.990> here's<00:01:27.990> three<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.619> them

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
five lines yes see here's three of them

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.200 
five lines yes see here's three of them
sees<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.600> starts<00:01:30.990> off<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.290> si<00:01:31.560> si<00:01:32.340> si

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
sees and it starts off with si si si

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.319 
sees and it starts off with si si si
like<00:01:33.720> that

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
like that

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
like that
now<00:01:36.329> these<00:01:37.259> green<00:01:37.650> lines<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.640> marked

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
now these green lines here that I marked

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.710 
now these green lines here that I marked
are<00:01:39.270> called<00:01:39.570> bar<00:01:39.780> lines<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.799> they<00:01:40.979> divide

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
are called bar lines because they divide

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.530 
are called bar lines because they divide
the<00:01:42.720> whole<00:01:42.930> music<00:01:43.290> into<00:01:43.860> bars<00:01:44.460> also<00:01:45.329> called

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the whole music into bars also called

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.469 
the whole music into bars also called
measures<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> here's<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.820> those<00:01:47.939> measures

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
measures so here's one of those measures

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.830 
measures so here's one of those measures
and<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.290> another<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.460> them<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.880> houses

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and it's another think of them as houses

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.440 
and it's another think of them as houses
where<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> notes<00:01:52.439> live<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:54.149> certain

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
where the notes live and a certain

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.530 
where the notes live and a certain
amount<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.810> notes<00:01:55.079> fit<00:01:55.350> into<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.640> house<00:01:56.880> like

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
amount of notes fit into one house like

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.450 
amount of notes fit into one house like
here<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.649> measure<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.189> three

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
here this in this measure that's three

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.330 
here this in this measure that's three
notes<00:01:59.840> but<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.530> measure<00:02:01.890> there's<00:02:02.159> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
notes but in this measure there's just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.810 
notes but in this measure there's just
one<00:02:02.610> note<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.280> music

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
one note and that is because in music

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.449 
one note and that is because in music
notation<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.719> notes<00:02:06.930> need<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> tell<00:02:07.560> us<00:02:07.799> not

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
notation the notes need to tell us not

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.779 
notation the notes need to tell us not
only<00:02:08.670> how<00:02:08.819> high<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.629> low<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
only how high or low the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.290 
only how high or low the
but<00:02:11.060> also<00:02:11.210> how<00:02:11.510> long<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:13.010> play<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.760> note<00:02:13.970> or

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
but also how long we play the note or

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.890 
but also how long we play the note or
sing<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.930> note<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.520> different<00:02:17.330> notes<00:02:17.570> of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
sing the note so different notes of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.050 
sing the note so different notes of
different<00:02:18.380> lengths<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.580> length<00:02:19.850> is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
different lengths and the length is

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.440 
different lengths and the length is
indicated<00:02:20.750> by<00:02:21.310> whether<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.550> note<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:23.030> not

this one we already looked at and at the

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.159 
this one we already looked at and at the
last<00:05:11.250> line<00:05:12.890> life<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:14.070> but<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.250> dream<00:05:14.390> life<00:05:15.390> is

up just one step from C to D and then

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:00.950 
up just one step from C to D and then

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
one is on a line so that means that you

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.649

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.519 
but the next C up higher okay and so
this<00:07:17.849> one<00:07:18.029> is<00:07:18.210> something<00:07:18.659> you<00:07:18.930> might<00:07:19.229> want<00:07:19.469> to
