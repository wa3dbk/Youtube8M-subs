00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.080
 very good kids data welcome to 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.969
 a new video of moore from minecraft and 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.530
 this time I bring you the minimal king so a 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.869
 of the first requests that he received 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.180
 part of requests also 3 mod that 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.320
 they are partly unknown because 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.970
 many action youtubers do not 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.039
 They use me and they seem very useful to me 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.900
 but good for now let's start with 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.609
 re minimum that many already know and 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.919
 well it's just a mod that adds you 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.169
 guide functions as is the map that 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.000
 you have above and some useful functions 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.829
 how to leave map marks for 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.390
 guide us in the best way the first thing that 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.829
 we have pressing the m are a lot of 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.379
 options that we can activate or 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.210
 deactivate what we can change the type of 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.649
 rendering that is the map for example 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.930
 same state on the surface we can 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.460
 see the biomes and we can see how they are 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.350
 the caves below the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.760
 surface worth we can also mark 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.530
 for example in later if we want to 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.059
 see where we died the last time in 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.949
 minimum we can change for example the 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.539
 style if we want it to be a square 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.129
 a circle the texture you want to have 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.140
 a lot of options but the most 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.910
 important or the most important would be 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.890
 pressing the X that we have the map in 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.720
 big one that helps us see a lot 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.240
 better what we have in front or by the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.010
 sides and the most important option 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 pressing the cee or pressing the m in 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.180
 waypoint 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.700
 that would be the possibility of leaving marks 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.780
 for example here you are going to put jungle 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.820
 balear for example I can go here 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.500
 go far away far away and as you see 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.720
 on the map we have a yellow mark 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.460
 what would the jungle be for example if I 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.039
 out here 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.590
 Well look, we could put for example 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.409
 cows we can here a brand that is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.610
 cow or cattle worth Japanese earned well 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.990
 we know for example if we have to go to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.570
 somewhere you want it and we have to 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.700
 come back or anything else we know that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.229
 there is the jungle and here is the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.500
 won by then you will find a 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.970
 dungeon or I do not know a diamond streak and 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.039
 does not have any iron peak because 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.229
 the gesture and then when you come back you know 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.940
 how to get to that point so nothing 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.009
 guys now let's move on to see how it 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.810
 install and see you in a moment to 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.369
 install it you only need two things what 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.470
 first is trenc install minecraft 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.090
 force that if you do not know how to do it or not 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.159
 is installed what you have in the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.780
 description of this same video and what 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.759
 another one that is missing is of course the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.180
 minimum king that you will also have 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.040
 description of this video 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.840
 once you get off the file it will be this 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.879
 you have here exactly the same only 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.409
 you have to copy the threads to yours 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.260
 minecraft folder who you know is 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.579
 writing here percent app data by 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.290
 hundred is something that you have like me 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.540
 I have here this roaming leaves you 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.879
 within you enter in minecraft enter upon 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.620
 the folder mods copies the file inside 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.799
 and you're just going to have to 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.269
 run now your minecraft using the 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.480
 profile of fort scheme wait for 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.849
 charge a little more to the force profile 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.230
 dais to start and now without doing 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.150
 magic with the minimum king has installed 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.939
 now you can leave your marks you can 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.260
 see the map of manuals to check 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.299
 that is well installed you only have 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.819
 have to face the option of mods and 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.980
 look for what will come out as mod king 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.659
 minimum is worth and that's all the guys if 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.849
