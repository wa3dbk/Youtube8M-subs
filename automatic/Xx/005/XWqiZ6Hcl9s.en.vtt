okay okay just have a minute just click
on<00:00:54.190> those<00:00:54.340> two<00:00:54.550> links<00:01:03.989> yes<00:01:04.989> did<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.409> ever<00:01:05.680> meet

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
on those two links yes did you ever meet

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.080 
on those two links yes did you ever meet
Walter<00:01:06.400> White<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.880> chemistry<00:01:07.420> conference

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
Walter White of the chemistry conference

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.289 
Walter White of the chemistry conference
okay

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
okay

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.440 
okay
just<00:01:10.659> wondering<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.700> thought<00:01:16.119> that<00:01:16.330> was

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
just wondering and I thought that was

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.880 
just wondering and I thought that was
very<00:01:16.540> relevant<00:01:16.960> okay<00:01:18.570> okay

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
very relevant okay okay

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.440 
very relevant okay okay
it<00:01:21.220> was<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.400> chemistry<00:01:21.820> question<00:01:21.970> it's<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
it was a chemistry question it's the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.210 
it was a chemistry question it's the
chemistry<00:01:22.810> question<00:01:23.350> they're<00:01:23.530> not<00:01:23.710> related

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
chemistry question they're not related

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.320 
chemistry question they're not related
to<00:01:25.259> okay<00:01:26.259> all<00:01:26.680> right<00:01:26.830> one<00:01:27.700> more<00:01:27.850> question

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
to okay all right one more question

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.990 
to okay all right one more question
yeah<00:01:28.689> is<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.799> loudest<00:01:30.310> your<00:01:30.520> microphone

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
yeah is that the loudest your microphone

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.840 
yeah is that the loudest your microphone
goes<00:01:32.790> okay<00:01:33.790> all<00:01:34.390> right<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:35.020> here<00:01:35.729> maybe<00:01:36.729> a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
goes okay all right in here maybe a

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.080 
goes okay all right in here maybe a
little<00:01:37.000> more<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:39.189> yes<00:01:39.700> all<00:01:40.180> right<00:01:40.360> very<00:01:40.630> good

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
little more here yes all right very good

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.610 
little more here yes all right very good
all<00:01:43.090> right

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.960 

we're<00:01:46.620> gonna<00:01:46.710> start<00:01:47.280> talking<00:01:47.400> about<00:01:47.730> chapter

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we're gonna start talking about chapter

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.080 
we're gonna start talking about chapter
one<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:49.040> think<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> will<00:01:50.280> find<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.670> chapter

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
one I think you will find that chapter

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.130 
one I think you will find that chapter
one<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.830> largely<00:01:52.830> review<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:54.300> most<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
one is largely review for most of you a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.720 
one is largely review for most of you a
lot<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.860> taken<00:01:55.980> general<00:01:56.460> chemistry

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
lot of you have taken general chemistry

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.990 
lot of you have taken general chemistry
and<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.720> think<00:01:57.930> chapter<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.730> broad

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and I think chapter one is it's a broad

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.280 
and I think chapter one is it's a broad
range<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.450> material<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.430> very<00:02:02.790> cohesive

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
range of material it's not very cohesive

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.180 
range of material it's not very cohesive
but<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.380> think<00:02:04.620> what<00:02:04.770> you'll<00:02:04.920> find<00:02:05.160> is<00:02:07.040> only<00:02:08.040> got

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
but I think what you'll find is only got

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.070 
but I think what you'll find is only got
one<00:02:08.399> lecture<00:02:08.670> dedicated<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:09.869> we're<00:02:09.990> gonna

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
one lecture dedicated so we're gonna

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.260 
one lecture dedicated so we're gonna
kind<00:02:10.320> of<00:02:10.500> zip<00:02:11.190> through<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:14.060> all<00:02:15.060> right

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
kind of zip through here all right

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.880 
kind of zip through here all right
excuse<00:02:16.020> me<00:02:16.230> yeah

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
excuse me yeah

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.220 
excuse me yeah
one<00:02:17.130> more<00:02:17.310> question<00:02:17.550> all<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:18.230> that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
one more question all right that

morning<00:03:02.890> here<00:03:03.780> all<00:03:04.780> right<00:03:05.050> what's<00:03:05.380> chemistry

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
morning here all right what's chemistry

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.300 
morning here all right what's chemistry
study<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.360> matter<00:03:07.569> study<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.650> its<00:03:08.800> properties

study of matter study of its properties

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.250 
study of matter study of its properties
and<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.150> changes<00:03:10.599> that<00:03:10.630> matter<00:03:10.930> undergoes

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
and the changes that matter undergoes

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.309 
and the changes that matter undergoes
there<00:03:11.709> are<00:03:11.770> some<00:03:11.890> definitions<00:03:12.520> matter<00:03:13.510> the

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
there are some definitions matter the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.270 
there are some definitions matter the
stuff<00:03:14.709> right<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.610> universe<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.180> made<00:03:16.390> up

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
stuff right that the universe is made up
