00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
probably about that much into my hand

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.949 
probably about that much into my hand
and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.709> start<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.520> did<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
and then just start and then did that

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.720 
and then just start and then did that
but<00:02:25.970> they're<00:02:27.260> patches<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:28.950> hair<00:02:29.220> where

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
but they're patches of my hair where

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.580 
but they're patches of my hair where
there<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.209> more<00:02:31.190> than<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:32.820> my

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
there is more than that but that's my

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.170 
there is more than that but that's my
uneven<00:02:34.590> distribution<00:02:34.740> from<00:02:35.400> myself<00:02:35.940> so

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
uneven distribution from myself so

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.640 
uneven distribution from myself so
that's<00:02:36.330> my<00:02:36.600> downfall<00:02:37.700> but<00:02:38.989> yeah<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.350> leaves

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that's my downfall but yeah it leaves

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.040 
that's my downfall but yeah it leaves
your<00:02:40.860> hair<00:02:41.450> that's<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.630> they're<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.900> not

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
your hair that's and they're just not

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.170 
your hair that's and they're just not
feeling<00:02:43.410> very<00:02:43.440> nice<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.730> doesn't<00:02:45.000> really

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
feeling very nice and it doesn't really

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.220 
feeling very nice and it doesn't really
hold<00:02:45.540> see<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.890> his<00:02:47.190> whole<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:48.239> holding<00:02:48.930> I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
hold see that his whole is holding I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.220 
hold see that his whole is holding I
guess<00:02:50.060> but<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.940> one's<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.570> lot<00:02:54.690> better<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.110> you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
guess but this one's a lot better if you

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.729 
guess but this one's a lot better if you
want<00:02:55.440> light<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.830> do<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.450> quiff<00:02:57.450> not<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.440> this

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
want light to do a quiff not that this

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.550 
want light to do a quiff not that this
is<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> quiff<00:02:59.340> really<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.269> subtle<00:03:00.989> quiff<00:03:01.350> or

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
is a quiff really is a subtle quiff or

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.070 
is a quiff really is a subtle quiff or
something<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:04.430> don't<00:03:05.430> know<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:06.000> wouldn't<00:03:06.690> I

is<00:04:01.079> called<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.829> clay<00:04:02.130> but<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.290> The

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
is called a clay but it's not like The

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.430 
is called a clay but it's not like The
Trevor<00:04:04.890> Trevor<00:04:05.489> sorbet<00:04:06.239> clay<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.840> have<00:04:07.170> is

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
Trevor Trevor sorbet clay that I have is

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.470 
Trevor Trevor sorbet clay that I have is
more<00:04:07.650> like<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.070> it's<00:04:08.400> more<00:04:08.579> like<00:04:08.760> I've

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
more like that and it's more like I've

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.500 
more like that and it's more like I've
got<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.989> map<00:04:10.470> clay<00:04:10.799> in<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.430> vo5<00:04:11.850> range<00:04:12.180> and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
got the map clay in the vo5 range and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.090 
got the map clay in the vo5 range and
it's<00:04:12.870> not<00:04:13.049> like<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.410> this<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.709> more<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.010> a

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
it's not like that this is more of a

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.890 
it's not like that this is more of a
paste<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.609> think<00:04:14.820> it<00:04:14.910> might<00:04:15.030> be<00:04:15.060> called<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.450> paste

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
paste I think it might be called a paste

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.780 
paste I think it might be called a paste
sure<00:04:16.199> I'm<00:04:16.530> not<00:04:16.919> sure<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.070> thought<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.519> was<00:04:17.639> cool

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
sure I'm not sure I thought it was cool

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.530 
sure I'm not sure I thought it was cool
clay<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.299> maybe<00:04:18.449> it's<00:04:18.660> not<00:04:19.400> but<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:21.239> isn't

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
clay but maybe it's not but this isn't

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.360 
clay but maybe it's not but this isn't
really<00:04:21.840> working<00:04:22.019> for<00:04:22.290> me<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:22.979> don't<00:04:23.040> know

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
really working for me and I don't know

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.850 
really working for me and I don't know
what<00:04:23.550> I'm<00:04:23.610> gonna<00:04:23.760> do<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.240> 150<00:04:25.050> mils<00:04:25.290> left<00:04:25.680> of

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
what I'm gonna do with 150 mils left of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.580 
what I'm gonna do with 150 mils left of
this<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.750> probably<00:04:27.750> shouldn't<00:04:28.080> do<00:04:28.229> that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
this I probably shouldn't do that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.409 
this I probably shouldn't do that
I<00:04:28.620> might<00:04:28.979> give<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.310> my<00:04:29.430> brother<00:04:29.460> but<00:04:30.090> it's

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
I might give it to my brother but it's
