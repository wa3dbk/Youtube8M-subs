00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
I have already I spent a good probably

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.530 
I have already I spent a good probably
eight<00:01:52.829> hours<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> design<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.329> used

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
eight hours on the design and I used

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.889 
eight hours on the design and I used
Google<00:01:54.720> Sketchup<00:01:55.110> I'll<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
Google Sketchup I'll do that on the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.200 
Google Sketchup I'll do that on the
another<00:01:57.899> video<00:01:58.229> I'll<00:01:58.530> show<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.060> so<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.119> know

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
another video I'll show that so I know

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.709 
another video I'll show that so I know
exactly<00:02:00.590> how<00:02:01.590> much<00:02:01.649> wood<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.219> needed<00:02:02.729> went<00:02:03.540> got

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
exactly how much wood I needed went got

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.039 
exactly how much wood I needed went got
it<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.079> also<00:02:04.290> knew<00:02:04.530> exactly<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> dimensions

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
it I also knew exactly the dimensions

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.790 
it I also knew exactly the dimensions
and<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:08.539> step<00:02:09.539> three<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.410> something

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and this is step three or something

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.890 
and this is step three or something
which<00:02:11.039> sucks<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:11.790> bad<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.270> I'm<00:02:12.450> breaking

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
which sucks really bad but I'm breaking

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.360 
which sucks really bad but I'm breaking
up<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.500> ground

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
up all the ground

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.789 
up all the ground
I'll<00:02:15.610> put<00:02:15.909> weed<00:02:16.120> cloth<00:02:16.299> down<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.019> then<00:02:17.260> that's

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
I'll put weed cloth down and then that's

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.320 
I'll put weed cloth down and then that's
where<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.459> gravel<00:02:20.159> comes<00:02:21.159> in<00:02:21.310> part<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.879> layer

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
where the gravel comes in part so layer

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.899 
where the gravel comes in part so layer
the<00:02:22.510> gravel<00:02:22.900> over<00:02:23.019> all<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:27.280> actually

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
the gravel over all this and actually

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.850 
the gravel over all this and actually
before<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.299> can<00:02:28.450> do<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.720> have<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.019> set<00:02:29.739> my

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
before I can do that I have to set my

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.690 
before I can do that I have to set my
pose<00:02:31.349> I'm<00:02:32.349> out<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.620> another<00:02:32.829> note<00:02:33.099> here's<00:02:33.519> my

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
pose I'm out of another note here's my

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.149 
pose I'm out of another note here's my
solar<00:02:34.890> panel<00:02:35.890> stand<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:37.680> had<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.739> take<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> break

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
solar panel stand I had to take a break

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.470 
solar panel stand I had to take a break
on<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:41.110> nonsense<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:42.010> build<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.280> deck<00:02:42.480> but

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
on this nonsense to build the deck but

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.069 
on this nonsense to build the deck but
as<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.900> can<00:02:43.989> see<00:02:44.819> my<00:02:45.819> panel<00:02:46.359> up<00:02:46.569> there<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.900> is

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
as you can see my panel up there this is

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.819 
as you can see my panel up there this is
much<00:02:50.290> better<00:02:50.470> than<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:52.019> side<00:02:53.019> of<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.500> fence

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
much better than the side of the fence

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.449 
much better than the side of the fence
paneling<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.730> had<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.069> on<00:02:57.220> hinges

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
paneling that I had and it is on hinges

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.770 
paneling that I had and it is on hinges
so<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.879> can<00:02:58.090> change<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.879> angle<00:03:00.879> during<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
so I can change the angle during the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.470 
so I can change the angle during the
different<00:03:01.930> seasons<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:03.459> whatever<00:03:04.030> that's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
different seasons but whatever that's

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.399 
different seasons but whatever that's
gonna<00:03:04.840> have<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.019> take<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.170> break<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:07.930> I'll

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
gonna have to take a break for this I'll

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.729
