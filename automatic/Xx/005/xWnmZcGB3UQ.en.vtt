dual voice coil subwoofer it's important
to<00:00:14.639> understand<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.540> both<00:00:15.960> voice<00:00:16.320> coils<00:00:16.830> need

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
to understand that both voice coils need

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.880 
to understand that both voice coils need
to<00:00:17.250> be<00:00:17.369> hooked<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.760> I've<00:00:18.439> run<00:00:19.439> across<00:00:19.529> some

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
to be hooked up I've run across some

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
to be hooked up I've run across some
people<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.400> want<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.580> hook<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.060> if

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
people to just want to hook up one if

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.210 
people to just want to hook up one if
that<00:00:21.720> blows<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:22.500> they<00:00:22.590> use<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> other<00:00:23.010> one

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
that blows then they use the other one

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.769 
that blows then they use the other one
it's<00:00:23.400> not<00:00:23.609> that's<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.660> it

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
it's not that's not the way that it

it's not that's not the way that it
works<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.289> want<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.529> hook<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.859> both<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> these

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
works you want to hook up both of these

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.759 
works you want to hook up both of these
in<00:00:26.760> here<00:00:26.960> there's<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.109> ways<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.529> hook<00:00:28.650> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
in here there's two ways you can hook it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.570 
in here there's two ways you can hook it
up

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
up

up
this<00:00:29.939> particular<00:00:30.420> subwoofer<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> two<00:00:31.740> um

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
this particular subwoofer is a two um

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.069 
this particular subwoofer is a two um
dual<00:00:32.610> voice<00:00:32.820> coil<00:00:33.180> sub<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.809> either<00:00:33.960> going

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
dual voice coil sub so it's either going

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.979 
dual voice coil sub so it's either going
to<00:00:34.140> run<00:00:34.290> at<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.620> ohm<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:34.980> four<00:00:35.790> ohms<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.450> I'll

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
to run at one ohm or four ohms and I'll

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.560 
to run at one ohm or four ohms and I'll
show<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.230> how<00:00:37.350> those<00:00:37.559> work<00:00:38.149> when<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.239> wire<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
show you how those work when you wire it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.900 
show you how those work when you wire it
in<00:00:39.660> parallel<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> put<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.760> down

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
in parallel that's going to put it down

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.639 
in parallel that's going to put it down
to<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.360> ohm<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
to one ohm and this is how you do that

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.450 
to one ohm and this is how you do that
take<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.800> wires<00:00:47.539> your<00:00:48.539> speaker<00:00:48.870> wires<00:00:49.079> here

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
take your wires your speaker wires here

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.799 
take your wires your speaker wires here
you<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> pay<00:00:50.820> close<00:00:51.180> attention<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.690> your

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you want to pay close attention to your

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
you want to pay close attention to your
positives<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.559> negatives<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:55.579> because

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
positives and negatives on this because

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
positives and negatives on this because
you<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:56.820> want<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> backwards<00:00:57.859> so

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you don't want to get it backwards so

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
you don't want to get it backwards so
you<00:00:58.890> hook<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.280> positive<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.570> voice

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you hook up your positive of one voice

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.759 
you hook up your positive of one voice
coil<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:02.600> connect<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> into<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.140> positive<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
coil and connect it into the positive of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.420 
coil and connect it into the positive of
the<00:01:05.369> second<00:01:06.000> voice<00:01:06.119> coil<00:01:06.530> your<00:01:07.530> negative<00:01:08.010> from

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the second voice coil your negative from

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
the second voice coil your negative from
one<00:01:08.580> voice<00:01:08.760> coil<00:01:09.090> goes<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> negative

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
one voice coil goes on to the negative

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130 
one voice coil goes on to the negative
of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> second<00:01:11.250> voice<00:01:11.340> coil<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> they're

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
of the second voice coil so they're

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.730 
of the second voice coil so they're
together<00:01:13.320> essentially<00:01:14.250> acting<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.740> one

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
together essentially acting as one one

together essentially acting as one one
voice<00:01:16.950> coil<00:01:17.220> together<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:20.610> your

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
voice coil together and you take your

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.190 
voice coil together and you take your
connection<00:01:21.150> that's<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> amplifier

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
connection that's going to the amplifier

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
connection that's going to the amplifier
or<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> inside<00:01:24.090> connection<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
or you know to the inside connection of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
or you know to the inside connection of
the<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.290> enclosure<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.950> want<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> keep

and your negative with the negative so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
and your negative with the negative so
what<00:01:39.030> should<00:01:39.180> happen<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.630> when<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> test<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
what should happen now when you test it

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700 
what should happen now when you test it
with<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.100> voltmeter<00:01:42.320> when<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.409> test<00:01:43.590> the

impedance you should come out with one
ohm<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.280> come<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:47.970> something

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
ohm on that come up with something

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.520 
ohm on that come up with something
different<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.780> need<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> check<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.380> work

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
different you need to check your work

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.840 
different you need to check your work
and<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> again<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.820> your

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and do it again so if your if your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.760 
and do it again so if your if your
amplifier<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:54.990> ohm<00:01:55.110> stable<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
lot of amplifiers aren't so you want to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.679 
lot of amplifiers aren't so you want to
check<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.600> manual<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:59.420> you<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.600> to

check the manual on that you want to

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.850 
check the manual on that you want to
hook<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.200> series<00:02:02.329> for<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.799> it's<00:02:04.799> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
hook it up in series for that it's a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.440 
hook it up in series for that it's a
little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.159> trickier

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
little bit trickier

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.109 
little bit trickier
you<00:02:08.050> want<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.289> hook<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.950> positive<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.759> one

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
you want to hook the positive of one

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.800 
you want to hook the positive of one
voice<00:02:10.300> coil<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> negative<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.720> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
voice coil up to the negative of the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.320 
voice coil up to the negative of the
other<00:02:14.260> voice<00:02:14.530> coil<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.849> then<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.970> leads<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
other voice coil and then the leads that

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.800 
other voice coil and then the leads that
are<00:02:19.450> going<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.830> amplifier<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:22.599> unhook

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
are going to the amplifier you unhook

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.210 
are going to the amplifier you unhook
your<00:02:22.959> positive<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> remaining<00:02:23.950> positive

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
your positive to the remaining positive

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.839 
your positive to the remaining positive
and<00:02:25.920> then<00:02:26.920> negative<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.459> remaining

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
and then negative to the remaining

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.910 
and then negative to the remaining
negative<00:02:30.750> then<00:02:31.750> when<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.050> test<00:02:32.290> these<00:02:32.470> thing

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
negative then when you test these thing

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490 
negative then when you test these thing
that<00:02:33.099> it's<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.340> dual<00:02:33.519> 2-ohm<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.150> should<00:02:34.810> read<00:02:35.290> at

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
that it's a dual 2-ohm it should read at

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.039 
that it's a dual 2-ohm it should read at
a<00:02:35.530> four<00:02:35.830> ohm<00:02:36.010> again<00:02:37.000> if<00:02:37.330> it's<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.690> correct

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
a four ohm again if it's not correct

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.800 
a four ohm again if it's not correct
then<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.860> want<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.180> go<00:02:40.180> back<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.540> check<00:02:40.660> your

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
then you want to go back and check your

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.780 
then you want to go back and check your
work<00:02:40.900> again<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.470> that's<00:02:42.069> how<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.250> wire<00:02:42.489> up<00:02:42.519> a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
work again so that's how you wire up a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.789 
work again so that's how you wire up a
dual<00:02:43.000> voice<00:02:43.209> coil<00:02:43.510> sub<00:02:43.780> woofer<00:02:44.049> I'm<00:02:44.200> Dan<00:02:44.650> and

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
dual voice coil sub woofer I'm Dan and

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.180 
dual voice coil sub woofer I'm Dan and
girl<00:02:44.980> with<00:02:45.280> soundscape<00:02:45.670> car<00:02:45.880> audio
