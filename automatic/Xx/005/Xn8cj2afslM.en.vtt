00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.170
 the word simulator usually causes a bad tie for those who like a 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.940
 racing game but do not want to think about things like they are said distribution 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.229
 of tires in acceleration control 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:15.239
 casual players want simple controls and more obvious driving like 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.179
 happened amy was stupid 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.099
 This one even fears names. 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.610
 as the great tourism 5 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.630
 and driving force behind 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.610
 However 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.960
 the clarification study finds a way between what 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.129
 inda criterion and the heavy weights of physics causing boss 2 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.450
 unleashed be a simulator 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.840
 but with a little taste 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.770
 as an example of this middle ground is in the way it has been presented to the player 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.650
 soon in the first race is given ammunition gps 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.260
 to show what is very good speed 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.320
 in a very complex layout 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.400
 full of curves and overtaking points such cases 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.970
 it is based on your performance on that track that the game will check the way 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.350
 how is it directed 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 and then it shows that it can literally please all tastes the player 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.270
 has left the track and 3% agency levels of assistance will be set to 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 do not make him frustrated 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.780
 on the other hand if the maneuvers were worthy of a champion will be made 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.870
 adjustments to give the right challenge to the virtual 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.710
 regardless of how one thing is clear is you will 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.120
 like shift 2 are more than 100 cars on disk and dozens of tracks 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.749
 real not to mention the excellent high social network logo 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.670
 presented in a few minutes 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.510
 which has been expanded to better suit the game 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.990
 the damage system is the best ever seen in a game of the genre one step further 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.320
 of what was seen in a few seconds 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.659
 and a pelt glove slap in the face of Gran Turismo 5 and force 3 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.860
 a simple knock on the rear can disintegrate the airfoil and impacts 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.120
 most powerful make parts fly everywhere 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.460
 the beats are so striking that they can only be compared to the series 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.850
 burnout the tracks also do not make ugly and will three Australians pass by 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.959
 United States of America and Europe 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.129
 and arrive in the narrow streets of Tokyo 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.980
 both in real tracts versus fictitious 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.609
 names like species whose before an ounce and nÃ¼rburgring 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.129
 will delight Formula 1 fans 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.339
 but also to those best known for the corridors of the tourism category 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.169
 like lagoon seca donington park zolder 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.000
 all with straight and challenging curves 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.740
 without mentioning that they are represented in the smallest detail including year 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.169
 past and light and shadow effects 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.239
 but it is when the sun goes down that the beast picks up because the night races are 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.040
 more than enough reasons 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.349
 to have status 2 in your game collection 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.029
 running in the night is a unique sensation 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:01.719
 mix motion and fear 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.839
 because in some tracings you can hardly see how a color is coming 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.299
 it is possible to see how the opponents are coming only by repairing the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.629
 car rear 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.019
 the team has a very interesting evolution system, but everything 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.229
 happens very quickly 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.719
 one of the reasons for this is the adhesion of the experience gained by breaking records 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.449
 of friends a car 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.110
 small boost hatch may seem insignificant 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.290
 but at the end of the first races 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.239
 it is already possible to advance to much more advanced tests and discourage 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.599
 ran into smaller categories 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.829
 which he has a very cool horcones system 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.109
 and that even allows upload to youtube 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.579
 however this feature is limited to 10 seconds as far as we can 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.279
 It's too little to make friends jealous. 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:51.220
 the limitation is even understandable since to make this tiny video 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.400
 takes about three to five minutes 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.169
 depending on the connection speed 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.169
 the response of the controls depends on the type of vision chosen to direct 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.939
 as a player uses areas considered normal 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.299
 for the racing games in the with the pt to-shock with behind the car the 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.799
 commands are executed with extreme philippines 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.510
 only when the mission goes to the helmet of the pilot the great news in the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.579
 cast the impression that the car gets looser 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.780
 without the feeling of weight and that makes it even harder to keep it giving us online 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.539
 straight 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.889
 the novelty is good but still needs adjustments 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:28.529
 it is necessary to pay attention because in many 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.080
 the distance is sensitive 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.000
 Brazilian components hardly feels delays. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.160
 but just give a stretch to a competitor out of our homeland to 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.620
 that the instability to appear 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.490
 and the worst 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.970
 is that when this occurs 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.180
 opponents are invisible and intelligible and it is possible to pass through 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.920
 inside them as if they were planted more tite 2 to 1 in full is a simulator 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.870
 of non-standard races he strives to meet both those who do not 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.580
 like exaggerated realism 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.960
 how many people calculate the pressure of the buffers to make a curve 4 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.479
 perfect management 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.560
 what he has some problems that scratched his bodywork 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.520
 but it's still a title that should definitely be in the fix 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.070
 of players who feel an uncontrollable desire for speed
