right<00:00:27.930> paddle<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.410> knife<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.760> wish<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.029> would

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
right paddle is knife and I wish I would

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.460 
right paddle is knife and I wish I would
have<00:00:30.210> switched<00:00:30.570> them<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.050> prefer<00:00:31.230> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
have switched them because I prefer to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.110 
have switched them because I prefer to
have<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> jump<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> right<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> knife

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
have the jump on the right and the knife

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.260 
have the jump on the right and the knife
on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> left<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.500> used<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.829> and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
on the left but I got used to it and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.000 
on the left but I got used to it and
this<00:00:36.270> gameplay<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.930> like<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.260> first<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.710> second

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
this gameplay is like my first or second

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
this gameplay is like my first or second
day<00:00:38.040> using<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> controller<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.600> think

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
day using the controller and and I think

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.840 
day using the controller and and I think
the<00:00:40.140> gameplay<00:00:40.559> speak<00:00:40.829> speaks<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.610> itself

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the gameplay speak speaks for itself

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
the gameplay speak speaks for itself
because<00:00:42.110> there's<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.170> no<00:00:43.879> freaking<00:00:44.879> way

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because there's just no freaking way

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.840 
because there's just no freaking way
that<00:00:45.570> I'd<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.809> able<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.340> maneuver<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> way

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that I'd be able to maneuver in the way

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.880 
that I'd be able to maneuver in the way
that<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.450> game<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.559> able<00:00:49.770> to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
avoid actually doing a review type video
for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> purpose<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.710> vid<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
for the purpose of this vid I think the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.130 
for the purpose of this vid I think the
gameplay<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.240> kind<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.509> speaks<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.840> itself

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
gameplay just kind of speaks for itself

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
gameplay just kind of speaks for itself
in<00:01:43.350> terms<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.950> review<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
in terms of a review because if you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
in terms of a review because if you
compare<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.140> gameplay<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.619> gameplay<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
compare this gameplay to gameplay that I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.700 
compare this gameplay to gameplay that I
posted<00:01:47.729> from<00:01:48.000> Call<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.810> Duty<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> Xbox<00:01:49.619> one

then<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.710> think<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> should<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.070> able

then I think I think you should be able
to<00:01:53.310> tell<00:01:53.549> pretty<00:01:53.850> significant<00:01:54.479> difference

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
aggressive I'm able to maneuver in a way

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.969

3d<00:03:12.269> space<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:13.849> in<00:03:14.849> order<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:16.220> do<00:03:17.220> really<00:03:17.489> good

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
3d space and in order to do really good

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.640 
3d space and in order to do really good
in<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:17.940> kind<00:03:18.389> of<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.079> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.350> gaming

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
in that kind of in that kind of gaming

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.099 
in that kind of in that kind of gaming
environment<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.549> kind<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:20.910> 3d<00:03:21.239> space<00:03:21.510> you

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
environment in that kind of 3d space you

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.170 
environment in that kind of 3d space you
need<00:03:22.319> full<00:03:22.530> range<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.920> motion<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:24.000> my

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
need full range of motion and my

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.629 
need full range of motion and my
argument<00:03:24.600> today<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.440> think<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
argument today is that I think that the

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.550 
argument today is that I think that the
people<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.120> are<00:03:27.239> making<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.959> hardware<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
people that are making the hardware the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.520 
people that are making the hardware the
Sony's<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.810> Nintendo's<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.319> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
Sony's and the Nintendo's in the and the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.370 
Sony's and the Nintendo's in the and the
Microsoft's<00:03:32.160> should<00:03:32.849> I'll<00:03:33.239> ship<00:03:33.750> all<00:03:33.989> their

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
Microsoft's should I'll ship all their

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.099 
Microsoft's should I'll ship all their
controllers<00:03:34.920> with<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.450> option<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.599> plugging

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
controllers with the option of plugging

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.449 
controllers with the option of plugging
it<00:03:37.230> into<00:03:37.440> your<00:03:37.560> computer<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> USB<00:03:38.069> port

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
it into your computer with a USB port

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.460 
it into your computer with a USB port
and<00:03:38.959> programming<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.079> buttons<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.440> be

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
and programming the buttons to be

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.900 
and programming the buttons to be
whatever<00:03:40.889> you<00:03:41.069> want<00:03:41.280> them<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.579> be<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.700> think

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
whatever you want them to be I think

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.879 
whatever you want them to be I think
that<00:03:42.180> people<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:43.019> play<00:03:43.200> games<00:03:43.440> these<00:03:43.650> guys

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
that people that play games these guys

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.860 
that people that play games these guys
want<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.310> want<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.790> play<00:03:44.970> them<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.480> best<00:03:45.690> of

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
want to want to play them to the best of

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.030 
want to want to play them to the best of
their<00:03:45.989> ability<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.560> they<00:03:46.620> want<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.889> keep

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
their ability and they want to keep

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.699 
their ability and they want to keep
pushing<00:03:47.370> themselves<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.200> that's<00:03:49.200> one<00:03:49.530> way

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
pushing themselves and that's one way

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.259 
pushing themselves and that's one way
that<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:50.040> can<00:03:50.190> do<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.639> have<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:50.970> having

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
that you can do that is have is having

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.360 
that you can do that is have is having
full<00:03:51.569> range<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.870> motion<00:03:52.049> it's<00:03:52.349> so<00:03:52.709> incredibly

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
full range of motion it's so incredibly

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.710 
full range of motion it's so incredibly
important<00:03:53.819> especially<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.450> first-person

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
important especially in first-person

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.559 
important especially in first-person
shooters<00:03:55.669> now<00:03:56.669> I<00:03:56.700> don't<00:03:56.849> know<00:03:57.060> how<00:03:57.209> much<00:03:57.359> that

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
shooters now I don't know how much that

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.770 
shooters now I don't know how much that
would<00:03:57.660> cost<00:03:58.730> extra<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.060> make<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.359> controller

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
would cost extra to make a controller

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.300 
would cost extra to make a controller
that<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.019> can<00:04:01.230> do<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.500> with<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.829> don't<00:04:01.950> think

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
that you can do that with I don't think

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.589 
that you can do that with I don't think
it<00:04:02.579> would<00:04:02.669> cost<00:04:02.849> that<00:04:03.030> much<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.389> then<00:04:03.510> again

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
it would cost that much but then again

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.780 
it would cost that much but then again
I'm<00:04:03.810> not<00:04:03.840> too<00:04:04.169> tech<00:04:04.410> savvy<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.069> if<00:04:05.160> someone<00:04:05.489> is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
I'm not too tech savvy so if someone is

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.729 
I'm not too tech savvy so if someone is
in<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.090> comments<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.169> want<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.530> let<00:04:07.650> me

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
in the comments and you want to let me

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.319 
in the comments and you want to let me
know<00:04:07.769> how<00:04:08.069> much<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.400> estimate<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.150> that

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
know how much you estimate that that

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.000 
know how much you estimate that that
that<00:04:09.690> would<00:04:09.840> add<00:04:10.049> to<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.380> manufacturing

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
that would add to the manufacturing

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.059 
that would add to the manufacturing
costs<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:12.139> these<00:04:13.139> controllers<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.799> ship

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
costs of these controllers that ship

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.060 
costs of these controllers that ship
with<00:04:14.250> these<00:04:14.340> consoles<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.060> let<00:04:15.209> me<00:04:15.299> know<00:04:16.070> but

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
with these consoles and let me know but

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.349 
with these consoles and let me know but
if<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.609> case<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:17.880> think<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.180> all

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
if that's not the case I think that all

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.560 
if that's not the case I think that all
games<00:04:18.660> should<00:04:18.840> allow<00:04:19.349> full<00:04:19.970> button<00:04:20.970> remapping

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
games should allow full button remapping

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.089 
games should allow full button remapping
to<00:04:21.719> whatever<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.169> want<00:04:22.349> them<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.650> be<00:04:22.770> that's

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
to whatever you want them to be that's

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.740 
to whatever you want them to be that's
been<00:04:23.310> something<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.760> Aska<00:04:24.240> cappers<00:04:24.599> been

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
been something that Aska cappers been

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.209 
been something that Aska cappers been
campaigning<00:04:25.140> for<00:04:25.289> for<00:04:25.740> like<00:04:25.860> three<00:04:26.099> or<00:04:26.190> four

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
campaigning for for like three or four

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.320 
campaigning for for like three or four
years<00:04:26.640> now

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
years now

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.540 
years now
for<00:04:27.659> gamers<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.710> play<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.009> disabilities

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
for gamers that play with disabilities

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.890 
for gamers that play with disabilities
that<00:04:29.669> have<00:04:29.729> limited<00:04:30.000> limited<00:04:30.539> use<00:04:30.689> of<00:04:30.720> their

ways<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.240> play<00:04:33.479> these<00:04:33.659> games<00:04:33.870> all<00:04:34.229> those

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
ways to play these games all those

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.020 
ways to play these games all those
things<00:04:34.919> would<00:04:35.039> be<00:04:35.099> mitigated<00:04:35.669> if<00:04:35.759> you<00:04:35.849> just

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
things would be mitigated if you just

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.240 
things would be mitigated if you just
allowed<00:04:36.300> button<00:04:36.659> remapping<00:04:37.169> now<00:04:37.800> apart<00:04:38.159> from

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
allowed button remapping now apart from

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.619 
allowed button remapping now apart from
that<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.460> think<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.909> people<00:04:39.150> just<00:04:39.330> want<00:04:39.539> to

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
that I think that people just want to

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:40.820 
that I think that people just want to
play<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.930> game<00:04:40.080> however<00:04:40.379> they<00:04:40.469> want<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> play

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
play the game however they want to play

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.450 
play the game however they want to play
the<00:04:40.949> game<00:04:41.129> and<00:04:41.370> everybody<00:04:42.300> has<00:04:42.509> a<00:04:42.539> different

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
the game and everybody has a different

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.649 
the game and everybody has a different
different<00:04:44.460> preference<00:04:45.060> in<00:04:45.180> terms<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.539> how

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
different preference in terms of how

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.480 
different preference in terms of how
button<00:04:46.020> button<00:04:46.560> layout<00:04:46.800> should<00:04:47.009> go<00:04:47.189> and

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
button button layout should go and

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.839 
button button layout should go and
sometimes<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.360> pre<00:04:48.960> pre-made<00:04:49.620> custom<00:04:50.129> button

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
sometimes the pre pre-made custom button

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.670 
sometimes the pre pre-made custom button
layouts<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.270> they<00:04:51.509> give<00:04:51.689> us<00:04:51.840> don't<00:04:52.289> exactly

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
layouts that they give us don't exactly

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.040 
layouts that they give us don't exactly
work<00:04:53.069> out<00:04:53.400> best<00:04:54.330> for<00:04:54.539> everyone

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
work out best for everyone

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.890 
work out best for everyone
I<00:04:55.310> think<00:04:56.310> gaming<00:04:56.550> is<00:04:56.610> becoming<00:04:56.969> much<00:04:57.150> more

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
I think gaming is becoming much more

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.529 
I think gaming is becoming much more
competitive<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.620> people<00:04:58.889> don't<00:04:59.069> want<00:04:59.539> they

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
competitive and people don't want they

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:01.430 
competitive and people don't want they
don't<00:05:00.719> want<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:00.930> play<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.139> game

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
don't want to play the game

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.589 
don't want to play the game
exactly<00:05:01.979> they<00:05:02.940> don't<00:05:03.090> want<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.270> be<00:05:03.330> told<00:05:03.479> how

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
exactly they don't want to be told how

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:04.700 
exactly they don't want to be told how
to<00:05:03.690> play<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.050> game<00:05:04.169> they<00:05:04.289> don't<00:05:04.319> want<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.620> be

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
to play the game they don't want to be

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.080 
to play the game they don't want to be
told<00:05:04.860> what<00:05:05.009> each<00:05:05.280> button<00:05:05.310> isn't<00:05:05.699> on<00:05:06.060> a

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
told what each button isn't on a

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.459 
told what each button isn't on a
controller<00:05:06.479> does<00:05:06.690> they<00:05:06.930> want<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.169> be<00:05:07.259> able<00:05:07.349> to

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
controller does they want to be able to

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.300 
controller does they want to be able to
do<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.770> themselves<00:05:07.949> and<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:09.389> think<00:05:10.379> that<00:05:10.590> you

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
do that themselves and I think that you

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.399 
do that themselves and I think that you
know<00:05:11.430> if<00:05:11.669> PC<00:05:12.030> players<00:05:12.270> get<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.719> have<00:05:13.110> better

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
know if PC players get to have better

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.379 
know if PC players get to have better
your<00:05:13.590> headsets<00:05:13.979> and<00:05:14.190> better<00:05:14.340> masses<00:05:15.240> and

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
your headsets and better masses and

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.820 
your headsets and better masses and
keyboards<00:05:15.750> than<00:05:15.870> each<00:05:15.990> other<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:16.409> console

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
keyboards than each other then console

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.619 
keyboards than each other then console
gaming<00:05:17.009> should<00:05:17.250> be<00:05:17.340> no<00:05:17.460> different

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
gaming should be no different

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.050 
gaming should be no different
and<00:05:19.259> I<00:05:19.409> really<00:05:19.770> think<00:05:19.889> that<00:05:20.009> a<00:05:20.099> full<00:05:20.699> range<00:05:20.940> of

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
and I really think that a full range of

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.240 
and I really think that a full range of
motion<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.479> gonna<00:05:21.990> allow<00:05:22.229> console<00:05:22.680> players<00:05:22.919> to

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
motion is gonna allow console players to

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.189 
motion is gonna allow console players to
not<00:05:23.789> compete<00:05:24.060> at<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.300> same<00:05:24.419> level<00:05:24.779> as<00:05:24.870> PC

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
not compete at the same level as PC

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.050 
not compete at the same level as PC
players<00:05:25.439> but<00:05:25.800> certainly<00:05:26.550> at<00:05:26.729> a<00:05:26.759> higher<00:05:27.029> level

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
players but certainly at a higher level

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.519 
players but certainly at a higher level
than<00:05:27.449> they<00:05:27.629> have<00:05:27.779> been<00:05:27.930> before<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.379> I<00:05:28.469> think

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
than they have been before and I think

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.529 
than they have been before and I think
that's<00:05:28.830> only<00:05:29.069> a<00:05:29.279> good<00:05:29.550> thing<00:05:29.759> anyways<00:05:30.240> what<00:05:30.479> do

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
that's only a good thing anyways what do

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.460 
that's only a good thing anyways what do
you<00:05:30.599> guys<00:05:30.659> think<00:05:30.719> hope<00:05:31.110> you<00:05:31.229> enjoy<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.500> vid
