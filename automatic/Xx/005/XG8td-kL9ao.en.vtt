00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.440
 Look, I'm a noble wing. It was in this video. I'll show you how it works. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.760
 I never lost count. 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.029
 very interesting very useful for those who work 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.230
 an animation 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.939
 the name of being violent 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.519
 freelance 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.329
 I reported that the monster was allowed to do is working warned 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.600
 mind with animation editing you have the mood to sound 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.600
 directly on 3d saw doubleleft 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.480
 so will you see 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.900
 that it is very interesting to work with this type of 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.980
 it's gift 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.430
 why does he leave more album more visual hand 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.120
 It's with the diadem editing actions 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.130
 then the first step in getting a new job 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.700
 enable 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.829
 or else and I'm doing this from here in my properties window 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.829
 d blender user preferences in the round area 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.110
 and you will enable here the wrong move if you have not installed 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.240
 visit the site that has your own love in case you do not know where and only visit my 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.650
 blog in the article you live in is 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.130
 inserted 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.560
 and you will be able to download it for free from mufg included to use in the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 your dr 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.560
 when you enable the municipality 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 buffon and ate it neither 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.620
 in my user preferences window on your toolbar goes 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.570
 an option that is called 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.040
 brake die 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.830
 and I go with my selected object in case I'm going to use this audience as an example 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.900
 I'll go here to enable or how was a brake I will click the button that neither crazy 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.410
 self love 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.220
 and I have here how to try a mode 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.109
 how I was going to come back 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.310
 location I'm going to do this kind of animation I want to see this kind of 

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:58.560
 information there on my 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.650
 April 3 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.300
 the boson enlarge a little bit here 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.990
 the barbie online tool to make it easier to dehumanize information 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.389
 promoted by the show 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.129
 here i can 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.249
 put a limit 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.850
 before and after 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.920
 from the board 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680
 you are viewing from your animation 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.680
 in case I want to put the display all the lines as funk will goes 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.409
 create then I'll use here as the cyrus too 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.409
 Santa Claus in the band that's open down here 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.259
 and I'll do or next I'll create an animation 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.639
 in theory, how are you going to move here? 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.879
 by my 3 and saw him position it here in that corner 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:45.069
 and i will add collection i an old phone location 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.500
 Let's move the table 30 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.289
 let's shift my goal to carr 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.769
 and I'll put another unprecedented feat 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.539
 location 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.709
 sometimes it is necessary just to tinker 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.120
 the 1 for the tram line without brake to appear 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.989
 So this is what you're looking at here. 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.410
 pattern in the blend if you perform this person resuscitation procedure 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.209
 doing here now 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 without the braking mouchão in that line will not appear 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.330
 I will not put it here again 4 50 years put the object 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.399
 on here 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.979
 letter i put in check and we will put here in the 70 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.539
 move here 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.529
 click here 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.439
 locks let's see how our lines are getting 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.069
 he scored the points allen appears still but no problem his points 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.149
 appear that the dead on the brake is working 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.599
 so I'm going to be moved board object 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.499
 were already stopped being delivered by the customer 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.949
 if you want a civil strategic reference to enable what you 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.050
 it was in the light 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.179
 and to cover updated here 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.449
 actress sending glamor 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.759
 I can see the numbers of the 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.390
 black brakes 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.039
 I'm using to eat apple 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:04.189
 of the 140 we are going to move here click here blocks 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.629
 221 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.629
 I tax my people 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.299
 on here 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.429
 that's it 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:15.629
 by Christ 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.239
 in 241 put usa in that corner just to complete the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.849
 the circuit 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.849
 so here's bush 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.400
 and to put a brake shows exactly the trajectory that my people 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.729
 it is 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.729
 plays cel to press that the litigation 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.110
 and will display animation 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.669
 and I can see the trajectory 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.680
 that my object is going 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.680
 now and this is not the legal part 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.680
 from the cold north 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.810
 the cool part of the dead was the time you can get these points here take 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.139
 with the positions 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.139
 in which we added flávio pictures 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.389
 and we can make modifications 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.270
 proposed with the letter g 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.020
 letter x 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.590
 It's better I can not 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.330
 I am 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.800
 and did not allow this kind of transformation 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 but you can for example make adjustments 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.110
 I can put mine on that spot in that place. 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.210
 a little more here my 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.639
 50 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.639
 here I have a curve then after getting injured 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.199
 the control handles 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.589
 of the curve 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.589
 the object will do 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.569
 I can move until it is impossible to add intermediate points 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.419
 and add new ones that fronts for example I selected the point 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.949
 equivalent is the table 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.949
 186 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.699
 in a trajectory that was previously 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.090
 straight lines 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.930
 without any transformation 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.930
 now 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.259
 is there the whole curve 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.800
 and with various modifications 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.770
 in your trajectory notice that I have an animation here 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.770
 completely different 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.710
 using 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.710
 On the report 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.250
 I hope you have tended to have precocious of the mouchão I believe we can 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.099
 make a series of transformations and accessions 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:38.680
 with these objects 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.219
 using island tools 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.460
 that he offers to work with animation 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.050
 If you are interested in the blazer, do not forget to wear 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.740
 you do not know how to work with br if you want to start using blender 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.819
 in your projects do not forget to visit my website 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:57.650
 is the gay port that common point where I have 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.910
 one free English course and two 5/1 points 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.069
 where you can enroll and take the course entirely online based on 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:06.399
 video classes 

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.959
 so I asked I hope you have liked the project understood how it works 

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.009
 a buffoon pueyo epah until the next
