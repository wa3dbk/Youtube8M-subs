00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:21.029
 blasters we set off space star

 wars the old republic 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.439
 storyline my game developed 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 br company notorious 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.510
 events in the game occur after 300 years 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.390
 after the events described in the games of the series 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 knights of the old republic 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.950
 November 15, 2012 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.090
 star wars the old republic moved on 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090
 fritupley model 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.370
 it choose the server side of them here only 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.070
 two is the republic and the Sith Empire and 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.469
 get into the editor here first thing 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.859
 determine which class we are interested in 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:03.040
 infantryman jedi knight consul jedi and 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.140
 smuggler i'm like a man who grew up on 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.860
 films lukas naturally choose 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.869
 jedi knight you have no other choice 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.869
 next we choose funny with the character 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.899
 or if in Russian itâ€™s just you 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.080
 those who play for free are not all available 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.840
 types of characters without becoming tricky I chose 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 a person well beyond the usual 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 romper face features hairstyles and so on 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.830
 this Jedi would not hurt the power of force 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.429
 will apparently gluttony have them in order 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.429
 Things it is necessary to wipe such a face 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.670
 the peculiarity of the game is that all 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.069
 characters in it are voiced and protagonists 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.680
 not exclude remember at least 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.689
 the fourteenth finalku where all the dialogues 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.939
 were the silent 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:02.670
 shaking heads under creeping out 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:05.680
 the text seems to me or something broke 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.060
 mission indicator clearly show on him 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.549
 other ways are still there proved 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.739
 the game is not that simple when i'm 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.720
 started playing it she continued 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.880
 pump in the background 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.489
 because of what part of the game content 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.120
 let's say story missions were me 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.480
 inaccessible interesting solution for 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.910
 multiplayer game 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.609
 imagine the situation you downloaded 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.579
 battlefield went into multiplayer and you 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.739
 bang and no weapons you frantically run away 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.980
 while everyone is kicking you ass 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.769
 and all because your gun is not yet 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.590
 He rocked that's what I thought of the game 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.470
 strange so is management first 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.959
 there is no strafe when pressing buttons hey 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.829
 go character just turns 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.940
 around its axis to be honest the idea is soft 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.880
 saying the thread itself 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.100
 so that the character began to meet again in 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.610
 driving time you need to hold one of 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.010
 mouse buttons to what such complexity 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:11.410
 vague oh well a little about the plot 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.660
 it all starts with that well at least 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.390
 if you play as a jedi knight with 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.280
 your arrival over the iphone planet where 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.890
 Jedi order is located 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.810
 we will have to fill level 1 and 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.300
 build your lightsaber 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.130
 well, up to this point we will have 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.590
 run around with some stick learning here 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.020
 that the game is definitely comfortable so this 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.840
 card when you stand still she 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.110
 opaque but if you start moving 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.270
 as she immediately begins to shine through to you 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.850
 there is no need to turn off every time and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.420
 open it again to find the right one 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.000
 the way and here he truly has the power 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.820
 see me ass to save 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.340
 time distance can be overcome as 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.130
 We are pedari and with the help of skill 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.590
 displacement in any investigated yu. 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.260
 truth for research is not enough 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.020
 come into it also find a special 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.660
 terminal some quests are pretty stupid 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.150
 built let's say here's an example to me 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.760
 need to run around a small area and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.459
 release a certain number of prisoners 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.410
 such cells are logical to assume 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.690
 that the cells will always be different and 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.050
 they will always be in different 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.600
 places but not enough just run away 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.350
 from already opening the cell to a certain 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.590
 distance 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.550
 wait a bit and open it again 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.220
 inside will miraculously be back 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.850
 prisoner power not otherwise 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.340
 yeah damn you beat ahead and you 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.320
 kidding something calm 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.810
 save ass go 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.750
 Download yourself a couple of levels you can 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.600
 learn a new skill done it for 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.600
 money from such masters is simple 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.330
 these very skills will be very useful to you 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.240
 as from time to time besides enemies 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.700
 ordinary you will stumble and boss 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.130
 in which just like that you will fill up figs 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.990
 if you during one of these 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.600
 battles still killed 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.880
 you have a choice either to be reborn 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.950
 nearest medical center is not again to Peha 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.110
 plot location minutes five or 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:24.010
 wait and be reborn right on the spot 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.860
 in the same place where death killed you and glory 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.440
 god you have time recovery so 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.840
 if you flip your flippers right under your nose 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.060
 enemies do not matter 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.290
 revived you can always 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.870
 run away painlessly 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.860
 from time to time the game will offer 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.380
 you make a choice 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.920
 where not everything is so obvious at first glance 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.940
 and the game I did not go to the end but go 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.070
 rumors that this choice affects something yes 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.800
 leveling up to level 10 will take you 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.800
 almost all day personally how much was spent on 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.110
 it's me in the end you will build 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.990
 your personal lightsaber at last 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:10.030
 well, and besides you can leave 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:13.090
 welcome location or not yours 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.140
 galaxy anyway star wars the 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.360
 old republic 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.540
 this game is actually there 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:22.090
 the story of which really want 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.150
