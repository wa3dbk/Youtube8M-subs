was<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.629> thought<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.020> funny

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
was in there so I thought that was funny

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.399 
was in there so I thought that was funny
and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:01.829> here's<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> Batmobile<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.199> think<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and then here's the Batmobile I think it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
and then here's the Batmobile I think it
comes<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> Batman<00:01:05.369> figure<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> has<00:01:06.030> like

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
comes with a Batman figure and has like

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
comes with a Batman figure and has like
a<00:01:06.240> missile<00:01:06.689> launcher<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:07.380> pretty<00:01:07.650> cool

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
a missile launcher so that's pretty cool

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.760 
a missile launcher so that's pretty cool
I<00:01:08.100> definitely<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.820> pick<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> I

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
I definitely will pick it up and I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.520 
I definitely will pick it up and I
reckon<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.210> Batman<00:01:12.840> goes<00:01:13.110> with

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
reckon see I think that Batman goes with

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.609 
reckon see I think that Batman goes with
it<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.549> sure<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.570> um<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.020> said

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it I don't know for sure but um I said

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
it I don't know for sure but um I said
it's<00:01:16.979> actually<00:01:17.310> pretty<00:01:17.520> good<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.720> scopes<00:01:19.020> are

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
it's actually pretty good the scopes are

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.830 
it's actually pretty good the scopes are
pretty<00:01:19.350> good<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:20.090> being<00:01:21.090> smaller

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
pretty good for how being smaller

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
pretty good for how being smaller
figures<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.560> these<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.460> believe

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
figures and then these are I believe

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
figures and then these are I believe
these<00:01:24.180> were<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> 12-inch<00:01:24.930> figures<00:01:25.200> these

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
these were the 12-inch figures these

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.060 
these were the 12-inch figures these
ones<00:01:25.890> had<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.689> got<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.229> articulation

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
ones had like got like more articulation

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.850 
ones had like got like more articulation
