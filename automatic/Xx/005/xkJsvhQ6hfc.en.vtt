00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.359
 Misha and today's topic of conversation will be 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 seemingly pretty banal 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.370
 and we will consider how correctly 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.429
 carry ammunition and at the moment 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.510
 You heard this right 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.859
 beautiful container that we see 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.920
 literally in every game, well, when he 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.279
 really need young and pretty 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.939
 difficult and not every support u will throw 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.270
 do you ask him correctly or not speech 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.430
 a little different friend 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.050
 replenish ammunition and for that weapon 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 which we need right now 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.020
 let's see now I have no ammo to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.629
 main weapon 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.050
 I don't have a gun because I have 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.110
 one rocket and I have this moment 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.090
 perk on grenades which is used to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.300
 so that you have no grenade 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.750
 and in every pants pocket grenade in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.320
 also 2 we have one of the help of this 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.409
 perk i can take one more so let's 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.439
 let's see let's say you need rockets 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.080
 how do people who do not know how 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.810
 correctly replenished ammunition 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.580
 in spite of the fact that they want to replenish 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.400
 rockets they take the main weapon and 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:30.060
 rush up to the box with the cartridges and such 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.610
 way you lose time because if 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.950
 I'm going to run up the ammo box 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.290
 my main weapon the cartridges begin 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.650
 to be replaced for this particular weapon 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.009
 which is currently selected let's 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.009
 try 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.369
 so we got one shop for the shaft 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.799
 let's see whether got yet 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.020
 any ammo 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:59.479
 the gun is empty everything is also one rocket and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.369
 All also one grenade if I need 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.140
 it would fill up the moment rocket 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.850
 then I would have to stand with the shaft in 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.220
 hands very long to wait until replenished 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.350
 cartridges for him then until replenished 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.950
 ammunition for the gun and already in the third 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.420
 turn I would start getting rockets and this 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.910
 would take a huge amount of time 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.720
 I hope you agree with me and so 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.480
 let's try the method here 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.970
 I suggest you not 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.049
 Imagine that we need exactly the rocket 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:39.680
 we choose see of or rpv and run up to 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:41.690
 box of ammunition with these weapons as 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.860
 see I just got a rocket 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.750
 let's check again 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.010
 and check if the cartridges were still received 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.299
 on any weapon the shaft is still 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.489
 one store we got 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.180
 just a minute ago 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.269
 the gun is empty and the grant is not replenished 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.590
 let's say i would need a grenade i 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:07.730
 I choose a grenade run off the box with 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.390
 cartridges and get first 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.150
 I have the same grenade again 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.450
 number of rounds on my main 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.900
 my weapon ammunition pistol as it was 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:25.780
 there used to be two rockets because before 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.780
 of this I took one and now two grenades 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.840
 so let's summarize what today 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.270
 learned if suddenly someone did not know about it 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.150
 of course, but we learned today that 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.640
 you can personally choose what's in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.500
 first of all you want to fill up 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.290
 ammunition for your first weapon for 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.030
 Does a pistol for rockets and this focus 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.920
 actually works with everyone 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.340
 absolutely with all classes if you 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.750
 play for ricon then for goodness sake you just 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.280
 choose the slot you want 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.760
 replenish let's say you need one more 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.920
 move 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.630
 you just choose this slot this 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.030
 magic box with cartridges will give you 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.739
 exactly what you need you will get you 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.319
 either with move or if you need a beacon 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.090
 rebirth you pick that layer which 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.260
 meets you the rebirth castle and you 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.260
 get it first 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.310
 I hope this video will be useful to someone 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.120
 help you save time and make it easier 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.120
 thank you very much for the process of the game and 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.120
 I'll see you
