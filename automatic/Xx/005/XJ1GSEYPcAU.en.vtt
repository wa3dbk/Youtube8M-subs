00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.090
 time to make Christmas cookies 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.650
 biscuits fit a little nice all 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.170
 made for kids for kids 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 especially and here we have a recipe hyper 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.810
 scented and which is especially very very 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.449
 very simple to make sweet butter sweet 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.550
 but all this in go hop 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.680
 rd now and then we see what is called a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.300
 super important phase will have created but 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.800
 that is, we will emulsify mucyo 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.840
 resigned to make the butter 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.370
 ointment and for me to be well a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.030
 little soft hair is a phase 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030
 super important 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 super creamy mixes the friendly and 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:53.110
 there we will put the liquid elements 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.200
 highway loss hello hello downright everything 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.820
 to yop 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 gold actually a little bit go we put back 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.200
 It Works has chosen 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.689
 now we will add the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.240
 solid ingredients then but the flour 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.920
 and the hazelnut powder 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.600
 if we do not have Toulouse, it's 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.119
 pistachio nut powder 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.130
 we wanted above all to create a little 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.060
 praslin powder for children on 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.710
 problem these are almonds 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.690
 caramelized way and it will chew 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.190
 often traveling and gently for not 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.399
 To give too much body to body 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.399
 path 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.080
 go now we look at the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.760

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.350

 we will let the butter do its job 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 work and so you see the dough she has 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.770
