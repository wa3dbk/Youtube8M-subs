00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 for everyone hello my name is vadim blackbirds 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.370
 and the first question that I'm brewing is that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.309
 This is actually for the city such 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.969
 and everything is just wai city yes yes guys 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.219
 gta wai city gta 5 is obtained through the forests 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.770
 not that many people wanted 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.779
 action events gta 6 thousand she of course 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.090
 will be happening in the city under 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.699
 called Wai City because everyone wanted 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.189
 ponastalgic but now in 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.289
 the top five can do so to speak 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.840
 let's fill not probably the machine 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.180
 some good so that you can 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.110
 explore all the surroundings of it 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.079
 significant city moto but I will say this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 that will remove not very long 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.390
 because the game is like playing very and mod 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 installed on on another mod so to speak 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.539
 which actually likes to fly out 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.000
 so I'm already 1 4 trying to shoot I like 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.500
 only thing is to those places where 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.930
 such a ship saying bugs going on 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 happens and departures so enjoy 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.450
 we will be short with words but a reference 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.950
 on the mod and of course leave in the description and 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.369
 you can download and install it on 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.740
 mod on another mod how would it sound 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.689
 stupid but you can install it on 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.850
 another mod called five m 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.400
 which makes it possible to play 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 multiplayer gta 5 free have one 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.430
 on the license on pirates that is, you know 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.189
 This mod and you can actually 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.340
 immerse yourself in those golden days that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.250
 were still 2003 something I do not remember the second 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.950
 what year did gta wai city release 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.140
 you can feel the very atmosphere 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 childhood so to speak 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.520
 it seems to me that everyone remembers these places 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.950
 here now where this club used to be 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.810
 here unfortunately us something is wrong with 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.970
 textured so he completely 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.310
 transparent regret we ascend we probably 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.610
 we can not let's try all the same 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.100
 I remember here I interrupted a bunch of people yet 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.550
 when i would that i fall down just texture 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.520
 no not dumping yes but doing here 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.989
 absolutely nothing here is empty how empty 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.400
 Probably maybe there was some 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:19.050
 texture but bugs and and devoured very very 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.440
 how would she pour some water 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.010
 straight from concrete a little flawed but 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.690
 I think this is crazy, let's get this done. 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.930
 probably go and see nothing to 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.000
 what is common here on its supercar 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.100
 i remember all these places i paragraph here 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.489
 also on the machine simply could not go 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.900
 safe and sound 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.350
 i think you also remember with me 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.050
 together those places these places 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.050
 yes yes yes here we are by the way in 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.270
 the hospital was revived when we were killed 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.920
 like first missions but friends 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.500
 something happened that I was so afraid to fly 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.820
 games in general m I 'm trying to write here 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.410
 sticking together all these files that I have 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.000
 there are pieces and here we have some 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.620
 unknown to us doodles are displayed this 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.320
 because five m she will not on it 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.540
 pay attention by the way here 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.640
 pay attention to and of course will 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.040
 heard now it is not now 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.110
 regret is heard but here's the signal 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.960
 cars that is in the city absolutely 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.630
 empty no one but signals cars 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.900
 others can even hear the sound of the engine 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.460
 stranger as if you know creepy 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.860
 becomes like in the city 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.580
 ghost town you know as if strangers 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.580
 voices of non-existent people cars 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.470
 horror what to say probably worth it 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.470
 round out because the game does not give 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.770
 ok enjoy were were flies out 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.140
 more often than I don't know what's such 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.420
 In principle, our town is not bad made 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.670
 can we all the same way by the way I remember how 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.430
 I climbed that tower over there . 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.780
 somehow called the lighthouse there we have 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.480
 is like miniguns yourself not 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.230
 wrong let's go take a look 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.360
 7 is he there 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.360
 we'll go here sometime 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.489
 very interesting it will be Nikita minigun well 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.510
 unfortunately I think that you are not here 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.959
 it will be so here we have half the tower is not 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:22.350
 like half the smaller part well let's 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.419
 I try here we have the notorious 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.180
 the ladder which was still in wai 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.900
 City 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 so so so very hard i'm afraid that what 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.910
 time mind drawdown fps wild i'd that 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.210
 that now the game didn't crash because 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.520
 will not be very good so are going on 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.410
 the ladder 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.710
 let's look from there view and probably we will 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.220
 wrap it up already so michael let's not 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.330
 lag 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.100
 You are now up to 90 fps and below 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.760
 it was about thirty 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.169
 a little more so so very very 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:03.479
 long long climb michael god come on 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.169
 faster how much is a man a little more 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.169
 Michael 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.080

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.720

 we failed not remember exactly but 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.009
