00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.990 
let's get right into it today's episode
I'm<00:00:22.740> gonna<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:22.949> talking<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.279> movements

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
I'm gonna be talking about movements

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.630 
I'm gonna be talking about movements
angles<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.750> routes<00:00:25.160> basically<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.369> map

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
angles and routes basically just map

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.390 
angles and routes basically just map
knowledge<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.599> game<00:00:27.869> because<00:00:28.400> most

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
knowledge in this game because most

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.220 
knowledge in this game because most
people<00:00:29.640> probably<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.090> hey<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> get

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
people probably like hey how do I get

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
people probably like hey how do I get
dnase<00:00:31.800> or<00:00:32.070> how<00:00:32.219> i<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.520> i<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
dnase or how i do this i do that the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810 
dnase or how i do this i do that the
angles<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.620> routes<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> movements<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
angles the routes and the movements you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.540 
angles the routes and the movements you
do<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> game<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.020> what's<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> help

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
do in the game is what's going to help

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.459 
do in the game is what's going to help
you<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:38.969> those<00:00:39.149> DNA<00:00:39.540> bombs<00:00:39.870> help<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> get

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you get those DNA bombs help you get

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.340 
you get those DNA bombs help you get
those<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:41.160> high<00:00:41.190> scoring<00:00:41.670> game<00:00:41.820> plays

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
those really high scoring game plays

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.990 
those really high scoring game plays
because<00:00:43.350> movements<00:00:44.040> angles<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.520> routes<00:00:44.730> are

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
because movements angles and routes are

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.069 
because movements angles and routes are
what<00:00:45.239> sets<00:00:45.539> apart<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.170> pro<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.100> my<00:00:47.190> amateur<00:00:48.079> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
what sets apart a pro for my amateur so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.389 
what sets apart a pro for my amateur so
basically<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.649> starting<00:00:49.950> off<00:00:50.010> time<00:00:50.280> out

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
basically just starting off time out

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.150 
basically just starting off time out
advanced<00:00:50.670> warfare<00:00:51.090> advanced<00:00:51.360> warfare<00:00:51.750> added

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
advanced warfare advanced warfare added

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
advanced warfare advanced warfare added
systems<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.430> double<00:00:54.270> jumping<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.840> well<00:00:55.170> as

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
systems of double jumping as well as

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.160 
systems of double jumping as well as
they<00:00:55.620> added<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> sprint<00:00:56.610> system<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.780> XO

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
they added the sprint system and the XO

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.170 
they added the sprint system and the XO
movement<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.219> able<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.730> around<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> map

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
movement so able to get around the map

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.029 
movement so able to get around the map
faster<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.379> around<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> map<00:01:01.859> in

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
faster and get around the map in

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.359 
faster and get around the map in
different<00:01:02.399> ways<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> movements<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.129> game

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
different ways so movements in this game

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.280 
different ways so movements in this game
are<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.970> dominant<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> one<00:01:07.049> thing<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
are really dominant and one thing that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.980 
are really dominant and one thing that
affects<00:01:07.590> movements<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.189> blast<00:01:08.670> suppressor<00:01:09.240> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
affects movements is blast suppressor so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.280 
affects movements is blast suppressor so
in<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.950> opinion<00:01:11.010> i<00:01:11.430> recommend<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.750> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in my opinion i recommend it but if you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.539 
in my opinion i recommend it but if you
have<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.650> use<00:01:13.740> scavenger<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.400> for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
have to use scavenger you're going for

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.460 
have to use scavenger you're going for
DNA's<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.229> blast

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
DNA's it's up to you but blast

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.510 
DNA's it's up to you but blast
suppressor<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> help<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> move

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
suppressor is going to help you move

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749 
suppressor is going to help you move
around<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> map<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:18.540> quietly<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.759> then

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
around the map more quietly and then

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.820 
around the map more quietly and then
angles<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> routes<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.409> map<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.799> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
angles and routes on the map like this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.420 
angles and routes on the map like this
map<00:01:23.250> detroit<00:01:23.759> there's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.009> capture<00:01:26.009> point<00:01:26.280> in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
map detroit there's a capture point in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
map detroit there's a capture point in
the<00:01:26.549> building<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.049> second

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the building on on the the second

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.100 
the building on on the the second
capture<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:30.030> basically<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.689> either<00:01:30.840> run

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
capture so basically you can either run

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 
capture so basically you can either run
through<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.920> stairs<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.329> middle<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
through up the stairs in the middle the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.090 
through up the stairs in the middle the
stairs<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.200> backside<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> go

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
stairs on the backside or you can go

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620 
stairs on the backside or you can go
around<00:01:35.280> through<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> window<00:01:35.939> there's<00:01:36.270> four

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
around through the window there's four

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.410 
around through the window there's four
different<00:01:37.100> angles<00:01:38.100> routes<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.880> take<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
different angles routes you can take to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
different angles routes you can take to
get<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.840> capture<00:01:40.290> point<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.220> picking

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
get to that capture point so picking

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.160 
get to that capture point so picking
which<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.990> time<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:45.170> taking

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
which one is right at the time is taking

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710 
which one is right at the time is taking
the<00:01:46.320> better<00:01:46.530> route<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.180> given<00:01:48.570> time

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the better route just at that given time

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
the better route just at that given time
everything<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.740> situational<00:01:50.430> taking<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
everything is situational taking the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.289 
everything is situational taking the

to<00:01:54.360> set<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> apart<00:01:55.049> what's<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.500> keep

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
to set you apart what's going to keep

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.219 
to set you apart what's going to keep
you<00:01:55.680> alive<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.219> those<00:01:56.369> streaks<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.049> then<00:01:58.049> also

another<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.649> about<00:01:58.860> routes<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.549> always

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
another thing about routes is always

another thing about routes is always
having<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.750> escape<00:02:01.320> route<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.939> most

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
having an escape route this is the most

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.179 
having an escape route this is the most
important<00:02:03.990> thing<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> game<00:02:04.649> something<00:02:05.100> i

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
is having an escape route having a way

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.420 
is having an escape route having a way
always<00:02:11.080> setting<00:02:11.410> yourself<00:02:11.800> up<00:02:11.950> for<00:02:12.010> success

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
always setting yourself up for success

always setting yourself up for success
in<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.900> route<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.500> how<00:02:15.430> you're<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.850> always

trapping the leaning and ghost was an

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.790 
trapping the leaning and ghost was an
angle<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:28.990> was<00:02:29.140> something<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.590> knew

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
angle that was something that I knew

that<00:02:29.830> was<00:02:30.160> invented<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.959> dominated<00:02:31.959> so

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
that was invented that dominated so

that was invented that dominated so
finding<00:02:33.130> those<00:02:33.280> angles<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.910> are<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
finding those angles that are going to

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.670 
finding those angles that are going to
help<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.480> get<00:02:34.630> those<00:02:34.810> kills<00:02:35.200> where<00:02:35.440> people
