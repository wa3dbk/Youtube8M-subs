we're<00:00:07.599> about<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:07.930> do<00:00:08.050> the<00:00:08.170> blood<00:00:08.380> draw<00:00:08.590> for<00:00:08.920> the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
we're about to do the blood draw for the

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.790 
we're about to do the blood draw for the
PRP<00:00:09.309> using<00:00:10.300> the<00:00:10.420> platelets<00:00:10.900> that<00:00:11.140> I<00:00:11.380> found<00:00:11.620> the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800 
PRP using the platelets that I found the

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.820 
PRP using the platelets that I found the
blood<00:00:11.980> we<00:00:12.190> concentrate<00:00:12.820> them<00:00:13.030> and<00:00:13.800> we<00:00:14.800> use

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
blood we concentrate them and we use

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.429 
blood we concentrate them and we use
them<00:00:15.460> to<00:00:16.000> produce<00:00:16.180> these<00:00:16.539> growth<00:00:16.810> bankers<00:00:17.289> in

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
them to produce these growth bankers in

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.529 
them to produce these growth bankers in
the<00:00:17.470> skin<00:00:17.830> as<00:00:18.010> we<00:00:18.189> inject<00:00:18.580> it<00:00:18.730> into<00:00:18.970> the<00:00:19.150> areas

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
the skin as we inject it into the areas

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.230 
the skin as we inject it into the areas
that<00:00:19.570> we<00:00:19.900> want<00:00:20.140> them<00:00:20.380> to<00:00:21.000> repair<00:00:22.000> and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
that we want them to repair and

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.420 
that we want them to repair and
rejuvenate<00:00:22.539> it<00:00:23.410> helps<00:00:23.770> to<00:00:23.890> bring<00:00:24.100> in<00:00:24.250> new

blood vessels new collagen elastin and

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.620 
blood vessels new collagen elastin and
really<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:29.080> true<00:00:29.680> anti-aging<00:00:29.980> process

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
really is a true anti-aging process

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.849 
really is a true anti-aging process
we're<00:00:31.630> about<00:00:31.779> to<00:00:31.960> start<00:00:32.230> doing<00:00:32.649> the

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:32.859 
we're about to start doing the

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.040 
we're about to start doing the
non-invasive<00:00:33.370> Thermolite<00:00:34.329> treatment<00:00:34.809> and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
non-invasive Thermolite treatment and

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.950 
non-invasive Thermolite treatment and
what's<00:00:35.859> amazing<00:00:36.190> we<00:00:36.579> can<00:00:36.760> do<00:00:36.940> all<00:00:37.179> the<00:00:37.569> way<00:00:37.690> up

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
what's amazing we can do all the way up

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.979 
what's amazing we can do all the way up
into<00:00:38.289> their<00:00:38.710> eyebrow<00:00:39.159> in<00:00:39.429> the<00:00:39.670> eyelid<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:40.839> we

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
into their eyebrow in the eyelid so we

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.860 
into their eyebrow in the eyelid so we
can<00:00:41.139> get<00:00:41.289> a<00:00:41.319> lift<00:00:42.190> without<00:00:42.969> having<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.629> cut

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
can get a lift without having to cut

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.290 
can get a lift without having to cut
we're<00:00:44.499> going<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.710> do<00:00:44.859> the<00:00:44.979> lips<00:00:45.219> to<00:00:45.760> improve

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
we're going to do the lips to improve

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.809 
we're going to do the lips to improve
the<00:00:46.510> lines<00:00:46.809> here<00:00:47.199> and<00:00:47.409> to<00:00:47.649> improve<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.579> skin

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
the lines here and to improve the skin

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.270 
the lines here and to improve the skin
around<00:00:49.269> it<00:00:49.539> we're<00:00:50.260> using<00:00:50.499> the<00:00:50.799> infrared

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
around it we're using the infrared

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.809 
around it we're using the infrared
camera<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:52.170> monitor<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.739> treatment<00:00:53.979> area<00:00:54.609> and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:54.819 
camera to monitor the treatment area and

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.719 
camera to monitor the treatment area and
once<00:00:55.780> we<00:00:55.989> get<00:00:56.139> to<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.499> endpoint<00:00:57.039> of<00:00:57.280> the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
once we get to the endpoint of the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.270 
once we get to the endpoint of the
treatment<00:00:58.149> we<00:00:58.959> stop<00:00:59.289> in<00:00:59.499> that<00:00:59.649> area<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.159> we

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
treatment we stop in that area and we

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.270 
treatment we stop in that area and we
move<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.059> next<00:01:01.179> area<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:02.409> monitor<00:01:02.859> shows

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
move to the next area the monitor shows

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280 
move to the next area the monitor shows
us<00:01:03.519> over<00:01:03.760> here<00:01:03.999> that<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.360> skin<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:04.839> heating<00:01:05.170> up

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
us over here that the skin is heating up

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.550 
us over here that the skin is heating up
very<00:01:05.530> nicely<00:01:05.940> it<00:01:06.940> takes<00:01:07.150> about<00:01:07.330> 20<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.230> 30

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
very nicely it takes about 20 to 30

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.700 
very nicely it takes about 20 to 30
minutes<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:09.190> do<00:01:09.460> one<00:01:10.180> half<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.570> this<00:01:10.750> space<00:01:11.230> we

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
minutes to do one half of this space we

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.320 
minutes to do one half of this space we
can<00:01:11.890> then<00:01:12.070> look<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.550> see<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.850> difference

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
can then look and see the difference

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.710 
can then look and see the difference
between<00:01:13.570> one<00:01:13.900> side<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.530> other<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:15.430> same

getting it up to the set temperature you

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.900 
getting it up to the set temperature you
can<00:01:48.320> already<00:01:48.560> see<00:01:48.890> some<00:01:48.920> improvement<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:49.760> her

lines

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.990 

so<00:01:59.210> we<00:01:59.360> just<00:01:59.540> finished<00:01:59.690> half<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.590> face<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:01.070> as

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
so we just finished half the face and as

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.800 
so we just finished half the face and as
you<00:02:02.450> can<00:02:02.570> tell<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.710> eye<00:02:04.070> has<00:02:04.910> lifted<00:02:05.330> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
you can tell the eye has lifted the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.380 
you can tell the eye has lifted the
lines<00:02:06.320> are<00:02:06.680> less<00:02:06.890> prominent<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.150> we're<00:02:08.300> going

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
lines are less prominent so we're going

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.750 
lines are less prominent so we're going
to<00:02:08.450> start<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:08.990> on<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.410> second<00:02:09.890> side<00:02:10.070> one<00:02:10.729> of

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
to start now on the second side one of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.670 
to start now on the second side one of
the<00:02:10.880> great<00:02:11.480> things<00:02:11.780> about<00:02:11.960> this<00:02:12.320> technology

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the great things about this technology

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.760 
the great things about this technology
is<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.460> be<00:02:13.580> used<00:02:13.820> on<00:02:14.030> all<00:02:14.770> skin

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
is that you can be used on all skin

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.130 
is that you can be used on all skin
colors<00:02:15.800> because<00:02:16.670> we're<00:02:17.210> not<00:02:17.360> doing<00:02:17.750> anything

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
colors because we're not doing anything

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.960 
colors because we're not doing anything
to<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.500> skin<00:02:18.800> surface<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.460> all<00:02:19.730> working

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
to the skin surface is all working

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.320 
to the skin surface is all working
underneath<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.650> tighten<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.190> collagen<00:02:22.700> now

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
underneath to tighten the collagen now

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.510 
underneath to tighten the collagen now
we're<00:02:23.570> about<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.930> start<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> thermal<00:02:25.160> RF

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
we're about to start the thermal RF

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.809 
we're about to start the thermal RF
portion

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.759 

so<00:02:31.390> I'm<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.659> prepping<00:02:31.989> with<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.319> skin<00:02:32.590> with

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
so I'm just prepping with this skin with

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.610 
so I'm just prepping with this skin with
some<00:02:32.920> betadine<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:34.000> sterilize<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.540> skin<00:02:34.750> do

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
some betadine just sterilize the skin do

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.970 
some betadine just sterilize the skin do
it<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.969> bit<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.299> numbing<00:02:38.019> here<00:02:38.469> you're

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it a little bit of numbing here you're

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:47.030 
it a little bit of numbing here you're
gonna<00:02:39.099> feel<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.810> little<00:02:40.810> pinch<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:42.280> okay

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.559 

where<00:02:48.040> I'm<00:02:48.159> treating<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:48.819> on<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.329> jowl<00:02:49.540> area

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
where I'm treating now on the jowl area

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.899 
where I'm treating now on the jowl area
you<00:02:50.470> can<00:02:50.620> see<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.159> heating<00:02:51.489> up<00:02:51.609> and<00:02:51.819> is

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
you can see that it's heating up and is

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.990 
you can see that it's heating up and is
becoming<00:02:52.329> white<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.920> telling<00:02:54.220> me<00:02:54.519> what

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
becoming white and is telling me what

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.660 
becoming white and is telling me what
I've<00:02:55.120> treated<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.750> what<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.930> have<00:02:56.079> not<00:02:56.260> treated

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
I've treated and what I have not treated

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.099 
I've treated and what I have not treated
so<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:57.879> great<00:02:58.120> guide<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.750> tells<00:02:58.959> you

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
so it's a great guide it tells you

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.589 
so it's a great guide it tells you
exactly<00:02:59.230> where<00:02:59.889> you<00:03:00.040> need<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.340> be<00:03:00.370> on<00:03:01.150> average

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
exactly where you need to be on average

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.809 
exactly where you need to be on average
anywhere<00:03:02.290> between<00:03:02.530> half-hour<00:03:03.159> to<00:03:03.609> an<00:03:03.639> hour

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
anywhere between half-hour to an hour

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.699 
anywhere between half-hour to an hour
you<00:03:04.269> can<00:03:04.750> do<00:03:04.989> most<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.379> this<00:03:05.530> treatment

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.830 

we've<00:03:12.709> started<00:03:13.010> doing<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.459> second<00:03:13.849> side<00:03:14.060> in

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
we've started doing the second side in

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.080 
we've started doing the second side in
Marshall's<00:03:15.650> case<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.099> skin<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.489> pretty<00:03:16.760> thin

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
Marshall's case the skin is pretty thin

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.110 
Marshall's case the skin is pretty thin
so<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:18.020> tends<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.380> heat<00:03:18.620> up<00:03:18.650> very<00:03:19.069> quickly<00:03:19.400> but

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
so it tends to heat up very quickly but

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.589 
so it tends to heat up very quickly but
she<00:03:20.510> has<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.750> lot<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.200> these<00:03:22.069> deep<00:03:22.430> lines<00:03:22.599> which

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
she has a lot of these deep lines which

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.580 
she has a lot of these deep lines which
are<00:03:23.810> harder<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.440> treat<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:25.430> in<00:03:26.330> her<00:03:26.569> case<00:03:26.870> we're

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
are harder to treat so in her case we're

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.640 
are harder to treat so in her case we're
going<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:27.860> add<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:29.060> platelet-rich<00:03:29.690> plasma<00:03:29.870> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
going to add the platelet-rich plasma to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.760 
going to add the platelet-rich plasma to
improve<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.550> quality<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.480> skin<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.020> to

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
improve the quality of the skin and to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.650 
improve the quality of the skin and to
improve<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.400> healing<00:03:34.880> process

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.350 

we're<00:03:40.660> done<00:03:40.840> with<00:03:40.990> the<00:03:41.260> thermia<00:03:41.950> RF<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.610> now

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
we're done with the thermia RF and now

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.870 
we're done with the thermia RF and now
we're<00:03:44.110> going<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.470> put<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:45.190> platelet-rich

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
we're going to put the platelet-rich

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.600 
we're going to put the platelet-rich
plasma<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.780> PRP<00:03:47.110> we're<00:03:47.740> going<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.100> inject<00:03:48.430> it

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
plasma the PRP we're going to inject it

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.059 
plasma the PRP we're going to inject it
into<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.910> area<00:03:49.270> that<00:03:49.480> we<00:03:49.569> treated<00:03:49.990> so<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.740> we

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
into the area that we treated so that we

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:04.310 
into the area that we treated so that we
can<00:03:51.250> get<00:03:51.459> even<00:03:52.300> better<00:03:52.450> results

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.380 

so<00:04:05.320> we<00:04:05.470> just<00:04:05.650> finished<00:04:06.010> doing<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.940> three

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
so we just finished doing the three

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.530 
so we just finished doing the three
procedures<00:04:07.750> we<00:04:08.380> did<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.770> therm<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.580> tight<00:04:10.000> to

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
procedures we did the therm a tight to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.290 
procedures we did the therm a tight to
the<00:04:10.660> face<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.170> neck<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.560> then<00:04:12.280> we<00:04:12.460> did<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
the face and neck and then we did the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.410 
the face and neck and then we did the
thermi<00:04:13.930> RF<00:04:14.290> then<00:04:15.190> we<00:04:15.340> did<00:04:15.520> they<00:04:15.820> played<00:04:16.180> rich

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
thermi RF then we did they played rich

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.250 
thermi RF then we did they played rich
plasma

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
plasma

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.259 
plasma
it<00:04:17.680> really<00:04:17.950> wasn't<00:04:18.190> painful<00:04:18.549> especially<00:04:18.850> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
it really wasn't painful especially the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.410 
it really wasn't painful especially the
first<00:04:19.540> process<00:04:20.200> was<00:04:21.900> very<00:04:22.900> soothing<00:04:23.290> and

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
first process was very soothing and

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.480 
first process was very soothing and
comfortable<00:04:25.420> quite<00:04:26.230> warm<00:04:26.590> again<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.070> look<00:04:27.400> a

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
comfortable quite warm again you look a

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.370 
comfortable quite warm again you look a
lot<00:04:27.610> better<00:04:27.670> when<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.390> numbing<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.080> all<00:04:29.200> the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
lot better when this numbing and all the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.370 
lot better when this numbing and all the
initial<00:04:30.280> swelling<00:04:30.850> goes<00:04:31.030> away<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:32.110> look

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
initial swelling goes away and you look

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.930 
initial swelling goes away and you look
better<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.830> better<00:04:32.980> over<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.520> next<00:04:33.550> few

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
better and better over the next few

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:46.510 
better and better over the next few
weeks

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.129 

you

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.199 

you
