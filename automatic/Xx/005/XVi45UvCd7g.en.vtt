00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
entire portion of this game and so far

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.300 
entire portion of this game and so far
this<00:02:08.610> shotgun<00:02:08.879> I'm

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
this shotgun I'm

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.110 
this shotgun I'm
um<00:02:10.610> I'm<00:02:11.480> not<00:02:11.540> too<00:02:12.050> disappointed<00:02:12.560> with<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.160> I

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
um I'm not too disappointed with it I

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.030 
um I'm not too disappointed with it I
know<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.540> most<00:02:14.930> shotguns<00:02:15.440> aren't<00:02:15.800> great

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
know that most shotguns aren't great

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.309 
know that most shotguns aren't great
until<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.400> unlock<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:17.000> know<00:02:17.120> damage<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
until you unlock you know damage and

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.770 
until you unlock you know damage and
extended<00:02:19.069> mags<00:02:19.250> because<00:02:19.970> extended<00:02:20.599> mags

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
extended mags because extended mags

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.630 
extended mags because extended mags
increases<00:02:21.470> increases<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.310> number<00:02:22.610> of

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
increases increases the number of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.839 
increases increases the number of
pellets<00:02:23.180> per<00:02:23.420> shot<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.709> your<00:02:25.160> shotgun<00:02:25.610> I

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
pellets per shot of your shotgun I

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.880 
pellets per shot of your shotgun I
believe<00:02:26.239> it's<00:02:26.360> from<00:02:26.450> 6<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:27.019> 9<00:02:27.050> on<00:02:27.560> most

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
believe it's from 6 to 9 on most

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.330 
believe it's from 6 to 9 on most
shotguns<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:30.069> especially<00:02:31.069> with<00:02:31.280> a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
shotguns and so especially with a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.890 
shotguns and so especially with a
striker<00:02:31.640> since<00:02:31.970> you're<00:02:32.330> kind<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.599> just<00:02:32.780> like
