00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.130 

that's<00:04:19.850> not<00:04:20.030> bad<00:04:20.269> that's<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.079> too<00:04:21.350> bad<00:04:21.380> at<00:04:21.709> all

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
that's not bad that's not too bad at all

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.600 
that's not bad that's not too bad at all
as<00:04:24.140> I've<00:04:24.350> said<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.710> other<00:04:24.800> videos<00:04:24.890> I'm<00:04:25.430> not<00:04:25.580> a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
as I've said in other videos I'm not a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.870 
as I've said in other videos I'm not a
big<00:04:25.880> fan<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:27.170> fucking<00:04:27.770> loggers<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.370> pilsners

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.750 
big fan of fucking loggers and pilsners
and<00:04:29.150> that's<00:04:29.300> such<00:04:29.570> usually<00:04:30.320> they're<00:04:30.500> my<00:04:31.490> least

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
and that's such usually they're my least

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.840 
and that's such usually they're my least
favorite<00:04:32.180> type<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.390> beer<00:04:32.690> quite<00:04:33.050> frankly<00:04:33.850> but

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
favorite type of beer quite frankly but

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.790 
favorite type of beer quite frankly but
this<00:04:35.030> isn't<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.420> head<00:04:35.630> this<00:04:36.020> is<00:04:36.230> not<00:04:36.380> bad<00:04:36.650> at

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
this isn't the head this is not bad at

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.280 
this isn't the head this is not bad at
all<00:04:39.880> it<00:04:40.880> doesn't<00:04:41.180> have<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> lot<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.630> character

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
all it doesn't have a lot of character

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.990 
all it doesn't have a lot of character
or<00:04:42.440> complexity<00:04:42.950> but<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.610> can't<00:04:43.880> really

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
or complexity but you can't really

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.450 
or complexity but you can't really
expect<00:04:44.390> that<00:04:44.630> for<00:04:44.900> most<00:04:45.170> loggers<00:04:46.070> and

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
expect that for most loggers and

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.220 
expect that for most loggers and
pilsners<00:04:47.650> they're<00:04:48.650> they're<00:04:49.040> just<00:04:49.310> not<00:04:49.520> made

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
pilsners they're they're just not made

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.750 
pilsners they're they're just not made
to<00:04:51.230> have<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:51.890> sort<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:54.190> body<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.370> fullness

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
to have that sort of body and fullness

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.090 
to have that sort of body and fullness
to<00:04:55.940> them<00:04:56.270> they're<00:04:56.480> there<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:57.770> know<00:04:57.860> their

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
to them they're there you know their

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.100 
to them they're there you know their
beers<00:04:58.820> that<00:04:58.940> you're<00:04:59.270> their<00:04:59.480> session<00:04:59.870> beers

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
beers that you're their session beers

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.270 
beers that you're their session beers
essentially<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.900> this<00:05:03.290> was<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.680> isn't<00:05:04.040> bad

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
essentially and this was this isn't bad

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.970 
essentially and this was this isn't bad
this<00:05:04.610> this<00:05:05.060> would<00:05:05.210> be<00:05:05.390> good<00:05:05.600> summer<00:05:05.930> beer<00:05:06.230> like
