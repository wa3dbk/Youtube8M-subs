00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
them up and we'll give it get a bit of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.959 
them up and we'll give it get a bit of
an<00:00:33.090> air<00:00:33.450> into<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.050> any<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:35.040> ways<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.760> can

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
an air into there any little ways we can

something very early on in in the season

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.670 
something very early on in in the season
we<00:04:31.800> won't<00:04:32.039> have<00:04:32.250> problems<00:04:32.789> getting<00:04:33.110> down<00:04:34.110> into

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
we won't have problems getting down into

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.219 
we won't have problems getting down into
the<00:04:34.800> soil<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.340> manure<00:04:36.120> would<00:04:36.389> be<00:04:36.539> frozen<00:04:36.750> and

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
the soil the manure would be frozen and

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.189 
the soil the manure would be frozen and
that<00:04:37.860> will<00:04:38.009> break<00:04:38.160> up<00:04:38.370> very<00:04:38.610> very<00:04:38.669> easily

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
that will break up very very easily

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.670 
that will break up very very easily
it'll<00:04:40.199> also<00:04:40.470> stop<00:04:41.539> the<00:04:42.539> weeds<00:04:42.750> coming<00:04:43.229> through

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
it'll also stop the weeds coming through

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.770 
it'll also stop the weeds coming through
or<00:04:43.979> a<00:04:44.039> lot<00:04:44.759> of<00:04:44.789> them<00:04:45.120> coming<00:04:45.360> through<00:04:45.449> we'll

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
or a lot of them coming through we'll

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.719 
or a lot of them coming through we'll
still<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:46.259> some<00:04:46.560> because<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.099> manures<00:04:47.520> made

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
still have some because the manures made

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.480 
still have some because the manures made
the<00:04:47.849> soil<00:04:48.090> really<00:04:48.270> nice<00:04:48.570> but<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.770> lot<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.190> them

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
the soil really nice but a lot of them

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.790 
the soil really nice but a lot of them
will<00:04:50.639> actually<00:04:50.910> grow<00:04:51.120> from<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.660> manure<00:04:52.020> so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
will actually grow from the manure so

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.770 
will actually grow from the manure so
they're<00:04:53.250> very<00:04:53.460> easy<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.910> dig<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.539> manure

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
they're very easy to dig and the manure

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.080 
they're very easy to dig and the manure
itself<00:04:55.169> is<00:04:55.289> actually<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:55.710> about<00:04:55.949> the<00:04:56.849> most

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
itself is actually as about the most

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.760 
itself is actually as about the most
probably<00:04:57.419> about<00:04:57.630> two<00:04:57.870> two<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.440> half<00:04:58.590> three

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
probably about two two and a half three

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.800 
probably about two two and a half three
inches<00:04:59.130> thick<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.699> suppose<00:05:00.210> we're<00:05:00.449> looking<00:05:00.720> at

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
inches thick I suppose we're looking at

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.279 
inches thick I suppose we're looking at
here<00:05:01.110> um<00:05:02.039> and<00:05:02.449> that's<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.690> either<00:05:03.840> then

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
here um and that's the either then

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.620 
here um and that's the either then
that's<00:05:04.919> why<00:05:05.250> we<00:05:05.490> use<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:05.759> it's<00:05:06.120> good<00:05:06.360> for<00:05:06.570> the

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
that's why we use it it's good for the

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.370 
that's why we use it it's good for the
soil<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.530> worms<00:05:07.770> love<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.729> it's<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.990> it

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
soil the worms love it and it's a it

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.540 
soil the worms love it and it's a it
stops<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:11.099> weeds<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:12.180> feeds<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:13.199> soil

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
stops the weeds and it feeds the soil

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.399 
stops the weeds and it feeds the soil
also<00:05:14.930> another<00:05:15.930> thing<00:05:16.289> cats<00:05:16.860> dogs<00:05:17.610> foxes<00:05:18.479> don't

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
also another thing cats dogs foxes don't

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.189 
also another thing cats dogs foxes don't
like<00:05:19.620> smell<00:05:20.039> so<00:05:20.820> if<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.120> put<00:05:21.330> this<00:05:21.479> down<00:05:21.750> they

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
like smell so if you put this down they

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.890 
like smell so if you put this down they
tend<00:05:22.620> not<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:23.130> dig<00:05:23.669> it<00:05:23.849> but<00:05:24.479> we'll<00:05:24.659> soon<00:05:24.840> see

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
tend not to dig it but we'll soon see

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.689 
tend not to dig it but we'll soon see
there<00:05:25.349> are<00:05:25.500> some<00:05:25.710> round<00:05:25.979> here<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.490> whether

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
there are some round here so whether

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.700 
there are some round here so whether
they're<00:05:26.970> immune<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.509> it<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.720> don't<00:05:27.780> know<00:05:28.110> will

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
they're immune to it I don't know will

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.529 
they're immune to it I don't know will
soon<00:05:28.979> see<00:05:29.190> but<00:05:29.370> what<00:05:29.490> I've<00:05:29.580> done<00:05:29.820> that<00:05:30.060> one<00:05:30.270> bed

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
soon see but what I've done that one bed

put more Mignot down you can now see

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.210 
put more Mignot down you can now see
where<00:05:44.820> this<00:05:45.090> bed<00:05:45.389> is<00:05:45.659> because<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.680> manures<00:05:47.039> on

there there's no getting mixed up with

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.189 
there there's no getting mixed up with
the<00:05:49.320> path<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:49.979> that's<00:05:50.639> the<00:05:50.880> first<00:05:51.180> one<00:05:51.659> done
