00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.720 
sounds like a lot of work and we can
assume<00:02:33.079> that<00:02:33.109> people<00:02:33.470> bathe<00:02:33.859> a<00:02:33.889> lot<00:02:34.310> less<00:02:34.519> in

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
assume that people bathe a lot less in

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.340 
assume that people bathe a lot less in
those<00:02:34.880> days<00:02:35.180> than<00:02:35.450> they<00:02:35.569> do<00:02:35.630> today

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
those days than they do today

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.080 
those days than they do today
you'd<00:02:36.739> feel<00:02:37.010> any<00:02:37.310> good<00:02:37.459> give<00:02:37.579> all<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.730> four

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
you'd feel any good give all to four

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.299 
you'd feel any good give all to four
bells
