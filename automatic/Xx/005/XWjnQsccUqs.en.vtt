00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
hovercraft as well but he fits in the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.380 
hovercraft as well but he fits in the
back<00:01:33.439> perfectly<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> fold

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

doesn't go anywhere and I think it looks
awesome<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.070> blue<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.579> bit

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
awesome the blue is a little bit

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.510 
awesome the blue is a little bit
different<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.079> makes<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.710> figure<00:01:47.100> look

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
different but it makes the figure look

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.389 
different but it makes the figure look
awesome<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.570> think<00:01:49.020> let<00:01:49.920> me<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.280> you
