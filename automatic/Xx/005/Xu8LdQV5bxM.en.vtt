wanting to be elevated go ahead and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.260 
wanting to be elevated go ahead and
build<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.500> about<00:01:36.770> 2<00:01:36.980> or<00:01:37.010> 3<00:01:37.160> hi<00:01:37.520> I'm<00:01:37.850> doing<00:01:38.120> that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
build it about 2 or 3 hi I'm doing that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.910 
build it about 2 or 3 hi I'm doing that
because<00:01:38.630> I'm<00:01:38.930> above<00:01:39.200> like<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.470> little<00:01:39.740> river

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
here and I thought it'd be a good idea

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.260 
here and I thought it'd be a good idea
to<00:01:42.290> make<00:01:42.410> it<00:01:42.530> elevated<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.790> do<00:01:43.910> not<00:01:44.030> have

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
to make it elevated but you do not have

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.610 
to make it elevated but you do not have
to<00:01:44.420> do<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.660> you<00:01:44.840> can<00:01:44.930> make<00:01:44.960> yours<00:01:45.200> over<00:01:45.470> lava

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
to do that you can make yours over lava

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.780 
to do that you can make yours over lava
whatever<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.580> want<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.850> make<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.120> over<00:01:47.600> and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
whatever you want to make it over and

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.010 
whatever you want to make it over and
once<00:01:49.790> again<00:01:49.910> guys<00:01:50.210> just<00:01:50.450> reminded<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:50.900> don't

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
off to the side and like I mentioned

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.150 
off to the side and like I mentioned
earlier<00:03:09.019> you're<00:03:09.350> obviously<00:03:09.500> not<00:03:09.830> gonna<00:03:09.980> put

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
earlier you're obviously not gonna put

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.979 
earlier you're obviously not gonna put
the<00:03:10.280> lever<00:03:10.459> at<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> start<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.330> bridge<00:03:11.600> if

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
the lever at the start of the bridge if

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.180 
the lever at the start of the bridge if
you're<00:03:12.470> trying<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.709> make<00:03:12.830> this<00:03:12.950> like

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
you're trying to make this like

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.430 
you're trying to make this like
secretive<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.060> then<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:15.050> last<00:03:15.200> thing<00:03:15.350> you

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
secretive and then the last thing you

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.350 
secretive and then the last thing you
have<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.590> do<00:03:15.709> is<00:03:15.830> just<00:03:15.950> run<00:03:16.100> redstone<00:03:16.610> down<00:03:17.150> the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
have to do is just run redstone down the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.330 
have to do is just run redstone down the
sides<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.930> trapdoors<00:03:18.440> make<00:03:19.010> sure<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.250> hit

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
sides of the trapdoors make sure you hit

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.820 
sides of the trapdoors make sure you hit
every<00:03:19.580> block<00:03:19.820> connect<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.739> connect<00:03:21.739> them

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
every block connect it and connect them

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.240 
every block connect it and connect them
together

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
together

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.620 
together
and<00:03:22.459> then<00:03:22.580> connect<00:03:22.820> them<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.120> lever<00:03:23.360> and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
and then connect them to the lever and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.780 
and then connect them to the lever and
you<00:03:23.780> guys<00:03:24.470> got<00:03:24.709> yourselves<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:25.340> trapdoor

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
you guys got yourselves a trapdoor

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.820 
you guys got yourselves a trapdoor
bridge<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.790> hope<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:30.110> video<00:03:30.320> helped
