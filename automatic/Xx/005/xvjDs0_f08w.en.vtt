00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.969

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.049
 dunkirk deltell bp were heard 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.139
 few other clubs when writing afp much to believe in it 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.519
 so 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.400
 Why

 enough is enough 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.380
 cdi 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.450
 p early July 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.469

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.469
 every night 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.180
 60 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.769

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.740
 the chief of the un 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.160
 perhaps 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.160
 I repeat that the others 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 school 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 i think my pc more 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 the other thing, after all 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.580
 I believe 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.860
 it is done 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 show 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.870
 this optics 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.330
 in fact too much 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 the other 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.520
 next time 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.540
 side the chef 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.990
 it's too much 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840
 I am ready 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.020
