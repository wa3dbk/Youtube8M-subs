don't get it right I'm not gonna play
their<00:02:27.150> game<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.900> thing<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.709> was<00:02:28.890> way

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
their game the thing is is that was way

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.710 
their game the thing is is that was way
too<00:02:29.190> quick<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:29.730> something<00:02:30.240> like<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.390> scout

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
too quick for something like a scout

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.780 
too quick for something like a scout
rifle<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.170> double<00:02:31.530> tap<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.040> chambering

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
rifle that double tap the chambering

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.600 
rifle that double tap the chambering
time<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.350> ridiculous<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.190> it's<00:02:35.520> a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
time is ridiculous and I know it's a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.920 
time is ridiculous and I know it's a
one-shot<00:02:35.790> kill<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> head<00:02:36.720> shot

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
one-shot kill if you get the head shot

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.360 
one-shot kill if you get the head shot
but<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:37.170> not<00:02:37.290> people<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:37.860> confidently

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
but if not people can just confidently

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.070 
but if not people can just confidently
just<00:02:38.670> go<00:02:38.850> for<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.060> body<00:02:39.300> all<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.660> time<00:02:39.690> and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
just go for the body all the time and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500 
just go for the body all the time and
ignore<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.830> fact<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.090> I'm

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.229 
that's that's what's happening and I'm
still<00:02:47.190> consistently<00:02:47.640> being<00:02:47.820> able<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> get

still consistently being able to get

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.300 
still consistently being able to get
headshots<00:02:48.450> I'm<00:02:48.930> able<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.260> pass<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.010> lead<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
headshots I'm able to pass and lead the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.030 
headshots I'm able to pass and lead the
targets<00:02:50.670> properly<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.810> take<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.709> from<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.010> guy

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
targets properly so take it from a guy

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
targets properly so take it from a guy
thats<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.489> greatest<00:02:53.820> on<00:02:54.060> console<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.720> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
thats not the greatest on console and is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.600 
thats not the greatest on console and is
able<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.110> perform<00:02:55.440> at<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.860> level<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> gun

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
able to perform at this level with a gun

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.759 
able to perform at this level with a gun
like<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.390> that's<00:02:57.959> saying<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.380> lot<00:02:58.410> so

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
like this that is that's saying a lot so

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.020 
like this that is that's saying a lot so
I<00:02:58.800> do<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.250> they<00:02:59.370> need<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.580> tone<00:02:59.820> down<00:02:59.850> some

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I do think they need to tone down some

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.280 
I do think they need to tone down some
of<00:03:00.239> these<00:03:00.360> guns<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.810> balance<00:03:01.050> ease<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.200> little

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
me thinks that this sniping is trying to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.729 
me thinks that this sniping is trying to
be<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.239> balance<00:03:39.660> with<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.870> fast-paced<00:03:40.290> nature

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
be on balance with the fast-paced nature

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.319 
be on balance with the fast-paced nature
of<00:03:40.920> this<00:03:41.130> game<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.700> don't<00:03:41.910> know<00:03:42.060> if<00:03:42.090> they're

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
of this game so I don't know if they're

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.210 
of this game so I don't know if they're
wanting<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.989> be<00:03:43.019> where<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.950> could<00:03:44.130> be

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
wanting this to be where you could be

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.380 
wanting this to be where you could be
far<00:03:44.459> more<00:03:44.489> confident<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.269> aggressive

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
far more confident and aggressive

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.090 
far more confident and aggressive

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
opportunities to put in at least need to

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.300 
opportunities to put in at least need to
connect<00:03:58.320> with<00:03:58.350> two<00:03:58.560> or<00:03:58.680> three<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.980> them<00:03:59.130> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
connect with two or three of them and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.100 
connect with two or three of them and
these<00:03:59.940> guys<00:04:00.120> going<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.390> be<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.600> open<00:04:00.930> so

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
these guys going to be in the open so

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.440 
these guys going to be in the open so
many<00:04:01.170> times<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:01.850> again<00:04:02.850> sniping<00:04:03.329> is

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
many times so again sniping is

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.000 
many times so again sniping is
definitely<00:04:03.900> changed<00:04:04.230> between<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:04.709> game<00:04:04.950> and
