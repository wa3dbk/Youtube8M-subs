00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.220
 ah 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.390
 this is how is called scorpio 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.570
 game 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:32.350
 the machine reflects the machine 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.350
 Soda has gone awesome 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:46.270
 basically it's a giant crossbow that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.270
 is released forward 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:01:02.960
 this to block entry to the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.320
 torsional rope is like a network of 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.320
 wood 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.470
 ok we are going to charge it more because of 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.800
 hand has nothing and not once 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.560
 loaded let's put what was before 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.369
 doing the companion is released 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.850
 a soldier aims 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.810
 It is perfectly movable haha and other 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 releasing the loop 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.710
 horse manes are used for example 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.549
 and when the Romans agreed to the 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.320
 cartago city 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.570
 finally they destroyed it in the third 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 public war when they ran out 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.049
 war material because they had been 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.299
 commandeered all the Romans is counted 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.039
 that the women of Carthage were cut 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.020
 the hair so that their hair 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.540
 then serve as mechanisms of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.270
 torsion for these scorpions crossbows 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.100
 seriously 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.170
 then they had to be cut again 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.550
 the hair for other types of weapons and 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.790
 others and as a historian comments 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:19.030
 discretion as soon as the hair was very 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:22.709
 bolivar but they were supposed to be developed 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.819
 for the first time on the island of eivissa and 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.049
 we can shoot again we can 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.379
 shoot him again you can see these 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.239
 weapons had so much reach has a 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.489
 Caesar campaign against concello in your 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.620
 own attacked positions from the sea 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.910
 over the warships they fired 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.040
 logically that ship is well that 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.560
 I was quite a few meters from the line 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.560
 action fire already on the childhoods of 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.530
 cease 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.730
 we have the crouched ones how would it be 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.730
 a game of meanwhile the soldiers 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.730
 they were shooting stones from 2032 that already 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.569
 they are loading projectiles that to three 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.610
 men next to the bin in the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.860
 wastepaper basket and wait for a moment 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.209
 them in the world where the wastebasket is 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.040
 then this is to ojÃ­metro you're not 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.690
 pointing but you have a peephole or something 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:28.610
 well or it's calculation little craft you take 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:32.290
 all ballistic life and let's see 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.290
 we are going to see him shoot the scorpion 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.290
 fire 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.080
 once a machine of these was 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.850
 pointed to a position had a great 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.920
 rendering another of the scenes that 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.540
 Caesar account that most admirable of 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.760
 it turned out it was in the siege of a city 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.350
 to find out how they were doing 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.150
 some machine of this type to the party 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.040
 superior of the wall and there was a 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.190
 giant gallic warrior going out to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.310
 throw ideas on and everything against 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.050
 siege works crossed it with a 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.060
 projectile and the next warrior came out 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.550
 in the same place to keep pulling 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.170
 torches went through all the 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.910
 knowing they were being carried like the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.500
 videogame the Martians that the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.500
 second manzanito came through here 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.960
 total movement 2 kos that came out knowing 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.540
 that they would die in order to throw a 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.840
 little fire and do away with the works of 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.840
 fortification 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:56.940
 someone is not 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.930
 now or in the bin it is curious that the 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.439
 collective name that he received in all 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.900
 these machines was storm and it comes from 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:17.219
 thor which is the root and 14 profession weapons 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.740
 of torsion friends who developed to 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.289
 from the fourth century on the island of 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.379
 some people believe that tuning the 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.150
 fifth floor as always if one appears 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.490
 single machine of this type that is 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.689
 earlier ground those theories 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.689
 apart they remain 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.919
 first and then a great manufacturer of 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.550
 these machines was not archimedes in the 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.909
 three years old 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.909
 his wit 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.630
 also 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.669
 do not
