00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.970
 latitude 13 is a laptop that wants to position within the range of 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.290
 ultralight, taking care of all aspects related to design and 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.320
 mobility but it gets too expensive the final input solution does not remember 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.410
 the first version of the famous thalamus by the type of integration 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.249
 performed 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.679
 its robust aluminum housing and protect the equipment and the telefax screen as 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.999
 3 inches its implemented zinc hinges provide a fixation to the base without 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.820
 precedents away from the typical models that with the passage of time 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.980
 creak and undo the touchpad driver is generous with two buttons 

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:40.159
 dedicated sensitive to the pulsation the size of the keys also very 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.219
 broad although this time cancer retro keyboard illumination with 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.109
 views to offer a price adjusted to users have been omitted aspects 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.460
 interesting as the hdmi video output in a consumer model in fact the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.129
 number of gas connections in somewhat limited with express tower lanes 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.930
 cards 5-in-1 of its laterals and leaving without connections the other side 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.600
 on the back is the video output of type v gea a 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.230
 external connector to the ata serial has shared with a cd other or sb and that of 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.490
 tell me what to do as most microlights of these dimensions 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.550
 it lacks an optical unit in favor of strengthening its mobility section 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.230
 since its weight amounts to 1 with 5 kilograms 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.340
 in terms of configuration the processor can be a celeron 7 4 3 d 1 with 2 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.530
 gigahertz or the core option tm 2 only one with 4 gigahertz admits 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.240
 up to the ddr3 memory modules has the intel chipset moaned 4500 and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.960
 it is possible to reach resolutions of 1366 by 7 6 8 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.280
 unlike the ones we're used to seeing in the pc world its 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.810
 6-cell battery found embedded in the housing which can result in 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.960
 against it when replacing it with another 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.540
 in his favor it is necessary to emphasize the excellent integration and finishing of the equipment 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.150
 at the expense of knowing the final price of the first latitude 13 configurations 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.080
 It can be interesting for prices that are between 700 and 800 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.720
 euros 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.540
 above which there are configurations with more processors 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.310
 powerful though you miss the essence of mobility design brought to its maximum 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.299
 expression in this model
