00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello, there is my passion fan 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.830
 favorites for the march and I start 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.429
 with a fashion trend of me 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.200
 a few months ago 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.759
 impressed and influenced me and myself 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 could hardly wait for it to arrive 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 gets a bit warmer and me somehow 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.570
 that can wear as well as me 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.060
 wanted to and it is about the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.789
 white separates and that means you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 as well as denim and your two 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 white part combined with a combo 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.980
 and / or even if you are 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.350
 he wants to wear completely white outfits and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 I think that screams for spring and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.469
 summer and I can not wait 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.780
 when I finally get on a white jeans 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.710
 and then really knows completely 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.539
 can carry 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.930
 but in this month I really like 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 a white sleeveless blouse worn with 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.379
 a white blazer over it and am 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.000
 Dearest this white blouse here from 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.829
 Of course, mango has two bags 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.149
 up front and not so in 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.860
 real collar but rather one like that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.840
 Stand collar and you can then as well 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.170
 wear them on a bit 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.390
 loose field and I have said as no 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.520
 So of course you can do that as well 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.700
 wear and I just have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.200
 worn a blazer 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.780
 that's actually my favorite 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 blazer i always enjoy working 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.360
 often count as well in the leisure time 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.950
 just totally love it because you just 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 so simple and easy to wear 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.700
 can give us your but it can also 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.159
 of course very much rose by that 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.409
 blazer continues and yes that is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.939
 combination of such a white top and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.520
 the white blazer and also a white one 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.220
 t shirt and a white blazer has me 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.990
 I really liked the music 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 I somehow totally in this month 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.360
 Remixes expire and I have to 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.979
 actually only call an artist because 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.830
 my heart has just like that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.590
 influenced there is simply 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.910
 not at all and that's kate trainer that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.540
 is a dj from Canada and I think 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.970
 just his remixes are just like that 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.130
 good and everything he produces and out 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.340
 brings is just exactly my taste 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 and you can call me at soundcloud caterer 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.860
 I also link it once 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.660
 infobox 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.880
 but I just find sound to this 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.980
 channel I would every day from work 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.390
 every day when I come from work 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.330
 who go to work when I'm on the road 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.400
 I'm always because he's never so good 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.620
 makes mood and I like the music so much 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.100
 he likes to make such a remix 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.050
 hiphop and house and electro i know 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.240
 at all , the music direction is called 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.120
 but he also has janet jackson 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.920
 and so very old 90s just hunk 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.780
 so he opens like that and so in the remix 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.130
 That's what you probably do 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.180
 already are exactly mainz and therefore 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.880
 Canada all the way 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.750
 but because it's on the last few weeks 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.230
 ran daily 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.600
 sweet day by jessie j ems uwe rooster 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.880
 I will also remix you in the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.610
 infobox is simply a song that too 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.760
 I've heard every day in the mix with 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.430
 kate honda just syria since easy 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.870
 a really good dj and I like 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.550
 it's so nice and easy this good dj 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.100
 with this great singer in one 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.750
 Remix together is just love two 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.370
 I have seen films this month 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.160
 that impressed me a lot 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.040
 the first one is of course great as cottagers 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.390
 and he has a lot of oscars 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 I have to say I am with them 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.820
 really moving and great what 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.860
 was told and how it was told 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.600
 but he does not have me so extreme of the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.390
 hewed socks and there were already 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.519
 very many rumors about that 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.620
 Some voted even though they did 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.769
 film did not see it simply because it 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.720
 that genre of African American 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:01.250
 somehow treated and no idea 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.510
 I just found somehow brad pitt in the 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.970
 movie displeasure 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.000
 me and so he as the only white 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.980
 somehow thinks well and so 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.129
 strange role somehow and I know 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.010
 the film is with and from and about them 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.600
 80 do not know what but I found it 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.239
 somehow not really fit but 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.709
 in itself the main actor so me 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.330
 found the main actor who would have 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.449
 really earned in oscar because that was 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.880
 really so good and i never have 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.500
 really understood why that 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.090
 leading actress so to speak the oscar 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.460
 I get it now was not so 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.220
 extremely blatant because I found the main title 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.900
 really better but a movie 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.300
 where I award the oscar 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.389
 can really empathize is davis 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:50.990
 cup with matt mccall and jared leto 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.880
 bradley for the year as a singer not at all 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.570
 just so anti I totally think it 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.449
 bad 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.580
 personally but I still know him 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.620
 requiem woltering from the movie and is 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.990
 really such an incredibly good movie 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.120
 and the svs just rattle again 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.729
 shown what a blatant actor 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.560
 jared leto is and how extremely courageous 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.120
 He really did not recognize him forever 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.930
 Again there was a situation where I am in 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.729
 did not recognize the film and also 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.860
 martin konecny ​​so you really can 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.070
 partly do not want to look 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.020
 at the sonos work and that really 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.610
 so shocking were it based on 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.930
 a true story and it is 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:33.139
 just such power and such a great 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.789
 history so well implemented and the 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.949
 Actors are just amazing 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.720
 good and really blew me away and 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.000
 would not have thought more than anything else 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.370
 chemistry conny you just rather like that 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.229
 somehow knows about the fastest filming 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.789
 so convinced that it is really a movie 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.169
 everyone should have seen 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.289
 There is not really stress 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.250
 anything that somehow at 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.740
 took foodstuffs to me 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.500
 was extremely great or different than that 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.360
 months before that series I did not 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.849
 also did not really look youtube what 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.710
 I'm a little sorry for myself 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.310
 hat but 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.840
 sometimes so and yes until today i would 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.760
 I would just say that at this 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.390
 place and hope the video has you 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.170
 like 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.170
 Until next time
