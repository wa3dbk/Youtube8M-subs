so transfusion dependent anemia is one

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
so transfusion dependent anemia is one

the quality of life issues as I said are

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.690 
the quality of life issues as I said are

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
improve survival but short of that if it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.710 
improve survival but short of that if it

traditionally in myelofibrosis the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.259 
traditionally in myelofibrosis the
management<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.680> anemia<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.489> used<00:02:48.730> drugs

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
management of anemia have used drugs

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.090 
management of anemia have used drugs
such<00:02:49.840> as<00:02:49.890> aerotropolis<00:02:51.000> stimulating<00:02:52.000> agents

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
such as aerotropolis stimulating agents

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.150 
such as aerotropolis stimulating agents
androgen<00:02:54.100> preparations<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.650> forth<00:02:56.920> and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
androgen preparations and so forth and

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.009 
androgen preparations and so forth and
they<00:02:57.760> don't<00:02:57.970> work<00:02:58.180> very<00:02:58.239> well<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.900> those

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
they don't work very well and those

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.920 
they don't work very well and those
drugs<00:02:59.380> usually<00:02:59.620> end<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.850> making<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.569> splint

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
drugs usually end up making the splint

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.820 
drugs usually end up making the splint
even<00:03:02.140> larger<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.850> there<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.540> dire<00:03:04.870> need<00:03:04.900> for

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
even larger so there is a dire need for

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.680 
even larger so there is a dire need for
effective<00:03:06.190> drugs<00:03:06.640> especially<00:03:07.360> in

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
effective drugs especially in

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.250 
effective drugs especially in
alleviating<00:03:08.110> anemia<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:10.299> we<00:03:10.510> started

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
alleviating anemia so we started

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.460 
alleviating anemia so we started
exploring<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:13.060> use<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.470> immunomodulatory

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
exploring the use of immunomodulatory

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.370 
exploring the use of immunomodulatory
drugs<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:16.329> first<00:03:16.540> one<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:16.870> actually

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
drugs and the first one we actually

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.640 
drugs and the first one we actually
tried<00:03:17.680> was<00:03:17.860> thalidomide<00:03:18.540> very<00:03:19.540> early<00:03:19.900> we

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
tried was thalidomide very early we

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.560 
tried was thalidomide very early we

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
pioneered the use of thalidomide

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.319 
pioneered the use of thalidomide

fda-approved pomalidomide isn't we used

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.020 
fda-approved pomalidomide isn't we used
lenalidomide<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.769> disease<00:03:54.040> after<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
thundermutt story and again we found

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.150 
thundermutt story and again we found
about<00:03:57.760> 20%<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.720> response<00:03:59.079> rate<00:03:59.350> now<00:04:00.100> the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
about 20% of response rate now the

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.300 
about 20% of response rate now the
thalidomide<00:04:01.410> given<00:04:02.410> over<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.650> long<00:04:02.890> period<00:04:03.220> of

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
time can cause peripheral neuropathy so

that's an issue lenalidomide causes

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.270 
that's an issue lenalidomide causes
milder<00:04:09.310> suppression<00:04:09.820> sometimes<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.540> causes

milder suppression sometimes it causes

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.520 
milder suppression sometimes it causes
profound<00:04:12.280> degrees<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.940> low<00:04:13.750> white<00:04:14.019> count<00:04:14.049> and

profound degrees of low white count and
low<00:04:14.890> head<00:04:15.159> count<00:04:15.580> so<00:04:16.090> we<00:04:16.419> were<00:04:16.630> always<00:04:16.810> on<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
low head count so we were always on the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.930 
low head count so we were always on the
lookout

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
lookout

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.390

for<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.269> better<00:04:18.570> immunomodulatory<00:04:19.350> drug<00:04:20.010> that

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
for a better immunomodulatory drug that

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.490 
for a better immunomodulatory drug that
does<00:04:20.549> not<00:04:20.700> have<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.120> toxicity<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.080> perhaps

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
does not have this toxicity and perhaps

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.460 
does not have this toxicity and perhaps
it<00:04:22.620> will<00:04:22.710> be<00:04:22.890> better<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:24.000> alleviating<00:04:24.600> anemia

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
it will be better in alleviating anemia

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.610 
it will be better in alleviating anemia
that's<00:04:25.980> how<00:04:26.370> we<00:04:27.180> decided<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:28.290> test

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
that's how we decided to test

that's how we decided to test
pomalidomide<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.700> we<00:04:30.570> tested<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.170> in<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.680> multi

we understand the toxicity profiles
better<00:04:54.420> so<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.260> was<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:55.620> just<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.730> design<00:04:57.180> of

better so that was a just the design of
the<00:04:57.570> study<00:04:57.840> we<00:04:58.290> were<00:05:00.230> very<00:05:01.280> impressed<00:05:02.280> by<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
the study we were very impressed by the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.610 
the study we were very impressed by the
preliminary<00:05:03.690> results<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.320> we<00:05:04.440> have<00:05:06.620> the

preliminary results that we have the

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.760 
preliminary results that we have the
first<00:05:07.860> thing<00:05:08.250> we<00:05:08.430> found<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.410> this<00:05:10.410> drug

patients<00:06:35.120> we're<00:06:35.300> at<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.630> later<00:06:35.840> stage<00:06:36.140> of

patients we're at the later stage of
their<00:06:36.440> disease<00:06:36.710> so<00:06:36.740> they<00:06:36.950> were<00:06:37.070> progressing

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
their disease so they were progressing

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.960 
their disease so they were progressing
so<00:06:37.850> they<00:06:38.030> didn't<00:06:38.270> have<00:06:38.390> time<00:06:38.720> to<00:06:39.580> to<00:06:40.580> benefit

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
so they didn't have time to to benefit

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.760 
so they didn't have time to to benefit
from<00:06:41.150> the<00:06:41.360> drug<00:06:41.600> but<00:06:42.080> so<00:06:42.170> if<00:06:42.320> you<00:06:42.440> took

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
from the drug but so if you took

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.710 
from the drug but so if you took
patients<00:06:43.280> who<00:06:43.400> had<00:06:43.640> managed<00:06:44.210> to<00:06:44.330> take<00:06:44.600> the

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
response rate with the drug alone was

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.920 
response rate with the drug alone was
almost<00:06:49.820> 40%<00:06:50.240> and<00:06:51.940> response<00:06:52.940> rate<00:06:53.150> a<00:06:53.180> low<00:06:53.600> dose

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
almost 40% and response rate a low dose

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.880 
almost 40% and response rate a low dose
of<00:06:54.140> the<00:06:54.230> drug<00:06:54.580> which<00:06:55.580> is<00:06:55.690> 0.5<00:06:56.690> milligrams<00:06:57.260> was

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
of the drug which is 0.5 milligrams was

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.560 
of the drug which is 0.5 milligrams was
a<00:06:58.100> short<00:06:58.430> course<00:06:58.760> of<00:06:58.910> prednisone<00:06:59.240> which<00:06:59.450> is

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
a short course of prednisone which is

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.240 
a short course of prednisone which is
given<00:06:59.840> only<00:06:59.990> for<00:07:00.260> the<00:07:00.350> first<00:07:00.590> three<00:07:00.830> months<00:07:01.010> in

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
given only for the first three months in

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.090 
given only for the first three months in
a<00:07:01.580> tempering<00:07:02.060> schedule<00:07:02.540> was<00:07:03.350> also<00:07:03.919> about

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
a tempering schedule was also about

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.600 
a tempering schedule was also about
forty<00:07:04.550> percent<00:07:04.760> so<00:07:05.350> we<00:07:06.350> are<00:07:06.680> happy<00:07:07.220> about<00:07:07.340> the

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
forty percent so we are happy about the

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.420 
forty percent so we are happy about the
preliminary<00:07:08.150> result<00:07:08.450> obviously<00:07:08.980> we<00:07:09.980> need<00:07:10.250> to

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
preliminary result obviously we need to

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.540 
preliminary result obviously we need to
produce<00:07:11.240> this<00:07:11.810> in<00:07:12.050> a<00:07:12.500> larger<00:07:13.040> group<00:07:13.340> of

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
produce this in a larger group of

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.260 
produce this in a larger group of
patients<00:07:14.350> and<00:07:15.350> we<00:07:15.860> were<00:07:16.010> you<00:07:16.610> know<00:07:16.640> very

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.580 
some clue as to who the drug benefits it
appears<00:07:29.030> that<00:07:29.120> those<00:07:29.480> patients<00:07:30.020> who<00:07:30.380> don't

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.590 
appears that those patients who don't

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.219 
appears that those patients who don't
have<00:07:30.740> a<00:07:30.890> big<00:07:31.340> split<00:07:31.729> or<00:07:31.970> a<00:07:32.030> very<00:07:32.780> high<00:07:32.990> white

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:33.229 
have a big split or a very high white

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:35.080 
have a big split or a very high white
card<00:07:33.500> are<00:07:33.740> the<00:07:33.860> ones<00:07:34.070> who<00:07:34.250> benefit<00:07:34.669> the<00:07:34.820> best

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.090 
card are the ones who benefit the best

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.620 
card are the ones who benefit the best
so<00:07:35.900> if<00:07:36.290> you<00:07:36.680> have<00:07:36.919> myelofibrosis<00:07:37.400> and<00:07:38.120> you

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:38.630 
so if you have myelofibrosis and you

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.590 
so if you have myelofibrosis and you
don't<00:07:38.960> have<00:07:39.280> leukocytosis<00:07:40.280> or<00:07:40.600> marked

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.600 
don't have leukocytosis or marked

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.620 
don't have leukocytosis or marked
splenomegaly<00:07:42.820> then<00:07:43.820> you<00:07:43.970> have<00:07:44.180> a<00:07:44.210> very<00:07:44.510> good

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:44.630 
splenomegaly then you have a very good

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.260 
splenomegaly then you have a very good
chance<00:07:44.810> of<00:07:45.229> responding<00:07:45.530> to<00:07:45.860> the<00:07:46.130> drug<00:07:46.400> but<00:07:47.180> the

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.270 
chance of responding to the drug but the

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.290 
chance of responding to the drug but the
response<00:07:47.630> is<00:07:47.810> only<00:07:48.050> for<00:07:48.410> anemia<00:07:49.060> one<00:07:50.060> thing

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:50.300 
response is only for anemia one thing

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.690 
response is only for anemia one thing
that<00:07:50.479> we<00:07:50.630> have<00:07:50.810> noticed<00:07:51.320> that<00:07:51.590> it<00:07:52.100> does<00:07:52.400> not

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:52.700 
that we have noticed that it does not

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.400 
that we have noticed that it does not
effect<00:07:53.330> the<00:07:53.419> spleen<00:07:53.750> one<00:07:53.960> way<00:07:54.080> or<00:07:54.200> the<00:07:54.380> other

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.410 
effect the spleen one way or the other

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.760 
effect the spleen one way or the other
so<00:07:54.890> the<00:07:55.070> key<00:07:55.250> message<00:07:55.280> is<00:07:55.880> that<00:07:56.380> there<00:07:57.380> is<00:07:57.560> now

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:57.770 
so the key message is that there is now

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.990 
so the key message is that there is now
another<00:07:58.010> drug<00:07:59.020> that<00:08:00.020> is<00:08:00.229> very<00:08:00.650> well<00:08:00.830> tolerated

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 
another drug that is very well tolerated

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.350 
another drug that is very well tolerated
and<00:08:02.000> has<00:08:02.720> a<00:08:02.750> potential<00:08:03.590> to<00:08:03.890> help<00:08:04.370> at<00:08:04.669> least<00:08:04.940> 1/3

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 
and has a potential to help at least 1/3

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.050 
and has a potential to help at least 1/3
of<00:08:05.600> patients<00:08:05.660> was<00:08:06.790> anemia<00:08:07.790> in<00:08:08.120> mild<00:08:08.479> fibrosis
