00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.670
125 gallon marineland reef tank complete.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.180
upgraded from 75 gallon reef tank to 125 reef
tank and couldn't be happier.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.390
love this new tank! more videos to come on
the upgrade process.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.000
Still have some aquascaping to do (rock setup.)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.420
A reef aquarium or reef tank is a marine aquarium
that prominently displays live corals and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.310
other marine invertebrates as well as fish
that play a role in maintaining the tropical

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
coral reef environment.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.250
A reef aquarium requires appropriately intense
lighting, turbulent water movement, and more

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.059
stable water chemistry than fish-only marine
aquaria, and careful consideration is given

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.300
to which reef animals are appropriate and
compatible with each other.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.340
A "reef ready" or simply "drilled" tank is
often used.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.730
This style of tank has holes drilled into
the rear pane allowing water to drain into

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.970
the sump or refugium.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:57.050
These drains are usually housed in an internal
overflow apparatus made of plastic or glass

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.100
which encloses a drain standpipe and a water
return line (See fig 1, a).

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:32.140
The surface water pours over the overflow,
down the standpipe (See fig 1, b), through

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.390
PVC piping, into the sump.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.649
After transiting the sump, water is pushed
by a return water pump through the second

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.890
hole and into the aquarium (See fig 1, c).

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.909
Alternatively, standard non-drilled aquariums
employ an external "hang-on" overflow that

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.909
feeds water via continuous siphon to the sump
(See fig 1 d).

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:53.909
The tanks are usually constructed from either
glass or acrylic.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:05.159
Acrylic has the advantage of optical clarity,
lightness, and ease of drilling.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:48.280
Drawbacks include a tendency to scratch easily,
bowing, and often limited access from above

00:02:48.280 --> 00:03:01.540
due to top bracing.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:28.040
Glass aquariums are heavier but harder to
scratch.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:58.750
Other materials such as epoxy-coated plywood
have been used by industrious DIYers, but

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.180
these materials are typically reserved for
the construction of larger tanks.
