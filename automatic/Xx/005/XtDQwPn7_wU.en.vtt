my<00:00:14.490> list<00:00:14.809> this<00:00:15.809> episode's<00:00:16.379> myth<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.800> not<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.130> be

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
my list this episode's myth is not to be

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.529 
my list this episode's myth is not to be
confused<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:18.000> we've<00:00:18.150> done<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
confused with one we've done in a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.720 
confused with one we've done in a
previous<00:00:18.960> episode<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.920> series<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.550> was

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
previous episode in this series that was

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.120 
previous episode in this series that was
to<00:00:20.939> find<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.080> full<00:00:22.289> tune<00:00:22.529> enchantment

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
to find out if the full tune enchantment

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.529 
to find out if the full tune enchantment
would<00:00:23.250> affect<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> drop<00:00:23.910> rate<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.330> leaves

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
would affect the drop rate of leaves

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.450 
would affect the drop rate of leaves
today<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.260> we're<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.650> doing<00:00:25.859> is

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
today what we're going to be doing is

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.400 
today what we're going to be doing is
destroying<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.150> leaves<00:00:27.359> by<00:00:27.599> hand<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.199> then

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
destroying the leaves by hand and then

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.019 
destroying the leaves by hand and then
letting<00:00:28.619> them<00:00:28.769> decay<00:00:29.070> naturally<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.670> find<00:00:29.880> out

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
letting them decay naturally to find out

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.279 
letting them decay naturally to find out
if<00:00:30.150> there's<00:00:30.300> any<00:00:30.359> difference<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> drop

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
if there's any difference with the drop

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.870 
if there's any difference with the drop
rate<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.099> scenario

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
rate in that scenario

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
rate in that scenario
so<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.600> test<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.800> one

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
so this test is going to be like the one

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.340 
so this test is going to be like the one
we<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.460> before<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.360> trees<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.870> mirrored<00:00:37.170> so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
we have before the trees are mirrored so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
we have before the trees are mirrored so
it's<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.649> even<00:00:37.829> test<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.370> evens<00:00:38.670> either<00:00:39.149> side

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it's an even test on evens either side

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.299 
it's an even test on evens either side
and<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.379> second<00:00:40.739> test<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.040> we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and the second test that we're going to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
and the second test that we're going to
be<00:00:41.430> doing<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.969> use<00:00:42.149> mcedit<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.809> remove<00:00:43.079> all

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
be doing is to use mcedit to remove all

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.720 
be doing is to use mcedit to remove all
of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> wood<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.250> watch<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of the wood here and then watch the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
of the wood here and then watch the
leaves<00:00:44.879> decay<00:00:45.329> naturally<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> first

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
leaves decay naturally but the first

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
leaves decay naturally but the first
test<00:00:46.920> I'll<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.550> around<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.059> destroying

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
test I'll be going around and destroying

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
test I'll be going around and destroying
them<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.110> hand<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:49.710> always<00:00:50.160> we're<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
them by hand so as always we're going to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
them by hand so as always we're going to
be<00:00:50.610> doing<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:51.030> time-lapse<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.110> today<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.590> get

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
be doing a time-lapse but today we get

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.900 
be doing a time-lapse but today we get
to<00:00:52.860> enjoy<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> from<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> different<00:00:53.670> perspective

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to enjoy it from a different perspective

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.150 
to enjoy it from a different perspective
because<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.079> cameraman<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
because I have my cameraman which is my

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.630 
because I have my cameraman which is my
second<00:00:56.520> computer<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.120> recording<00:00:57.899> this

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
second computer here recording this

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:55.300

[Music]

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.510 

you

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:54.100 
you
[Music]

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.960 

so<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.320> concludes<00:02:55.530> our<00:02:55.950> testing<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
so that concludes our testing and in the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.090 
so that concludes our testing and in the
second<00:02:57.330> one<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.450> did<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:57.930> did<00:02:58.200> say<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:59.070> I

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
second one I did that I did say that I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.920 
second one I did that I did say that I
would<00:02:59.220> use<00:02:59.520> mcedit<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.180> remove<00:03:00.480> all<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
would use mcedit to remove all of the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.480 
would use mcedit to remove all of the
log<00:03:01.110> blocks<00:03:01.410> well<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.370> it

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
log blocks well if you do that it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.190 
log blocks well if you do that it
doesn't<00:03:02.670> update<00:03:03.090> any<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.480> leaves<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.050> they

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
doesn't update any of the leaves so they

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.050 
doesn't update any of the leaves so they
just<00:03:04.380> stay<00:03:04.590> there<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.010> they<00:03:05.520> don't<00:03:05.670> decay<00:03:06.000> so

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
just stay there and they don't decay so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.940 
just stay there and they don't decay so
I<00:03:06.240> had<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.480> go<00:03:06.600> around<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.050> manually<00:03:07.560> remove

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
I had to go around and manually remove

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.200 
I had to go around and manually remove
the<00:03:08.100> blocks<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:08.610> otherwise<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.180> pretty

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
the blocks but otherwise it is pretty

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.110 
the blocks but otherwise it is pretty
much<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.200> same<00:03:10.440> test<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.820> go<00:03:11.940> down<00:03:12.090> here

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
much the same test so if we go down here

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
much the same test so if we go down here
and<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.540> look<00:03:12.690> at<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.080> results<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.740> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and have a look at the results on the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.130 
and have a look at the results on the
side<00:03:14.670> where<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.270> let<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.480> Leafs<00:03:15.810> decay

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
side where we let the Leafs decay

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.140 
side where we let the Leafs decay
naturally<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.800> got<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> stack<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.340> forty<00:03:17.760> seven

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
naturally we got a stack of forty seven

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.600 
naturally we got a stack of forty seven
and<00:03:18.330> twelve<00:03:18.750> apples<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.440> if<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.130> test<00:03:20.400> can

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
and twelve apples and if this test can

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.820 
and twelve apples and if this test can
hear<00:03:20.880> any<00:03:21.330> more<00:03:21.540> perfect<00:03:21.990> we<00:03:22.170> pretty<00:03:22.440> much<00:03:22.560> got

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
hear any more perfect we pretty much got

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.770 
hear any more perfect we pretty much got
the<00:03:22.950> same<00:03:23.160> results<00:03:23.580> over<00:03:23.880> here<00:03:24.060> we<00:03:24.630> got<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the same results over here we got a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.720 
the same results over here we got a
stack<00:03:25.080> and<00:03:25.260> forty-four<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:25.860> twelve<00:03:26.280> apples

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
stack and forty-four and twelve apples

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.130 
stack and forty-four and twelve apples
again<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> think<00:03:27.660> that's<00:03:27.959> pretty

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
again so I think that's pretty

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.660 
again so I think that's pretty
conclusive<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.860> there's<00:03:29.190> no<00:03:29.310> difference

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
conclusive that there's no difference

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.040 
conclusive that there's no difference
between<00:03:29.730> letting<00:03:30.209> these<00:03:30.390> leaves<00:03:30.660> decay

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
between letting these leaves decay

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.960 
between letting these leaves decay
naturally<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.770> breaking<00:03:32.520> them<00:03:32.700> with<00:03:32.820> your

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
naturally and breaking them with your

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.410 
naturally and breaking them with your
fists

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
fists

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.180 
fists

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
and of course I go Ryan has checked this

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.010 
and of course I go Ryan has checked this
against<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.670> game<00:03:35.850> code<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.330> can<00:03:36.600> confirm

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
against the game code so I can confirm

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.470 
against the game code so I can confirm
that<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.010> case<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:38.850> as<00:03:39.030> always<00:03:39.180> if<00:03:39.450> you
