00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
orchestrating that before but he would

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.250

Jay<00:03:23.310> Cutler<00:03:23.700> coming<00:03:24.030> back<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.570> thought<00:03:25.440> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
Jay Cutler coming back I thought I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.320

them<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.800> thought<00:03:28.980> he<00:03:29.130> gave<00:03:29.310> them<00:03:29.459> a

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
them just I thought he gave them a

better chance Cutler ended up looking
bad<00:03:31.980> early<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.730> he<00:03:32.880> looked<00:03:33.090> good<00:03:33.239> later<00:03:33.540> but

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
bad early and he looked good later but

NFC<00:04:10.440> North<00:04:10.560> do<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.799> think<00:04:10.980> Aaron<00:04:11.160> Rodgers

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
NFC North do you think Aaron Rodgers

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.100 
NFC North do you think Aaron Rodgers
plays<00:04:11.730> against<00:04:12.090> Pittsburgh<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.540> think<00:04:12.840> Aaron

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
plays against Pittsburgh I think Aaron

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.229 
plays against Pittsburgh I think Aaron
Rodgers<00:04:13.470> definitely<00:04:13.920> plays<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.610> I<00:04:14.940> think

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
Rodgers definitely plays and I think

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.729 
Rodgers definitely plays and I think
they<00:04:15.390> have<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> great<00:04:15.930> start<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.350> win<00:04:16.530> if

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
they have a great start to win if

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.460 
they have a great start to win if

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
Detroit doesn't win tonight I think we

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.289

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
Romo a good quarterback a great

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.110 
Romo a good quarterback a great
quarterback<00:07:01.340> or<00:07:01.610> an<00:07:01.670> average<00:07:01.790> quarterback

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
quarterback or an average quarterback

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.730 
quarterback or an average quarterback
actually<00:07:02.510> good<00:07:02.720> quarterback<00:07:03.170> is<00:07:03.350> winning

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
actually good quarterback is winning

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.620 
actually good quarterback is winning
okay<00:07:04.190> average<00:07:04.490> second<00:07:04.820> I<00:07:04.880> think<00:07:05.120> he's<00:07:05.300> good

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
okay average second I think he's good

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.980 
okay average second I think he's good
attention<00:07:06.580> I<00:07:07.580> think<00:07:07.910> he's<00:07:08.030> good<00:07:08.300> potential<00:07:08.930> to

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
attention I think he's good potential to

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.410 
attention I think he's good potential to
be<00:07:09.110> great<00:07:09.290> but<00:07:09.890> he<00:07:10.100> prevents<00:07:10.850> himself<00:07:11.210> from

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:11.420 
be great but he prevents himself from

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.300 
be great but he prevents himself from
being<00:07:11.630> great<00:07:11.750> but<00:07:12.380> I<00:07:12.410> don't<00:07:12.680> put<00:07:12.920> all<00:07:13.100> of<00:07:13.130> this

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
being great but I don't put all of this

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.300 
being great but I don't put all of this
on<00:07:13.550> him<00:07:13.900> but<00:07:14.900> sometimes<00:07:15.560> when<00:07:15.740> your<00:07:15.860> team<00:07:16.130> is

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
on him but sometimes when your team is

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.730 
on him but sometimes when your team is
bad<00:07:16.550> your<00:07:17.390> quarterback<00:07:17.900> can<00:07:18.170> be<00:07:18.290> great<00:07:18.530> and

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
bad your quarterback can be great and

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.760 
bad your quarterback can be great and
that's<00:07:19.190> the<00:07:19.400> difference<00:07:19.580> I<00:07:20.230> keep<00:07:21.230> waiting<00:07:21.440> for

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
that's the difference I keep waiting for

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.160 
that's the difference I keep waiting for
Tony<00:07:21.950> to<00:07:22.550> be<00:07:22.670> great<00:07:22.880> in<00:07:23.000> December<00:07:23.450> and<00:07:23.630> maybe

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.170 
Tony to be great in December and maybe

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.060 
Tony to be great in December and maybe
be<00:07:24.800> great<00:07:25.040> in<00:07:25.190> January<00:07:25.670> but<00:07:26.500> it's<00:07:27.500> not<00:07:27.710> all<00:07:27.890> on

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
be great in January but it's not all on

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.610 
be great in January but it's not all on
him<00:07:28.280> that's<00:07:28.460> a<00:07:28.580> bad<00:07:28.760> defense<00:07:29.210> but<00:07:29.420> 26<00:07:30.020> to<00:07:30.170> 3<00:07:30.350> at

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620 
him that's a bad defense but 26 to 3 at

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.060 
him that's a bad defense but 26 to 3 at
home<00:07:31.100> against<00:07:31.730> a<00:07:31.850> backup<00:07:32.300> quarterback

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
home against a backup quarterback

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.620 
home against a backup quarterback
there's<00:07:34.070> no<00:07:34.190> excuse<00:07:34.550> for<00:07:34.580> that<00:07:34.760> no<00:07:35.030> and<00:07:35.300> then

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630 
there's no excuse for that no and then

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.880 
there's no excuse for that no and then
you<00:07:35.780> can't<00:07:35.990> have<00:07:36.170> your<00:07:36.320> star<00:07:36.650> wide<00:07:36.860> receiver

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:36.890 
you can't have your star wide receiver

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.760 
you can't have your star wide receiver
leave<00:07:37.580> the<00:07:37.760> game<00:07:38.270> before<00:07:38.960> it's<00:07:39.080> over<00:07:39.200> that's

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770 
leave the game before it's over that's

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.680 
leave the game before it's over that's
another<00:07:40.130> symptom<00:07:40.580> of<00:07:40.820> what's<00:07:41.060> wrong<00:07:41.330> there

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:41.690
