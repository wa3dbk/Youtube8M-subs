you<00:00:43.500> buy<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.829> index<00:00:44.190> cards<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> buy

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you buy your index cards is that you buy

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.680 
you buy your index cards is that you buy
unlined<00:00:45.809> index<00:00:46.590> cards<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.090> ink<00:00:48.360> on

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
unlined index cards because the ink on

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.650 
unlined index cards because the ink on
the<00:00:48.809> index<00:00:49.289> card<00:00:49.710> could<00:00:50.430> come<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the index card could come off on the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.020 
the index card could come off on the
clay<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.590> matters<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
clay and if it matters to you on the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.240 
clay and if it matters to you on the
back<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> clay<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.930> don't<00:00:55.110> want<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
back of the clay you don't want that so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.110 
back of the clay you don't want that so
what<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:58.020> stamp<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> piece<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> clay

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
what I do is I stamp on a piece of clay

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.689 
what I do is I stamp on a piece of clay
and<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.480> am<00:01:00.870> sorry<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.770> stamped<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.430> white

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and I am sorry that I stamped on white

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
and I am sorry that I stamped on white
clay<00:01:03.059> cuz<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.170> contrast<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.100> too

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
clay cuz I see the contrast is not too

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
clay cuz I see the contrast is not too
much<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.600> stamping<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> piece<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
much here but I'm stamping on a piece of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.460 
much here but I'm stamping on a piece of
white<00:01:08.070> clay<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.409> my

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
white clay and then I have it on my

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
white clay and then I have it on my
index<00:01:10.979> card<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> usually<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.170> do

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
index card and usually when I do

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
index card and usually when I do
projects<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.310> work<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.820> tile<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> baking

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
projects I work on a tile or a baking

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.490 
projects I work on a tile or a baking
sheet<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.970> find<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.290> cut

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
sheet but I find that when I have to cut

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.420 
sheet but I find that when I have to cut
something<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.180> ease<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.799> moving<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
something out the ease of moving the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.660 
something out the ease of moving the
index<00:01:24.360> card<00:01:24.750> around<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:26.070> helps<00:01:26.430> me<00:01:26.490> out

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
index card around really helps me out

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
index card around really helps me out
and<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:29.159> usually<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.329> trim<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and so I just usually I trim out a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
and so I just usually I trim out a
little<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:34.430> no<00:01:35.430> particular<00:01:35.970> reason<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
little bit by no particular reason just

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
little bit by no particular reason just
on<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> big<00:01:37.770> pieces<00:01:38.040> away

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
on you know to get the big pieces away

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
on you know to get the big pieces away
but<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:39.509> i<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:44.149> but<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.479> how<00:01:45.659> I'm<00:01:45.810> able

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
but all i do is but you see how I'm able

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.420 
but all i do is but you see how I'm able
to<00:01:46.380> move<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.340> card<00:01:48.270> around<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.979> makes

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
to move the card around it just makes

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
to move the card around it just makes
life<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.119> much<00:01:51.180> easier<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:54.590> here's<00:01:55.590> another

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
life so much easier and here's another

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.700 
life so much easier and here's another
thing<00:01:56.040> i've<00:01:56.430> used<00:01:56.640> stays<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.390> ink<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.110> my

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
thing i've used stays on ink on my

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.550 
thing i've used stays on ink on my
polymer<00:01:59.280> clay<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.990> dries<00:02:01.259> very

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
polymer clay and so it dries very

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.800 
polymer clay and so it dries very
quickly<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.390> don't<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
quickly and it's there you don't have to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590 
quickly and it's there you don't have to
heat<00:02:04.020> set<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:04.619> away<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.340> once<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.390> make

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
heat set it right away and once I make

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.479 
heat set it right away and once I make
the<00:02:06.750> cut<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.259> usually<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:07.770> around<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.310> my

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
the cut I usually go around with my

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.840 
the cut I usually go around with my
finger<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.270> soften<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.259> cut

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
finger just to soften the cut

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.990 
finger just to soften the cut
and<00:02:11.180> have<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.750> really<00:02:12.110> dry<00:02:12.350> there<00:02:12.700> anyway<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.760> I
