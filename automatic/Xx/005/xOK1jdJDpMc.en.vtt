00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
sure that it was trimmed out right but I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.540 
sure that it was trimmed out right but I
never<00:00:27.840> actually<00:00:28.199> flown<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.369> myself

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
never actually flown it by myself

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.759

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
months or so I've been practicing on

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.540 
months or so I've been practicing on
real<00:00:55.860> flight<00:00:57.050> for<00:00:58.050> point<00:00:58.350> five<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.370> we're

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
real flight for point five so we're

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.889 
real flight for point five so we're
going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.329> simulator

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
going to see if all that simulator

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
going to see if all that simulator
training<00:01:01.109> actually<00:01:01.649> paid<00:01:01.859> off<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> whether<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
training actually paid off and whether I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.719 
training actually paid off and whether I
can<00:01:02.760> fly<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.030> plane<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> landed<00:01:04.339> by<00:01:05.339> myself

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
can fly this plane and landed by myself

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.160 
can fly this plane and landed by myself
and<00:01:05.880> no<00:01:06.000> help<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.530> we'll<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.740> how<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> goes

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
and no help and we'll see how it goes

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:37.440 
and no help and we'll see how it goes
and<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> picture<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> plane

I guess that simulator flight training
paid<00:06:35.680> off
