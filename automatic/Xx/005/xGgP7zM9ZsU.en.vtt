a<00:00:35.010> half<00:00:35.040> grams<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.610> salt<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.719> lot<00:00:37.559> like

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
a half grams of salt which is a lot like

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.799 
a half grams of salt which is a lot like
