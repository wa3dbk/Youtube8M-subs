00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.509 

the<00:00:09.420> economy<00:00:09.780> itself<00:00:10.080> first<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.099> all<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.309> star

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the economy itself first of all in star

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.070 
the economy itself first of all in star
citizen<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.030> completely<00:00:12.420> dynamic<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
citizen is completely dynamic so the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.150 
citizen is completely dynamic so the
player's<00:00:13.320> actions<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.070> be

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
player's actions are going to be

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.490 
player's actions are going to be
affecting<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.089> supply<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.540> demand<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
affecting the supply and demand and the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
affecting the supply and demand and the
prices<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.640> lot<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.270> missions<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.750> are

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
prices so a lot of the missions that are

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.480 
prices so a lot of the missions that are
generated<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.439> players<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> take<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.220> even<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
generated for players to take or even a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.179 
generated for players to take or even a
I<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.289> created<00:00:23.010> by<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I to go and do are created by the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.189 
I to go and do are created by the
economy<00:00:23.760> system<00:00:24.060> itself<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.869> give<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.109> an

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
economy system itself to give you an

economy system itself to give you an
example<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> weapons

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
example you know if you have a weapons

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.450 
example you know if you have a weapons
factory<00:00:27.900> sitting<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> planet<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
factory sitting on a planet and it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.120 
factory sitting on a planet and it
requires<00:00:29.820> three<00:00:30.420> tons<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:31.050> metal<00:00:31.380> alloy<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
requires three tons of metal alloy and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.520 
requires three tons of metal alloy and
one<00:00:32.880> ton<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> high<00:00:33.480> explosive<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.230> ton<00:00:34.440> of

game<00:00:37.140> turn<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.770> factory<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:39.180> create<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
game turn that factory will create a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.139 
game turn that factory will create a
mission<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:41.190> mission<00:00:41.399> boards<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:41.969> will

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
mission on mission boards which will

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.369 
mission on mission boards which will
have<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> system<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.230> will

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
have like in the system and that will

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.440 
have like in the system and that will
propagate<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.040> other<00:00:44.550> systems<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.210> sort<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
propagate to other systems that sort of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
propagate to other systems that sort of
the<00:00:45.600> speed<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.050> communication<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> stars

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the speed of communication in the stars

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
the speed of communication in the stars
in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> universe<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.180> will<00:00:48.270> say<00:00:48.390> hey<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
in the universe and it will say hey you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.069 
in the universe and it will say hey you
know<00:00:48.809> look<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.500> three<00:00:50.219> tons<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:51.079> steel

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
know look I need three tons of steel

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.750 
know look I need three tons of steel
alloy<00:00:52.350> 110<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> high<00:00:52.949> explosive<00:00:53.370> 1<00:00:53.489> ton<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
alloy 110 of high explosive 1 ton of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.060 
alloy 110 of high explosive 1 ton of
electronics<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.379> who<00:00:55.379> wants<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> take<00:00:55.860> them

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
electronics and who wants to take them

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.069 
electronics and who wants to take them
and<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.699> case<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.180> player<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.899> look

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and so in that case a player could look

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.209 
and so in that case a player could look
at<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> mission<00:00:58.500> Bongo<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> there's<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
at the mission Bongo that there's a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.380 
at the mission Bongo that there's a
mission<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.550> take<00:00:59.670> three<00:00:59.879> toes<00:01:00.030> okay<00:01:00.180> I'll

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
mission to take three toes okay I'll

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.959 
mission to take three toes okay I'll
take<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.899> fly<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> alloy<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> if

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
take it and fly in with the alloy and if

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
take it and fly in with the alloy and if
the<00:01:03.149> player<00:01:03.359> doesn't<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:03.899> A<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> will

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the player doesn't do it an A I will

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
the player doesn't do it an A I will
take<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.040> fly<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.339> stuff<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.939> along

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
take it and fly the stuff in and along

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
take it and fly the stuff in and along
the<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.350> player<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.920> AI<00:01:08.130> get

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the way if that player or the AI get

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.880 
the way if that player or the AI get
attacked<00:01:08.700> by<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.880> pirate<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.560> they<00:01:10.560> don't<00:01:10.680> make

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
attacked by a pirate and they don't make

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
attacked by a pirate and they don't make
it<00:01:11.040> through<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.670> goods<00:01:12.330> aren't<00:01:12.600> getting

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it through then the goods aren't getting

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
it through then the goods aren't getting
to<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> factory<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> factory<00:01:14.400> doesn't<00:01:14.549> have

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
to the factory the factory doesn't have

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
to the factory the factory doesn't have
the<00:01:14.850> materials<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> needs<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> make<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the materials it needs to make the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
the materials it needs to make the
missiles<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.740> can't<00:01:16.950> produce<00:01:17.070> missiles

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
missiles so it can't produce missiles

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.800 
missiles so it can't produce missiles
out<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:17.970> people<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.299> buying<00:01:18.450> missiles

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
out so now if people are buying missiles

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.749 
out so now if people are buying missiles
in<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.020> system<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.920> inventory<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.549> show

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
in that system the inventory on the show

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.010 
in that system the inventory on the show
floor<00:01:20.970> will<00:01:21.240> dwindle<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.780> won't<00:01:21.930> have

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
floor will dwindle and they won't have

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.390 
floor will dwindle and they won't have
any<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.229> missiles<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:23.009> mean<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
any more missiles which will mean the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
any more missiles which will mean the
supplies<00:01:23.939> low<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:24.659> don't<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
supplies low so they don't you know the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
supplies low so they don't you know the
demands<00:01:25.530> high<00:01:25.979> prices<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.729> probably<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.150> up

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
demands high prices will probably go up

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.999 
demands high prices will probably go up
now<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.750> factory<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.409> probably<00:01:28.680> say<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
now that factory will probably say this

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.160 
now that factory will probably say this
pirate<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> pirate<00:01:29.909> problem<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:31.079> know

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
pirate I'm a pirate problem I you know

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.020 
pirate I'm a pirate problem I you know
getting<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:31.560> raw<00:01:31.770> materials<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.939> will

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
getting my raw materials so it will

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.460 
getting my raw materials so it will
create<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> mission<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> mercenaries

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
create a mission with the mercenaries

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
trader could affect what's happening in

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.260 
trader could affect what's happening in
the<00:01:49.770> economy<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.759> Pirates<00:01:51.119> could

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the economy you know the Pirates could

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.899 
the economy you know the Pirates could
be<00:01:51.450> strangling<00:01:52.439> supplied<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.280> planets<00:01:53.670> or

be strangling supplied to planets or

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
be strangling supplied to planets or
other<00:01:54.240> people<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.630> blockading<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.409> if

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
other people be blockading and then if

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 
other people be blockading and then if
supplies<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.979> getting<00:01:56.219> through<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> planet

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
supplies on getting through that planet

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
supplies on getting through that planet
will<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.689> creating<00:01:58.170> missions<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.860> get

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
will be creating missions to get

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
will be creating missions to get
supplies<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.850> get<00:01:59.969> people<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.479> open<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
supplies or get people to open the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
supplies or get people to open the
blockade<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.340> basically<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> economy<00:02:03.479> itself

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
blockade so basically the economy itself

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.560 
blockade so basically the economy itself
is<00:02:04.049> generating<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> lot<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> action

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
is generating a lot of the action

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.180 
is generating a lot of the action
and<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.050> missions<00:02:06.320> are<00:02:06.440> going<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.010> by<00:02:07.159> the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
and the missions are going on and by the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.620 
and the missions are going on and by the
way<00:02:07.310> in<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.760> combat<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:08.360> you're<00:02:08.479> having

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
way in that combat that you're having

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.450 
way in that combat that you're having
like<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.470> pirate<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.009> attacking<00:02:10.399> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
like the pirate that is attacking the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.100 
like the pirate that is attacking the
merchant<00:02:10.789> ship<00:02:10.940> while<00:02:11.450> missiles<00:02:11.780> are<00:02:11.900> getting

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
merchant ship while missiles are getting

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.690 
merchant ship while missiles are getting
fired<00:02:12.380> ships<00:02:12.800> are<00:02:12.950> getting<00:02:13.130> blown<00:02:13.310> up<00:02:13.340> well

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
fired ships are getting blown up well

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.660 
fired ships are getting blown up well
that's<00:02:14.450> demand<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> economy<00:02:15.890> side<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.490> you

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
that's demand on the economy side so you

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.970 
that's demand on the economy side so you
know<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.690> means<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:18.080> more<00:02:18.470> missiles<00:02:18.830> will

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
know that means that more missiles will

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.290 
know that means that more missiles will
have<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.160> be<00:02:19.250> replenished<00:02:19.760> or<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.910> ship<00:02:20.060> has<00:02:20.209> to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
have to be replenished or a ship has to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.210 
have to be replenished or a ship has to
be<00:02:20.360> replying<00:02:20.630> show<00:02:20.810> there's<00:02:21.230> factory<00:02:22.010> nodes

on planets making the ships and so at

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.110 
on planets making the ships and so at
all<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.800> kind<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.100> balance<00:02:25.370> hopefully<00:02:25.790> from

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
all is kind of balance hopefully from

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.210 
all is kind of balance hopefully from
that<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.630> sort<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.110> how<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.800> economy

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
that you can sort of see how the economy

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.860 
that you can sort of see how the economy
and<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:28.610> fact<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.120> dynamic<00:02:29.540> is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and the fact that it's dynamic is

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.570 
and the fact that it's dynamic is
generating<00:02:30.500> missions<00:02:30.800> for<00:02:30.980> other<00:02:31.100> players<00:02:31.340> of
