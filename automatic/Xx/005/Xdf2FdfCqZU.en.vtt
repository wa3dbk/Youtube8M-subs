00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 I would be asked once , too 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.330
 on this topic to the acids and 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.349
 Bases react well to im 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.000
 general a salt and water me 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.930
 I already had another video 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.430
 Let's talk about what if I am 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.060
 metal-bound acid on it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.400
 to let 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 then it generally reacts too 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.829
 So, for example, an expensive responds too 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.410
 responds to the channel Hochrhein 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:42.379
 it reacts to a salt 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.379
 This metal is an expensive rest 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.039
 rest and well because the poor at the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 army hydrogen here in the acid 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.149
 Inside is then here is hydrogen in the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.579
 generally so at least hcl to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:06.780
 For example, just one hydrogen round 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:10.110
 acid rest that works in this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.450
 case so that this acid can be with 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.970
 the metal connects and that the rest 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.670
 Hydrogen may end up molecular 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.430
 in general so now have it like that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.930
 that you can not say 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.369
 metal and acid but now we say 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.259
 times have a base, a base that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.150
 but is generally made 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.409
 these are now that we are in the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.220
 Inorganic chemistry from a metal 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.829
 and a group so oxygen 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 Hydrogen group H group now again 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.840
 the servers are the same 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:53.369
 he also goes to the salt and that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:57.980
 metal and metal join again 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.190
 west and 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:05.560
 from the rest and the hydrogen ahead 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.869
 the acid consists of water 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.560
 and this water we write 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.970
 Of course, then let's go here 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 I'm pretty much in everything 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.200
 so if i just metal ours 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920
 let react produces a salt and 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.910
 Hydrogen why because the acid is out 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.190
 consists of hydrogen ions and one 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.510
 acid rest I do not want it concrete 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.520
 to respond to it then arises so and at 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.560
 The base is metal so that the outside 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.880
 and a group emerges and the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.480
 hydrogen from the acid 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.520
 that fits perfectly together ha ha ha 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.020
 you can say two ooo and then stay 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.380
 the left I do that sometimes fast one 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.920
 concrete example 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.860
 and I thought about it for example 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.950
 calcium hydroxyl hydroxyl are oxidized 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.030
 generally only once negative 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.710
 loaded so - once negative and 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.560
 Calcium million this twice 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.800
 to arrive positively so that I say 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.540
 got to 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.250
 okay, I have to cling to the group 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.870
 Write twice this must be specified when 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.490
 so now we leave a little bit again 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.140
 place with it will compensate if so 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.220
 So , 223 can be a lousy one 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.370
 Lobbyist carbon dioxide is passed in the water 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.070
 so you could say so cheeky so 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.580
 carbonic acid and then it arises 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.680
 calcium carbonate so cold ca co 3 now 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.930
 just look if the thing is here two 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.880
 times positively charged because that's two 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.650
 Hydrogen ions are positive 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.080
 loaded then this has to be twice - 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.890
 if calcium but twice positive 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.870
 one fits an ideal fits the one fits 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.459
 ideal acid of twice negative 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.370
 loading seen towards the outside 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.850
 Ideally plus and now they said 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.130
 like here because I base and yes 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.250
 React acid now in 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.060
 special in the water why fits all 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.680
 good together 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.290
 Now we have to look but if that 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:07.330
 right here I have it in here 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:10.810
 twice plus 2 xh 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:15.750
 now I have 2 xh in here if 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.019
 that does not match this and that 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.150
 ideal 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.120
 that turns to water but how much I do 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.070
 I have to have another one 22 times 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.630
 prescribe now I look again 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.830
 calcium itself agrees about 23 then votes 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.110
 Can I then let it go? 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.710
 balanced then i can studio metro 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.730
 speak 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 It often happens here that I still have it 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.440
 the water must take two times the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.760
 often happens but is the last 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.280
 I have an acid here 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.450
 another example is simple 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.640
 For example, although increased pressure and potassium 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.410
 I watch with nitric acid 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.080
 react hn3 then then will be fine 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.040
 By the way, that's one more km3 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.650
 very strong if you are the gate calli 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.590
 Salpeter officer early on the skis 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.330
 powder and as we look at times 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.710
 there is something to balance 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.090
 I can do that now without that 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.030
 to write down sang oh + h wonderful 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.400
 fits together ideally 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.800
 that will be too hard 2 and that's what I need 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.540
 so here just not so different 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.790
 but I can write one 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.740
 Another example I take again 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.700
 and I'll do that with sulfuric acid 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.040
 react 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.160
 Although is here then is not 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.460
 happen again as just two per 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.550
 4 why it once positively charged 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.740
 I already see this potassium ion here 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.720
 if the two are positive this one has to 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.350
 This acid shaves negative twice 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.690
 were loaded 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.200
 Consequently, I have to write two so 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.919
 plus h2o but now pay attention 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.870
 has to look a damn I have here 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.790
 two potassium ions if mold second 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.770
 At the same time, I have this in front of the scribe 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.900
 yes true Viennese art bracket now than when 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.350
 I'll say the whole expression 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.790
 a little twice, here the 200th 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.480
 then adjusts nothing before 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.390
 as I said that everything is a bit hurry 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.860
 namely still fast sodium hydroxide and 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.470
 Let that react again but that 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.980
 remembers very strongly with the metal 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.720
 history so the video is already there 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.010
 take a look then arises here 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.690
 sodium chloride, that's what we already have 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:37.300
 thought plus but it will be fine 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:42.200
 if not nice if 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:45.050
 sodium and chloride come together 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.170
 arises nacl who is left one still 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.730
 it looks like that again h &amp; h that suits 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.560
 ideal h2o 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.180
 I do not have to compensate anymore and so 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.590
 it always happens again and again 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.750
 Again I can do that with organic 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.950
 Otherwise, acids would do that too 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.690
 I have to do that now 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.340
 because of the short now easy 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.010
 So I hope that has finished 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.660
 helped and wish a lot of fun not 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.050
 much fun club all the best in the 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.050
 job
