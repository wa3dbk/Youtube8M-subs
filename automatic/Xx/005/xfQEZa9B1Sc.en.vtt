00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
our burger now nobody's ever invented a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.590 
our burger now nobody's ever invented a
chicken<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.800> will<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.219> perfect<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.329> cut

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
chicken that will be perfect when we cut

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.869 
chicken that will be perfect when we cut
it<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> exactly<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.610> want

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it and have it exactly the way we want

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.569 
it and have it exactly the way we want
so<00:00:45.270> let's<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> best<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.860> let's<00:00:47.309> just

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so let's do the best we can let's just

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
so let's do the best we can let's just
start<00:00:48.000> by<00:00:48.059> slicing<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
start by slicing it like this and now I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.959 
start by slicing it like this and now I
want<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> slice<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.579> down<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> middle

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
want you to slice it down the middle

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
want you to slice it down the middle
because<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.629> need<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> make<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.440> bit

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
because we need to make it a little bit

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
because we need to make it a little bit
thinner<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.789> fit<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.690> button<00:00:55.050> now

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
thinner so it can fit on the button now

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.170 
thinner so it can fit on the button now
be<00:00:55.350> very<00:00:55.559> careful<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.059> be

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
be very careful here because this can be

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
be very careful here because this can be
a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.420> bit<00:00:57.690> tricky<00:00:58.170> keep<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.649> eyes<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.829> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
a little bit tricky keep your eyes on it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
a little bit tricky keep your eyes on it
now<00:00:59.489> let's<00:01:00.300> slice<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.780> right<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> middle

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
now let's slice it right down the middle

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.729 
now let's slice it right down the middle
here<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:01.980> guess<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:04.199> two

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
here and guess what we now have two

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.190 
here and guess what we now have two
portions<00:01:05.280> now<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.510> want<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.020> take
