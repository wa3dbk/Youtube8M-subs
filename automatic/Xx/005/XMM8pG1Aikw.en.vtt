Catwoman<00:01:55.630> but<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:55.840> think<00:01:56.229> there's<00:01:56.410> got<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.709> be

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
Catwoman but I think there's got to be

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.469 
Catwoman but I think there's got to be
some<00:01:57.100> sort<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.520> hidden<00:01:57.819> villain<00:01:58.240> that's<00:01:58.390> gonna

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
some sort of hidden villain that's gonna

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.020 
some sort of hidden villain that's gonna
pop<00:01:58.810> up<00:01:58.840> at<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.259> end<00:01:59.649> okay<00:02:00.160> maybe<00:02:00.429> has

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
pop up at the end okay maybe has

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.969

something<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.420> do<00:02:01.539> with<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.170> first<00:02:02.500> one<00:02:02.709> I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
something to do with the first one I

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.889 
something to do with the first one I
think<00:02:03.429> Liam<00:02:03.700> Neeson's<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.330> this<00:02:04.479> film<00:02:04.780> but

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
think Liam Neeson's in this film but

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.230 
think Liam Neeson's in this film but
it's<00:02:05.050> only<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.410> flashback<00:02:06.069> because<00:02:06.099> in<00:02:06.849> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
it's only in flashback because in the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.820 
it's only in flashback because in the
first<00:02:07.420> batman<00:02:07.929> film<00:02:08.229> he<00:02:08.410> talks<00:02:08.679> about

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
death ray or lives on my theory is that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.770

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
good point that's not a theory no one

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.930 
good point that's not a theory no one

Superman yet universe this is where it
gets<00:04:09.239> really<00:04:09.509> confusing<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:10.439> the<00:04:10.560> Superman

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
gets really confusing in the Superman

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.949 
gets really confusing in the Superman
version<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.790> Nightwing<00:04:12.299> he's<00:04:12.659> Kryptonian

like<00:04:13.709> Superman<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.819> that<00:04:14.970> means<00:04:15.239> he's<00:04:15.659> alien

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
like Superman so that means he's alien

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.860 
like Superman so that means he's alien
so<00:04:16.470> how<00:04:16.680> they<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.669> really<00:04:18.209> really<00:04:18.479> hard<00:04:18.659> to

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
so how they it's really really hard to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.749 
so how they it's really really hard to
try<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.859> are<00:04:20.039> they<00:04:20.159> gonna<00:04:20.280> have<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.519> change

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
there's definitely had this in mind long

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.790 
there's definitely had this in mind long
time<00:05:01.610> ago<00:05:01.640> to<00:05:01.970> get<00:05:02.300> nolan<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.020> on<00:05:03.200> both<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.500> the

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
time ago to get nolan and on both of the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.410 
time ago to get nolan and on both of the

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
franchise's and actually put them

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.230 
franchise's and actually put them
together<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.960> would<00:05:06.230> be<00:05:06.350> very<00:05:06.380> surprised

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
Nightwing is the perfect character

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.470 
Nightwing is the perfect character
because<00:05:16.130> they<00:05:16.310> can<00:05:16.490> actually<00:05:16.790> do<00:05:16.940> Nightwing

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
in on that and another earlier theory

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.710 
in on that and another earlier theory
that<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:22.670> liked<00:05:22.970> was<00:05:23.180> that<00:05:23.240> Joseph
