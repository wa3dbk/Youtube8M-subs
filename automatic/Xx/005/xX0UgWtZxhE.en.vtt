00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.800 
so we have seen that the Formica roofer
ants<00:07:04.100> from<00:07:04.370> Iran<00:07:04.910> to<00:07:04.940> hold<00:07:05.330> the<00:07:05.479> village

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.810 
ants from Iran to hold the village

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.290 
ants from Iran to hold the village
prefer<00:07:06.620> to<00:07:06.949> refer<00:07:07.250> that<00:07:07.550> by<00:07:07.850> creating

prefer to refer that by creating

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.050 
prefer to refer that by creating
daughter<00:07:08.840> nests<00:07:09.560> only<00:07:10.250> the<00:07:10.610> most<00:07:10.790> powerful

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
daughter nests only the most powerful

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.659 
daughter nests only the most powerful
nests<00:07:11.540> can<00:07:12.020> afford<00:07:12.380> to<00:07:12.620> host<00:07:12.860> a<00:07:13.040> mating<00:07:13.400> flight

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
nests can afford to host a mating flight

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:17.379 
nests can afford to host a mating flight
but<00:07:14.300> even<00:07:14.570> they<00:07:14.750> do<00:07:15.139> it<00:07:15.260> only<00:07:15.470> to<00:07:16.460> increase<00:07:16.880> the

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
but even they do it only to increase the

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.570 
but even they do it only to increase the
number<00:07:17.750> of<00:07:17.780> Queens<00:07:18.650> in<00:07:18.949> the<00:07:19.160> nest

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:19.580 
number of Queens in the nest

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.480 
number of Queens in the nest
single<00:07:20.330> Queens<00:07:20.630> are<00:07:20.900> ill<00:07:21.199> adapted<00:07:21.860> for

single Queens are ill adapted for

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.840 
single Queens are ill adapted for
survival<00:07:23.180> in<00:07:23.479> our<00:07:23.750> harsh<00:07:24.139> climate<00:07:24.830> we<00:07:25.460> haven't

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
survival in our harsh climate we haven't

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.060 
survival in our harsh climate we haven't
managed<00:07:26.270> to<00:07:26.330> create<00:07:26.660> a<00:07:26.720> new<00:07:27.080> ant<00:07:27.320> nest<00:07:27.680> only

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
managed to create a new ant nest only

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.150 
managed to create a new ant nest only
from<00:07:28.699> one<00:07:28.940> queen<00:07:29.270> but<00:07:30.020> next<00:07:30.290> time<00:07:30.590> we<00:07:30.770> will<00:07:30.800> try

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 
from one queen but next time we will try

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.340 
from one queen but next time we will try
another<00:07:31.520> way<00:07:31.790> of<00:07:31.910> creating<00:07:32.060> a<00:07:32.419> new<00:07:32.449> nest<00:07:32.840> and

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350 
another way of creating a new nest and

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.409 
another way of creating a new nest and
this<00:07:33.560> time<00:07:33.830> I'm<00:07:34.100> sure<00:07:34.430> we<00:07:34.610> will<00:07:34.729> succeed<00:07:35.030> in

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:35.419 
this time I'm sure we will succeed in

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:37.600 
this time I'm sure we will succeed in
spreading<00:07:35.780> the<00:07:36.020> Formica<00:07:36.470> roof<00:07:36.590> ants<00:07:37.010> on<00:07:37.160> the

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610 
spreading the Formica roof ants on the

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.680 
spreading the Formica roof ants on the
