like this metallic silver color to it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.790 
like this metallic silver color to it
it's<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.480> really<00:02:31.959> great<00:02:32.170> look<00:02:32.379> for<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> figure

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
it's a really great look for the figure

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.210 
it's a really great look for the figure
overall<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.440> flipping<00:02:35.770> over<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
overall so flipping over to the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.850 
overall so flipping over to the
xenomorph<00:02:36.610> soldier<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.990> sculpt<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.500> pretty

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
xenomorph soldier the sculpt is pretty

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.530 
xenomorph soldier the sculpt is pretty
much<00:02:39.010> exactly<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.580> same<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.150> guy<00:02:40.330> the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
much exactly the same on this guy the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.670 
much exactly the same on this guy the
body<00:02:40.690> seems<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.200> be<00:02:41.290> this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
body seems to be this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.770 
body seems to be this
same<00:02:41.980> scope<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.549> we<00:02:42.579> saw<00:02:42.879> on<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.269> lurker

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
same scope that we saw on the lurker

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.330 
same scope that we saw on the lurker
however<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.409> paintjob<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:45.040> slightly

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
however the paintjob is slightly

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.339 
however the paintjob is slightly
different<00:02:45.849> he<00:02:46.299> still<00:02:46.540> has<00:02:46.659> that<00:02:46.780> nice<00:02:46.930> glossy

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
different he still has that nice glossy

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.170 
different he still has that nice glossy
look<00:02:47.739> but<00:02:47.950> he's<00:02:48.069> also<00:02:48.250> got<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.519> light<00:02:48.849> brown

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
look but he's also got a light brown

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.059 
look but he's also got a light brown
wash<00:02:49.569> on<00:02:49.840> there<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.530> he<00:02:50.620> doesn't<00:02:50.920> have<00:02:51.040> that

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
wash on there so he doesn't have that

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.220 
wash on there so he doesn't have that
same<00:02:51.430> sleek<00:02:51.879> black<00:02:52.359> look<00:02:52.719> that<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.019> lurker

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
same sleek black look that the lurker

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.309 
same sleek black look that the lurker
has<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:55.060> head<00:02:55.209> sculpt<00:02:55.540> on<00:02:55.629> this<00:02:55.780> guy<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:55.989> also

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
has the head sculpt on this guy is also

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.709 
has the head sculpt on this guy is also
a<00:02:56.500> lot<00:02:56.739> different<00:02:57.219> you'll<00:02:58.030> notice<00:02:58.359> that<00:02:58.510> he's

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
a lot different you'll notice that he's

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.959 
a lot different you'll notice that he's
got<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.959> more<00:02:59.290> jagged<00:02:59.889> scope<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.519> his<00:03:00.639> head<00:03:00.849> he

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
got a more jagged scope to his head he

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.490 
got a more jagged scope to his head he
doesn't<00:03:01.090> have<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.480> clear<00:03:01.719> dome<00:03:01.959> instead<00:03:02.379> he's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
doesn't have the clear dome instead he's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.949 
doesn't have the clear dome instead he's
just<00:03:02.680> got<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:02.980> kind<00:03:03.189> of<00:03:03.280> solid<00:03:03.670> black<00:03:03.959> part

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
just got that kind of solid black part

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.270 
just got that kind of solid black part
over<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.290> eyes<00:03:05.439> there<00:03:05.829> so<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.040> don't<00:03:06.189> have

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
over the eyes there so you don't have

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.709 
over the eyes there so you don't have
like<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.489> little<00:03:06.519> Scholl<00:03:07.180> eyes<00:03:07.389> shining

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
like the little Scholl eyes shining

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.170 
like the little Scholl eyes shining
through<00:03:08.159> so<00:03:09.159> essentially<00:03:09.670> what<00:03:09.909> you've<00:03:10.060> got

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
through so essentially what you've got

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.520 
through so essentially what you've got
here<00:03:10.329> with<00:03:10.450> these<00:03:10.569> two<00:03:10.629> figures<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.469> the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
here with these two figures and the

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.300 
here with these two figures and the
lurker<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.670> alien<00:03:13.299> one<00:03:13.750> movie<00:03:14.409> alien<00:03:15.069> and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
lurker is the alien one movie alien and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.530 
lurker is the alien one movie alien and
the<00:03:16.049> soldier<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.829> aliens

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
the soldier is like the aliens

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.089 
the soldier is like the aliens
Xenomorphs<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.109> it's<00:03:20.260> pretty<00:03:20.409> cool<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:20.919> is<00:03:21.069> a

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
Xenomorphs so it's pretty cool this is a

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.649 
Xenomorphs so it's pretty cool this is a
way<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.310> get<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.669> two<00:03:21.849> different<00:03:21.879> types<00:03:22.419> of

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
way to get the two different types of

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.530 
way to get the two different types of
aliens<00:03:23.260> or<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.799> Xenomorphs<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.819> we<00:03:24.970> saw<00:03:25.209> in

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
aliens or the Xenomorphs that we saw in

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.339 
aliens or the Xenomorphs that we saw in
the<00:03:25.720> early<00:03:26.019> alien<00:03:26.469> films<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:29.019> let's<00:03:29.200> go<00:03:29.290> ahead

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
the early alien films so let's go ahead

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.839 
the early alien films so let's go ahead
and<00:03:29.439> take<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> look<00:03:29.859> at<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.040> articulation<00:03:30.730> on

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
and take a look at the articulation on

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.449 
and take a look at the articulation on
these<00:03:30.969> guys<00:03:31.439> the<00:03:32.439> heads<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> really<00:03:33.310> nice

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
these guys the heads on a really nice

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.190 
these guys the heads on a really nice
ball<00:03:33.790> joint<00:03:34.120> which<00:03:34.329> can<00:03:34.540> make<00:03:34.689> the<00:03:34.870> head<00:03:35.019> move

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
ball joint which can make the head move

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.319 
ball joint which can make the head move
left<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.799> right<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.549> have<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.849> really<00:03:37.120> nice

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
left and right and have a really nice

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.940 
left and right and have a really nice
range<00:03:37.629> of<00:03:37.750> motion<00:03:37.810> even<00:03:38.200> moving<00:03:38.409> up<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.859> down

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
range of motion even moving up and down

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.009 
range of motion even moving up and down
the<00:03:39.430> scope<00:03:39.939> doesn't<00:03:40.239> really<00:03:40.450> seem<00:03:40.659> to<00:03:40.780> hinder

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
the scope doesn't really seem to hinder

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:41.789 
the scope doesn't really seem to hinder
it<00:03:41.139> whatsoever

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
it whatsoever

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.649 
it whatsoever
you<00:03:42.549> got<00:03:42.730> great<00:03:42.969> ball<00:03:43.209> joints<00:03:43.540> at<00:03:43.629> the

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
you got great ball joints at the

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.089
