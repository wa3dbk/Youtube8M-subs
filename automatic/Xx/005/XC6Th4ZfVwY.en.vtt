00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:10.139
 just bake and watch this video 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.000
 today it's about chocolate to king that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.570
 is a buttery mass we put together 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 produce and which consists of sugar 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:27.740
 butter eggs flour cocoa powder and 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:31.439
 baking powder so then as a first step 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.570
 the butter and the sugar come together 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.579
 in the machine 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.420
 That is always with every butter mass 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.510
 the same and is actually the same 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 Easiest way to make butter and sugar 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.629
 is pitched together 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.110
 then comes slowly in several parts 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:57.480
 the egg to it and at the end that will me 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:02.940
 because still suppressed and so only briefly 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.489
 so that it does not bleed in the flour 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.650
 is created 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:13.220
 otherwise the whole mass will be c again 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.369
 start at low speed 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.130
 until the whole is mixed and slowly 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.070
 increase the tempo 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.670
 take butter out the day before or 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.960
 short in the microwave to soft 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.189
 same with the eggs 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.700
 they should not be too cold 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:39.380
 otherwise there is a danger that the mass 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.380
 Property that means falling apart 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.220
 Now you can see the mass of butter 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.399
 give become and sugar until fluffy now 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.890
 We slowly get the eggs at the ten of their 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.890
 Slowly down under the crowd 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.209
 if the crowd falls apart then 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.130
 you can just warm them up a bit 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.870
 and then she binds again 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.640
 not the case here but you can see 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.920
 It's good that something is wrong 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.400
 if you break the eggs too fast 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.980
 pure or the butter was too cold 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.270
 then do not worry the mass just short 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.780
 warm and that's how we have it all 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.209
 be in it 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:38.989
 beautifully underlined as the mission 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.340
 in between always down a bit 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.340
 cleaning the edge 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:53.180
 Now we give the flour baking powder 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.650
 and the cocoa break over the exact one 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.880
 You will find a recipe in the infobox 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.660
 I would like your comments 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.570
 We are happy to send you a simple bisky 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.709
 is a very good taste 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:15.560
 is that there is very rich in the 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:18.590
 ingredients, so to speak, we can that more 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.980
 in there and now let me just that 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.980
 mission 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.959
 if I accept it now 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.690
 would be the whole mass 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.370
 and we keep small nice result 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.790
 we had even a copied before the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.790
 treasury 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.310
 Of course, my goal is to get recipes too 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.130
 really show that at home too 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.190
 Well , it could not work well 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.630
 if you do not have something on it 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.850
 have to and not actually implemented 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.670
 Mean primary is here with the canal 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.240
 to help you show that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.090
 that is possible and really that you can do it 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.340
 can implement the same and a simple one 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.610
 to go away 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:19.140
 so now that it underneath I pull that 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.300
 a little bit more with the rubber 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.040
 A man also remains a little more after 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:31.360
 hang down there you can not do much 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:33.790
 and my method is that me 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.880
 I always have a warm fill 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.060
 and the same then with inserts 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.630
 the dead as you see it now 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.390
 I'm doing such a creek dam 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:51.250
 I have designed me with 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.350
 baking paper for the crowd and then 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.460
 I always pack with this frame no matter 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.620
 what is i want then also the cake 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.919
 right this year and cut 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.479
 everything from that you see then in the video 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.479
 how to put pies 1 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.880
 she's a whole concept I set 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.510
 the dead ones have one then 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.350
 little waste or a bit too much 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.100
 Afford 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.190
 but I can continue the rest 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.070
 use with other cakes like this 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.840
 For example, at the Easter cake 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:35.900
 looking hilarious sounds a bit 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.730
 complicated then I hope you have 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.590
 Mind says you increase the 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.670
 Comments could also like to beat 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.960
 what I want to see from me I try 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.940
 About five videos in the week 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.280
 upload with this channel now new 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.770
 and of course me too 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.770
 always to improve the quality 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:02.660
 the same as me, the crowd is ringing and 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.210
 pay close attention that flies three quarters 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.170
 filled is not higher there as he is in 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.520
 up nor an oven drove then have 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.060
 I grab the whole thing 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:20.840
 this size is 20 to 30 minutes at 190 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:22.210
 Just finished and already that 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.470
 baked bisky 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.720
 Here I show you a trick if 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.830
 you do not know that bisky baked well 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.600
 is that a fair rhine pulls it out 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.380
 and if nothing sticks to the knife 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:43.490
 stays then the biscuit is through 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.580
 baked when you have a thermometer off 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.430
 you can also plug in if the 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.730
 he then displays between 85 and 90 degrees 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.620
 it's just fine 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.570
 ready bisquit like the pie there 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.140
 is used or how it goes on 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:02.360
 she was the other video that's I 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.690
 thank you write me comment or
