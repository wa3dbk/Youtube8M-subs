 4th face then to combine this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 satanic cocktail ab internet too 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.119
 it sucks so I decided to record 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.040
 for you a series for beginners of the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.670
 flash book are in case you consider yourself 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.620

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.000
 It will not suit you, but you. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.440
 want to hear a little more about the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.070
 book about what I'm going to show here in this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 series 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.640
 pretty canal beauty 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.760
 so come on let's start from the beginning 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.590
 how to share our ancestors what is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 the flash book or call the faithful or else 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 as soon as it is known is basically a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.590
 game set fashion style and me 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
 obvious is that nothing more than a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.899
 multiplayer online button arena 8 em 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.360
 Portuguese produced something near the arena 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.530
 online battles for multiple 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.930
 players 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 basically this but then what this 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 means that in practice the real part a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.350
 stop then simply a game that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 involves a number of things, such as 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 action strategy there are reflexes thoughts 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.670
 very fast and small that lasts in 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.799
 average of more or less between 20 and 35 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.860
 minutes or so where your goal 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.780
 main is to invade the enemy base 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.460
 destroy her and win the game inside 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.680
 of that battlefield there 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.140
 are totally independent and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.909
 each round is a new round or you 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.610
 There is no continuity, let's finish a 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.070
 match and begins another you do in 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.290
 same departure and two separate hours 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810
 this basically sets the mode to which the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.790
 flash book is part of it including 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.770
 free game register and play 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.600
 grace and the game reaches millions of people 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.549
 throughout the world and has several 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 various local servers such as 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.119
 example Brazil itself united states 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.060
 europe and in other locations 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.430
 Asia is then when you join the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.350
 ig you can interact with people from 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.209
 world depended on the entrance of its 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.520
 preference for you to start playing 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.500
 obviously going to enter the server and go 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.210
 select location 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.850
 I wish you'd like it more 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.010
 Wanna play then you'll upgrade 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.080
 your player profile which is basically 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.330
 your character plus what to talk about 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.860
 that later do not care seen 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.050
 there the faithful Libyans is a very 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.310
 broad in the sense of community even 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.510
 amount of fish 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.220
 it also has a system of 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.890
 ranking that is nothing more than 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.320
 matches that are competitive 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 count ranking points where you 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.030
 sort league felt divisions and there 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.310
 you have an extra goal there in the game 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.430
 So if you're that guy over there 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.590
 like for hardcore even more 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.790
 competitive lot offers this out 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.270
 also the championships that happen 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.620
 very often officers and also 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.390
 then becomes a 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.430
 great attraction even for the guys who 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.070
 like the most serious word you like 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.989
 compete as well as have fun 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.150
 but what I speak now you little 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.040
 gazebo you already know you basically show 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.690
 It's kind of how it works. 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.459
 Let's go to the most important episode 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.940
 Today's here is about the layout of the 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.890
 goal 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.900
 so come on, your account is tied to 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.790
 a player profile or the same 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.470
 thing you receive and mails you 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.080
 Did you register that you make your own? 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.840
 login and join this curve you have the south 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.610
 none are nerds or else the indicator 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.019
 where are you going to put your name that goes 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.880
 show up with your friends will appear 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.830
 within matches and such you too 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.750
 pass books you see money you 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.370
 buy your champions remembering and 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.950
 also the staff that this part of the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.650
 was totally independent of the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.329
 matches in online games 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.459
 parts that you play against champions 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.290
 opponent is then his level of 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.180
 flying his money he is not 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.410
 directly related to your level 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.760
 within the match 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.680
 but to make things easier 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.019
 to ease a little let's go 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.209
 divide by parts the first part you 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.700
 there is an evocative link to your account 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.459
 and you have 30 level you go from level 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.650
 1 to the level of 30 and for you to pass 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.959
 level level to summon the pain you 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.090
 play online matches against pots or 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.890
 then against other prices or even 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.540
 custom parties and at the end of each 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.090
 You are going to win an amount 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.790
 experience and also gold of 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.190
 influence and second part is to follow 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.930
 The game you play the matches to the end 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.270
 they give you experience and they too 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.380
 They study influences so it had a 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.300
 kind of money for a player 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.460
 again remembering that these influence 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.600
 bridges or also started known as 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.580
 ipÃª 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.800
 this is independent of the gold you 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.870
 wins inside matches is then he 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.450
 works separately within the game 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.010
 he was part of the educator I remember that 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.690
 I was very confused about this in the 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.400
 I started when I started playing in the 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.750
 true but for anyone who has questions 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.760
 also trying to help in the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.680
 as easy as possible you're going to 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.720
 third part with these influences 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.850
 with that ps you won as you 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.710
 You're going to play, you're either winning or 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.810
 losing you will gain experience and 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.790
 also these influence bridges you as 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.800
 a certain amount you can get 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.690
 buy their champions and also the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.880
 benefits are widespread him 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.190
 favors its gameplay within the 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.440
 play multiplayer games 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.180
 fact these improvements these benefits 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.650
 are also known as mules is 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.020
 but this is a subject for the next 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.040
 video so do not worry too much about 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.780
 this folder 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.460
 we will cover the fourth track is as follows 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.110
 for you that has a condition because the 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.400
 The more money you can spend 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.980
 money with the game and such 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.080
 despite the book flash game cold game 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.420
 Grace you can put real money 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.490
 to buy virtual money that also 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.350
 are known as the bridge radii is 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.150
 a species that you moment of 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.820
 virtual money that you earn 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.830
 purchase with real money ie you 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.570
 paid to have this then you can 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.910
 buy their champions more 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.860
 quickly without having to be with your 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.780
 53 points but those improvements that 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.910
 I told you before the runes 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.890
 they not only with locks with light bridges 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.470
 because it's a good point because 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.180
 some games are very fish wii ne 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.650
 Let's now go to the fifth and last part 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.840
 that you stop for you is the following 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.820
 until you understand that you are 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.220
 seeing there is also known as tv 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.450
 point where you can follow your 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.160
 player profile 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.990
 ie their recent matches your 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.910
 champions that you have already acquired 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.560
 set up your mules to set up your 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.780
 talents are things that I will explain 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.610
 Also in the next episode and you too 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.830
 Access to the store you buy your 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.440
 champions blame their clothes on the streets 15 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.300
 Years that bought your wrinkles are you. 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.490
 also gives the history of each 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.470
 champion you and your friends and forms 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.600
 if you match together you will play 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.220
 and such is basically a large screen 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.400
 the waiting screen you can get 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.670
 configure 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.620
 with others more 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.880
 and this is the first episode I do not know 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.470
 How many people are going to be 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.240
 I hope somehow this video 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.160
 It has helped someone I remember that counts. 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.380
 for you when I started playing the team 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.420
 several doubts so I hope 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.860
 this somehow helps someone step 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.800
 that left a person is already going to be 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.090
 Valuing for me, at least it 's more. 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.500
 finally this is it 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.480

 It serves the channel if you are not writing it 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.380
 Then I gave the episode a hug to 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.380
 you
