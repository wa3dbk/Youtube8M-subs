you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.340> fill<00:01:02.489> these<00:01:02.640> corners<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> do

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you can fill these corners in if you do

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840 
you can fill these corners in if you do
so<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> blazes<00:01:05.430> when

once<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.960> have<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.560> top<00:03:22.800> done<00:03:24.470> actually<00:03:25.470> I

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
once you have the top done actually I

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.229 
once you have the top done actually I
might<00:03:25.770> need<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.100> make<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.640> higher<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
might need to make it one higher so I

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.660 
might need to make it one higher so I
could<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.540> make<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> roof<00:03:28.400> which<00:03:29.400> I

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
could just make the roof which I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.210 
could just make the roof which I
probably<00:03:29.940> will<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:31.230> yeah<00:03:31.590> I'm<00:03:31.739> gonna<00:03:31.860> make<00:03:32.040> it

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
probably will so yeah I'm gonna make it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.110 
probably will so yeah I'm gonna make it
one<00:03:32.370> more<00:03:32.760> higher<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.770> this<00:03:35.220> wall<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:36.090> be

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
one more higher so this this wall can be

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.660 
one more higher so this this wall can be
as<00:03:36.300> high<00:03:36.510> as<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.750> want<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:37.739> make<00:03:37.980> sure<00:03:38.310> that

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
as high as you want just make sure that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.479 
as high as you want just make sure that
it's<00:03:39.480> not<00:03:39.720> too<00:03:40.260> high<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.920> blazes<00:03:41.310> will

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
it's not too high that the blazes will

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.060 
it's not too high that the blazes will
take<00:03:41.700> forever<00:03:41.940> unless<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:43.260> have<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.800> ton

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
take forever unless you have a ton

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.790 
take forever unless you have a ton
of<00:03:44.130> blaze<00:03:44.810> responders<00:03:45.810> which<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.560> case

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
of blaze responders which in that case

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.520 
of blaze responders which in that case
this<00:03:47.670> place<00:03:47.970> grandeur<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.930> perfect<00:03:49.290> one

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
this place grandeur is the perfect one

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.100 
this place grandeur is the perfect one
for<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.450> make<00:03:51.570> this<00:03:51.690> as<00:03:51.900> high<00:03:52.050> as

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
for you so you can make this as high as

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.410 
for you so you can make this as high as
you<00:03:52.260> want<00:03:52.290> I'm<00:03:53.070> just<00:03:53.130> gonna<00:03:53.370> make<00:03:53.550> it<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:54.090> think

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
you want I'm just gonna make it I think

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.120 
you want I'm just gonna make it I think
this<00:03:54.600> is<00:03:54.660> six<00:03:55.560> now<00:03:56.900> six<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.020> probably<00:03:58.290> normal

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
this is six now six is probably normal

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:08.520 
this is six now six is probably normal
and<00:04:00.850> now<00:04:01.390> I<00:04:01.420> just<00:04:01.690> need<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.900> make<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.140> roof<00:04:07.530> so

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.140 
noticing why I have this wall right here
I<00:04:17.170> added<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.920> so<00:04:18.160> light<00:04:18.400> would<00:04:18.580> come<00:04:18.610> in<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.120> you

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
I added it so light would come in so you

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.960 
I added it so light would come in so you
guys<00:04:19.390> see<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.500> now<00:04:20.950> let's<00:04:21.250> just<00:04:21.310> add<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:21.790> water

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
guys see so now let's just add the water

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:30.600 
guys see so now let's just add the water
in<00:04:22.300> each<00:04:22.510> corner<00:04:22.900> like<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:29.280> now<00:04:30.280> let's

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
in each corner like so and now let's

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.720 
in each corner like so and now let's
just<00:04:30.790> find<00:04:31.690> out<00:04:31.930> though<00:04:32.350> usually<00:04:33.310> one<00:04:33.460> place

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
just find out though usually one place

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.110 
just find out though usually one place
monitors<00:04:34.420> two<00:04:34.870> on<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.620> third<00:04:35.980> corner<00:04:36.670> away

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
monitors two on the third corner away

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.850 
monitors two on the third corner away
from<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.570> corner<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.110> wall<00:04:38.140> so<00:04:38.620> right

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
from the corner of the wall so right

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.520 
from the corner of the wall so right
here<00:04:39.450> same<00:04:40.450> with<00:04:40.600> this<00:04:40.750> side<00:04:40.810> so<00:04:41.200> one<00:04:41.380> two

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
here same with this side so one two

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.010 
here same with this side so one two
three<00:04:42.990> one<00:04:43.990> two<00:04:44.350> three<00:04:45.300> just<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:46.390> make<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:46.600> in

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
three one two three just to make it in

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.730 
three one two three just to make it in
the<00:04:47.110> most<00:04:47.260> efficient<00:04:47.800> way<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.870> once<00:04:49.870> at<00:04:50.290> that

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
the most efficient way so once at that

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.250 
the most efficient way so once at that
then<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.820> want<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.090> find<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.510> center<00:04:53.020> right

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
then you want to find the center right

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.480 
then you want to find the center right
here<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.870> spawners<00:04:56.200> on<00:04:56.530> this<00:04:56.740> will<00:04:56.980> drop

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
here so the spawners on this will drop

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.590 
here so the spawners on this will drop
down<00:04:57.700> right<00:04:57.970> here<00:04:58.890> put<00:04:59.890> you<00:05:00.100> there

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
down right here put you there

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.950 
down right here put you there
to<00:05:01.720> there<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.140> there<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:03.150> there<00:05:04.150> this<00:05:04.450> get<00:05:04.750> made

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
to there to there to there this get made

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.660 
to there to there to there this get made
dipper<00:05:05.230> if<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.560> have<00:05:05.680> less<00:05:05.890> song<00:05:06.130> spawners

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
dipper if you have less song spawners

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.910 
dipper if you have less song spawners
then<00:05:07.030> just<00:05:07.240> put<00:05:07.420> in<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.690> middle<00:05:07.990> like<00:05:08.710> right

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
then just put in the middle like right

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.420 
then just put in the middle like right
here

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
here

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.240 
here

but for now I'm putting on the

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.000 
but for now I'm putting on the
spawners<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:16.230> let's<00:05:17.230> go<00:05:17.410> down<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.740> the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
spawners and let's go down to the

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.740 
spawners and let's go down to the
