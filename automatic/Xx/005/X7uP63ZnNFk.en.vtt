this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.790> what's<00:00:05.970> called<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.270> backyard<00:00:06.720> cottage

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.650 
this is what's called a backyard cottage
it's<00:00:07.620> similar<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.190> a<00:00:08.309> carriage<00:00:08.580> house<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.420> this

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
it's similar to a carriage house so this

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.629 
it's similar to a carriage house so this
is<00:00:09.780> essentially<00:00:10.320> an<00:00:10.530> adjunct<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> main

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
is essentially an adjunct to the main

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.230 
is essentially an adjunct to the main
house<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:13.050> is<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.590> new<00:00:14.009> idea<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.610> Seattle

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
house and this is a new idea for Seattle

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.859 
house and this is a new idea for Seattle
in<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:16.400> Seattle's<00:00:17.490> zoning<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.239> primarily

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
in that Seattle's zoning is primarily

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.389

single-family<00:00:19.700> my<00:00:20.700> firm<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.270> advocating<00:00:22.110> for

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:22.399 
single-family my firm was advocating for

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.429 
single-family my firm was advocating for
being<00:00:23.399> able<00:00:23.489> to<00:00:23.610> allow<00:00:23.790> these<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:25.110> part

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
being able to allow these in part

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.540 
being able to allow these in part
because<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.829> just<00:00:25.950> gives<00:00:26.189> us<00:00:26.309> a<00:00:26.399> lot<00:00:26.520> more

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.270 
vacation all the time I think the big
lesson<00:03:28.870> for<00:03:29.349> this<00:03:29.439> house<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.640> think<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.360> is

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
lesson for this house is I think it's is

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.009 
lesson for this house is I think it's is
to<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:33.519> prioritize<00:03:33.790> what's<00:03:34.480> important

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
to really prioritize what's important

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.280 
to really prioritize what's important
and<00:03:35.439> that's<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.220> really<00:03:36.489> personal<00:03:36.700> decision<00:03:37.329> I

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
and that's a really personal decision I

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.559 
and that's a really personal decision I
think<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.189> lot<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.459> people<00:03:39.760> when<00:03:40.030> designing<00:03:40.450> a

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
think a lot of people when designing a

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.410 
think a lot of people when designing a
house<00:03:40.720> make<00:03:41.430> decisions<00:03:42.430> based<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:42.849> maybe<00:03:43.120> what

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
house make decisions based on maybe what

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.899 
house make decisions based on maybe what
they<00:03:43.840> feel<00:03:44.439> like<00:03:44.470> other<00:03:45.099> people<00:03:45.189> might<00:03:45.609> want

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
they feel like other people might want

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.319 
they feel like other people might want
to<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:47.230> know<00:03:47.319> what<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.560> norm<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.329> really

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
to you know what the norm is and really

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.970 
to you know what the norm is and really
you<00:03:49.420> don't<00:03:49.510> need<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.230> be<00:03:50.379> happy<00:03:50.709> this

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
you don't need all that to be happy this

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.119 
you don't need all that to be happy this
is<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.370> great<00:03:51.760> house<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.569> lives<00:03:52.900> wonderfully<00:03:53.590> it

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
is a great house it lives wonderfully it

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.710 
is a great house it lives wonderfully it
feels<00:03:54.400> much<00:03:54.639> larger<00:03:55.060> than<00:03:55.150> it<00:03:55.299> actually<00:03:55.450> is

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
feels much larger than it actually is

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.680 
feels much larger than it actually is
and<00:03:56.139> that's<00:03:56.680> just<00:03:57.159> a<00:03:57.370> factor<00:03:57.879> of<00:03:57.909> because<00:03:58.510> it

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
and that's just a factor of because it

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.440 
and that's just a factor of because it
is<00:03:59.109> that<00:03:59.290> sort<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.530> essential<00:03:59.980> living<00:04:00.450> that

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
is that sort of essential living that

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.390 
is that sort of essential living that
you<00:04:01.780> know<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.200> perfectly<00:04:02.680> satisfies<00:04:03.189> their

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
you know it's perfectly satisfies their

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.670 
you know it's perfectly satisfies their
needs
