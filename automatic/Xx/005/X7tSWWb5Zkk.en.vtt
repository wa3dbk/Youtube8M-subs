00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
make it more tender than if you're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.459

like<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> triangle<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:46.050> biggest

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
like a triangle which it is the biggest

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
like a triangle which it is the biggest
part<00:00:46.440> across<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.039> bottom<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.850> want<00:00:47.969> to

part across the bottom and you want to
cut<00:00:48.420> from<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
cut from the top if you have to you can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
cut from the top if you have to you can
mark<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> tri-tip<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> people<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
mark the tri-tip and a lot of people it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
mark the tri-tip and a lot of people it
makes<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> easy<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:54.270> cut<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
makes it easy to do that just cut the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.959 
makes it easy to do that just cut the
top<00:00:54.899> off<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.670> where<00:00:56.879> you

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
cutting and follow that all the way

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070 
cutting and follow that all the way
through<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.030> find<00:01:03.449> them<00:01:03.539> with<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> fat<00:01:03.899> all

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
through you can find them with a fat all

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.690 
through you can find them with a fat all
over<00:01:04.110> Bandung<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.830> my<00:01:05.010> fat<00:01:05.220> off<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> get

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
over Bandung for my fat off and get

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
over Bandung for my fat off and get
attractive<00:01:06.119> underneath<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.990> worth

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
attractive underneath it but it's worth

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.200 
attractive underneath it but it's worth
the<00:01:07.170> money<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.530> let<00:01:07.740> them<00:01:07.950> trim<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> believe<00:01:09.180> me

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the money to let them trim it believe me

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
the money to let them trim it believe me
most<00:01:09.780> time<00:01:10.080> they'll<00:01:10.260> take<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> off<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.890> far

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
most time they'll take it off this far

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.280 
most time they'll take it off this far
you<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.000> take<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.540> rest<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.869> fat<00:01:13.080> off

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you can take the rest of fat off

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
you can take the rest of fat off
yourself<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.520> quite<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.790> bit<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.240> might

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
yourself I do that quite a bit I might

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.420 
yourself I do that quite a bit I might
come<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.229> take<00:01:16.409> any<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> call<00:01:17.070> silver

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
come in and take any what I call silver

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
come in and take any what I call silver
skins<00:01:17.700> off<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:19.049> simple<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.799> takes

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
skins off and it's simple do just takes

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
skins off and it's simple do just takes
a<00:01:20.159> minute<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> makes<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.869> more

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
a minute but I think it makes for a more

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020 
a minute but I think it makes for a more
tender<00:01:22.259> tri-tip<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:23.580> ahead<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.909> take
