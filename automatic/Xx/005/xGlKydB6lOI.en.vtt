00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
cigarettes during the tournament I think

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.359

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
one I think the guys are developing more

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.969 
one I think the guys are developing more
of<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> personality<00:01:14.610> back<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:16.170> black<00:01:16.710> shirt

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
of a personality back then a black shirt

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.580 
of a personality back then a black shirt
was<00:01:17.189> considered<00:01:17.700> outrageous<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> bowling

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.429 
was considered outrageous on the bowling
alley<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.310> think<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.240> didn't<00:01:21.570> Tom<00:01:22.020> pocket<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.450 
alley so I think we didn't Tom pocket I
were<00:01:22.530> talking<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.040> think<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.430> are

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
were talking about it I think there are

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.020 
were talking about it I think there are
ways<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.509> PBA<00:01:25.320> could<00:01:25.970> increase<00:01:26.970> his

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
ways that the PBA could increase his

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780 
ways that the PBA could increase his
exposure<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:29.189> way<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> doing<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
exposure and this is one way of doing it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.249 
exposure and this is one way of doing it
but<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.180> you're<00:01:30.360> doing<00:01:30.509> you're<00:01:30.840> doing<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
are your thoughts on this plastic ball
controversy<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.450> competition<00:01:48.990> well<00:01:49.470> it's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
controversy or in competition well it's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.639 
controversy or in competition well it's
in<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.149> mind<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> lot<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.869> golf<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
in my mind a lot like golf that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.359 
in my mind a lot like golf that
technology<00:01:53.520> has<00:01:53.790> pushed<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.079> sport<00:01:55.470> almost

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
technology has pushed the sport almost

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.319 
technology has pushed the sport almost
beyond<00:01:57.649> where<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.829> should<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.729> can't<00:02:00.119> put

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
beyond where it should be you can't put

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.130 
beyond where it should be you can't put
trees<00:02:00.689> off<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> bowling<00:02:01.649> alley<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.159> cannot

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
trees off the bowling alley you cannot

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.260 
trees off the bowling alley you cannot
take<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> lanes<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.829> put<00:02:05.100> spikes<00:02:05.610> along<00:02:05.850> them

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
take the lanes and put spikes along them

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.730 
take the lanes and put spikes along them
so<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.890> do

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
so I think what you have to do

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.670 
so I think what you have to do
is<00:02:08.830> at<00:02:09.280> least<00:02:09.790> examine<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.480> ball<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.900> see<00:02:11.470> how

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
is at least examine the ball and see how

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.010 
is at least examine the ball and see how
much<00:02:11.890> it's<00:02:12.190> actually<00:02:12.910> being<00:02:13.180> more<00:02:13.450> important

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
much it's actually being more important

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.250 
much it's actually being more important
than<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.800> bowler<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.000> case<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.720> still

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
than the bowler and in that case I still

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.740 
than the bowler and in that case I still
think<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:18.010> should<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.580> tiger<00:02:19.270> woods<00:02:19.300> with

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
think it should be tiger woods with

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.290 
think it should be tiger woods with
persimmon<00:02:20.170> clubs<00:02:20.620> could<00:02:21.460> beat<00:02:21.640> anybody<00:02:21.940> else

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
persimmon clubs could beat anybody else

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.540 
persimmon clubs could beat anybody else
I<00:02:22.600> believe<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.530> plastic<00:02:23.830> ball<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.490> I

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
I believe with the plastic ball and I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.460 
I believe with the plastic ball and I
love<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.880> concept<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.510> wish<00:02:25.690> golf<00:02:25.990> would<00:02:26.230> take

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
love this concept I wish golf would take

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.580 
love this concept I wish golf would take
it<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.710> maybe<00:02:26.920> tennis<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> wooden<00:02:28.590> we're

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
it up maybe tennis have a wooden we're

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.070 
it up maybe tennis have a wooden we're
going<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.860> use<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.300> wood<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.540> maybe<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.930> old

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
going to use of wood and maybe the old

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.450 
going to use of wood and maybe the old
balls<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.530> stuff<00:02:32.710> like<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:32.890> i<00:02:33.040> really

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460

believe<00:02:33.700> other<00:02:33.880> sports<00:02:34.210> should<00:02:34.420> pick<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.050> on

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
believe other sports should pick up on

believe other sports should pick up on
