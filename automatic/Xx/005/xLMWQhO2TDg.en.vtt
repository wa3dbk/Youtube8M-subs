00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
fast behind the gate by the time you

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.219 
fast behind the gate by the time you
basically<00:05:20.610> get<00:05:21.270> going<00:05:21.510> in<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.660> race<00:05:21.870> you're

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
tight turn and it's starting gate goes

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.420 
tight turn and it's starting gate goes
pretty<00:05:26.940> good<00:05:27.150> with<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:27.630> rail<00:05:27.810> you<00:05:28.169> got<00:05:28.710> you're

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
pretty good with the rail you got you're

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.279 
pretty good with the rail you got you're
going<00:05:29.580> pretty<00:05:29.729> slow<00:05:29.880> it's<00:05:30.630> nice<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.080> it's<00:05:31.200> a

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
going pretty slow it's nice and it's a

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.810 
going pretty slow it's nice and it's a
long<00:05:31.470> way<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.710> come<00:05:31.800> from<00:05:32.100> that<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.280> doll<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:32.700> get

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
long way to come from that a doll to get

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.640 
long way to come from that a doll to get
all<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.000> way<00:05:33.090> down<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.510> rail<00:05:33.720> and<00:05:33.990> then

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
all the way down to that rail and then

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.920 
all the way down to that rail and then
go<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:35.010> rest<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.340> mile<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.690> post

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
go the rest of the mile so the post

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.070 
go the rest of the mile so the post
position<00:05:37.380> here<00:05:37.590> is<00:05:37.710> is<00:05:37.979> a<00:05:38.220> big<00:05:38.580> big<00:05:38.940> factor<00:05:39.419> the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
position here is is a big big factor the

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.850 
position here is is a big big factor the
tracks<00:05:40.320> got<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.620> be<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:40.770> good<00:05:40.800> shape<00:05:41.570> it's<00:05:42.570> just

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
tracks got to be in good shape it's just

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.440 
tracks got to be in good shape it's just
if<00:05:43.860> it's<00:05:44.039> inconsistent<00:05:44.640> it<00:05:45.090> makes<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.390> very

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
if it's inconsistent it makes it very

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.590 
if it's inconsistent it makes it very
very<00:05:45.660> tough<00:05:46.700> being<00:05:47.700> inconsistent<00:05:48.060> I'm<00:05:48.330> saying

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
very tough being inconsistent I'm saying

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.360 
very tough being inconsistent I'm saying
that<00:05:48.690> its<00:05:48.930> hard<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.440> one<00:05:49.560> day<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.010> then<00:05:50.100> solve

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
that its hard and one day and then solve

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.490 
that its hard and one day and then solve
the<00:05:50.550> next<00:05:50.700> day<00:05:50.970> or<00:05:51.150> loose<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.510> next<00:05:51.780> day<00:05:51.930> it

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
the next day or loose the next day it

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.500 
the next day or loose the next day it
makes<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.919> tough<00:05:53.130> but<00:05:53.520> it<00:05:53.760> comes<00:05:54.000> on<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.270> track

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
makes it tough but it comes on the track

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.450 
makes it tough but it comes on the track
the<00:05:54.750> tracks<00:05:55.020> good<00:05:55.320> it<00:05:55.830> makes<00:05:55.979> our<00:05:56.160> job<00:05:56.190> a<00:05:56.400> lot

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
the tracks good it makes our job a lot

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.700 
the tracks good it makes our job a lot
easier<00:05:56.550> from<00:05:57.360> a<00:05:57.510> driver's<00:05:57.960> standpoint
