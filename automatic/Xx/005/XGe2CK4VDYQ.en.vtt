00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.569
 I would have ordered it 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.989
 It's not like he's trying to talk but I 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.369
 so startling was the beginning 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.279
 vega 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.799

 with voice they take a little more time to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.369
 the power this 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.169
 the sector what they feel 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.029

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.399
 to the descent of your heart of london 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:18.490
 in Ecuador 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.349
 the most regressive 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.349
 once although it is something that will not seem 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.959
 faithful friend and gold as she tell us your story 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.319

 I do not 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.039
 well a stress 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.999
 in general 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.999
 in the tapes areas in the network 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.129
 I would like them to seem confused 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.230
 in its own way with national intelligence shame ani one of the young 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.429
 can call 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.039
 because they have children in which the juvenile 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.700
 works are also days like 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.700
 because without this game they are not mainly 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.309
 the person you want to make 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.629
 when I fulfilled 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.069
 mons 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.349
 14 years old I started to take 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.469
 had until then undefeated inside demi 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:21.609
 what 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.609
 als to take I felt like 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.279
 like my heart and my soul 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.770
 it felt better 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.389
 They learn to identify the emotional problems that people have where they come from 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.039
 and how can they 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.270
 fix them 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.150
 after an escape for me 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.800
 for feelings 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.099

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.199
 adosac stronger drugs 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.349

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.259
 they learn because a center of specific sessions that function have in their 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.259
 dlna life by flipping my 1st 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.650
 and that was what sustains us that the unpredictability 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.229
 they took me 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.930
 fasting he did not write 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.559
 I started thinking and what is living like that 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.779
 and so 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:04.880
 I told my mom 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.779
 You know he could not I can not be a stylist 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.039
 that is 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.229
 already then punish him 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.550
 he always fell 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.710
 forever 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.110
 in the family 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.469
 12 hours ago 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:18.909
 he is sick 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.179
 but not just the whole dynamic is the whole structure of the 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.870
 family 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.680
 no more doctors are optimistic i 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.870
 i told me but you have to be the call 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.410
 half of the mici I wanted to dance but let me on Monday you will travel to park 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.530
 He even ignores it and does not need it unless he is all happy in case of 100 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.059
 It should be noted that 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:44.529
 efe efe efe special efe the hotel st 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.409
 coming here is you can create new alternatives for 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.680
 doing it in a different way in here can 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 learn ambi r 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.969
 without having to use drugs if it were not finally ex 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.710
 the bride was here 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.949
 learn a lot 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.289
 community 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.430
 favalora 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.839
 in this context my family is extensive 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.689
 acceptance 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.889
 unconditionally matters where it comes from, if that is what 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.389
 what are you doing under 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.680
 you are going to be accepted supported 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.130
 it will not be abandoned 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.870
 and in his recovery process 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.870
 you will always have all the support you need 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.770
 I like the concept of truth is that it is 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.689
 man is a Greek myth in which the phoenix 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.139
 destroys itself and then rises from its ashes 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.210
 and it is renewed 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.249
 then he took that concept because sometimes 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.499
 Cold recipients the same with their addictive behaviors 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:46.619
 with drugs but to keep going you have to wait out the 

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:49.289
 rebuild a missile when losing ground 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:50.180
 it's nice 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.880
