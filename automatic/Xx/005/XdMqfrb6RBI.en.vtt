00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.050 
throat as you see there's a karma dealer
up<00:01:59.100> there<00:02:00.020> now<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.080> Karma<00:02:01.590> dealer<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.430> the

up there now the Karma dealer on the
Karma<00:02:03.450> dealer<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.230> that<00:02:04.350> it

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
Karma dealer you would think that it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.110 
Karma dealer you would think that it
would<00:02:04.650> cost<00:02:04.950> comer<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.460> buy<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
would cost comer to buy it but it

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.010 
would cost comer to buy it but it
actually<00:02:06.270> does<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.810> I'm<00:02:07.800> just<00:02:07.980> because<00:02:08.400> and

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
actually does it I'm just because and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.330 
actually does it I'm just because and
now<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.380> rewards<00:02:10.650> actually

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
now all these rewards actually

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.520 
now all these rewards actually
unfortunately<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.270> they're<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.530> cosmetic

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
unfortunately that they're just cosmetic

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.510 
unfortunately that they're just cosmetic
they<00:02:13.650> don't<00:02:13.830> actually<00:02:13.980> make<00:02:14.220> your<00:02:14.370> character

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
they don't actually make your character

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.050 
they don't actually make your character
better<00:02:14.960> I<00:02:16.130> guess<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.310> just<00:02:17.370> because<00:02:17.580> they

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
better I guess it's just because they

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.240 
better I guess it's just because they
don't<00:02:18.240> want<00:02:18.420> people<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.350> overpowered<00:02:20.040> and

the<00:03:09.600> North<00:03:09.840> Sea<00:03:10.410> Ewing<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.680> okay<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.510> know

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
the North Sea Ewing it okay and you know

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.900 
the North Sea Ewing it okay and you know
there's<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.140> key<00:03:13.410> word<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.160> think<00:03:14.790> it's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
there's a key word here I think it's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.520 
there's a key word here I think it's
like<00:03:15.030> 200<00:03:15.510> degrees<00:03:15.540> after<00:03:15.959> something<00:03:16.380> I

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
like 200 degrees after something I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.680 
like 200 degrees after something I
didn't<00:03:16.709> really<00:03:16.890> follow<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.220> storyline<00:03:17.489> but

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
didn't really follow the storyline but

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.890 
didn't really follow the storyline but
anyway<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.050> here<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.530> all<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.770> rooms

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
anyway this is it here it's all in rooms

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.119 
anyway this is it here it's all in rooms
because<00:03:21.900> people<00:03:22.470> abandoned<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.190> guess

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.170 

and<00:03:27.129> we're<00:03:27.459> going<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.640> go<00:03:27.700> ahead<00:03:27.790> here<00:03:28.060> and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
and we're going to go ahead here and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.280 
and we're going to go ahead here and
then<00:03:28.299> usually<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.870> guilt<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.170> one

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
then usually and guilt or this one

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.949 
then usually and guilt or this one
