00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and I have no option but to cut them to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.400 
and I have no option but to cut them to
keep<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:50.039> looking<00:00:50.190> decent<00:00:51.170> also<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
keep them looking decent also I have a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.979 
keep them looking decent also I have a
cuticle<00:00:52.680> pusher<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:54.210> using<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.629> metal

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
cuticle pusher here I'm using a metal

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
cuticle pusher here I'm using a metal
one<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.250> scrapes<00:00:56.730> off<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
one because it really scrapes off the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
one because it really scrapes off the
excess<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> said<00:00:57.840> that's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> big<00:00:58.199> problem

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
excess like I said that's a big problem

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
excess like I said that's a big problem
for<00:00:58.770> me<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.359> that's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
for me if it's not for you that's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.630 
for me if it's not for you that's
another<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.109> skip<00:01:01.350> or<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.489> can

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
another thing you can skip or you can

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.080 
another thing you can skip or you can
also<00:01:02.850> use<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> wooden<00:01:04.580> orange<00:01:05.580> stick<00:01:05.850> like

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
also use just a wooden orange stick like

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.789 
also use just a wooden orange stick like
this<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.570> push<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> back<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.650> that's

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this to push it back with but that's

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
this to push it back with but that's
just<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.070> enough<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.670> nails<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.720> then

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
just not enough for my nails and then

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.899 
just not enough for my nails and then
also<00:01:10.140> i'm<00:01:10.439> using<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:12.020> relatively<00:01:13.020> fine<00:01:13.439> grit

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
also i'm using a relatively fine grit

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.260 
also i'm using a relatively fine grit
metal<00:01:14.909> nail<00:01:15.689> file<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.100> over<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.090> an

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
metal nail file I use this over like an

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
metal nail file I use this over like an
emery<00:01:18.540> board<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.770> ring<00:01:19.979> here

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
emery board I just have one ring here

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
emery board I just have one ring here
because<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> file<00:01:21.780> with<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.290> emery

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
because when I file with this emery

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.880 
because when I file with this emery
board<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.400> nails<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.150> edges<00:01:24.450> feel<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.080> ragged

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
board my nails the edges feel so ragged

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
board my nails the edges feel so ragged
afterwards<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.640> ridiculous<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
afterwards it's ridiculous and it just

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.170 
afterwards it's ridiculous and it just
feels<00:01:27.930> terrible<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.979> makes<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.610> lot

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
feels terrible so this makes it a lot

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
feels terrible so this makes it a lot
smoother<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.020> typically<00:01:31.680> don't

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
smoother and you really typically don't

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.700 
smoother and you really typically don't
need<00:01:32.159> something<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> heavy<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
need something this heavy and then the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
need something this heavy and then the
next<00:01:34.829> thing<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.460> optional<00:01:36.240> because<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.840> my

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
next thing also optional because of my

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.170 
next thing also optional because of my
problem<00:01:37.259> cuticles<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:38.000> have<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.119> little

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
sort of buffing block here I've already

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.750 
sort of buffing block here I've already
done<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.760> all<00:02:18.880> my<00:02:19.210> nails<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.760> basically

done that to all my nails and basically

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.050 
done that to all my nails and basically
there's<00:02:22.060> usually<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.480> hard<00:02:22.840> grit<00:02:23.170> side<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:24.610> like

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
there's usually a hard grit side to like

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.940 
there's usually a hard grit side to like
actually<00:02:25.270> shape<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.930> file<00:02:26.110> your<00:02:26.140> nails<00:02:26.560> and

actually shape and file your nails and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.340 
actually shape and file your nails and
then<00:02:27.130> there's<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.400> softer<00:02:28.090> grit<00:02:28.270> side<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.960> file

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
then there's a softer grit side to file

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.700 
then there's a softer grit side to file
your<00:02:29.740> nails<00:02:30.310> like<00:02:30.880> your<00:02:31.030> nail<00:02:31.240> bed<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.930> that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
your nails like your nail bed and that

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.290 
your nails like your nail bed and that
will<00:02:32.860> remove<00:02:33.160> any<00:02:33.400> ridges<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.970> have<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.240> your

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
nails and even it out and the next slide

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.740 
nails and even it out and the next slide
generally<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.370> like<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:40.060> called<00:02:40.300> clean<00:02:40.720> I

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
generally just like it's called clean I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.540 
generally just like it's called clean I
think<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.740> kind<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.040> smoothes<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
think and it just kind of smoothes it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.980 
think and it just kind of smoothes it
out<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> little<00:02:42.940> bit<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.630> lash<00:02:43.810> line

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
out a little bit and then the lash line

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.740 
out a little bit and then the lash line
adds<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.800> really<00:02:45.190> high<00:02:45.400> gloss<00:02:45.730> shine<00:02:46.300> and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
adds like a really high gloss shine and

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.110 
adds like a really high gloss shine and
it<00:02:47.350> looks<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.860> good<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.490> make<00:02:48.670> sure<00:02:48.850> it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
it looks so good and I just make sure it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.699 
it looks so good and I just make sure it
just<00:02:49.300> brightens<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.780> nails<00:02:50.080> up<00:02:50.380> when<00:02:50.650> they

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
just brightens your nails up when they

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.090 
just brightens your nails up when they
get<00:02:50.800> kind<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.070> dingy<00:02:51.280> looking<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.650> that's<00:02:53.950> what

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
get kind of dingy looking so that's what

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.949 
get kind of dingy looking so that's what
I<00:02:54.130> did<00:02:54.220> already<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.540> next<00:02:56.020> step<00:02:56.260> would<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.040> to

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
I did already the next step would be to

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.870 
I did already the next step would be to
soften<00:02:58.959> your<00:02:59.080> cuticles<00:02:59.530> to<00:03:00.250> start<00:03:00.459> working<00:03:00.790> on

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
definitely soak them in warm soapy water

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.690 
definitely soak them in warm soapy water
or<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.420> can<00:03:07.630> put<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.320> cuticle<00:03:08.650> remover<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.430> your

like all these nail filings on my nails
so<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:22.030> next<00:03:22.209> thing<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.510> want<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.720> do<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.840> just

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
good underneath and on top to get all

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.770 
good underneath and on top to get all
that<00:03:30.310> grit<00:03:30.640> out<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.000> crevices<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.540> things

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
that grit out of the crevices and things

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.540 
that grit out of the crevices and things
like<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.440> then<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.130> typically

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
like that and then that typically

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.630 
like that and then that typically
softens<00:03:34.239> up<00:03:34.420> my<00:03:34.570> cuticles<00:03:35.019> enough<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:36.489> then

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
softens up my cuticles enough and then
