 at this point the tutolo to get behind the wheel first touches journalist 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:14.499
 the first laps only season. immediately clear that to get the right timing 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.289
 we must not force too much 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.409
 as simone suggested, the car must be left to do 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.129
 primary fidelfatti would position you to guarantee the ideal liquid 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.309
 situations where electronic checks were really helping go stronger 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.100
 above all you have to trust the carbon ceramic brakes 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.670
 tellers at most in the disconnected at the limit 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.760
 thus avoiding perhaps a little spectacular but effective way the building is 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.530
 because the intervention of traction and stability control 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.810
 also thanks to the decisive contribution of the Napoleonic fort defender 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.430
 in the same way in the pure the most drawn phrases it is possible to hear the fava beans 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.500
 of the pieve 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.970
 at this point p registered as a journalist 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.970
 what his best time will have been 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.460
 peter schumacher. the telemetry being in the car in turn obviously him 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 both the car and the end know perfection 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 to follow his lap on the monitors you immediately understand the main one 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.910
 difference between two at night

 onofri completely sending the electronics and against the stable 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.520
 besides his evenings are enormously more violent 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.780
 ahhh 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.480
 ok prÃ©sente hostel last curve of the circuit before the final destiny 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.650
 the pressure on the first the star of a hundred steps in practice the double

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.710
 driving school this long day on the track the ferrari in fiorano 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.530
 read all micheal schumacher did his five laps on the track he did 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.670
 mark a time 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 very good but not exceptional but also time 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.640
 particular there are 35 degrees the foolish temperature is particularly 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.110
 other tires I suffer many these conditions made him score a time 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.280
 of a good 28 net at this point you will wonder how many bent me to turn 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.229
 here in fiorano 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.739
 well my time is better than the eight laps you have made available to me 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.029
 it was one minute and 31 seconds net or three seconds only 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.609
 slower than schumacher 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.089
 which demonstrates what we wanted to prove until the beginning, that is 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.759
 cars like the 400 trento stable with their electronic systems 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.329
 electronic control of electronic management and stability of the

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:50.519
