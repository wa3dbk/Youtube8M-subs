look<00:01:02.399> disconnected<00:01:03.120> meaning<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.629> very

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
look disconnected meaning it's very

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
look disconnected meaning it's very
short<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.159> really

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you no longer on the top disconnected so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.550 
you no longer on the top disconnected so
if<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> want<00:01:10.080> his<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.369> ask<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> 0<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:13.530> a
