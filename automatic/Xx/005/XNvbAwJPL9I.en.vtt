00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
will practically open the blade as I

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.359

wasn't<00:02:10.840> careful<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.959> know<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.260> my<00:02:14.350> backup

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
wasn't careful you know it's my backup

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.540 
wasn't careful you know it's my backup
EDC<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:16.780> even<00:02:16.959> get<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.890> only<00:02:18.130> good

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
EDC don't even get that the only good

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.980 
EDC don't even get that the only good
thing<00:02:18.610> that's<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
thing that's about it is that the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.880 
thing that's about it is that the
serrations<00:02:20.830> are<00:02:20.950> still<00:02:21.130> sharp<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:23.709> really

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
serrations are still sharp it's really

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.160 
serrations are still sharp it's really
lightweight<00:02:24.160> too<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.360> doesn't<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
lightweight too so it doesn't have the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.810 
lightweight too so it doesn't have the
new<00:02:27.570> liners<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.810> new<00:02:28.930> indoors<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.820> its
