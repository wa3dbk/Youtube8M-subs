00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 all right 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.510
 I am a maite of the church and I dedicate myself to 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.090
 fashion world I started as a model and 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.800
 I am currently also blogger my blog 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.720
 which has a fashionable theme 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.510
 I always wanted it to be a bit 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.939
 original that had a personal touch 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.980
 that was very linked to my facet 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.140
 work to everything that happens and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.720
 give you a vision you can see that it was 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.149
 thereby working within it 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.680
 I get that area of â€‹â€‹originality and 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.680
 personalization that I've always searched 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.780
 with this project something that marks the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.879
 difference within meff that's the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.350
 fact that they wanted to find in 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.910
 madrid 'a little more spirit 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.980
 international that resembles those 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 gateways so concrete and blurry that 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.000
 we could see then in mclean in new 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.640
 york and in london during the days 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.920

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.850
 you have to go to the workshops 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.710
 each one of the designers when I go to 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.840
 the search for something different 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.450
 for me one of the most 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.580
 relevant is that it be original but to the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.060
 Couple that elegant I think there are two 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.659
 basic concepts that together mean 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.659
