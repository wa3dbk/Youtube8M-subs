I said this list is potential on 343 has

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.319 
I said this list is potential on 343 has
stress<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.920> list<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.489> nowhere<00:00:54.030> near

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
reticle turns red to match the DMR so
when<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> radical<00:01:22.470> turns<00:01:22.740> red<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.100> means

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
when the radical turns red that means

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
when the radical turns red that means
that<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.909> weapon<00:01:24.270> tents<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.990> know<00:01:25.080> obviously

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
that the weapon tents you know obviously

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.890 
that the weapon tents you know obviously
see<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.130> detect<00:01:26.490> there's<00:01:27.030> an<00:01:27.119> enemy<00:01:27.450> off<00:01:27.630> in

see and detect there's an enemy off in

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
see and detect there's an enemy off in
the<00:01:28.020> distance<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:28.740> they're<00:01:28.950> light<00:01:29.159> rifle

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the distance so now they're light rifle

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.310 
the distance so now they're light rifle
and<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> DMR<00:01:30.060> will<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> same<00:01:30.720> range<00:01:31.079> in

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and the DMR will have the same range in

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
and the DMR will have the same range in
which<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.979> reticle<00:01:32.340> turns<00:01:32.670> red<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
which the reticle turns red when it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390 
which the reticle turns red when it
recognizes<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:34.380> an<00:01:34.500> enemy<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:34.890> front<00:01:35.040> of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.060 
like to use the coupling partner because
it<00:01:45.509> has<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.049> highest<00:01:46.079> rate<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> fires

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it has one of the highest rate of fires

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.280 
it has one of the highest rate of fires
and<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> feel<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.930> extra

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and now I feel like that one extra

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
and now I feel like that one extra
bullet<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.220> need<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.880> help

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
bullet that I don't need can help

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
bullet that I don't need can help
definitely<00:01:51.750> kill<00:01:51.960> those<00:01:52.170> people<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.649> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
definitely kill those people because I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.200 
definitely kill those people because I
always<00:01:52.979> felt<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.369> somebody<00:01:53.579> will<00:01:53.790> run<00:01:53.970> away

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
always felt like somebody will run away

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060 
always felt like somebody will run away
just<00:01:54.450> before<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.380> itch<00:01:55.560> shot<00:01:55.890> in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
just before I can get the itch shot in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.670 
just before I can get the itch shot in
so<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.759> only<00:01:56.909> take<00:01:57.060> seven<00:01:57.719> shots<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so now it will only take seven shots the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.770 
so now it will only take seven shots the

for all playlists but it looks like
three<00:05:31.440> four<00:05:31.620> threes<00:05:31.860> only<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.370> be<00:05:32.490> targeting

certain<00:05:33.360> playlists<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.289> ones<00:05:34.530> that<00:05:34.620> they<00:05:34.830> did

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
certain playlists the ones that they did

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.830 
certain playlists the ones that they did
mention<00:05:35.250> previously<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.120> other<00:05:36.300> boat<00:05:36.570> and

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.480 
mention previously in the other boat and
they've<00:05:37.020> called<00:05:37.380> them<00:05:37.530> competitive<00:05:37.919> playlist

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
so we don't know which ones but they'll

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.409 
so we don't know which ones but they'll

playlists<00:05:42.840> now<00:05:43.380> I<00:05:43.410> would<00:05:43.740> like<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:44.039> see<00:05:44.220> this

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
playlists now I would like to see this

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.360 
playlists now I would like to see this
implemented<00:05:44.940> across<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.600> board<00:05:45.870> because<00:05:46.370> CSR

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
implemented across the board because CSR

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.310 
implemented across the board because CSR
has<00:05:47.550> been<00:05:47.760> implemented<00:05:48.360> across<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:49.080> board

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
has been implemented across the board

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.050 
has been implemented across the board
that<00:05:49.410> means<00:05:49.860> there's<00:05:50.250> always<00:05:50.669> going<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:50.970> be

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
that means there's always going to be

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.240 
that means there's always going to be
some<00:05:51.419> player<00:05:51.810> out<00:05:52.080> there<00:05:52.110> who<00:05:52.740> has<00:05:52.979> been

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
some player out there who has been

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.279 
some player out there who has been
invested<00:05:53.970> in<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.210> particular<00:05:54.750> place<00:05:54.810> and

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
invested in a particular place and

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.930 
invested in a particular place and
therefore<00:05:55.470> cares<00:05:55.950> about<00:05:56.220> a<00:05:56.250> certain<00:05:56.460> playlist

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
therefore cares about a certain playlist

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.210 
therefore cares about a certain playlist
so<00:05:57.240> they'll<00:05:57.419> be<00:05:57.570> carrying<00:05:58.200> about<00:05:58.470> that<00:05:58.710> CSR

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
so they'll be carrying about that CSR

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.520 
so they'll be carrying about that CSR
rank<00:05:59.520> so<00:05:59.789> that<00:06:00.090> means<00:06:00.270> all<00:06:00.510> playlists<00:06:00.900> are<00:06:01.260> you

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
rank so that means all playlists are you

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.740 
rank so that means all playlists are you
know<00:06:01.650> considered<00:06:02.250> valuable<00:06:02.580> by<00:06:02.970> a<00:06:03.180> certain

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
know considered valuable by a certain

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.540 
know considered valuable by a certain
amount<00:06:03.900> of<00:06:04.080> players<00:06:04.380> so<00:06:04.710> why<00:06:05.100> not<00:06:05.220> just<00:06:05.280> put

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
amount of players so why not just put

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.190 
amount of players so why not just put
the<00:06:05.669> joining<00:06:05.940> progress<00:06:06.210> parameters<00:06:06.810> into

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
the joining progress parameters into

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.320 
the joining progress parameters into
every<00:06:07.740> place<00:06:07.979> at<00:06:08.280> a<00:06:08.310> certain<00:06:08.550> degree<00:06:08.820> I<00:06:09.120> don't

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
every place at a certain degree I don't

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.000 
every place at a certain degree I don't

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
know that's up to 3 for 3 to the side

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.590 
know that's up to 3 for 3 to the side
and<00:06:11.220> with<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:11.550> that<00:06:11.760> does<00:06:12.030> conclude<00:06:12.300> this
