has the Python not a one-shot around 11
i<00:05:58.960> guess<00:05:59.350> it<00:05:59.530> like<00:05:59.710> dies<00:05:59.920> after<00:06:00.220> around<00:06:00.430> like

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
i guess it like dies after around like

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.190 
i guess it like dies after around like
10<00:06:00.940> or<00:06:01.150> something<00:06:01.570> I<00:06:01.780> thought<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:02.020> was<00:06:02.140> a

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
10 or something I thought it was a

one-shot for a while though I know the

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.930 
one-shot for a while though I know the
stakeout<00:06:10.060> isn't<00:06:10.420> but<00:06:10.840> how<00:06:11.350> long<00:06:11.530> might<00:06:11.890> I<00:06:12.160> need
