hello<00:00:20.840> it's<00:00:21.020> fernando<00:00:21.410> here<00:00:21.620> we<00:00:21.800> will<00:00:21.950> see<00:00:22.160> a

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
hello it's fernando here we will see a

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.430 
hello it's fernando here we will see a
quality<00:00:22.670> lab<00:00:22.850> now<00:00:23.150> in<00:00:23.390> a<00:00:23.510> spa<00:00:23.720> Franco<00:00:24.080> charm<00:00:24.290> in

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
quality lab now in a spa Franco charm in

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.880 
quality lab now in a spa Franco charm in
Belgium<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:26.300> we<00:00:26.869> start<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:27.260> lap<00:00:27.440> in<00:00:27.619> a<00:00:27.710> very

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
Belgium so we start the lap in a very

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.730 
Belgium so we start the lap in a very
short<00:00:28.360> stride<00:00:29.360> let's<00:00:29.810> say<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.410> will<00:00:30.439> have<00:00:30.710> a

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
short stride let's say and I will have a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.150 
short stride let's say and I will have a
10-1<00:00:31.610> very<00:00:31.970> very<00:00:32.210> tight<00:00:32.450> corner<00:00:32.960> in<00:00:33.800> first

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
10-1 very very tight corner in first

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.510 
10-1 very very tight corner in first
year<00:00:34.400> around<00:00:35.260> 60<00:00:36.260> 65<00:00:36.739> millimeters<00:00:37.190> mallet

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
year around 60 65 millimeters mallet

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.549 
year around 60 65 millimeters mallet
it's<00:00:38.210> important<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.750> have<00:00:38.840> a<00:00:38.930> clean<00:00:39.230> exit

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
it's important to have a clean exit

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.400 
it's important to have a clean exit
because<00:00:39.770> now<00:00:40.070> we<00:00:40.129> will<00:00:40.400> have<00:00:40.610> around<00:00:41.410> 17

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
because now we will have around 17

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.130 
because now we will have around 17
seconds<00:00:42.830> with<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.489> full<00:00:43.760> throttle<00:00:44.210> passing<00:00:45.020> in

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
seconds with a full throttle passing in

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.410 
seconds with a full throttle passing in
the<00:00:46.059> traditional<00:00:47.059> rouge<00:00:47.510> corner<00:00:48.370> seven-year

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
the traditional rouge corner seven-year

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.180 
the traditional rouge corner seven-year
uphill<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:50.629> it's<00:00:50.870> not<00:00:51.050> really<00:00:51.290> a<00:00:51.440> corner<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
uphill but it's not really a corner and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.430 
uphill but it's not really a corner and
now<00:00:52.220> these<00:00:52.640> days<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:53.000> Formula<00:00:53.330> One<00:00:53.510> then<00:00:54.170> very

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
now these days in Formula One then very

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.259 
now these days in Formula One then very
very<00:00:54.710> long<00:00:54.890> straight<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:55.519> it's<00:00:55.699> important<00:00:56.210> to

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
very long straight so it's important to

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.560 
very long straight so it's important to
have<00:00:56.659> a<00:00:57.170> clean<00:00:57.860> exit<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.760> other<00:00:59.360> first

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
have a clean exit of the other first

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.290 
have a clean exit of the other first
corner<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.589> after<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.190> long<00:01:01.220> period<00:01:01.850> of<00:01:01.940> full

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
corner and after so long period of full

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.329 
corner and after so long period of full
throttle<00:01:02.330> arrive<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.500> first<00:01:03.739> combination<00:01:03.979> of

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
throttle arrive the first combination of

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.000 
throttle arrive the first combination of
corners<00:01:04.699> right<00:01:04.940> left<00:01:05.390> right<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:06.170> third<00:01:06.979> year

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
corners right left right in third year

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.600 
corners right left right in third year
not<00:01:07.850> too<00:01:08.510> slow<00:01:08.750> around<00:01:09.080> 160<00:01:10.070> kilometers<00:01:10.490> an

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
not too slow around 160 kilometers an

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.450 
not too slow around 160 kilometers an
hour<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:12.590> circuit<00:01:12.950> they<00:01:13.070> start<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.430> go

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
hour the circuit they start to go

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.120 
hour the circuit they start to go
downhill<00:01:13.940> in<00:01:14.390> this<00:01:14.570> point<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.380> we<00:01:15.560> have<00:01:15.740> the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
downhill in this point so we have the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.830 
downhill in this point so we have the
first<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:16.580> corner<00:01:17.000> very<00:01:17.180> long<00:01:17.450> corner

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
first right corner very long corner

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.370 
first right corner very long corner
around<00:01:18.350> 120<00:01:19.310> kilometres<00:01:19.460> an<00:01:19.760> hour<00:01:20.380> quickly

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
around 120 kilometres an hour quickly

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.800 
around 120 kilometres an hour quickly
after<00:01:21.680> left<00:01:22.250> corner<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:22.790> for<00:01:23.030> gear<00:01:23.240> very<00:01:23.510> fast

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
after left corner in for gear very fast

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.290 
after left corner in for gear very fast
we<00:01:24.140> keep<00:01:24.440> going<00:01:24.650> down<00:01:25.040> T<00:01:25.370> in<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.670> circuit<00:01:26.060> so

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
we keep going down T in the circuit so

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.530 
we keep going down T in the circuit so
very<00:01:26.540> easy<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.960> reach<00:01:27.140> high<00:01:28.010> speed<00:01:28.430> very<00:01:29.330> very

very easy to reach high speed very very

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.490 
very easy to reach high speed very very

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
the track chains and we start to going

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.800 
the track chains and we start to going
uphill<00:01:38.120> to<00:01:38.540> recover<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:40.420> altitude<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.600> we

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
uphill to recover the altitude that we

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.380 
uphill to recover the altitude that we
had<00:01:42.020> at<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.230> beginning<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.770> lab<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.670> have

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
had at the beginning of the lab so have

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.360 
had at the beginning of the lab so have
a<00:01:44.420> combination<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.230> high<00:01:45.650> speed<00:01:46.010> she<00:01:46.160> gains

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
a combination of high speed she gains

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
a combination of high speed she gains
