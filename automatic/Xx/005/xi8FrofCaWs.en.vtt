00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.960
 was the 13th is the first work that hp 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.420
 how to measure that it has a screen of 13 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.009
 inches with a resolution of 1366 per 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.800
 768 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.220
 it has 4 gb of ram and is equipped with a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.860
 core i5 storage effect in one 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.440
 ssd then his system response is 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.809
 a pretty fast job 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.350
 although important as we expect 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.510
 ultrabooks and it's not as 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.780
 thin or as light as some others 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.489
 models with their 1 and a half pounds and almost 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.809
 2 centimeters thick but still 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.239
 so it has some specs 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.839
 cool it 's very light to download 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.640
 to use on a daily basis 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.850
 the connections he has are on the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.609
 left is a USB connection a connection 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.610
 hdmi and a network connection plus a 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.300
 sd and e card connector 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.580
 energy 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.620
 on the right side is the headset jack 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.479
 and one more usb connection 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.220
 it is very interesting the radio the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.740
 Their responses are fast for both 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.360
 call how much to open apps 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.030
 much merit from ssd 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.890
 but for games and regional are so 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.950
 even interesting because the graph 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.040
 integrated intel processor 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.610
 in this case of the generation 3.005 sandy bridge 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.010
 not yet so convincing despite 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.540
 not be a very powerful GPU gives to 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.390
 risk some games some franchises 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.140
 lighter than she is weak or the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 own devil 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.140
 folio 3 found on the market by a 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.810
 between 3,000 and 3,500 reais, which 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.580
 It's not very cheap but it's still 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.010
 below some competitors such as those in 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.410
 book with a 3-inch screen is 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.390
 being sold by almost 5 thousand options 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.360
 cheaper as the work that gives this 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.180
 that is there in the house of the 2 thousand almost three 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.110
 thousand reais but it does not come equipped with 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.610
 ssd then it is a considerable loss photo 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.710
 3 is a good option for those who do not want 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.970
 spend a lot of ultrabook but also not 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.250
 want to give up some 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.070
 important features like a ssd 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.110
 do not bother with the size and weight a 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.209
 slightly higher than some competitors 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.310
 this was the analysis prevented foley 13 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.270
 more detail you find in the analysis
