00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.589
 the car wash jerks on motorists can put so much effort into owning a car 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.870
 to wash they opt for hyper modern streets 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.489
 no more brushes but a big win 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:12.559
 the inside are done 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 it is all at the expense of the small car wash competition 

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:16.880
 killing 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.199
 prices decline 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.449
 and with that the battle for the dirty car is in full swing 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.990
 the Serbian car on the road all day with a lot of junk 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.720
 carwashes stand out in that not only the outside but also the inside 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.470
 is cleaned as here in schiedam 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.920
 because this is not just a ball street this is a mega wax complex 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.250
 where 200 cars per hour are run through 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.750
 to the outside seconds 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.820
 a conveyor belt to stand for the inside it is the newest of the newest 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.210
 the alpine country is 40 meters long 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.970
 we have ten of them 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.730
 ten people a month 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 and yes they work at the moment and therefore wait first 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.470
 the engine would put on the drama that was already made and then last it 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.560
 vacuuming 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.570
 the majority of 10 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.030
 the client in this case a reporter stands by and looks at it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.320
 house nicer to let the car so we reach everything 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.420
 something for the people 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.820
 The Netherlands has 18 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 185 forest street in all shapes and sizes 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.380
 were driving through 35 million times a year 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.190
 the market is booming brands time or sense to do it yourself is no longer there 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.720
 a bit lazy 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.660
 do not feel like 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.970
 more and more municipalities are banning pay attention to street passes 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.840
 i just think so 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.230
 that was Saturday between nickname experiences from that your car on 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.520
 a band is put through it 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.140
 are often a lot of bells and whistles for nicer entertaining things 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.880
 children but in the meantime the competition is killing sometimes try as 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.370
 small postelstraat but you box against those ultramodern ones 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.690
 The smaller ones also disappear or try to lure the customers promotions 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.890
 at a number of refueling times it was both for the price and the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.700
 the second happened for 2 euros yes the Turks we all participate 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.420
 Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water fetched by a mess would be the car wash 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.680
 more environmentally friendly than the bucket with them 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.669
 We know that there are around 100,000 pounds of junk 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.599
 and the sewer flushed due to the world being on the street and that is actually 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.619
 not good 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.409
 the bosstraat is more expensive 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.409
 it is so easy there i'm going to do magic trick again 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.609
 next year the construction of the largest coors in Rotterdam will start 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.189
 Europe 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.189
 nice to make such a pole at an appointment he gets 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.579
 in that case 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.020
 and I don't think so 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.379
 all too well that men were foreseen to do that tomorrow 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.280
 hope so too automatically
