00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 there is a doctor web company 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.840
 arrest given good two options 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.390
 action this check file on your 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.530
 computer 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.620
 and check your site window 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.360
 Here you start checking the files check 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.900
 the files that is the mayor are on the page 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.410
 nhl tab check files but he 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.280
 called listing any file with symbian for example 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.260
 any there 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.570
 the picture is a case of war in it 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.360
 check 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.450
 and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.260
 naturally soviet should 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.230
 download 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.030
 file to yourself anna crn 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.670
 after which the test takes place 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.850
 here it takes a little time 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 and third such 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649
 we see that he is on the new tax 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.350
 information 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.400
 paired with them said his person 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.990
 while suffering patients can 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.240
 open the window 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.000
 and if you want for example a lot right 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.009
 check it out at the same time he doesn't 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.499
 stop one by one 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.759
 then you need to use here 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.159
 such advice and and 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.030
 we activate all the rules 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.900
 in 1 m 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.099
 archives benfici temper 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.870
 and upload again to this service 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.069
 your verification you receive information 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.729
 on all 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.049
 the ferry which is located 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.400
 that's just enough to give small 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.579
 file absolutely fit 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.749
 Next, check the link and consider 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.719
 that it is here here for asman who 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.599
 need to lead address 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.789
 For example 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.639
 there is a mobile theme site 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.109
 mobile contract but here's a penny of opera 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.389
 writes that this danger 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.430
 that is the scene 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.430
 we are choosing progress 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.829
 eg 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.599
 any page that you 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.999
 interested we press how 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.879
 that is, I select the right mouse button 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.629
 Io called context menu 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.359
 southern copy 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.979
 opening the tab inserting joule 5 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.109
 Kievproject with mouse note insert 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.599
 I put in the field with him checking 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.230
 Now let's see what we have here 40 I have 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.859
 I can assure you that there is a site that took 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:28.799
 a link 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.799
 previously a virus 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.379
 because as we we go an old project 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.489
 here and here some trouble 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.919
 discovered notes decided to check what the end 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.379
 antivirus what is the second stage 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.769
 says that everything is fine 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.959
 even if scott iraq says not 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.409
 fine 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.969
 here is the attack 10 action report information about 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.239
 the page 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.999
 there is enough information to 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.790
 find out what is where and how the third stage 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.229
 us 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.689
 lucky there is no virus to us 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.279
 lucky to demonstrate 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.279
 execution 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.549
 the percentage of the work of this savisaar 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.169
 but he is the most obvious example I 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.409
 I can for example bring the following 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.579
 here you get some spam 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.719
 mailing here but not opened 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.719
 there are mailboxes that are vodka 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.469
 constantly spam years 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.189
 we open 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.389
 out of words 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.389
 ismo tremasova someone areas are offered 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.920
 m basically by the way it could be links 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.860
 with redirection but even with 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.050
 redirecting semen to copy 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.069
 link address and look 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.849
 what will we do by the way to highlight 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.029
 text in the box you can click the outline and 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:54.289

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.090
 poker 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.730
 and by the way he would leave 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.330
 copied link housing check 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.330

 and if it is stated that the director was killed 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.219
 redirecting nato itself 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.319

 Kiev 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.110
 can't imagine checking 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.509
 car center is the best option 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.830
