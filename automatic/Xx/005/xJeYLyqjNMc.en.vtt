00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
they're simply collections of photos

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.630 
they're simply collections of photos
that<00:00:15.599> are<00:00:15.990> logically<00:00:16.859> grouped<00:00:16.980> under<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
that are logically grouped under a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.849 
that are logically grouped under a
common<00:00:18.119> heading<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.289> let's<00:00:19.470> go<00:00:19.650> ahead<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
common heading so let's go ahead and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
common heading so let's go ahead and
look<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.400> our<00:00:20.550> sets<00:00:21.230> page<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.630> we<00:00:24.630> can

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
look at our sets page here and we can

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.660 
look at our sets page here and we can
see<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.170> many<00:00:25.529> sets<00:00:25.949> associated

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
see that we have many sets associated

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.419 
see that we have many sets associated
with<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> bike<00:00:27.060> club<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.769> if<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.949> had<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> free

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
with the bike club and if we had a free

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.220 
with the bike club and if we had a free
account<00:00:29.760> we'd<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.240> limited<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.720> actually

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
account we'd be limited to actually

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
account we'd be limited to actually
three<00:00:31.560> sets<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.489> since<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.090> pro

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
three sets but since we have the pro

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.150 
three sets but since we have the pro
account<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.110> unlimited<00:00:34.410> number<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
account we can have unlimited number of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.729 
account we can have unlimited number of
sets<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.140> sets<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.680> be

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
sets and we can see that sets can be

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.690 
sets and we can see that sets can be
either<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:39.180> an<00:00:39.329> individual<00:00:40.050> a

with<00:02:09.649> our<00:02:09.770> sets<00:02:10.069> if<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.369> have<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.520> pro<00:02:10.759> account

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
with our sets if we have a pro account

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.839 
with our sets if we have a pro account
is<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.930> organize<00:02:12.440> them<00:02:12.680> into<00:02:12.860> collections

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
is we can organize them into collections

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.940 
is we can organize them into collections
so<00:02:14.599> let's<00:02:14.720> go<00:02:14.840> ahead<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:14.989> look<00:02:15.200> at<00:02:15.440> our<00:02:15.620> bike

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
so let's go ahead and look at our bike

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.309 
so let's go ahead and look at our bike
club<00:02:16.220> example<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.540> check<00:02:17.989> out<00:02:18.170> the

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
club example and and check out the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.780 
club example and and check out the
collections<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.130> are<00:02:19.190> associated<00:02:19.489> with

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
collections that are associated with

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.780 
collections that are associated with
this<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:21.319> we<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.620> see<00:02:21.739> we've<00:02:21.860> got<00:02:22.040> quite<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
this and we can see we've got quite a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.460 
this and we can see we've got quite a
few<00:02:23.000> collections<00:02:23.330> here<00:02:23.750> let's<00:02:24.080> look<00:02:24.200> at<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
few collections here let's look at the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.530 
few collections here let's look at the
one<00:02:24.590> called<00:02:24.860> Utah<00:02:25.310> we<00:02:25.730> see<00:02:25.880> we<00:02:25.970> have<00:02:26.090> seven

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
one called Utah we see we have seven

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.900 
one called Utah we see we have seven
sets<00:02:26.840> underneath<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.530> let's<00:02:28.519> drill<00:02:28.880> down

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
sets underneath that let's drill down

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.400 
sets underneath that let's drill down
into<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:31.489> our<00:02:31.900> utah<00:02:32.900> collection

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
into that and so in our utah collection

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.550 
into that and so in our utah collection
we<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:34.120> we<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.239> sets<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.989> are<00:02:36.230> all

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
we have we have sets that are all

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.559 
we have we have sets that are all
related<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:37.100> utah<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.700> we<00:02:37.819> have<00:02:37.970> sets<00:02:38.269> about<00:02:38.540> a

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
related to utah so we have sets about a

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.890 
related to utah so we have sets about a
place<00:02:39.280> gooseberry<00:02:40.280> mesa<00:02:40.519> or<00:02:40.880> an<00:02:41.060> event<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.690> bike

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
place gooseberry mesa or an event a bike

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.539 
place gooseberry mesa or an event a bike
race<00:02:42.200> at<00:02:43.190> deer<00:02:43.549> valley<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.549> really

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
race at deer valley and so really

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.030 
race at deer valley and so really
collections<00:02:47.239> are<00:02:47.480> just<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.959> higher<00:02:48.260> level<00:02:48.860> of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
collections are just a higher level of

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400 
collections are just a higher level of
organization<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.600> once<00:02:50.959> we<00:02:51.140> get

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
organization so that once we get

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.380 
organization so that once we get
thousands<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.489> pictures<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:53.030> our<00:02:53.150> flickr

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
thousands of pictures in our flickr

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.080 
thousands of pictures in our flickr
account<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.110> perhaps<00:02:54.290> hundreds<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:55.010> sets<00:02:55.310> we

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
account and perhaps hundreds of sets we

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.990 
account and perhaps hundreds of sets we
have<00:02:56.299> another<00:02:56.600> tool<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.380> help<00:02:57.709> us<00:02:57.950> find<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
have another tool to help us find the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.870 
have another tool to help us find the
pictures<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.540> we<00:02:59.690> want<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.019> see<00:03:00.849> so<00:03:01.849> let's

look<00:03:02.180> at<00:03:02.330> some<00:03:02.480> other<00:03:02.540> ways<00:03:02.870> that<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:03.260> can<00:03:03.440> find

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
look at some other ways that we can find

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.640 
look at some other ways that we can find
photos<00:03:04.549> from<00:03:04.760> within<00:03:05.120> our<00:03:05.269> flickr<00:03:05.540> account

about and this particular view is called

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.129 
about and this particular view is called
a<00:03:54.650> tag<00:03:54.920> cloud<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.790> each<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.389> these<00:03:56.510> words<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:57.109> a

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
a tag cloud and each of these words is a

big<00:04:07.280> word<00:04:07.489> like<00:04:07.730> da<00:04:07.970> tree<00:04:08.359> know<00:04:08.510> for<00:04:08.750> instance

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
big word like da tree know for instance

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.950 
big word like da tree know for instance
let's<00:04:09.410> click<00:04:09.739> in<00:04:09.889> on<00:04:10.040> that

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
let's click in on that

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.060 
let's click in on that

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.700 
and this shows us all the photos in date
order<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:16.180> are<00:04:16.330> assigned<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:16.870> tag<00:04:17.350> and

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
order that are assigned to that tag and

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.880 
order that are assigned to that tag and
you<00:04:17.800> can<00:04:17.950> see<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.880> know<00:04:18.970> we've<00:04:19.120> got<00:04:19.270> 114<00:04:20.200> pages

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
you can see you know we've got 114 pages

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
of photos with that tag so the tag cloud

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.900 
of photos with that tag so the tag cloud
is<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.420> kind<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.140> neat<00:04:26.290> way<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:27.520> research

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
is a kind of a neat way to to research

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.830 
is a kind of a neat way to to research
pictures<00:04:28.650> let's<00:04:29.650> look<00:04:29.860> at<00:04:30.010> some<00:04:30.160> other<00:04:30.250> ways

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
pictures let's look at some other ways

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.410 
pictures let's look at some other ways
we<00:04:31.840> can<00:04:32.050> do<00:04:32.200> this<00:04:32.230> let's<00:04:33.130> go<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:34.180> map

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
we can do this let's go to the map

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.620 
we can do this let's go to the map
function<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.580> now<00:04:36.580> each<00:04:36.790> time<00:04:37.060> we<00:04:37.270> upload<00:04:37.300> a

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
function and now each time we upload a

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.680 
function and now each time we upload a
photo<00:04:37.990> we<00:04:38.530> can<00:04:38.770> actually<00:04:39.480> assign<00:04:40.480> the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
photo we can actually assign the

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.290 
photo we can actually assign the
location<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.530> photo<00:04:42.100> that<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.090> photo

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
location of that photo that that photo

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.440 
location of that photo that that photo
was<00:04:43.480> taken<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:45.130> our<00:04:45.160> map<00:04:45.520> here<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.060> we<00:04:46.300> can

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
was taken to our map here and we can

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.730 
was taken to our map here and we can
look<00:04:46.570> at<00:04:46.690> this<00:04:46.810> map<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:47.290> several<00:04:47.650> different

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
look at this map in several different

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.830 
look at this map in several different
views<00:04:48.190> that's<00:04:48.400> click<00:04:48.760> in<00:04:48.910> on<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.180> hybrid<00:04:49.600> view

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
views that's click in on the hybrid view

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.430 
views that's click in on the hybrid view
so<00:04:50.530> that's<00:04:50.710> kind<00:04:50.920> of<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:51.070> hybrid<00:04:52.080> street<00:04:53.080> view

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
so that's kind of a hybrid street view

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.300 
so that's kind of a hybrid street view
and<00:04:54.030> with<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.060> with<00:04:55.890> geographical<00:04:56.890> features

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
and with that with geographical features

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.700 
and with that with geographical features
and<00:04:57.580> we<00:04:58.480> see<00:04:58.600> this<00:04:58.630> pink<00:04:58.990> dot<00:04:59.260> here<00:04:59.560> and

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
and we see this pink dot here and

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.320 
and we see this pink dot here and
there's<00:04:59.890> actually<00:05:00.130> one<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.640> our<00:05:00.790> photos<00:05:01.150> was

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
there's actually one of our photos was

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.270 
there's actually one of our photos was
taken<00:05:01.690> here<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.170> we<00:05:02.260> click<00:05:02.530> in<00:05:02.560> on<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:03.040> and

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
taken here and we click in on that and

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.970 
taken here and we click in on that and
we<00:05:04.090> can<00:05:04.270> see<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.600> photo<00:05:04.870> or<00:05:05.230> emit<00:05:05.530> perhaps<00:05:05.830> it

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
we can see the photo or emit perhaps it

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.010 
we can see the photo or emit perhaps it
was<00:05:06.100> multiple<00:05:06.610> photos<00:05:06.880> that<00:05:07.390> was<00:05:07.540> taken<00:05:07.930> at
