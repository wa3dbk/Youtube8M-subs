00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 run the kibiz 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.440
 and when 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.710
 presented by kinopolis pour 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.199
 until half-time, it looked like one 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.449
 relaxed evening for the fans of the hsg 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.880
 wetzlar from the middle hessen seemed 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.419
 more than fair to your favorite role 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.180
 become 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:35.199
 sovereign dominant the folder had all 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.170
 clearly the hsg in hand again and again 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.720
 the again strong new addition manas 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.150
 head over left and to one 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.010
 strong fighting power 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.620
 July is here after the ball loss 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.100
 after the game device conquers back 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.309
 and oli ivanovic with the hit after 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.220
 the first half wetzlar led with 20 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.580
 To eleven the game seemed in favor of the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.970
 host already decided 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.989
 but something in the tea seemed 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.450
 to have a drowsing effect 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.130
 because after the half only determined 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.590
 still the guests from friesenheim the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.110
 partie after an interim 10 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.240
 was right after the break 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.659
 the projection of the wetzlarer within 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.250
 from ten minutes to five gates 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.620
 Shrinked the thread in the HSG 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.630
 Now completely torn the game 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.670
 the simplest passes failed 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.160
 speed reaction shortened friesenheim 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.750
 keep the residue well ten minutes 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.370
 before closing the two separated 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:40.270
 teams only three goals 26 to 23 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.330
 just from the view of the hsg 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.130
 leader ivano balic it was his 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.520
 Team with this exclamation mark 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.350
 wetzlar shook awake again 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.740
 calmer and safer 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.060
 also in the defense never friesenheim 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.350
 now the time of it 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:04.720
 the guests with hasty conclusions 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.640
 in the end it was 32 to 27 which hsg brings 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.280
 the victory deserves in the end 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.789
 home and gets up in the table now 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.789
 place nine 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.989
 Today we have a good game 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.409
 especially the first half was very 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.579
 very good have come into the game what 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.749
 very important because you have to 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.599
 I think we have taken into consideration 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:26.480
 Ten post-mortem hits had us today 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.969
 of course, the matter has made it harder 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.069
 yes it will be tight again that was not so 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.299
 as we had wished but for 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.250
 luck could change switch again 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.540
 and have the game good for the stage 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.579
 have brought two points and are 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.870
 happy 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.439
 for the next few weeks we will then 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.909
 in berlin we will see what kate 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.510
 Magdeburg comes your team of 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.269
 hour 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.639
 I think you can also say that 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.069
 we got into the game badly 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.510
 we have two options for the pace 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.790
 counter-attack or 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.989
 in us if I always have the ball if you 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.439
 exposed to rain 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.140
 they only get into the game with difficulty 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:10.390
 sega has better always has one 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.329
 had ready solution and must get out too 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.970
 play 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.230
 especially in the form of ivano balic im 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.620
 weber together 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.750
 of ghana it was of course not in 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.709
 So powerful ran to get into the second 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.140
 half 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.200
 that's why the blow was no more 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.200
 ready
