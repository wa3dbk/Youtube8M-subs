00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
the conditioner has so much slip that's

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.410 
the conditioner has so much slip that's
why<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.000> one<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.210> my<00:00:50.329> favorite<00:00:50.870> conditioners

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
why it's one of my favorite conditioners

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.670 
why it's one of my favorite conditioners
that<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:54.050> takes<00:00:54.409> out<00:00:54.649> all<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.120> tangles<00:00:57.909> so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
that it takes out all the tangles so

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.560 
that it takes out all the tangles so
this<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.860> what<00:01:01.040> I<00:01:01.070> do<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.399> pile<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:02.030> on<00:01:02.120> top<00:01:02.149> of<00:01:02.390> my

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570

it<00:01:06.610> soak<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:08.360> guess<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:09.049> what<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:09.350> see

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
I don't do all that I'm impatient I

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.650 
I don't do all that I'm impatient I
guess<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.340> comes<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.850> age

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
guess that comes with age

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.020 
guess that comes with age
I'm<00:02:28.350> nothing<00:02:28.620> apart<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.580> hoping<00:02:29.850> to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
I'm nothing apart it in a hoping to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.570 
I'm nothing apart it in a hoping to
different<00:02:30.360> parts<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> way<00:02:32.550> I

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
different parts and so this is the way I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.490 
different parts and so this is the way I
do<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.150> takes<00:02:34.250> part<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.400> any<00:02:35.820> time<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
do it takes part in any time and so I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.260 
do it takes part in any time and so I
stretch<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> out<00:02:40.800> with<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.250> hands<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.030> can

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
stretch it out with my hands so I can

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.040 
stretch it out with my hands so I can
get<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:44.040> frizz<00:02:44.400> or<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:45.000> much<00:02:45.180> prison<00:02:45.660> I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
get all the frizz or as much prison I

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.880 
get all the frizz or as much prison I
can't<00:02:46.350> out<00:02:47.870> because<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:49.050> think<00:02:49.110> what<00:02:49.440> our<00:02:49.590> here

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
can't out because I think what our here

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.880 
can't out because I think what our here
is<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.310> hard<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.600> all<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.350> frizz<00:02:52.650> out

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.290 

cuz<00:02:55.890> then<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.250> will<00:02:56.340> start<00:02:56.610> looking<00:02:56.760> more<00:02:57.090> like

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
cuz then it will start looking more like

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.820 
cuz then it will start looking more like
a<00:02:57.330> jheri<00:02:57.690> curl<00:02:57.780> no<00:02:58.680> we<00:02:58.890> don't<00:02:59.130> want<00:02:59.400> that<00:03:00.830> okay

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
a jheri curl no we don't want that okay

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.340 
a jheri curl no we don't want that okay
so<00:03:02.360> I'll<00:03:03.360> make<00:03:03.600> sure<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.110> every<00:03:04.470> string

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:16.270 
so I'll make sure it's on every string

and a whole bunch of other stuff and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.199 
and a whole bunch of other stuff and
this<00:03:26.190> softens<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.900> eco<00:03:28.170> styler<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.760> we<00:03:29.940> don't

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
this softens the eco styler so we don't

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:39.250 
this softens the eco styler so we don't

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.330 

I'll<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:42.230> much<00:03:43.230> as<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.560> can<00:03:43.890> without

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
and also has gel on it

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.670 
and also has gel on it
and<00:04:09.739> so<00:04:10.280> it's<00:04:10.519> really<00:04:10.760> easy<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:11.599> glue<00:04:12.290> the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
and so it's really easy to glue the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.490 
and so it's really easy to glue the
edges<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.910> I<00:04:14.239> make<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.630> go<00:04:14.780> back<00:04:15.080> because<00:04:15.349> I

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
edges and I make it go back because I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:27.730 
edges and I make it go back because I
can't<00:04:15.799> stand<00:04:16.310> here<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:17.000> my<00:04:17.150> face<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:27.320> it's<00:04:27.530> so

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
can't stand here in my face and it's so

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.680 
can't stand here in my face and it's so
hot<00:04:27.950> today<00:04:28.160> my<00:04:28.490> hair<00:04:28.669> is<00:04:28.790> already<00:04:29.240> starting<00:04:29.660> to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
hot today my hair is already starting to

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:43.780 
hot today my hair is already starting to
dry<00:04:39.340> so<00:04:40.340> I'm<00:04:40.520> just<00:04:40.790> with<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:42.280> make<00:04:43.280> sure<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.520> got

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
dry so I'm just with it make sure I got

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.260 
dry so I'm just with it make sure I got
every<00:04:44.240> storm<00:04:47.590> alright<00:04:48.590> it's<00:04:48.860> been<00:04:49.010> about<00:04:49.270> five

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
every storm alright it's been about five

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.050 
every storm alright it's been about five
hours<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:52.220> is<00:04:52.490> dry<00:04:54.100> it's<00:04:55.100> really<00:04:55.520> hot<00:04:55.760> here

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
hours and it is dry it's really hot here

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.750 
hours and it is dry it's really hot here
so<00:04:56.169> maybe<00:04:57.169> that's<00:04:57.470> why<00:04:57.770> because<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.550> was

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
so maybe that's why because I was

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.490 
so maybe that's why because I was
surprised<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.600> didn't<00:04:59.840> think<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.110> was<00:05:00.169> going<00:05:00.380> to

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
surprised I didn't think it was going to

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.730 
surprised I didn't think it was going to
places<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.190> do<00:05:01.250> my<00:05:01.490> hair<00:05:01.700> so<00:05:02.060> late<00:05:02.389> so<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:04.660> felt

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
places I do my hair so late so I felt

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.210 
places I do my hair so late so I felt
I'm<00:05:06.740> blind<00:05:07.160> Washington<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:11.360> shea<00:05:11.660> butter

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
I'm blind Washington and the shea butter

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.710 
I'm blind Washington and the shea butter
it<00:05:13.630> made<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.810> echo<00:05:15.080> stellar<00:05:15.590> not<00:05:16.100> be<00:05:16.370> so<00:05:16.820> fresh

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
it made the echo stellar not be so fresh

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.920 
it made the echo stellar not be so fresh
so<00:05:17.750> I<00:05:18.620> guess<00:05:19.220> do<00:05:19.990> this<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.350> all<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:22.450> like<00:05:23.450> it

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
so I guess do this and all that like it

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:34.900 
so I guess do this and all that like it
