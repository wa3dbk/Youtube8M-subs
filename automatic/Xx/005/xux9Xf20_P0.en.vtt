actually do so on my right-hand side
we've<00:01:39.180> got<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> bar<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.900> slider<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.470> you're

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
we've got the bar and slider and you're

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.120 
we've got the bar and slider and you're
going<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.220> they're<00:01:41.369> constructed<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.180> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
bending so if you go down you're sliding

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
bending so if you go down you're sliding
along<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.280> ground<00:02:05.549> you're<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.240> going<00:02:06.570> to

along the ground you're not going to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
along the ground you're not going to
wear<00:02:06.780> away<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> ends<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.740> your<00:02:07.860> grips<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.369> your

wear away the ends of your grips or your
throttle<00:02:09.000> tubes<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:10.289> what<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.649> is

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
throttle tubes so that's what this is

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.440 
throttle tubes so that's what this is
intended<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.280> they<00:02:11.940> come<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.209> three

your handlebars they're also going to

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.399 
your handlebars they're also going to
have<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> version<00:02:25.780> that's<00:02:26.079> going<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:26.379> a

this<00:04:18.070> plastic<00:04:18.609> cutout<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.000> it's<00:04:19.090> going<00:04:19.180> to

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
this plastic cutout and it's going to

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.029 
this plastic cutout and it's going to
have<00:04:19.359> this<00:04:19.479> C<00:04:19.750> channel<00:04:20.139> right<00:04:20.289> here<00:04:20.500> the

have this C channel right here the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.800 
have this C channel right here the
reason<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.519> have<00:04:21.669> this<00:04:21.849> C<00:04:22.090> channel<00:04:22.419> cutout<00:04:22.690> to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
reason you have this C channel cutout to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.839 
reason you have this C channel cutout to
the<00:04:22.900> plastic<00:04:23.320> piece<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:24.520> it's<00:04:24.669> going<00:04:24.760> to

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
the plastic piece is that it's going to

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.040 
the plastic piece is that it's going to
add<00:04:24.969> rigidity

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
add rigidity

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.379 
add rigidity
maintaining<00:04:26.470> flexibility<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:27.789> if<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.240> on

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
maintaining flexibility so if this is on

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.820 
maintaining flexibility so if this is on
your<00:04:28.509> bar<00:04:28.750> you're<00:04:29.139> riding<00:04:29.470> down<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.590> road<00:04:29.680> and

your bar you're riding down the road and
somebody<00:04:30.099> bumps<00:04:30.520> into<00:04:30.669> you<00:04:30.759> it's<00:04:31.300> going<00:04:31.449> to

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
somebody bumps into you it's going to

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.450 
somebody bumps into you it's going to
actually<00:04:31.720> flex<00:04:32.440> it's<00:04:32.680> going<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.860> absorb<00:04:32.979> some

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
actually flex it's going to absorb some

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.010 
actually flex it's going to absorb some
of<00:04:33.699> that<00:04:33.789> impact<00:04:34.210> so<00:04:34.389> you<00:04:34.419> don't<00:04:34.659> feel<00:04:34.870> the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
of that impact so you don't feel the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.559 
of that impact so you don't feel the
whole<00:04:35.259> impact<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.949> your<00:04:36.009> handlebar<00:04:36.849> it<00:04:37.330> took<00:04:37.479> a
