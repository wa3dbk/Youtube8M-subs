00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.480
 Hello, how are you doing? 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.369
 because today I come with a Christmas idea 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.710
 for decorating dishes in these 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.900
 dates can be for Christmas Eve or 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.640
 New Year 's Eve special days or 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.769
 any food that we have with friends 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
 or family members and we want our 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.609
 appetizer and dessert dishes are left 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.589
 a little more originals and nothing here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.179
 I leave these two ideas that I hope you 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.130
 like and I'll tell you how I did it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.630
 which is very simple 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.940
 Well, first let's do the one 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.399
 the snacks I have here the spills 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.290
 I'm going to use only cheese and ham 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 you can use any other loin rod 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.790
 what you want a little bit of mint 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.090
 to make 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.640
 a little green on the plate 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.710
 first with two sticks of these that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 are for meat bugs I'm going to do 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.430
 the shape of the triangle because I'm going to 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.500
 make a Christmas tree and so what 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.190
 use as a day so as not to deviate and that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.190
 stay perfect 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.260
 I'll go alternating peppermint cheese and 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.500
 ham to make a line and that we have the 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.070
 tree decorated as simulating golden 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.070
 Red and green 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.800
 what you can do whatever you want by 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.090
 Of course you can use even another herb 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.370
 like rosemary or something but the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.760
 Peppermint gives very good smell to the dish 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.760
 as well 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.070
 and of course you can cut the cheese and 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.980
 ham as you want now I'm going to put 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.690
 doing as the trunk of the tree you are 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.080
 slices of toast though you can 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.450
 use peaks or normal bread or whatever you want 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.400
 and apart in a basket I will put the rest 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.440
 of bread to accompany the appetizer but 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.860
 so it remains the complete decoration of 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.670
 a tree you already see an original way of 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.670
 present the appetizers 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.090
 well now we go to the plate of the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.470
 desserts good sweet desserts 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.020
 typical christmas candy nougat 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.390
 chocolate nougat how rich the leaf 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 the christmas drina the wine reds the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.280
 polvorones good everything we have 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.560
 by hand 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.080
 and good cutting the nougat in strips 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.590
 I'm going to draw a star 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.600
 yours that you choose something 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.220
 Christmas something that is something that with 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.160
 Christmas so that the decoration is 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.410
 own no 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 nothing, as you can see, doing the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.610
 draw very easy putting the nougat 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.290
 star shaped 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.440
 I make a double line so that they remain 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.250
 because they take thick the drawing and also 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.770
 is machorro 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.240
 and now at each point I'm going to put 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.240
 example one sheet per day 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.480
 in the center then I'll put some wine 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.980
 you can load it of course much more 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.780
 and you can put many more things but 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.150
 as an idea because nothing wanted to do something 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.459
 so simple and that looks good 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.680
 in a very original way from the bid 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.750
 or the dessert are boiling equally 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.370
 all the Christmas sweets but good 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.319
 more Christmas still mind 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.970
 and nothing, these are the two ideas that 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.280
 I wanted to leave you I hope you like what 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.360
 happen and happy to party and see you in the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.360
 next video chao
