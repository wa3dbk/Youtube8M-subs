00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.150
 video presentation of the brand new 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.319
 ipad r in this video we will see 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.240
 together what are the novelties 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.309
 present on this new generation of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.990
 ipad and also for example 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.790
 comparisons and see more in detail 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.790
 some new features 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.630
 describe the design of the ipad r is enough 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.250
 simple take a mini ipad you the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.340
 put on steroids and you get a 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.680
 ipad r the ipad is takes over all 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.410
 aesthetic codes of the ipad mini 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.989
 it is available in sidereal gray and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.250
 also white silver they are colored 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.199
 really beautiful no do you 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.480
 not worry when choosing or will be 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.879
 fulfilled in both cases at the level 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.100
 aesthetic compare an ipad mini the ipad 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.129
 r done much bigger though 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.530
 it's exactly the same idea the same 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.149
 thickness the same look 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.739
 for example apple has reduced 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.780
 considerably the thicknesses of 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.340
 left and right borders which is not 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.769
 no worse because it allows immersion 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.260
 more interesting at the screen 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.470
 remove this mono brick look 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.210
 is also not really 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.660
 of impact on the handling being 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.100
 given that the ios software is capable of 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.250
 detect if your finger and cause 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.720
 intentionally or not on the sides 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.720
 on the back cover is not alone 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.850
 noticeable difference is the ipad logo 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.200
 it is not brilliant on ipad r and the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.780
 apple logo that seems encrusted 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.549
 now in the unibody shell a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.900
 second microphone also appears at the level of 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.990
 the back but otherwise as you can 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.970
 to see it is the same thing the same 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.950
 sheep positioning the same look 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.750
 buttons the same silver color as 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.750
 either on the padd is online family 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.300
 like every 9.7 inch ipad since the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.870
 third generation 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.880
 the ipad mini embeds a retina screen 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.010
 this one is always good effect the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.380
 picture quality is really amazing 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.970
 the colors are really sublime and the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.100
 diminished screen outline allows 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.090
 to clearly accent the immersion to 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.090
 inside the image 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.610
 whether for viewing your 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.920
 personal photos or browse 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.959
 safari for example the screen retina high 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.980
 will come out clearly the colors of 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.019
 images pictures 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.810
 the typography will be absolutely 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.239
 excellent whether it's on safari on 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.280
 sites designed for retina and also 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.890
 on ibooks for example or the letters 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.349
 looks like paper printed at the level 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.390
 of the video no complaints either video 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.269
 hd will come out wonderfully on this 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.700
 sublime screen to note also that the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.170
 performance in wide viewing angle 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.440
 are absolutely remarkable about this guy 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.440
 screen 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.260
 at the apple camera level has 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.629
 however, not much effort 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.099
 she kept the 5 megapixel sensor 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.739
 far this generation that certainly takes 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.970
 of relatively decent pictures but 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.560
 it's still pretty limited 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.209
 compared to the iphone 5 sensor is 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.209
 his burst mode and his banjo beauchesne 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.640
 just like the iphone 5 s the ipad r possesses 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.920
 the apple processor at 7 is also the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.410
 M7 processor as OVEMENT included 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.180
 in this type of processor the processor 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.520
 m7 captures all your movements 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.680
 and so the ipad to recognize what 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.540
 types of locomotion you use the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.830
 apple processor at seven and four times 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.790
 more powerful than the older generation 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.830
 apple a6 to 6 x present in the ipad of 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.360
 fourth generation 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.500
 it's a really powerful processor 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.739
 whether in your applications 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.540
 general or games it's a it's a 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.890
 processor that will be for the big 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.080
 part of the users enough 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.519
 underused since few are 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.380
 compatible apps and they 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.600
 completely use this type of 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.920
 technology but that's still 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.090
 relatively comfortable in some 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.739
 apps and some games 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.570
 relatively greedy it is a 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.709
 relatively powerful processor and who 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.709
 runs in 64 bits 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.170
 ipad r is available in two models 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.880
 wifi or wi-fi + cellular wifi + 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.530
 cell has a band at the back 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.810
 plastic that allows the waves 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.190
 cell phones to pass more easily 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.410
 so can enjoy facetime or 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.460
 safari anywhere regardless of your 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.320
 geographical position 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.239
 note that the father ipad is compatible 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.130
 with the French 4g he owns 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.170
 also a relatively integrated gps 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.790
 convenient at the level of packages I you 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.610
 advise for example if you are it is 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.350
 at sosh to take the option at 5 euros 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.910
 per month multi sim relatively 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.730
 economic who share an attack from 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.360
 our strength and from 1990 with 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.360
 your tablet 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.480
 to conclude we can say that the ipad 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.740
 is 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.720
 - a worthy representative of the family 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.220
 ipad certainly he is not exempt from 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.930
 defects like for example without a screen that 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.400
 is always better outdoors is 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.080
 also the absence of the touch sensor 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.360
 Heidi introduced and the iPhone 5 s 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.580
 another notable defect is the price 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.230
 of course the ipad r especially in 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.390
 cellular configuration is a small 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.380
 slightly higher than average prices but 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.520
 it's a little bit cheaper to 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.580
 a few dozen euros in France 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.080
 compared to the older generation 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.960
 overall it will remain a product enough 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.030
 atypical with a unique design and a 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.980
 hardware software relationship is difficult 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.700
 to find elsewhere 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.370
 do not hesitate to see them my other 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.420
 test videos on the ipad r and also of 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.420
 the smart cover on my channel
