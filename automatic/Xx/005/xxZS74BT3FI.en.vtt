00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.010
 mexico the pilot like this I hope that they are everything for good and that everything 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.149
 what they are doing in Spain what a wonder 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.989
 well before starting this video tutorial to thank all the 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.609
 guys and girls who have subscribed to my channel that I must say that 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.500
 In a short time he has had a great breakthrough thanks to all of you who 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:23.480
 support 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.099
 Everywhere, nice comments that really leave me, I thank you 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.009
 very much 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.589
 that is not little to say 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.470
 keep visiting my channel subscribing watching the videos pointed 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.750
 you already know that if you need something from me I do not know what it is 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.650
 let me know through my channel by comments or messages 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.580
 personal 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.970
 and is that maybe a friend and then 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.690
 I hope you are very well 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.880
 Well, today 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.190
 percent let's see alcor regarding the partitions 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.350
 probably many already know what it consists of so that you do not see 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.550
 but for those who do not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 let's go back to the ones a little bit 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.150
 to start as you can see I here I have only one 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.150
 partition 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.210
 and we all know that partitions are very important because in them 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.340
 can we store what is a second operating system 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.690
 or failing 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.680
 records 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.740
 that are not possible in this species and after hole for that and used it 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.469
 but that there may be question about what is the correct way to 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.640
 create it so 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.570
 today we are going to go back to that and let's see what is very simple to create 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 a partition as well as its same deletion 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.400
 Well, for them, we are going to start 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.750
 in team as you give a right click 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.630
 aqmi minister option 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.460
 let's hope it does not come out 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.960
 a little window 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.840
 15 up 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 here we are interested in this option that is called disk management 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.029
 inside it we will find 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.059
 like trancan and cádiz 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.070
 and good a curious fact 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.110
 to be able to participate in the necessary quique 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.110
 we finish it from there that we have 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:26.100
 more space that is greater in this case this gentleman 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.079
 can observe them 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.509
 so I position myself have done about a click 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:32.699
 straight 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.979
 and let's go to the option that says challenges and volume 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.849
 We were going to expect it to be done here in the space consultation for 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.489
 reflection 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.469
 while that happens we can 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.309
 and it was wanted 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:47.959
 the calculator because 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.549
 I must tell you that we will be very useful at this time 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.389
 very well once finished we will look like this window 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:06.029
 and here a box appeared in which we have to put 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:11.509
 for acts that size we want our partition for that I told them we burn 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.189
 occupy the calculator 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.370
 what is always going to be done by law is to multiply min 0 24 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.429
 for the amount that we want 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.219
 in this case like this is 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:25.689
 just test for me 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.119
 it can not be different 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.329
 obviously we are referring to the partition 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.329
 and what we get here 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.329
 is what we are going to put on this side what 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.169
 Once this is done we will click on tangles and 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.239
 and while we can take out the calculator 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.149
 we wait 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:04:00.009
 very well once this is done how can they kill here and we created another space 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:03.440
 but the process is not finished yet 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.429
 so we position ourselves on the course that appeared with a click 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:11.989
 We were going to give a right click and we are not an option that I wanted new volume 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.549
 simple is very simple 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.329
 then until it appears 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.949
 an assistant páramo volume 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.949
 and only what we are going to do is 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.330
 next 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.659
 in this window 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:30.250
 that use assign letter we put to assign the letter quipus temos 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.550
 but I recommend that I always told you what children by default 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.779
 it is unfair 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.869
 next and feel until final 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.490
 my friends as you can see we already have 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.490
 a new partition here already warns me that I do not have 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.550
 to check again we're going to go to team 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:58.239
 and as you can see here we already have the new petition that we have created 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.469
 massa I already had 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.400
 obviously 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.050
 but it is worth mentioning that if for some reason they did not want them anymore, what 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.630
 we pay or for whatever it is no longer 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.139
 we no longer need it 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.229
 we can also eliminate laws too simple I'm going to show you 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.689
 how to do it again we express ourselves where we have not created 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.990
 we position ourselves with a click 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.550
 Yes well done 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.250
 it did not take to go out to the option that says in and mines volume 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.680
 will ask us 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.680
 and we are going to give him only 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:35.789
 again 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.770
 we position ourselves on 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.830
 newly made iker 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.889
 and we will give remove partition 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.499
 again the múzquiz and 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.270
 now we are going to return 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.180
 where do we start from? 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.210
 from where we took it in my case was this 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.099
 I'm going to give you a right tint 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:59.869
 and we're going to select the option that says extend a volume 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.830
 only here it goes to 6 100 the assistant 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.199
 until final 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.939
 and as we can see 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.330
 we only have the partition that we had from the beginning 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.740
 but to check famous go again team 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:24.719
 iniesta friends here this petition that a few moments ago has disappeared 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:25.960
 mine head 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.930
 as you can see it is very simple they do not have any difficulty 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:34.979
 besides that yes you believe your partitions can as you had already 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.789
 mentioned in the beginning store information or data they do not want 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.909
 lose at the time of formatting 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.949
 Obese defect can store another operating system already 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.189
 Well, you know that it's possible 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:53.810
 good friend after how they could realize it is very simple I hope that 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:56.399
