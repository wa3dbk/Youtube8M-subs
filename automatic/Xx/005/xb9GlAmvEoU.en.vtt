burn<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.760> aggro<00:00:39.390> build<00:00:40.100> can<00:00:41.100> beat<00:00:41.339> some<00:00:41.609> decks

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
burn or aggro build can beat some decks

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.709 
burn or aggro build can beat some decks
sometimes<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.109> once<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.609> have<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> more

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
sometimes but once when we have a more

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.829 
sometimes but once when we have a more
stable<00:00:46.350> environment<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.609> aggro<00:00:48.120> deck<00:00:48.359> so<00:00:48.570> only

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
stable environment so aggro deck so only

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.660 
stable environment so aggro deck so only
really<00:00:49.199> good<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.589> new<00:00:49.859> set<00:00:50.100> comes<00:00:50.339> out<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
really good when a new set comes out and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
really good when a new set comes out and
people<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:51.179> really<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.659> what<00:00:51.870> what's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
people don't really know what what's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.189 
people don't really know what what's
happening<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.429> guess<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.329> best<00:00:54.629> example

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
happening or I guess the best example

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.250 
happening or I guess the best example
would<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.319> when<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.649> set<00:00:56.129> rotates<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.260> then

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
would be when a set rotates out then

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.079 
would be when a set rotates out then
I'll<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.769> becomes<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.309> good<00:00:59.519> because<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
I'll go becomes very good because the

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.200 
I'll go becomes very good because the
decks<00:01:00.479> are<00:01:00.749> the<00:01:01.079> matter<00:01:01.319> has<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:02.210> become

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
decks are the matter has not become

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.530 
decks are the matter has not become
mid-range<00:01:03.899> E<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.320> combo<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:05.190> long<00:01:06.030> rangy

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
mid-range E or combo or long rangy

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
mid-range E or combo or long rangy

like having more options actually helps

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.680 
like having more options actually helps
them<00:03:51.989> more<00:03:52.410> than<00:03:53.280> your<00:03:53.699> regular<00:03:54.030> deck<00:03:54.389> builder

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
them more than your regular deck builder

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.360 
them more than your regular deck builder
because<00:03:54.870> they<00:03:55.230> need<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.500> different<00:03:56.040> cards

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
because they need the different cards

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.629 
because they need the different cards
right<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.290> don't<00:03:58.709> know<00:03:58.859> my<00:03:59.040> general<00:03:59.489> feeling

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
right so I don't know my general feeling

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.399 
right so I don't know my general feeling
about<00:04:00.230> magic<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.409> a<00:04:02.540> lot<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.840> stuff<00:04:04.109> since

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
about magic is a lot of the stuff since

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.979 
about magic is a lot of the stuff since
it<00:04:04.650> has<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.190> playset<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.299> don't<00:04:06.780> need

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
it has to be playset so you don't need

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.990 
it has to be playset so you don't need
just<00:04:07.260> one<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.650> them<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.980> need<00:04:08.159> four<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.639> them<00:04:08.790> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
just one of them you need four of them a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.759 
just one of them you need four of them a
lot<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.329> times<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.870> rabble<00:04:10.230> master<00:04:10.560> when

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
