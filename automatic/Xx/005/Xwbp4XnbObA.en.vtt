time<00:00:39.960> draining<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> water<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.460> week<00:00:41.670> i

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
time draining the water and a week i

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.959 
time draining the water and a week i
fill<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.320> let<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.100> run<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.640> few<00:00:44.820> days

fill it up let it run for a few days

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.900 
fill it up let it run for a few days
then<00:00:45.300> drain<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> again<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
then drain it again just to get on the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.279 
then drain it again just to get on the
phosphates<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.570> everything<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
phosphates and everything out of the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.819 
phosphates and everything out of the
water<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.480> that's<00:00:51.480> about<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> I've<00:00:52.260> hooked<00:00:52.559> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
water and that's about it I've hooked on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.439 
water and that's about it I've hooked on
my<00:00:53.010> two<00:00:53.989> NP<00:00:54.989> 40s<00:00:55.820> on<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.180> left<00:00:57.420> side<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:59.449> one

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
my two NP 40s on the left side and one

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.080 
my two NP 40s on the left side and one
on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.870> side<00:01:01.399> I'm<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> probably

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
on the right side I'm going to probably

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
on the right side I'm going to probably
add<00:01:03.420> 2<00:01:04.170> MP<00:01:04.559> tens<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:07.159> not<00:01:08.159> only

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
add 2 MP tens on the back and not only

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.560 
add 2 MP tens on the back and not only
that<00:01:08.570> one<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.840> IP<00:01:10.020> 10<00:01:10.530> heads<00:01:11.570> started

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that one of my IP 10 heads started

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
that one of my IP 10 heads started
making<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:12.990> crazy<00:01:13.320> noise<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> had<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
making this crazy noise so I had to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.330 
making this crazy noise so I had to
change<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.159> garbage<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:19.340> other

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
change it so that's it garbage now other

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.020 
change it so that's it garbage now other
than<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:21.119> lights<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.540> looking<00:01:21.840> crazy<00:01:22.140> I

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
than that my lights are looking crazy I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.999 
than that my lights are looking crazy I
spent<00:01:24.030> 30<00:01:24.540> less<00:01:24.780> than<00:01:24.960> thirty<00:01:25.259> dollars<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
spent 30 less than thirty dollars on the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.609 
spent 30 less than thirty dollars on the
whole<00:01:26.159> harness<00:01:26.580> thing<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.060> build<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.750> hang

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
whole harness thing to build it and hang

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.390 
whole harness thing to build it and hang
it<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.009> wall<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.520> mean<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.600> ceiling<00:01:31.400> but

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
it on the wall I mean on the ceiling but

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
it on the wall I mean on the ceiling but
I<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.299> originally<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.140> with

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
I was not originally going to go with

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
I was not originally going to go with
three<00:01:34.619> radians<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> them

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
three radians but I think two of them

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.170 
three radians but I think two of them
are<00:01:36.720> more<00:01:36.930> than<00:01:37.079> enough<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.770> tank

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
are more than enough for this tank

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
are more than enough for this tank
especially<00:01:39.180> when<00:01:39.810> there<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.100> forty<00:01:41.100> percent

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
especially when there are forty percent

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.580 
especially when there are forty percent
right<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.150> there's<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.630> much<00:01:42.780> brightness

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
right now and there's so much brightness

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
right now and there's so much brightness
to<00:01:43.829> them<00:01:44.149> I'm<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.659> shade<00:01:45.930> under<00:01:46.610> rock

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to them I'm a little shade under rock

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.899 
to them I'm a little shade under rock
there<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.590> about<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.490> rest<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
there and that's about it the rest of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.580 
there and that's about it the rest of
the<00:01:51.030> tank<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> lit<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:52.049> there's<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the tank is lit well there's not a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.120 
the tank is lit well there's not a
little<00:01:52.950> shade<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.430> there<00:01:53.729> too<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:55.130> other

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
little shade right there too but other

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.660 
little shade right there too but other
than<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.270> whole<00:01:57.479> tank<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> led<00:01:58.670> okay

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
than that the whole tank is led okay

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
than that the whole tank is led okay
