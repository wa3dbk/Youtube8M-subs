00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
possibly be the sleeper stimulant they

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
possibly be the sleeper stimulant they
didn't<00:01:55.649> say<00:01:55.770> exactly<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> weapon<00:01:56.729> parts

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
will be used to build sir maybe it will

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
will be used to build sir maybe it will
be<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> sleepy<00:01:59.399> simulant<00:01:59.820> may<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.180> word<00:02:00.450> we

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
be the sleepy simulant may be a word we

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.450 
be the sleepy simulant may be a word we
don't<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.890> last<00:02:02.070> part<00:02:02.310> is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
don't know right now this last part is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
don't know right now this last part is
just<00:02:02.490> some<00:02:02.729> speculation<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.689> end<00:02:03.930> now<00:02:04.680> just

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
just some speculation on my end now just

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.590 
just some speculation on my end now just
by<00:02:05.070> looking<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.490> weapon<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.360> see

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
by looking at this weapon you can see

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.290 
by looking at this weapon you can see
that<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> has<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.140> same<00:02:07.409> sleek<00:02:07.860> black<00:02:08.310> sexy

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that it has the same sleek black sexy

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.809 
that it has the same sleek black sexy
angular<00:02:09.750> design<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.259> warm<00:02:10.860> I'd<00:02:11.039> architecture

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
angular design as warm I'd architecture

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.540 
angular design as warm I'd architecture
and<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.300> even<00:02:12.420> has<00:02:12.569> Rasputin's

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
and it even has Rasputin's

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.190 
and it even has Rasputin's
booger<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.030> gun<00:02:14.270> meaning<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.050> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
booger on the gun meaning that it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.140 
booger on the gun meaning that it
incorporates<00:02:15.500> warm<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.190> technology<00:02:16.820> just

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
incorporates warm and technology just

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.970 
incorporates warm and technology just
like<00:02:17.300> pocket<00:02:17.630> infinity<00:02:18.080> which<00:02:18.620> could<00:02:18.860> make

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
like pocket infinity which could make

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.400 
like pocket infinity which could make
for<00:02:19.160> some<00:02:19.340> interesting<00:02:19.430> backstory<00:02:20.360> maybe<00:02:21.260> it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
for some interesting backstory maybe it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.050 
for some interesting backstory maybe it
could<00:02:21.530> also<00:02:21.650> mean<00:02:21.800> that<00:02:21.950> Rasputin<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.790> somehow

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
could also mean that Rasputin is somehow

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.870 
could also mean that Rasputin is somehow
involved<00:02:23.510> in<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.200> quest<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.830> gun<00:02:25.100> now

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
involved in the quest for this gun now

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.970 
involved in the quest for this gun now
this<00:02:26.150> makes<00:02:26.330> me<00:02:26.480> wonder<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.590> means<00:02:27.860> that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
this makes me wonder if this means that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.860 
this makes me wonder if this means that
laser<00:02:28.490> beams<00:02:28.760> will<00:02:28.940> become<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.390> new<00:02:29.420> weapon

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
laser beams will become a new weapon

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.350 
laser beams will become a new weapon
type<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.680> ticking<00:02:31.040> king<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.460> at<00:02:32.030> least<00:02:32.210> at

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
type in the ticking king or at least at

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.000 
type in the ticking king or at least at
some<00:02:32.390> point<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.960> future<00:02:32.990> of<00:02:33.320> destiny<00:02:33.800> in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
some point in the future of destiny in

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.950 
some point in the future of destiny in
the<00:02:34.520> article<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:35.000> describe<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.660> sleeper

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
the article they describe the sleeper

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.920 
the article they describe the sleeper
simulant<00:02:36.410> as<00:02:36.500> an<00:02:37.070> exotic<00:02:37.520> fusion<00:02:38.060> rifle<00:02:38.420> that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
simulant as an exotic fusion rifle that

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.990 
simulant as an exotic fusion rifle that
goes<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.290> heavy<00:02:39.530> weapon<00:02:39.860> slot<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:40.820> it

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
goes in the heavy weapon slot so it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.700 
goes in the heavy weapon slot so it
doesn't<00:02:41.360> necessarily<00:02:41.420> confirm<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.680> laser

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
doesn't necessarily confirm that laser

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.890 
doesn't necessarily confirm that laser
beams<00:02:43.220> will<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.550> thing<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:44.570> still<00:02:44.840> a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
beams will be a thing it's still a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660 
beams will be a thing it's still a
fusion<00:02:45.260> rifle<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.220> vex<00:02:46.370> mythic

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
fusion rifle just like the vex mythic

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.240 
fusion rifle just like the vex mythic
last<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.090> also<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.450> fusion<00:02:47.810> rifle<00:02:48.170> yet<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.920> fires

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
last is also a fusion rifle yet it fires

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.330 
last is also a fusion rifle yet it fires
like<00:02:49.580> an<00:02:49.730> auto<00:02:49.880> rifle<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.480> primary<00:02:50.900> slot

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
like an auto rifle in the primary slot

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.740 
like an auto rifle in the primary slot
so<00:02:52.340> that's<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.700> for<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.910> video<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.360> really
