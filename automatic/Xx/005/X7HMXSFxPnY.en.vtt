00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:18.779
 do not pull the rubber and that is still me 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.390
 temporary beat and you try again 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.230
 figure out what to take winter studded 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.140
 non - studded vsesezonka take everything 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.940
 leave understand in the laboratory 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 modern tire is like a puff pie 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 the sweetest part of the cake is the icing 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.980
 over the tire instead of the glaze protector 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.829
 double layer of the highest quality rubber 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.949
 responsible for the grip below 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.989
 triple layer of cord for strength inside 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.220
 tires tightly soldered metal 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.440
 side ring pressing to the woods drive 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.079
 in the winter, the main rule of the brakes is not sharp and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.900
 cities and nothing will happen right 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.240
 so check these wheels on the side 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.720
 demolition our car rides in a circle with 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 speed of 20 kilometers per hour so far 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.060
 winter tires Cordiant keeps 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.580
 the road is fine but now we are smooth 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 accelerate centrifugal force 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.780
 pushing the car from the landfill to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.420
 speed 42 kilometers per hour tires 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.670
 powerfully extended pattern 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.410
 name directed non-directional pattern 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 he is good at snow or on ice 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.000
 preferably directed withdrawn from the tire 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.160
 water and snow porridge for safety 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.580
 more important than drawing and soft tires 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.560
 soft tires 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.209
 depends on the rubber composition of the component 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 known artificial and natural 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.390
 rubber burn for sulfur is not oil but 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.649
 their ratio manufacturers keep in 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.989
 the strictest secret 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.759
 if I still put rubber spikes 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.640
 Strongly do not overclock the new template you need 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.540
 know know at least 500 kilometers 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.710
 next year necessarily 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 they were all in place otherwise otherwise what 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.850
 full rubber tighter plus spikes 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.670
 fly out unevenly so the wheels 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.500
 fuck differently for the road car on 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.290
 non-studded tires easily 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.870
 accelerates to 30 kilometers per hour but 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.580
 already at the speed of 35 kilometers per hour, and its 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.310
 also endures the passion to watch winter 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.290
 tires are all broken on the checkers square 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.209
 and the checkers are made up of thin plates 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.980
 lamella when braking wheel 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.470
 fillet pressed against hand slats 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.650
 open up and cling to the road 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.860
 coating exactly every tire cordiant 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.620
 consists of about 30 item collects 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.690
 tire special machine until this 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.760
 rubber is soft and very sensitive to 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.430
 temperature to become full 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.360
 the tire the future tire goes to 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.360
 vulcanization 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.430
 vulcanization i.e. turning soft 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.090
 raw rubber in tight and not afraid 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.340
 heating up 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.820
 invented the american scientist charles 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.820
 gudier it happened in 1839 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.090
 quite by chance scientists have mixed raw 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.330
 rubber with gray but could not hold the tube and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.490
 poured the contents on the burner rubber became 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.500
 durable and no longer afraid of heating 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.510
 really make money on your genius 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.860
 invention scientist has failed 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.710
 rubber and car tires 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.750
 appeared only 50 years later 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:37.500
 and can take vsesezonka sparingly 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.540
 let's see how all-season reason 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.970
 tire behaves on packed snow 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.360
 significantly worse than others tested 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.850
 instances wear speed 27 kilometers 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.490
 in an hour it seems better to stay on the spikes 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:58.100
 not in a hurry with freaks winter tires is not 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:03.070
 only rolled snow and slush 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.070
 gasha and in the city ​​just wet asphalt 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.760
 the conditions of our experiment are the same 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.980
 only the cover has changed now 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.950
 Sinek melted reagents 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.889
 urban snow porridge however the difference is 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.380
 tire behavior is more than noticeable 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.960
 tenacious in these conditions were winter 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.979
 not studded tires rate of contribution 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.370
 36 kilometers an hour close days led 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.630
 myself 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.940
 studded tires 34 kilometers per hour worse 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.570
 total all season speed 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.160
 demolition 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.160
 23 kilometers per hour 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.680
 well, where I prepared yes, here are the currencies 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.390
 bought well done arisen choosing not rush 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.400
 me you are determined not a shadow of the middle 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.790
 I am determined by the situation the founder is not 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.790
 an approach
