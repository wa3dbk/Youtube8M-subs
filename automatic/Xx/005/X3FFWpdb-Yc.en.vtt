 Denmark's royal capital Copenhagen is the Amalienborg Palace 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.410
 The residence of the Danish kings in this Frederik the Eighth Pauli pulls 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.589
 soon the crown prince couple Merry and Frederik b 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.829
 YB but before it could be visited exceptionally after six years 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:31.240
 Renovation shines the couple lives in baroque splendor In 1750 it was built in 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.609
 The surprise of contemporary art attracts the walls of the castle 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.879
 among other things a light installation of the internationally known artist 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.010
 Olafur Eliasson 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.960
 the idea comes from the prince couple itself it comes therefore that one in the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.490
 eighteenth century life in another point Denmark also artists to 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.500
 Design of the castle has settled 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.250
 and you want to do the same here, the Crown Prince and Queen have a lot of works of art 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.930
 seen the artist and said that he likes it and that they have something like that 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.310
 want to have similar 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.080
 The castle is 4700 square meters and has 36 rooms, hopefully 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.800
 Currently there are 18 available 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.420
 for the design of the underlying prince pair 10 of the best artists 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.620
 Denmark's one of them is Morning poses 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.340
 the tents the first double this is a fantastic option such 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.060
 to do a great job 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.829
 I had a bit of stage fright but I got over it and that 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.109
 best given so get firm Koeppen Neumarkt 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.460
 the work in the reception room of the castle presents a fantasy world indeed 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.720
 Relation to the crown prince couple 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.890
 among other things shows that the deck of a ship on the Frederik 2006 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.210
 It was a scientific expedition 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.680
 tiny media too 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.770
 the prince is a real adventurer a real action-thriller «Salt» 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.940
 Relations Tel 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 Lord likes all this magic of theory 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.610
 but here the magic is not yet called this Frank Schaal should also be one 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.560
 Decorate artwork 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.340
 but that was taken off again because the prince and pair did not like it 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.810
 further on, the picture of Körner already appeared on the 10th 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.069
 a widow of 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.069
 my first picture was not that successful lid 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 For high ferris wheel of the Crown Prince and his wife Mary rejected it from Breitner 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.629
 they did not do it 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.609
 Save for that 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.609
 Mueller led perhaps it was to help 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:42.099
 Now the Danish artist has a new work showing Danish soldiers 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.449
 a few days earlier in the Afghan war, the prince couple was with them and that 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.449
 new picture has asked the areas 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.759
 we had to go for 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.309
 X out of r 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.439
 The Crown Prince's hotel was a soldier a few years ago, so he understands 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.619
 Definitely what I mean what drier 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:10.429
 ver and they like it that way it is so i am happy for the best 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:11.789
 hands 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.629
 Witnesses had 4 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.780
 back in the castle of the crown prince couple renovations 27 million 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.939
 cost about three million more for the current course so 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.389
 In Europe, a unique castle was created in which rococo and modern 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.249
 to meet 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:32.409
 Kasper live has also painted a picture many of the presented lock not 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.799
 only the prince couple also Denmark 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.089
 Velvet conceivable 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:42.879
 whether the citizens are changing people's view of modern art 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.729
 represent 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:49.809
 this is closed and the art always connect and that is 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.930
 yes, I think it's interesting to bet 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.559
 the women's race about that also knows how to look into the future churches 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:02.119
 until the 30th of May the castle can be visited afterwards 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:06.139
 Summer Crown Prince Frederik and his wife Mary with their children
