00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
you how to build a skyscraper now the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.180 
you how to build a skyscraper now the
first<00:00:10.710> step<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.460> building<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.940> skyscraper<00:00:12.210> is

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
first step to building a skyscraper is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:29.419 
first step to building a skyscraper is
to<00:00:14.190> create<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:15.059> big<00:00:15.750> tall<00:00:16.529> tower<00:00:26.930> now<00:00:28.279> once<00:00:29.279> you

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
to create a big tall tower now once you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.209 
to create a big tall tower now once you
have<00:00:29.550> created<00:00:29.699> tower<00:00:30.269> starting<00:00:31.080> start<00:00:31.830> going

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
have created tower starting start going

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
have created tower starting start going
out<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.850> make<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.329> different<00:00:36.600> shapes

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
out you can make all different shapes

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:55.720 
out you can make all different shapes
but<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.219> think<00:00:38.820> we'll<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.090> stick<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.480> square

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.389 

there<00:00:56.730> now<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.360> asked<00:00:57.719> where<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.399> take

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
there now we have asked where we take

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.690 
there now we have asked where we take
lava<00:01:00.390> bucket<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:02.250> place<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.989> top<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
lava bucket and place it on top of the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.500 
lava bucket and place it on top of the
dirt<00:01:10.070> now<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.130> recommend<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
dirt now I recommend you do this in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.530 
dirt now I recommend you do this in
creative<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:15.180> hard<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
creative because it is really hard to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:30.630 
creative because it is really hard to
avoid<00:01:15.900> lava

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
don't know I'm gibbets so you could

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.050 
don't know I'm gibbets so you could
either<00:02:30.020> drop<00:02:30.440> into<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.920> middle<00:02:31.250> or<00:02:31.460> the

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
have a skyscraper now you go here and

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.819 
have a skyscraper now you go here and
get<00:03:42.340> some<00:03:42.540> cobblestone<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:45.930> patch<00:03:46.930> up<00:03:47.349> the

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829

get some cobblestone and patch up the
holes<00:03:50.010> wait<00:03:51.010> for<00:03:51.189> the<00:03:51.280> water<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.609> pass

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.500

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
now you want to leave a door so here you

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.810 
now you want to leave a door so here you
will<00:04:19.840> have<00:04:19.870> two<00:04:20.620> layers<00:04:20.890> so<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.489> go<00:04:21.670> in

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
will have two layers so you can go in

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:30.990 
will have two layers so you can go in
the<00:04:22.000> inside<00:04:27.540> outside<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:29.550> then<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.670> can<00:04:30.850> just
