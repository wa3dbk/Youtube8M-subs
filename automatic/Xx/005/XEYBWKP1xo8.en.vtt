00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.130
 how about friends how have they been i am 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.170
 king of here again with another map more 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.209
 for you I think it's going to 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.240
 like since it adds up for something special 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.460
 that map is called 100 days of darkness 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.419
 this is a map converted from pc to the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.210
 console by the hacker game friend 360 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.730
 this same guy who turned the map 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.039
 This light of jairo rings 3 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.780
 Well, the truth is greatly appreciated 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.390
 because their maps pretty good so 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.280
 I hope he keeps converting more this 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.650
 map as it consists of trying 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.110
 survive in this dark world as 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.660
 you know will always be in full 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.000
 darkness and we will have all the time 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.310
 enemies everywhere and it is 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.620
 practically impossible but since 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.240
 we are quite arcs since we are 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.910
 quite some others well let's try to 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.820
 survive here and well I hope that what 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.220
 achieve and I really liked this 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.080
 map because that 's a different challenge 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.420
 is no longer business as usual for 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.960
 survive now this time to survive 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.980
 but we just have to do everything 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.170
 time 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.360
 at night practically as we can see 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.020
 over there I do not know if you see the sun what the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.690
 sun you see out there is already in the part of 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 up but when it's falling 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.840
 coming out we can see the sun 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 and then all the time go dark is what 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.670
 that here we have a little house 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990
 it's found 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.220
 so here we have a few 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.210
 posters the mapmaker and joshua 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.660
 026 660 the youtube channel of the former 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.940
 hacker game 360 as you already know how 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.790
 I told them that same guy who created or 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.320
 turned this halo map 3 that was 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.880
 pretty good that if you have not seen it 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 I recommend you to go through the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.900
 channel and you download it in the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.210
 description also go to the channel 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.030
 this person so that if he wants to spend 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.220
 for your channel and watch your videos because it would be 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.800
 I saw around here we have more posters that 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.459
 here tells us to build the portal 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.959
 to kill the dragon is an optional challenge 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.440
 so you do not have to do it if you do not 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.700
 they want here it puts us that we have the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.890
 objects to be the portal 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.400
 eyes of ender and in the structures of 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.840
 report to him and we also have some 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 this 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.780
 good armors pretty useful things 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.080
 to start playing with a little 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.110
 of coal here we have then wheat weapons 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.260
 and pumpkin seeds 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.350
 I think teams these values ​​are 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.690
 empty the good thing is that we already have where 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.240
 take refuge and pass 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.030
 let's say that the eternal night is 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.900
 important to create us a bed then if 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.970
 they do not leave sheep if they do not leave lambs 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 then they have to kill spiders for 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.740
 damage and get pretty gone and so 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.830
 they can make your bed getting thread and 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.760
 then turning it into wool and that 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.600
 way they can create their beds then 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.030
 I think this is quite a challenge 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.030
 pretty good I really liked the map 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.550
 why then why 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.380
 as you can see everywhere they go 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.470
 see zombies creepers of all 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.080
 do not believe that everyone is like this but 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.110
 it's a great is a big part of the world 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.640
 that is in total darkness and therefore 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.780
 I hope you like it, you know that the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.970
 interest charge will be in the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.400
 Description will send them to the website 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.710

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.940
 it's all I hope you liked this
