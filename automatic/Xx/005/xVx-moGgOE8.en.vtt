giving<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:32.780> performance<00:00:32.930> we<00:00:33.470> animate<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:34.010> so

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
giving a performance we animate it so

what<00:00:45.710> we<00:00:45.800> do<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:47.530> did<00:00:48.530> quite<00:00:49.040> a<00:00:49.100> lot<00:00:49.129> of<00:00:49.280> work<00:00:49.400> on

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
what we do I did quite a lot of work on

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.509 
what we do I did quite a lot of work on
that<00:00:50.000> gun<00:00:50.510> which<00:00:50.809> is<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.320> an<00:00:51.890> alien<00:00:52.010> weapon

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.280 
that gun which is a and an alien weapon
that<00:00:52.729> sort<00:00:53.059> of<00:00:53.089> disintegrates<00:00:53.720> people<00:00:54.110> with

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
that sort of disintegrates people with

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.259 
that sort of disintegrates people with
lightning<00:00:54.739> bolts<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.190> getting<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.790> look<00:00:55.940> and

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
lightning bolts and getting the look and

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.450 
lightning bolts and getting the look and
animation<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.080> that<00:00:57.229> right<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:57.830> approved<00:00:58.220> it

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
animation of that right and approved it

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.859 
animation of that right and approved it
was<00:00:58.580> that<00:00:58.820> took<00:00:59.000> that<00:00:59.210> it<00:00:59.330> took<00:00:59.570> some<00:00:59.750> doing

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869 
was that took that it took some doing

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.200 
was that took that it took some doing
but<00:01:00.140> yeah<00:01:00.619> it's<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.100> quite<00:01:01.580> satisfying<00:01:01.970> shots

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
but yeah it's the quite satisfying shots

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.240 
but yeah it's the quite satisfying shots
and<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.420> think<00:01:02.570> they've<00:01:02.690> been<00:01:02.900> quite<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:03.530> people

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
and I think they've been quite so people

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.740 
and I think they've been quite so people
are<00:01:04.339> being<00:01:04.460> quite<00:01:04.790> surprised<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.360> first<00:01:05.390> time

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
are being quite surprised the first time

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.660 
are being quite surprised the first time
they<00:01:05.869> see<00:01:06.049> someone<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.530> kid<00:01:06.710> blowing<00:01:07.400> them

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
they see someone to the kid blowing them

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.490 
they see someone to the kid blowing them
to<00:01:07.790> most<00:01:10.540> likely<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:11.720> all<00:01:11.840> over<00:01:11.960> quickly<00:01:12.200> so

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to most likely it's all over quickly so

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.530 
to most likely it's all over quickly so
it's<00:01:12.619> not<00:01:12.799> it's<00:01:13.010> not<00:01:13.070> too<00:01:13.220> big<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.640> lot<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.479> the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
it's not it's not too big a lot of the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.060 
it's not it's not too big a lot of the
effects<00:01:14.780> was<00:01:15.020> very<00:01:15.170> subtle<00:01:15.530> like<00:01:15.740> stuff<00:01:15.950> it

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
effects was very subtle like stuff it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.710 
effects was very subtle like stuff it
doesn't<00:01:16.189> bleep<00:01:16.580> out<00:01:16.790> on<00:01:16.820> screen<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.360> say<00:01:17.510> hey

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
doesn't bleep out on screen and say hey

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.260 
doesn't bleep out on screen and say hey
I<00:01:18.020> I'm<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.799> fixed<00:01:19.070> ed<00:01:19.250> I<00:01:19.280> did<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.820> stuff

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
I I'm in a fixed ed I did this stuff

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.149 
I I'm in a fixed ed I did this stuff
like<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.570> know<00:01:20.630> aliens<00:01:20.840> kicking<00:01:21.260> up<00:01:21.470> dust<00:01:21.799> and

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
like you know aliens kicking up dust and

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.069 
like you know aliens kicking up dust and
sand<00:01:22.400> as<00:01:22.610> you're<00:01:22.760> walking<00:01:22.850> around<00:01:23.119> but<00:01:23.600> it's

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
sand as you're walking around but it's

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.020 
sand as you're walking around but it's
actually<00:01:24.170> quite<00:01:24.439> challenging<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.429> achieve<00:01:25.880> it

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
actually quite challenging to achieve it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.480 
actually quite challenging to achieve it
and<00:01:26.179> have<00:01:26.929> it<00:01:26.960> feeling<00:01:27.289> natural<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.159> bar<00:01:28.310> was

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
and have it feeling natural the bar was

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.370 
and have it feeling natural the bar was
set<00:01:28.609> pretty<00:01:28.820> high<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.329> sort<00:01:29.929> of<00:01:29.990> meeting<00:01:30.140> that

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
set pretty high and sort of meeting that

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.069 
set pretty high and sort of meeting that
so<00:01:30.560> whether<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:31.130> was<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.280> challenge<00:01:34.899> when<00:01:35.899> I<00:01:35.929> was

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
so whether it was a challenge when I was

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.319 
so whether it was a challenge when I was
actually<00:01:36.170> happy<00:01:36.469> of<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.950> met<00:01:37.460> Sean<00:01:37.939> while

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
actually happy of this I met Sean while

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.849 
actually happy of this I met Sean while
she<00:01:38.570> was<00:01:38.659> actually<00:01:38.749> deserved<00:01:39.229> as<00:01:39.380> an<00:01:39.409> effects

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
she was actually deserved as an effects

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.880 
she was actually deserved as an effects
executive<00:01:40.609> producer<00:01:41.030> understory<00:01:41.570> 9<00:01:41.719> he<00:01:42.679> came

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.440

into<00:01:43.070> one<00:01:43.249> of<00:01:43.369> our<00:01:43.520> presentations<00:01:44.210> and

into one of our presentations and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.569 
into one of our presentations and
actually<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.020> guess<00:01:45.320> through<00:01:45.710> that<00:01:45.920> sort<00:01:46.520> of

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
actually I guess through that sort of

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.370 
actually I guess through that sort of
gave<00:01:46.759> me<00:01:46.999> ask<00:01:47.270> me<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.600> see<00:01:47.749> the<00:01:47.810> real<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.229> when

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
gave me ask me to see the real and when

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.410 
gave me ask me to see the real and when
I<00:01:48.409> was<00:01:48.619> when<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.130> was<00:01:49.219> finished<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:49.759> I<00:01:49.999> did<00:01:50.270> that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
I was when I was finished and I did that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.139 
I was when I was finished and I did that
and<00:01:50.770> pretty<00:01:51.770> much<00:01:51.829> started<00:01:52.340> at<00:01:52.460> image<00:01:52.789> engine

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
and pretty much started at image engine

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.389 
and pretty much started at image engine
straight<00:01:54.049> after<00:01:54.350> graduating<00:01:54.890> which<00:01:55.219> was
