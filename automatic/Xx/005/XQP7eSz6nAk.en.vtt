00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.819
 2002 world to a new good video 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.470
 it seems that james dot org have 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.050
 asked to remove the bull videogame 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.270
 I did not know game for anything 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.770
 done well you do not see that they are not 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.300
 making a video game about him about 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.460
 bullfighting and other good is making a 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.350
 Spanish developer and others and it seems 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.870
 be that good has started as I say 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.510
 a request to cancel the 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.860
 specifically good suit of the request 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.010
 He has also come from Spain and already 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:33.140
 has 30 thousand 500 signatures whatever it gives 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.930
 is that the game promotes abuse 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.540
 animal the truth that I want is that you 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.280
 say do not think in any videogame 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.070
 it's never like peta with 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.360
 minecraft is not that by killing sheep and 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.820
 others in main I think you are promoting 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.920
 animal abuse I do not think it's anything 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 from the same to me bullfighting for example not 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.790
 I like it for nothing but this game does 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.070
 that is a game I would at least give 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.620
 an opportunity and I would try it already 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.829
 I would be better and I would be the truth 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.690
 I prefer that I know that he sacrificed 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.209
 a bull in a video game that in life 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.719
 Real I do not know about you if it happens to you 

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:12.630
 We are already a little bit already crazy about 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:15.520
 the head the truth I do not know 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.290
 what do you want me to say 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.630
 a lot and I think that we have to start a 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.870
 little to distinguish between video games and 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.370
 real life because I think it already rang 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.380
 for fucking pots that there's nothing 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.700
 never proved that a video game to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.530
 nobody has yet shown you any 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.040
 study or anything one hundred percent has 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.280
 It is shown that video games are 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.590
 able to change your mentality for the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.290
 Negative side I did not burn myself 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.480
 promote killing people or killing 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.280
 animals nor do I doubt much that people 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.530
 that more than one bull in this game go 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.860
 killing bulls on the street or I doubt it 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.380
 very much crazy not if you think I want 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.060
 say that and I know that even people who 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.979
 is against the bullfighter and others I 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.720
 I think they would throw the games of the 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.670
 game at least to try it not for 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 play day by day, as I say then what 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.940
 I would try more as something as well as 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.380
 say something something you have never seen 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.479
 not because he has never seen a game of 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.070
 tournament I do not know if it shoots or not but I 've never 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.600
 seen a game this in this style the 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.239
 game was scheduled to come out for 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.670
 playstation 4 xbox pc and to have that 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.959
 now he will have problems 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.480
 like gram to see what it is that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.480
 it just happens as I always say there 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.920
 what to distinguish between video games and in 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.680
 reality is the most important thing in 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.540
 As soon as we cross that line and we cagamos 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.459
 quite because it is that more movies 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.709
 violent still mistreating dogs 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.350
 who mistreat everything and nobody says 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.350
 absolutely nothing or I do not know what kind 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.150
 of gilipolleces is and in fact I what 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.220
 I know I do not know I would fight for why not 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.370
 is going to be in another type of 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 animals in real life and so on but not 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.030
 complain with a video game that I see 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.280
 so 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.200
 I do not know do not get me wrong but we see it 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.540
 very simple to do do this kind of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.459
 things I think the problem is in the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.600
 real life not in the video game that 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.459
 you want me to tell you no I do not know maybe it's 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.290
 My opinion is not the same as other people 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.420
 he sees it differently but I see it from 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.010
 I do not think this video game makes 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.140
 no harm what do you want that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.450
 optics 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.940
 I do not know for example I like it 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.360
 very much the dogs if you get in a 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.480
 game of kicking dogs 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.959
 I would not play directly but I could not 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.340
 change my decision and say is not that 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.800
 this promotes the mistreatment against 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.720
 dogs because I do not think it's like that or they're 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.390
 I really do not think I do not 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.730
 because in fact in health and for 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.730
 example there are dog runs and kill 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.160
 dogs when those who come to eat you and 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.170
 nobody has complained for example of those 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.710
 organs and you understand me you do not get a 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.440
 little all very very strange 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.080
 I do not know I do not know I think you have to start 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.970
 to distinguish between videogame and reality 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.980
 I think that it is something basic, that is something 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.110
 that I should teach you already in class in the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.560
 school since I was a little kid 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.930
 reality and virtual reality or thing thing 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.250
 fake and real thing and nothing guys we 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.520
 we see in the next video until the 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.520
 next
