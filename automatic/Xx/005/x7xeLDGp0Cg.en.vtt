00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
we include the resource file that we

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.019 
we include the resource file that we
just<00:00:03.480> created<00:00:03.780> as<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.290> source<00:00:05.190> file<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.940> will

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
just created as a source file that will

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.000 
just created as a source file that will
get<00:00:06.240> built<00:00:06.480> we're<00:00:07.319> also<00:00:07.470> going<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.859> be<00:00:07.980> using

get built we're also going to be using
some<00:00:08.639> includes<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.840> need<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.080> be<00:00:10.200> sure<00:00:10.469> that

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
some includes so we need to be sure that

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.400 
some includes so we need to be sure that
the<00:00:11.250> search<00:00:11.670> path<00:00:11.969> will<00:00:12.210> be<00:00:12.360> included<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.290> well

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the search path will be included as well

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.560 
the search path will be included as well
in<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.679> build<00:00:13.910> we<00:00:14.910> also<00:00:15.059> need<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.389> add<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
in the build we also need to add a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.080 
in the build we also need to add a
couple<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.020> libraries<00:00:16.760> let's<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:17.910> ahead<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
couple of libraries let's go ahead and

I've added a few includes some are
specific<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> sam<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:50.489> run<00:00:50.640> time<00:00:50.850> em

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
specific to the sam will run time em

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 
specific to the sam will run time em
engine<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.379> I've<00:00:52.469> also<00:00:52.620> added<00:00:52.829> 14<00:00:53.309> resource<00:00:53.879> H

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
engine but I've also added 14 resource H

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.760 
engine but I've also added 14 resource H
because<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> resource<00:00:55.320> file<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.680> we

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
because of the resource file that we

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.560 
because of the resource file that we
have<00:00:55.920> included<00:00:56.370> next<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.510> ahead

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
have included next I'm going to go ahead

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
have included next I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:57.690> paste<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.140> code<00:00:58.379> into<00:00:58.680> win<00:00:58.859> main<00:00:59.100> we'll

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and paste some code into win main we'll

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
and paste some code into win main we'll
walk<00:00:59.699> through<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.059> code<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.480> explain<00:01:00.840> what

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
walk through the code to explain what

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.899 
walk through the code to explain what
it's<00:01:01.140> actually<00:01:01.289> doing<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> I've<00:01:05.430> replaced<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
it's actually doing so I've replaced the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's actually doing so I've replaced the
entire<00:01:06.030> contents<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.840> wind<00:01:07.049> main<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.490> here

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
entire contents of wind main and here

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.230 
entire contents of wind main and here
you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> declare<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.540> few<00:01:09.900> variables

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
you can see I declare a few variables

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.969 
you can see I declare a few variables
next<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.360> initialize<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.229> sam'l<00:01:13.560> runtime

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
next we initialize the sam'l runtime

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
next we initialize the sam'l runtime
engine<00:01:16.250> then<00:01:17.250> we're<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.240> pointer

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
engine then we're going to get a pointer

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
engine then we're going to get a pointer
to<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.590> singleton<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> Sam<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:20.759> run

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
to the singleton for the Sam will run

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.649 
to the singleton for the Sam will run
time<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.530> because<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.659> single

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
time this is because there is a single

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.600 
time this is because there is a single
object<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.350> there<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.009> sam'l<00:01:26.280> runtime

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
object out there for the sam'l runtime

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
object out there for the sam'l runtime
we<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.970> need<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.650> pointer

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
we just need to go out and get a pointer

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.920 
we just need to go out and get a pointer
to<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.670> object<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.600> something<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
to that object so we have something to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.090 
to that object so we have something to
work<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.460> now<00:01:32.460> using<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.909> pointer<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.920> need

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
work with now using that pointer we need

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.880 
work with now using that pointer we need
to<00:01:35.250> get<00:01:35.400> access<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.180> resource<00:01:36.570> file<00:01:36.890> that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
to get access to the resource file that

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.069 
to get access to the resource file that
we<00:01:38.009> included<00:01:41.540> now<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.659> we've<00:01:42.780> done<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
we included now that we've done that

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.020 
we included now that we've done that
we'll<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.890> ahead<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.130> prepare<00:01:44.700> some<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
we'll go ahead and prepare some of the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.370 
we'll go ahead and prepare some of the
data<00:01:45.180> structures<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.810> client<00:01:46.140> window

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
data structures for the client window

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
data structures for the client window
including<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.040> title<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> window<00:01:48.060> fact

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
including the title of the window fact

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.800 
including the title of the window fact
that<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.750> an<00:01:48.840> overlap<00:01:49.200> window<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:50.090> 0<00:01:51.090> 0<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that is an overlap window at 0 0 for the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.130 
that is an overlap window at 0 0 for the
coordinates<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.479> here<00:01:54.479> we're<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
coordinates and here we're going to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.499 
coordinates and here we're going to
specify<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.250> specific<00:01:56.850> resource<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.390> we

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
specify the specific resource that we

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.319 
specify the specific resource that we
want<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> access<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.860> go<00:01:59.009> back<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.490> open<00:02:00.270> up

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
want to access if I go back and open up

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.780 
want to access if I go back and open up
the<00:02:00.479> resource<00:02:00.780> file<00:02:00.990> again<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.610> see

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the resource file again here we can see

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
sam'l code that we created earlier next

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.530 
sam'l code that we created earlier next
we're<00:02:20.620> going<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.890> go<00:02:21.070> ahead<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.340> call<00:02:21.970> an<00:02:22.240> API

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
we're going to go ahead and call an API

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.100 
we're going to go ahead and call an API
to<00:02:22.710> create<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.860> host<00:02:24.040> window<00:02:24.400> using<00:02:24.940> zamel

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.330 

once<00:02:29.110> we've<00:02:29.260> done<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.590> need<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.920> get<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
once we've done that we need to get a

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.370 
once we've done that we need to get a
pointer<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.390> root<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.870> sample<00:02:32.020> code

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
pointer to the root of the sample code

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.080 
pointer to the root of the sample code
so<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.550> call<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:35.320> get<00:02:35.500> root<00:02:35.710> element<00:02:36.160> will

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so this call to get root element will

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.580 
so this call to get root element will
give<00:02:37.270> us<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.630> root<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> sam'l<00:02:40.350> at<00:02:41.350> this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
give us the root of the sam'l at this

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.160 
give us the root of the sam'l at this
point<00:02:41.890> we're<00:02:42.220> pretty<00:02:42.400> much<00:02:42.550> ready<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.910> go

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
point we're pretty much ready to go

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.300 
point we're pretty much ready to go
everything<00:02:44.170> up<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:44.410> point<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.770> more<00:02:45.220> or

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
everything up to this point is more or

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.000 
everything up to this point is more or
less<00:02:45.370> template<00:02:45.880> code<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:47.110> might<00:02:47.680> look<00:02:47.860> a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
less template code so it might look a

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.250 
less template code so it might look a
little<00:02:48.190> scary<00:02:48.610> having<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.390> much<00:02:49.600> code<00:02:49.930> here

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
little scary having this much code here

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.050 
little scary having this much code here
however<00:02:50.890> this<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.460> all<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> set<00:02:51.910> up

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
however this is just all the set up

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.630 
however this is just all the set up
pretty<00:02:52.660> much<00:02:52.810> will<00:02:53.260> be<00:02:53.290> used<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.100> same<00:02:54.280> each

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
pretty much will be used the same each

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.200 
pretty much will be used the same each
time<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:56.110> now<00:02:56.290> we<00:02:57.280> need<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.460> actually<00:02:57.700> access

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
time but now we need to actually access

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.390 
time but now we need to actually access
the<00:02:58.510> elements<00:02:59.110> within<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.500> sam'l<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.250> we're

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
the elements within the sam'l so we're

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.340 
the elements within the sam'l so we're
going<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.700> declare<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.240> button<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.170> type

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
going to declare a button it's of type

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.080 
going to declare a button it's of type
IX<00:03:02.800> our<00:03:03.040> button<00:03:03.940> base<00:03:04.120> pointer<00:03:05.820> now<00:03:06.820> we<00:03:06.880> need

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
IX our button base pointer now we need

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.260 
IX our button base pointer now we need
to<00:03:07.120> locate<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.810> within<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.350> sam'l<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:10.180> do

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
to locate that within the sam'l to do

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.830 
to locate that within the sam'l to do
that<00:03:11.070> using<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.370> route<00:03:12.760> object<00:03:12.910> we<00:03:13.690> got

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
that using that route object we got

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140 
that using that route object we got
before<00:03:13.990> we're<00:03:14.890> going<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.130> call<00:03:15.310> fine<00:03:15.610> name<00:03:15.910> on

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
before we're going to call fine name on

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.140 
before we're going to call fine name on
my<00:03:16.690> button<00:03:17.140> remember<00:03:18.040> before<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.880> was<00:03:19.030> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
my button remember before that was the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.520 
my button remember before that was the
name<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.300> I<00:03:19.480> gave<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.080> button<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.410> we

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
name that I gave to the button that we

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.910 
name that I gave to the button that we
created<00:03:21.240> next<00:03:22.240> we<00:03:22.900> need<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.110> create<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.470> event

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
created next we need to create a event

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.270 
created next we need to create a event
handler<00:03:24.730> for<00:03:24.880> when<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.120> button<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.450> clicked

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
handler for when the button is clicked

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.280 
handler for when the button is clicked
to<00:03:27.280> do<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.700> I'm<00:03:28.450> going<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.780> add<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.930> little<00:03:29.140> bit

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
to do this I'm going to add a little bit

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.980 
to do this I'm going to add a little bit
more<00:03:29.470> code<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:29.920> our<00:03:30.010> project<00:03:30.660> let's<00:03:31.660> go<00:03:31.780> back

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
more code to our project let's go back

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.990 
more code to our project let's go back
up<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.320> top<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.740> our<00:03:32.830> function<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:36.000> let's

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
up to the top of our function and let's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.720 
up to the top of our function and let's
go<00:03:37.090> ahead<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.240> paste<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:37.870> class<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
go ahead and paste in this class so I

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.790 
go ahead and paste in this class so I
create<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.360> class<00:03:40.660> here<00:03:40.900> called<00:03:41.140> button<00:03:41.470> event

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
create a class here called button event

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.940 
create a class here called button event
handler<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.880> includes<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.600> method<00:03:44.350> on<00:03:44.470> click

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
handler it includes a method on click

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.800 
handler it includes a method on click
and<00:03:46.260> what<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.380> will<00:03:47.500> do<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:49.480> will<00:03:49.510> just

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
and what it will do is it will just

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.360 
and what it will do is it will just
display<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.200> message<00:03:50.500> box<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.190> says

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
display a message box that says

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.270 
display a message box that says
Silverlight<00:03:51.910> sample<00:03:52.890> that's<00:03:53.890> really<00:03:54.160> all

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
Silverlight sample that's really all

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.910 
Silverlight sample that's really all
that<00:03:54.310> happens<00:03:54.730> here<00:03:57.300> now<00:03:58.300> down<00:03:58.480> below<00:03:58.920> back

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
that happens here now down below back

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.840 
that happens here now down below back
when<00:04:00.100> we<00:04:00.130> were<00:04:00.190> before<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:02.700> creating<00:04:03.700> an

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
when we were before here creating an

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.880 
when we were before here creating an
object<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.510> type<00:04:04.540> button'<00:04:05.110> event<00:04:05.350> handler<00:04:05.740> the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
object of type button' event handler the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.640 
object of type button' event handler the
class<00:04:06.100> that<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.550> saw<00:04:06.700> above<00:04:07.000> i<00:04:07.620> create<00:04:08.620> a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
class that you saw above i create a

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.720 
class that you saw above i create a
click<00:04:08.890> delegate<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.810> now<00:04:11.070> you<00:04:12.070> can<00:04:12.220> see<00:04:12.400> here

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
click delegate so now you can see here

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.780 
click delegate so now you can see here
we<00:04:12.820> make<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> call<00:04:13.300> to<00:04:13.330> create<00:04:13.720> delegate<00:04:14.170> in

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
we make a call to create delegate in

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.420 
we make a call to create delegate in
this<00:04:15.790> call<00:04:16.090> we<00:04:16.810> will<00:04:16.900> connect<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.920> handler

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
this call we will connect the handler

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.380 
this call we will connect the handler
that<00:04:18.820> we<00:04:18.970> created<00:04:19.480> and<00:04:20.729> here<00:04:21.729> we<00:04:21.850> can<00:04:22.000> see<00:04:22.180> that
