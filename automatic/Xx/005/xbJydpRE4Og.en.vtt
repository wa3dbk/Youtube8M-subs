00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.790
 well we are back to review what 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.379
 who gave us this one-way game in the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.920
 quarterfinals at the benito stadium 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.980
 juárez alebrijes de oaxaca and dorados de 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.650
 sinaloa end up tying 0 for 0 in a 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.509
 party that gave us options like 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.619
 is the first the average shot 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.960
 distance that very well 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 Fraustro sent to Thani Swartz Man to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.159
 corner shot that again demanded 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.679
 to the own frausto in the first time 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.689
 the first 15 20 minutes was 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.090
 really moved this other shot 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.320
 violent but hit on the post and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.730
 danny santoya who was one of the most 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.350
 redeemable that he made in the game 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.410
 and then in the second time danny 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.440
 santoya had is pulled the goalkeeper very 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.289
 well won by legs but afterwards he 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.010
 courage lacked courage courage to 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.829
 sweep and push that ball a flaw 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.079
 that can cost you very expensive alebrijes 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.699
 of oaxaca and with what lukewarmness not with the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.629
 Left leg and the play of controversy 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.300
 here as he treads frausto a santoya when 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.280
 I had no need and very well the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140
 referee to the canvas and escobedo ejecting 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.570
 Wholesale 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.300
 but the ball was not on his back in 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.310
 the lateral line and how it arrives it treads 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.380
 that the truth is that it was an innocent 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.320
 from his innocent child part what 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.190
 disappointed and then this error of danny 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.780
 saint 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 failed the penalty and missed an option 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 very important and then I would have this 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.590
 jonathan error lacerda the service 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.160
 delayed it out that was factor from 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.440
 who entered prevented that ball from reaching 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.570
 at the head of danny santoya if the the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.610
 temperate but open center is why 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.410
 you have to give double merit to the goalkeeper 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.000
 since he had four interventions 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.740
 all of them very good 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.720
 including the criminal that even though 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.770
 it does not stop it it ends up guessing and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.200
 pressing then to santoya 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.079
 and we're just going to see the failure of 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.640
 holy and the one that scared him and the one that 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.729
 it was cold and it's worth it to see it through 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.950
 of ted technology in the service 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:08.000
 in the first instance it is very good 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.759
 diego martínez speed exceeds 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.610
 jonathan lacerda and at the moment when 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.190
 the archer comes out so he takes off to frausto 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.780
 and there at that moment when you stretch the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.360
 leg had to sweep you had to 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.540
 win with all the decision to 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.970
 push the ball I insist this move 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.070
 it can cost you very expensive alebrijes this 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.310
 and the criminal one, but above all, this 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.410
 because it is very clear that undoubtedly with the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.150
 left leg had to be swept and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.860
 makes a minimum effort when it has 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.810
 carried the goalkeeper very well 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.180
 practically with the studs pulling 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.459
 the ball opening the angle 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.590
 completely just the frame and it is 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.160
 that just gave him cold while 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.160
 we go over
