we're going to fill it full of water and
check<00:00:48.019> it<00:00:48.170> out<00:00:48.879> this<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:49.909> what<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.269> looks<00:00:50.449> like

we'll fill it full of water and

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.529 
we'll fill it full of water and
apparently<00:01:00.289> you<00:01:01.249> laid<00:01:01.459> in<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.789> Sun<00:01:02.030> this<00:01:02.269> side

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
apparently you laid in the Sun this side

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.140 
apparently you laid in the Sun this side
up<00:01:03.109> so<00:01:03.619> let's<00:01:04.070> fill<00:01:04.280> full<00:01:04.460> of<00:01:04.549> water<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:04.850> had<00:01:05.030> the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
up so let's fill full of water I had the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.060 
up so let's fill full of water I had the
option<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:07.000> filling<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.210> with<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.450> hose<00:01:09.070> now

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
option of filling it with the hose now

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.650 
option of filling it with the hose now
if<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:10.370> were<00:01:10.460> out<00:01:10.610> in<00:01:10.730> the<00:01:10.760> woods<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:11.420> think

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
if we were out in the woods this think

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.870 
if we were out in the woods this think
it'd<00:01:11.780> kind<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.080> be<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.440> bear<00:01:12.980> to<00:01:13.430> fill<00:01:13.670> full

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
it'd kind of be of a bear to fill full

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.030 
it'd kind of be of a bear to fill full
of<00:01:14.030> water<00:01:14.270> because<00:01:14.770> apparently<00:01:15.770> that's<00:01:15.890> the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
of water because apparently that's the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.190 
of water because apparently that's the
only<00:01:16.100> hole<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:16.670> have<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:17.330> fill<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:17.690> with<00:01:17.870> I

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
only hole you have to fill it with I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.440 
only hole you have to fill it with I
would<00:01:19.010> imagine<00:01:19.250> you'd<00:01:19.550> have<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.820> wade<00:01:20.420> out

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
would imagine you'd have to wade out

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.370 
would imagine you'd have to wade out
into<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.050> pond<00:01:21.290> or<00:01:21.710> whatever<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.170> somehow<00:01:24.170> or

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
into the pond or whatever and somehow or

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.750 
into the pond or whatever and somehow or
another<00:01:24.410> Philip<00:01:24.890> full<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.130> water<00:01:25.310> but<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.550> have

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
another Philip full of water but I have

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.750 
another Philip full of water but I have
a<00:01:25.790> hose<00:01:26.030> going<00:01:26.920> so<00:01:27.920> we'll<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:28.250> fill<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.580> that

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
a hose going so we'll just fill it that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.620 
a hose going so we'll just fill it that
way<00:01:31.720> now<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:32.930> thing<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.170> 5<00:01:33.710> gallons<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.000> I

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
way now this thing is 5 gallons and I

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.450 
way now this thing is 5 gallons and I
know<00:01:35.690> they<00:01:35.990> make<00:01:36.170> smaller<00:01:36.650> ones<00:01:37.040> because<00:01:37.310> I

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
know they make smaller ones because I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.510 
know they make smaller ones because I
saw<00:01:37.670> them<00:01:37.850> at<00:01:37.940> REI<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.510> other<00:01:38.840> day<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.490> this

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
saw them at REI the other day so this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.400 
saw them at REI the other day so this
must<00:01:40.910> be<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.270> luxury<00:01:42.140> model<00:01:42.590> 5<00:01:42.980> gallons

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.300 

okay<00:01:49.410> it's<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.920> almost<00:01:50.880> 11<00:01:51.270> o'clock<00:01:52.310> I'm

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
okay it's a almost 11 o'clock I'm

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.720 
okay it's a almost 11 o'clock I'm
checking<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.030> temperature<00:01:54.480> of<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.780> right<00:01:54.960> now

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
checking the temperature of it right now

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:04.730 
checking the temperature of it right now
and<00:01:56.730> it<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.390> reading<00:02:01.460> 55<00:02:02.460> degrees<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.740> it's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740

pretty<00:02:22.530> heavy<00:02:22.800> because<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.250> five<00:02:23.970> gallons

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
pretty heavy because it's five gallons

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.830 
pretty heavy because it's five gallons
of<00:02:24.450> water<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:25.370> we'll<00:02:26.370> set<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.670> right<00:02:26.820> here

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.240 

that<00:02:30.840> looks<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.170> pot<00:02:31.620> it'll<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
that looks like it's pot it'll be in the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.020 
that looks like it's pot it'll be in the
Sun<00:02:32.460> all<00:02:32.640> day<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:35.130> like<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.400> say<00:02:35.580> we'll<00:02:35.820> check

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
Sun all day and like I say we'll check

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.090 
Sun all day and like I say we'll check
it<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.270> an<00:02:36.390> hour<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> temperature

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
it in an hour and see if the temperature

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.320 
it in an hour and see if the temperature
went<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:39.800> okay<00:02:40.800> guys<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.370> been<00:02:41.550> exactly<00:02:42.150> one

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
went up okay guys it's been exactly one

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.990 
went up okay guys it's been exactly one
hour<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:44.010> starting<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> get<00:02:44.550> some<00:02:44.730> little

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
hour and I'm starting to get some little

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.220 
hour and I'm starting to get some little
issues<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.920> distinctly<00:02:47.520> says<00:02:48.230> in

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
issues going here it distinctly says in

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.010 
issues going here it distinctly says in
the<00:02:49.440> directions<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.250> put<00:02:50.460> clear<00:02:50.730> side<00:02:51.030> up<00:02:51.330> well

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
the directions to put clear side up well

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.360 
the directions to put clear side up well
here's<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.470> problem<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:55.320> cap<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
here's the problem the cap is on the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.300 
here's the problem the cap is on the
black<00:02:56.610> side<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.870> not<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.440> screw<00:02:58.800> on<00:02:58.980> cap

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
black side and it's not a screw on cap

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.170 
black side and it's not a screw on cap
it's<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.700> push<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.180> cap<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:01.440> why<00:03:02.180> they

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
it's a push on cap so now why they

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.470 
it's a push on cap so now why they
wanted<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.510> put<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> cap<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:05.370> side<00:03:05.670> beans

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
wanted to put the cap on this side beans

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.420 
wanted to put the cap on this side beans
this<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.050> side<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.290> sits<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.130> don't

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
this is the side that sits up I don't

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.330 
this is the side that sits up I don't
know<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.270> why<00:03:10.230> they<00:03:10.530> didn't<00:03:10.800> make<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.130> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
know and why they didn't make this a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.420 
know and why they didn't make this a
screw<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:12.000> cap<00:03:12.410> instead<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.680> push<00:03:13.920> on<00:03:14.160> cap

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
screw on cap instead of a push on cap

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.750 
screw on cap instead of a push on cap
but<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.840> say<00:03:16.020> it's<00:03:16.170> been<00:03:16.290> an<00:03:16.410> hour<00:03:16.760> we'll

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
but like I say it's been an hour we'll

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
but like I say it's been an hour we'll
check<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.120> temperature<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.900> right<00:03:19.080> now

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
check the temperature in it right now

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.869 
check the temperature in it right now
see<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.890> went<00:03:20.130> up

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.660 

okay<00:03:27.420> let's<00:03:27.689> see<00:03:27.810> what<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.049> temperature<00:03:28.260> is

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.670 

79<00:03:32.670> degrees<00:03:32.849> is<00:03:33.689> what<00:03:33.989> it's<00:03:34.139> showing

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
79 degrees is what it's showing

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.119 
79 degrees is what it's showing
so<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.489> was<00:03:35.670> 55<00:03:36.359> degrees<00:03:36.870> an<00:03:37.319> hour<00:03:37.469> ago<00:03:37.889> so

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
so it was 55 degrees an hour ago so

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.849 
so it was 55 degrees an hour ago so
let's<00:03:38.249> went<00:03:38.519> up<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.840> we'll<00:03:40.170> SMED<00:03:40.409> us<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.680> here

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
let's went up so we'll SMED us in here

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.330 
let's went up so we'll SMED us in here
for<00:03:41.040> another<00:03:41.249> hour<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.700> see<00:03:41.879> what<00:03:42.030> happens

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
for another hour and see what happens

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:53.530 
for another hour and see what happens
okay<00:03:44.340> guys<00:03:44.639> it's<00:03:44.939> one<00:03:45.299> o'clock<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:47.069> it<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.700> at

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.709 

90<00:03:54.540> degrees<00:03:55.340> it's<00:03:56.340> also<00:03:56.609> 80<00:03:56.999> degrees<00:03:57.450> outside

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
90 degrees it's also 80 degrees outside

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.039 
90 degrees it's also 80 degrees outside
so<00:03:58.379> it's<00:03:59.040> 10<00:03:59.700> degrees<00:03:59.849> warmer<00:04:00.719> than<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.019> is

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
so it's 10 degrees warmer than it is

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.860 
so it's 10 degrees warmer than it is
outside<00:04:01.349> so<00:04:01.889> we'll<00:04:02.549> check<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:02.879> again<00:04:02.939> at<00:04:03.389> 2

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
outside so we'll check it again at 2

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.860 
outside so we'll check it again at 2
o'clock

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.349 

let<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.049> Bob<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.349> little<00:04:13.620> bit<00:04:16.669> okay<00:04:17.669> it's<00:04:17.910> 2

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
let that Bob a little bit okay it's 2

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.039 
let that Bob a little bit okay it's 2
o'clock<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:19.530> temperature<00:04:20.039> outside<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:21.049> 83

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
o'clock the temperature outside is 83

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.409 
o'clock the temperature outside is 83
degrees<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.919> right<00:04:23.610> now<00:04:23.789> this<00:04:24.120> thing<00:04:24.180> is

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
degrees and right now this thing is

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.710 
degrees and right now this thing is
running<00:04:25.280> at<00:04:26.660> 95<00:04:27.660> degrees<00:04:28.669> so<00:04:29.669> I'm<00:04:30.389> gonna<00:04:30.539> go

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
running at 95 degrees so I'm gonna go

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.469 
running at 95 degrees so I'm gonna go
hang<00:04:30.900> this<00:04:31.110> thing<00:04:31.289> up<00:04:31.440> in<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.680> tree<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.490> give

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
hang this thing up in the tree and give

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.279 
hang this thing up in the tree and give
you<00:04:33.570> my<00:04:33.750> final<00:04:34.020> thoughts<00:04:34.380> on<00:04:34.560> this<00:04:34.710> night<00:04:36.289> okay

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
you my final thoughts on this night okay

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.439 
you my final thoughts on this night okay
I<00:04:37.320> got<00:04:37.590> it<00:04:37.740> up<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.039> tree<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.580> should<00:04:39.090> say<00:04:39.270> we

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
I got it up in the tree I should say we

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.330 
I got it up in the tree I should say we
got<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.780> up<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.139> tree<00:04:40.380> this<00:04:40.889> thing<00:04:41.130> weighs

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
got it up in the tree this thing weighs

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.670 
got it up in the tree this thing weighs
40<00:04:41.849> pounds<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.810> takes<00:04:43.020> quite<00:04:43.199> a<00:04:43.259> bit<00:04:43.349> to<00:04:43.500> get

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
40 pounds so it takes quite a bit to get

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.170 
40 pounds so it takes quite a bit to get
it<00:04:43.830> up<00:04:43.919> in<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.159> tree

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
it up in the tree

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.810 
it up in the tree
it<00:04:45.539> does<00:04:45.780> have<00:04:46.020> some<00:04:46.229> flaws<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:47.099> cap<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.699> the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
it does have some flaws this cap is the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.510 
it does have some flaws this cap is the
big<00:04:48.030> flaw<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.750> mean<00:04:49.470> all<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.099> push<00:04:50.340> on

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
big flaw I mean all it is the push on

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.180 
big flaw I mean all it is the push on
cap<00:04:50.849> as<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.330> can<00:04:51.479> see<00:04:51.720> they<00:04:52.530> want<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.009> put

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
cap as you can see they want you to put

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.810
