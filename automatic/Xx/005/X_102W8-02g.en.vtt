okay you went on both the brake line off

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.190 
okay you went on both the brake line off
in<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.009> rough<00:00:05.190> stop<00:00:05.430> frame<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.660> boat<00:00:06.870> should

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
in the rough stop frame the boat should

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.839 
in the rough stop frame the boat should
come<00:00:07.500> out<00:00:07.589> easy<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.980> had<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.309> use<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> master

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
come out easy I had to use a master

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.509 
come out easy I had to use a master
because<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.420> such<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> tight<00:00:09.960> space<00:00:10.400> once<00:00:11.400> you

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
because it's such a tight space once you

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.730 
because it's such a tight space once you
get<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.849> out<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> way<00:00:12.300> move<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.380> down<00:00:13.559> out

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
get that out of the way move it down out

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.279 
get that out of the way move it down out
of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> way<00:00:14.210> and<00:00:15.210> then<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.690> move<00:00:15.900> your<00:00:16.049> fuel

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
of the way and then you move your fuel

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.590 
of the way and then you move your fuel
rails<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> way<00:00:17.270> and<00:00:18.270> then<00:00:18.480> you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
rails out of the way and then you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.439 
rails out of the way and then you
finished<00:00:18.990> cutting<00:00:19.289> edge<00:00:19.470> E&amp;C<00:00:19.910> I'll<00:00:20.910> reach<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
finished cutting edge E&amp;C I'll reach is

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.840 
finished cutting edge E&amp;C I'll reach is
hold<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.779> down<00:00:21.930> right<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.760> do

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
hold it down right there all I got to do

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.599 
hold it down right there all I got to do
is<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> little<00:00:24.510> cross<00:00:24.720> here<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.830> then<00:00:26.340> cut

is just a little cross here and then cut

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.420 
is just a little cross here and then cut
along<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.269> bottom<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.500> inside<00:00:31.430> okay

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
along the bottom get to the inside okay

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.799 
along the bottom get to the inside okay
as<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:34.610> cut<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.910> cut<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.540> all

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
as you can see I cut it out cut out all

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.000 
as you can see I cut it out cut out all
the<00:00:37.230> rock<00:00:38.809> there<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.170> piece<00:00:40.410> left<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the rock there is one piece left that I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.990 
the rock there is one piece left that I
get<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.780> which<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.700> right<00:00:44.700> there

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
get to take out which is a right there

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.630 
get to take out which is a right there
when<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.450> cut<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.289> matches<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:47.570> and

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
when I cut it out so it matches this and

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
when I cut it out so it matches this and
what<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.760> doing<00:00:52.010> I'm<00:00:53.010> using<00:00:53.280> still<00:00:54.000> plate<00:00:54.390> I'm

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
what I'm doing I'm using still plate I'm

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
what I'm doing I'm using still plate I'm
using<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.710> rotted<00:00:56.129> piece<00:00:56.480> see<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.579> mean<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
using the rotted piece see here I mean I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.639 
using the rotted piece see here I mean I
probably<00:01:00.480> couldn't<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:00.989> away<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.410> using

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
probably couldn't get away with using

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.030 
probably couldn't get away with using
the<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.160> piece<00:01:03.229> but<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.409> must<00:01:04.650> we'll<00:01:04.830> just

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040

93<00:02:16.250> Mustang<00:02:16.670> GT<00:02:17.120> very<00:02:18.020> simple<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:20.150> took<00:02:20.390> me

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
93 Mustang GT very simple it took me

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.560 
93 Mustang GT very simple it took me
maybe<00:02:20.810> two<00:02:21.170> days<00:02:21.320> total<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:22.040> cut<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> piece<00:02:23.030> that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
maybe two days total I cut a piece that

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.280 
maybe two days total I cut a piece that
both<00:02:23.780> fit<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.530> overlap<00:02:25.990> I'm<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.140> it's

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
both fit and overlap I'm so it's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.130 
both fit and overlap I'm so it's
overlapped<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.280> walled<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.270> in<00:02:29.420> there<00:02:29.690> you'll

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
overlapped and walled it in there you'll

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.220 
overlapped and walled it in there you'll
never<00:02:30.440> see<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.310> it'll<00:02:31.489> look<00:02:31.760> good<00:02:32.230> and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
never see it and it'll look good and
