00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.040 
and what I use is a piece of co hanger
like<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:39.980> which<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.129> Vic<00:00:41.340> Salinas<00:00:41.899> but<00:00:42.899> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
like this which is Vic Salinas but you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.080 
like this which is Vic Salinas but you
don't<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.590> that's<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.820> this

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
don't want to use one that's got this

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.990

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
little piece of plastic right here

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.520 
little piece of plastic right here

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because then you won't be able to get a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.360 
because then you won't be able to get a
good<00:00:50.160> loop<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> end<00:00:51.559> that's<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.219> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370

have<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.590> kettle<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.010> boiling<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
have so the kettle is boiling so you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.850

prefer it if you're looking for a more
natural<00:05:34.080> looking<00:05:34.710> bread<00:05:35.070> than<00:05:35.340> my<00:05:35.460> suppose<00:05:35.820> of

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
natural looking bread than my suppose of

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.129 
natural looking bread than my suppose of
those<00:05:36.210> would<00:05:36.389> go<00:05:36.540> well<00:05:36.780> but<00:05:37.190> position<00:05:38.190> back<00:05:38.400> so

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
those would go well but position back so

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.409 
those would go well but position back so
these<00:05:40.139> are<00:05:40.200> since<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.620> think<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.419> basically

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419

extra steam

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.750 
extra steam
on<00:06:01.530> there<00:06:01.860> so<00:06:02.580> it<00:06:02.700> keeps<00:06:02.880> it<00:06:03.620> loop<00:06:04.620> shape<00:06:04.950> and

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
on there so it keeps it loop shape and

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.290 
on there so it keeps it loop shape and
like<00:06:06.030> I<00:06:06.120> said<00:06:06.180> you<00:06:06.420> can<00:06:06.450> cut<00:06:06.750> all<00:06:06.900> this<00:06:07.110> off

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.960 

okay<00:06:10.840> so<00:06:11.310> basically<00:06:12.310> that's<00:06:12.550> how<00:06:12.759> you<00:06:12.909> do<00:06:13.180> it

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
okay so basically that's how you do it

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.180 
okay so basically that's how you do it
there<00:06:15.970> are<00:06:16.090> obviously<00:06:16.539> different<00:06:17.190> steaming

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
there are obviously different steaming

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.360 
there are obviously different steaming
lengths<00:06:18.610> for<00:06:18.909> different<00:06:20.069> lengths<00:06:21.069> of<00:06:21.190> time

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
lengths for different lengths of time

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.070 
lengths for different lengths of time
for<00:06:21.879> different<00:06:22.419> thickness<00:06:22.990> of<00:06:23.139> hair<00:06:24.750> so<00:06:25.750> as

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
for different thickness of hair so as

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.339 
for different thickness of hair so as
you<00:06:26.289> do<00:06:26.530> it<00:06:26.680> you<00:06:26.830> couldn't<00:06:27.069> learn<00:06:27.430> how<00:06:27.879> to

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
you do it you couldn't learn how to

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.890 
you do it you couldn't learn how to
adjust<00:06:29.759> the<00:06:30.759> times<00:06:31.030> but<00:06:31.360> this<00:06:31.509> is<00:06:31.629> just<00:06:31.810> a

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
adjust the times but this is just a

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.239 
adjust the times but this is just a
brief<00:06:32.110> tutorial<00:06:32.379> on<00:06:32.889> how<00:06:33.099> to

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:34.249 
brief tutorial on how to

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.820 
brief tutorial on how to
