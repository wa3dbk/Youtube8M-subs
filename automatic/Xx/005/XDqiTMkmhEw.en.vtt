00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.880 

and<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.550> question<00:00:05.910> then<00:00:06.589> after<00:00:07.589> Tegra<00:00:07.859> 2

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
and so the question then after Tegra 2

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.039 
and so the question then after Tegra 2
till<00:00:08.700> first<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.180> world's<00:00:09.450> first<00:00:09.570> dual<00:00:09.809> core

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:10.049 
till first the world's first dual core

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.230 
till first the world's first dual core
after<00:00:11.010> ticker<00:00:11.220> three<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.880> world's<00:00:12.210> first

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
after ticker three the world's first

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240 
after ticker three the world's first
quad<00:00:12.660> core<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.230> then<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:13.920> double<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
quad core and then we double the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.190 
quad core and then we double the
performance<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.120> tegra<00:00:15.360> 4

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
performance of that with tegra 4

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.550 
performance of that with tegra 4
what's<00:00:17.830> next<00:00:18.190> for<00:00:18.340> us<00:00:18.690> what's<00:00:19.690> next<00:00:20.020> for<00:00:20.140> us<00:00:20.230> I

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
what's next for us what's next for us I

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.250 
what's next for us what's next for us I
mean<00:00:21.100> what<00:00:21.280> can<00:00:21.400> we<00:00:21.550> possibly<00:00:21.730> do<00:00:22.240> I<00:00:22.450> guess<00:00:23.110> we

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
mean what can we possibly do I guess we

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.260 
mean what can we possibly do I guess we
could<00:00:23.440> we<00:00:23.890> could<00:00:24.040> do<00:00:24.190> a<00:00:24.220> course<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:28.240> that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
could we could do a course but that

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.540 
could we could do a course but that
seems<00:00:28.660> pretty<00:00:28.840> pedestrian<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:30.250> seems

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
seems pretty pedestrian that seems

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.640 
seems pretty pedestrian that seems
pretty<00:00:30.760> obvious<00:00:30.880> we<00:00:31.810> can<00:00:31.960> do<00:00:32.080> 12<00:00:32.380> course

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
pretty obvious we can do 12 course

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.180 
pretty obvious we can do 12 course
that's<00:00:32.980> more<00:00:33.160> than<00:00:33.280> eight<00:00:34.590> however<00:00:35.590> I<00:00:35.860> think

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
that's more than eight however I think

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.549 
that's more than eight however I think
that<00:00:36.489> maybe<00:00:36.700> we<00:00:36.880> could<00:00:36.910> do<00:00:37.120> better<00:00:37.239> than<00:00:37.450> that

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that maybe we could do better than that

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.549 
that maybe we could do better than that
what<00:00:38.559> we<00:00:38.680> decided<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.130> do<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:41.170> we<00:00:41.320> knew<00:00:41.410> it's

tegra<00:02:37.930> we<00:02:38.499> bridge<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:38.859> gap<00:02:39.629> we've<00:02:40.629> brought

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
tegra we bridge the gap we've brought

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.910 
tegra we bridge the gap we've brought
mobile<00:02:41.439> computing<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> same<00:02:43.060> level<00:02:43.090> as

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
mobile computing to the same level as

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.619 
mobile computing to the same level as

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
computing to the same level as

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.959 
computing to the same level as
supercomputer<00:02:49.469> we've<00:02:50.469> brought<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.400> heart<00:02:51.760> of

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:51.969

g-force and the soul of Tesla to mobile
computing<00:03:06.639> and<00:03:07.090> we're<00:03:07.209> really<00:03:07.359> excited<00:03:07.510> about

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
computing and we're really excited about

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.159 
computing and we're really excited about
that<00:03:08.019> now<00:03:08.919> what's<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.579> benefit<00:03:10.019> what's<00:03:11.019> the
