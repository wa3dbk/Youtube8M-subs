 You guys make that homemade hot spring. 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.460
 super fast and easy to practice 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.460
 we will need 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.470
 mineral water 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:41.940
 an apple and chamomile tea can be this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.339
 sachet if the best leaf still a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.610
 spray bottle with this container and 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:56.390
 Let's put mineral water in a little glass. 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.390
 to heat us to make tea 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:08.189
 Let's put water on and warm it up. 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:12.080
 microwaves a minute and a half more or 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.080
 less to warm the water is enough 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.090
 Now let's put two sachets of tea 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
 camomile 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.590
 I used two because I want it to stay 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:38.860
 concentrate and the chamomile herb that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.610
 has the property to calm the skin to 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.610
 this we are going to use 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.440
 Let's leave it there for 15 minutes in the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.440
 Water 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.750
 now let's cut the apple to the apple too 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.760

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.190

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:43.350
 so let's cut it into cubes as soon as 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:47.080
 no maybe the size of the apple is not 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.060

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.770
