00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.680
 this is a machine for extraction 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.680
 of cocoa oil 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.080
 and it was built by jorge luís sánchez 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.830
 with the support of an engineer 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.740
 so the various parameters of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.160
 operation were verified and is 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.160
 reliable to scale it industrially 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.329
 we will explain briefly the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.400
 process 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.720
 in this mill 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.690
 of hand 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.890
 the cocoa is milled 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.280
 the ground cocoa itself is concentrated here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.930
 what 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.390
 subsequently emptied into this plunger 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.890
 we have what we have 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.739
 controlled resistances 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.120
 to have the right temperature and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:08.320
 has an agitator moved by this motor 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.270
 and this agitator and the temperature itself 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.630
 liquefy 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.799
 this ground cocoa 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.320
 if you press it to make it flow to 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.830
 compression funnel 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.460
 which is seen through this valve 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.910
 once you get to this plunger of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.900
 Compression compression stimulus in your 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.900
 interior has a mesh 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.020
 a greater filter 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.100
 this filter medium is the one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.439
 allows separation of the oil 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.439
 and others the product that is the pasta 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.390
 we can see inside the plunger that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 It has a series of slots 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.730
 that push that allow or lead to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.000
 that the oil 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.310
 once released, follow this conduit 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.800
 until you get to this filter 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.690
 to finally 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.940
 well this filter also has a 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:21.060
 temperature control for finally 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.060
 fall in a front container installed 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.580
 this compression piston 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:36.230
 It has two parts, one fixed and it is mobile 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.230
 once it was filled with the product 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.540
 closes 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.349
 and it proceeds to compress in this case in 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.690
 this prototype we have manually 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:53.570
 a machine delivered to the producer 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.570
 it would be done by electrical means 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.370
 that's all the approximate cost of this 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.450
 equipment is 72 thousand pesos and its capacity 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.450
 is 4 kilograms 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.000
 for now cocoa thank you
