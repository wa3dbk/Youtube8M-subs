00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.949
 that here she flew out of him and now this 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.230

 only two stops to the house but 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.750
 events took a turn so rare 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.430
 that the girl was in hospital and I 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.430
 the turn added gas again 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.620
 from which the stroller began to pull down 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.210
 side yuzom ie she's like this 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 turned matching her kept these 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.920
 I havenâ€™t been given further hands to continue with me 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 beginning to break out and take down my hands 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.820

 arrived in a few minutes confidently 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 the bus is too sharply wil or 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 exceeded the speed and the fact that next 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.020
 there was an accident minibus with another bus 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.760
 only strengthened her suspicions 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.830
 for the sake of experiment the wheelchair is flying again 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220
 wearing straps

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.869
 drivers taking the child on their knees and
