show you another one of the basic
stretches<00:00:08.180> called<00:00:08.510> the<00:00:08.900> forward<00:00:09.800> scratch

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
stretches called the forward scratch

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.289 
stretches called the forward scratch
forward<00:00:10.970> cuts<00:00:11.349> Wow<00:00:12.490> very<00:00:13.490> self-explanatory

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
forward cuts Wow very self-explanatory

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.510 
forward cuts Wow very self-explanatory
you<00:00:14.870> here<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.259> forward<00:00:15.679> you<00:00:16.010> don't<00:00:16.280> hear<00:00:16.430> the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
you here the forward you don't hear the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.090 
you here the forward you don't hear the
backwards<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:17.870> way<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.050> do<00:00:18.200> this<00:00:18.350> is<00:00:18.590> by

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
backwards and the way you do this is by

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.080 
backwards and the way you do this is by
using<00:00:19.490> cross<00:00:20.060> fader<00:00:20.740> for<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.800> open<00:00:22.250> sorry

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
using cross fader for the open sorry

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.230 
using cross fader for the open sorry
opening<00:00:23.870> it<00:00:24.080> put<00:00:24.680> forward<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:25.790> closing<00:00:26.150> it

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
opening it put forward and closing it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.610 
opening it put forward and closing it
for<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.540> backwards<00:00:26.990> okay

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
for the backwards okay

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.710 
for the backwards okay
notice<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.310> positioning<00:00:28.910> of<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.150> fader<00:00:29.390> this

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
notice the positioning of the fader this

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.660 
notice the positioning of the fader this
is<00:00:29.870> a<00:00:29.900> closed<00:00:30.320> fader<00:00:30.770> scratch<00:00:31.130> as<00:00:31.340> opposed<00:00:31.610> to

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
is a closed fader scratch as opposed to

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.760 
is a closed fader scratch as opposed to
the<00:00:31.790> other<00:00:31.940> ones<00:00:32.149> that<00:00:32.270> we<00:00:32.360> did<00:00:32.620> any<00:00:33.620> other

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
the other ones that we did any other

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.590 
the other ones that we did any other
videos<00:00:34.100> we<00:00:34.280> were<00:00:34.370> doing<00:00:34.579> open<00:00:35.000> fader<00:00:35.239> stuff

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
videos we were doing open fader stuff

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.900 
videos we were doing open fader stuff
I'm<00:00:35.780> gonna<00:00:35.929> emphasize<00:00:36.140> this<00:00:36.589> along<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.879> way

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
I'm gonna emphasize this along the way

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.970 
I'm gonna emphasize this along the way
as<00:00:38.300> I<00:00:38.449> show<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.629> more<00:00:38.809> videos<00:00:39.170> with<00:00:39.530> tips<00:00:39.559> and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
as I show you more videos with tips and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.529 
as I show you more videos with tips and
tricks<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.339> something<00:00:40.609> that<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:41.359> very

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
tricks and something that it's very

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:42.819 
tricks and something that it's very
important<00:00:41.899> to<00:00:41.989> differentiate<00:00:42.320> between

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
important to differentiate between

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.209 
important to differentiate between
the<00:00:43.370> hand<00:00:43.609> positioning<00:00:44.059> for<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.140> closed<00:00:45.890> and

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
the hand positioning for the closed and

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.299 
the hand positioning for the closed and
open<00:00:46.969> fader<00:00:47.480> scratches<00:00:48.469> okay<00:00:48.679> this<00:00:48.890> one<00:00:49.129> is

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
open fader scratches okay this one is

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.970 
open fader scratches okay this one is
closed<00:00:49.519> meaning<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.030> starts<00:00:50.359> closed<00:00:50.659> and<00:00:50.989> ends

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
closed meaning it starts closed and ends

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.689 
closed meaning it starts closed and ends
closed<00:00:52.159> okay<00:00:53.089> not<00:00:53.929> all<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.350> time<00:00:54.530> just<00:00:54.859> more

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
closed okay not all the time just more

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.729 
closed okay not all the time just more
in<00:00:55.999> the<00:00:56.210> repetitive<00:00:56.839> face<00:00:57.050> we'll<00:00:57.350> get<00:00:57.499> there

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
in the repetitive face we'll get there

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.860 
in the repetitive face we'll get there
yes<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:58.219> now<00:00:58.399> just<00:00:58.699> just<00:00:59.269> for<00:00:59.390> now<00:00:59.479> start<00:00:59.809> it

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
yes so now just just for now start it

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.349 
yes so now just just for now start it
closed<00:01:00.199> I<00:01:00.469> don't<00:01:00.710> hear<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:00.979> sound<00:01:01.010> okay<00:01:01.819> I<00:01:02.030> tap

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
closed I don't hear the sound okay I tap

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.170 
closed I don't hear the sound okay I tap
it<00:01:02.539> in<00:01:02.719> for<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.050> foreword<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.760> close<00:01:05.000> it

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
it in for the foreword and I close it

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.000 
it in for the foreword and I close it
just<00:01:05.750> before<00:01:05.960> every<00:01:06.260> one<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.620> I<00:01:06.680> don't<00:01:06.740> hear

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
just before every one so I don't hear

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.600 
just before every one so I don't hear
any<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.370> that

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
any of that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.270 
any of that
oh<00:01:10.149> wow<00:01:11.210> not<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.350> rewind<00:01:12.649> you<00:01:12.890> don't<00:01:13.040> want<00:01:13.189> to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
oh wow not the rewind you don't want to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.880 
oh wow not the rewind you don't want to
close<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.540> as<00:01:14.719> you're<00:01:15.229> rewinding<00:01:15.680> because

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
close it as you're rewinding because

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.289 
close it as you're rewinding because
you're<00:01:16.130> probably<00:01:16.430> gonna<00:01:16.640> catch<00:01:16.939> some<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.210> the

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
you're probably gonna catch some of the

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.120 
you're probably gonna catch some of the
rewinding<00:01:17.780> sound<00:01:17.990> like<00:01:18.110> wow<00:01:18.290> wow<00:01:18.590> see<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
rewinding sound like wow wow see that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.940 
rewinding sound like wow wow see that
you<00:01:19.310> heard<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.939> rip<00:01:20.509> sound<00:01:20.990> okay<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:21.799> you

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
you heard the rip sound okay so you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.069 
you heard the rip sound okay so you
don't<00:01:22.100> want<00:01:22.219> that<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.640> want<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:23.000> do<00:01:23.119> pop<00:01:23.719> it<00:01:23.990> in

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
don't want that you want to do pop it in

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.889 
don't want that you want to do pop it in
for<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.350> foreword<00:01:24.799> close<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.700> then<00:01:26.240> rewind<00:01:26.570> so

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
for the foreword close it then rewind so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.410 
for the foreword close it then rewind so
it<00:01:27.380> looks<00:01:27.530> kind<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:27.860> like<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.039> delayed<00:01:28.579> motion

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
it looks kind of like a delayed motion

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.580 
it looks kind of like a delayed motion
you<00:01:30.049> know<00:01:30.170> I'm<00:01:30.289> going<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.250> then

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
you know I'm going like that and then

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.459 
you know I'm going like that and then
like<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:33.979> know<00:01:34.659> actually<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.020> forward

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
like that you know actually the forward

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.319 
like that you know actually the forward
problem<00:01:36.799> at<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.219> same<00:01:37.369> time<00:01:37.609> then<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:37.880> close<00:01:38.149> it

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
problem at the same time then I close it

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.260 
problem at the same time then I close it
then<00:01:38.479> we<00:01:38.570> want<00:01:38.810> yeah<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:43.369> there's<00:01:43.700> three

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
then we want yeah and there's three

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.029 
then we want yeah and there's three
variations<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:44.990> doing<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.380> forward<00:01:45.740> scrunch

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
variations of doing the forward scrunch

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.990 
variations of doing the forward scrunch
you<00:01:46.189> have<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:47.179> release<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:49.429> you<00:01:49.609> have<00:01:49.820> these

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
you have the release and you have these

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.990 
you have the release and you have these
fab<00:01:50.359> which<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.530> faster<00:01:52.039> or<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:53.240> drag<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.820> those

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
fab which is faster or the drag so those

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.149 
fab which is faster or the drag so those
are<00:01:56.119> just<00:01:56.270> different<00:01:56.479> articulations<00:01:57.159> doing

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
are just different articulations doing

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.590 
are just different articulations doing
any<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.429> those<00:01:58.579> will<00:01:58.850> suffice<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.359> good<00:01:59.509> to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
any of those will suffice is good to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.330 
any of those will suffice is good to
practice<00:01:59.749> all<00:02:00.200> those<00:02:00.530> variations<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.219> get

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
practice all those variations to get

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.069 
practice all those variations to get
comfortable<00:02:01.670> with<00:02:02.060> all<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.689> different
