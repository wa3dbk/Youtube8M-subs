pro angler I come up with this system
here<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.380> made<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.779> here<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> that's<00:00:25.289> a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.179 
the right side sort of like let me see
here

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.069 

and<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.280> goes<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.540> goes<00:01:57.810> like

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and it goes like that so that goes like

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:14.180 
and it goes like that so that goes like
that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190

screw<00:02:15.190> them<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:22.290> threw<00:02:23.290> them<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:25.300> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
screw them on threw them on and the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.900 
screw them on threw them on and the
motor<00:02:26.440> will<00:02:26.770> now<00:02:29.190> see<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.250> had<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:30.730> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
motor will now see I had it in the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.340 
motor will now see I had it in the
middle<00:02:31.209> before<00:02:31.830> down<00:02:32.830> through<00:02:33.220> here<00:02:34.350> which

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
middle before down through here which

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.590 
middle before down through here which
was<00:02:35.620> great<00:02:35.980> once<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.880> was<00:02:37.030> there<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:39.600> he

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
was great once it was there but he

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.720 
was great once it was there but he
couldn't<00:02:40.959> he<00:02:41.620> had<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.920> lay<00:02:42.069> down<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.580> wouldn't

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
couldn't he had to lay down it wouldn't

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.000 
couldn't he had to lay down it wouldn't
drop<00:02:42.970> straight<00:02:43.239> down<00:02:43.569> through<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.840> hole<00:02:44.110> like

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
drop straight down through the hole like

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.750 
drop straight down through the hole like
this<00:02:45.070> system<00:02:45.670> does<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.310> he<00:02:48.310> had<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.580> lay<00:02:48.730> down

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
this system does so he had to lay down

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.880 
this system does so he had to lay down
meaning<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.959> seed<00:02:50.230> had<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.530> be<00:02:50.620> out<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
meaning the seed had to be out of the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.979 
meaning the seed had to be out of the
way<00:02:51.040> meaning<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.030> person<00:02:52.239> had<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:52.840> out<00:02:52.930> of

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
way meaning the person had to be out of

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.180 
way meaning the person had to be out of
the<00:02:53.080> way<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:54.190> therefore<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:56.620> had<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.950> be<00:02:57.040> off

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
the way so therefore you had to be off

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.250 
the way so therefore you had to be off
to<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> side<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> kayak<00:02:58.600> out<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:59.110> the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
to the side of the kayak out in the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.229 
to the side of the kayak out in the
water<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:01.150> that's<00:03:01.540> not<00:03:01.750> safe<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.940> couldn't

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
water and that's not safe you couldn't

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.150 
water and that's not safe you couldn't
do<00:03:04.300> it<00:03:04.420> from<00:03:04.600> land<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.320> am<00:03:05.440> now<00:03:05.650> because

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.530 

the<00:03:09.160> motor<00:03:09.400> would<00:03:09.580> be<00:03:09.760> hitting<00:03:10.000> into<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.390> dirt

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
the motor would be hitting into the dirt

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.970 
the motor would be hitting into the dirt
and<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.810> course<00:03:14.080> too<00:03:14.260> if<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.470> come<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.739> over

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
and of course too if you come in over

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.550 
and of course too if you come in over
shallow<00:03:15.220> rocks<00:03:15.580> coming<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:17.140> motor<00:03:17.350> would

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
shallow rocks coming in the motor would

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.590 
shallow rocks coming in the motor would
hit<00:03:19.920> so<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:22.780> here<00:03:23.880> just<00:03:24.880> push<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.329> now<00:03:25.570> I

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
hit so this here just push this now I

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.949 
hit so this here just push this now I
better<00:03:25.870> lift<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.260> motor<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.880> hopefully<00:03:28.420> this

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
better lift the motor and hopefully this

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.870 
better lift the motor and hopefully this
will<00:03:29.200> hold<00:03:29.380> everything<00:03:32.549> we'll<00:03:33.549> just<00:03:33.700> have<00:03:33.790> to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
will hold everything we'll just have to

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.090 
will hold everything we'll just have to
set<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.209> depth<00:03:34.450> when<00:03:35.440> I'm<00:03:35.560> out<00:03:35.680> there<00:03:35.709> as

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
set the depth when I'm out there as

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.180 
set the depth when I'm out there as
having<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.489> right<00:03:36.579> now<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.850> battery<00:03:38.190> let's

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
having it right now the battery let's

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.699 
having it right now the battery let's
make<00:03:39.370> sure<00:03:39.400> it's<00:03:39.700> off<00:03:40.230> because<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.500> have

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
make sure it's off because I have

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.590 
make sure it's off because I have
plugged<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.549> before<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.209> motor<00:03:43.390> was

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
plugged it in before and the motor was

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.690 
plugged it in before and the motor was
running<00:03:43.920> which<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.100> not<00:03:45.250> good<00:03:45.459> if<00:03:45.579> you're

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
running which is not good if you're

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.130 
running which is not good if you're
standing<00:03:46.030> by<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.209> propellers<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:49.049> get<00:03:50.049> away

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
standing by the propellers so get away

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:59.360 
standing by the propellers so get away
from<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.590> propellers<00:03:53.640> attach<00:03:54.640> this<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.860> here

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.830 

yeah<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.610> battery<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.150> was<00:04:01.390> not<00:04:01.540> supposed

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
yeah the battery I know was not supposed

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.150 
yeah the battery I know was not supposed
to<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:01.960> sitting<00:04:02.260> loose<00:04:02.440> but<00:04:02.680> that's<00:04:02.860> what<00:04:03.070> I'm

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
to be sitting loose but that's what I'm

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.220 
to be sitting loose but that's what I'm
doing<00:04:03.460> tonight<00:04:03.640> I'm<00:04:04.600> going<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.810> push<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.140> out

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
doing tonight I'm going to push it out

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.900 
doing tonight I'm going to push it out
in<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.500> water<00:04:05.710> here<00:04:05.980> just<00:04:06.220> shortly<00:04:06.490> just<00:04:06.790> to

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
in the water here just shortly just to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.720 
in the water here just shortly just to
see<00:04:07.120> where<00:04:08.050> it<00:04:08.170> sits<00:04:08.640> level<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:10.440> then<00:04:11.730> and

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
see where it sits level and then and

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.760 
see where it sits level and then and
because<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.750> motors<00:04:14.050> on<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.230> right<00:04:14.500> I'm

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
because the motors on the right I'm

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.860 
because the motors on the right I'm
assuming<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.340> battery<00:04:15.760> will<00:04:16.360> probably<00:04:16.750> have

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
assuming the battery will probably have

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.550 
assuming the battery will probably have
to<00:04:16.900> be<00:04:17.110> over<00:04:17.290> to<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.500> left<00:04:17.680> somewhat<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:20.260> let's

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
to be over to the left somewhat so let's

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.640 
to be over to the left somewhat so let's
push<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:20.860> out<00:04:21.360> and<00:04:22.360> see<00:04:23.730> how<00:04:24.730> it's<00:04:24.970> it's<00:04:25.650> just

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
push it out and see how it's it's just

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.160 
push it out and see how it's it's just
sitting<00:04:26.950> more<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.490> right<00:04:27.640> more<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.300> left

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.050 

looks<00:04:35.170> pretty<00:04:35.500> good<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.700> course<00:04:36.910> I'm

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
looks pretty good and of course I'm

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.300 
looks pretty good and of course I'm
going<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.360> in<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.540> middle<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.170> if<00:04:39.040> that's

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
going to be in the middle so if that's

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.650 
going to be in the middle so if that's
in<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.640> middle<00:04:39.940> then<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.180> think<00:04:40.330> too<00:04:40.510> much

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
in the middle then I think too much

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.900 
in the middle then I think too much
weight<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.110> right<00:04:41.290> so<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.830> will<00:04:42.550> bring<00:04:42.730> this

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
weight to the right so I will bring this

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.510 
weight to the right so I will bring this
to<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.180> left<00:04:44.400> as<00:04:45.400> far<00:04:45.700> as<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:47.250> I'll<00:04:48.250> show<00:04:48.460> you

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
to the left as far as the I'll show you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.800 
to the left as far as the I'll show you
the<00:04:48.760> downrigger<00:04:49.330> also<00:04:51.450> okay<00:04:52.450> let's<00:04:52.690> just

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
the downrigger also okay let's just

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.060 
the downrigger also okay let's just
start<00:04:53.050> up<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.260> blades<00:04:53.500> here<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:53.860> see<00:04:54.010> if

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
start up the blades here and see if

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.390 
start up the blades here and see if
they're<00:04:54.220> going<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.400> go<00:04:56.850> yes<00:04:57.850> they<00:04:58.060> do<00:04:58.120> work

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
they're going to go yes they do work

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.490 
they're going to go yes they do work
okay<00:05:00.400> as<00:05:00.520> far<00:05:00.700> as<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:00.910> downloader<00:05:01.450> goes<00:05:02.430> it

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
okay as far as the downloader goes it

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.930 
okay as far as the downloader goes it
goes<00:05:05.520> here<00:05:06.960> down<00:05:07.960> through<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:08.440> holes<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:09.790> can

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
goes here down through the holes you can

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.180 
goes here down through the holes you can
see<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.330> hopefully<00:05:13.560> this<00:05:14.560> piece<00:05:14.770> of<00:05:14.950> foam

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
see that hopefully this piece of foam

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.490 
see that hopefully this piece of foam
sits<00:05:15.730> here<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:18.420> because<00:05:19.420> this<00:05:19.720> end<00:05:20.020> lifts

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
sits here and because this end lifts

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.540 
sits here and because this end lifts
because<00:05:20.830> it's<00:05:21.130> down<00:05:21.370> with<00:05:21.520> your<00:05:21.670> ball<00:05:21.850> I<00:05:22.180> put

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
because it's down with your ball I put

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.980 
because it's down with your ball I put
this<00:05:24.550> slot<00:05:25.000> at<00:05:25.300> this<00:05:25.510> end<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:27.040> can<00:05:27.220> see<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.610> I

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
this slot at this end you can see it I

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.920 
this slot at this end you can see it I
can't<00:05:28.990> see<00:05:29.170> where<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.410> camera<00:05:29.800> is<00:05:29.830> aiming<00:05:30.310> and

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
can't see where the camera is aiming and

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.950 
can't see where the camera is aiming and
then<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:32.170> put<00:05:32.440> this<00:05:32.620> velcro<00:05:32.980> over<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.960> that

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
then I put this velcro over it that

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.380 
then I put this velcro over it that
keeps<00:05:35.200> this<00:05:35.440> end<00:05:35.680> from<00:05:35.860> lifting<00:05:38.460> and<00:05:39.460> as<00:05:40.120> far

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
keeps this end from lifting and as far

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.620 
keeps this end from lifting and as far
as<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.720> seat<00:05:41.050> goes<00:05:41.380> that's

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.110 

there<00:05:47.630> we<00:05:47.750> go

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
there we go

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.680 
there we go
okay<00:05:50.120> everything<00:05:50.510> should<00:05:50.720> work<00:05:52.240> I'm<00:05:53.240> going<00:05:53.570> to

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
okay everything should work I'm going to

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.160 
okay everything should work I'm going to
step<00:05:54.230> in<00:05:54.470> and<00:05:54.860> this<00:05:55.100> is<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.310> trial<00:05:55.730> run<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:57.340> see

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
step in and this is the trial run to see

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.020 
step in and this is the trial run to see
if<00:06:00.170> the<00:06:00.380> system<00:06:00.770> works<00:06:01.040> so<00:06:01.280> I<00:06:01.310> can<00:06:01.550> go<00:06:01.640> salmon

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
if the system works so I can go salmon
