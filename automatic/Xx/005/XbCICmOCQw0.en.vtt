you can see there's no accelerator

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.890 
you can see there's no accelerator
accelerometer<00:02:32.250> built<00:02:32.489> into<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.940> Bridget<00:02:33.360> so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
accelerometer built into this Bridget so

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.660 
accelerometer built into this Bridget so
