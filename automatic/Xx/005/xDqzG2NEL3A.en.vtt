00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 And my name is Victor, I'm going to put one 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.120
 little of my story and for that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.400
 chose a slightly different way of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.640
 person even used that is the drama my life 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.150
 I was born on May 16, 1993 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.460
 here in Brazil, my mother speaks to me 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.650
 too expensive a cute baby 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.810
 kind of those ipavu transit when I leave 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.849
 on the street only occasionally catch those 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.310
 some family old and see my 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.200
 I was lucky when I was a baby and I 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.060
 have to transit only because not because 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.520
 it was beautiful but they got very ugly and 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.420
 very fat when he turns 35 years old. 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.220
 age someone the brother still profits when 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.260
 He was a kid, I traveled a lot for the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.239
 horizon and it was time for hell with 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.160
 my children are mother's 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.769
 he had a rock band actually 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.350
 their house was very kind mass is 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.149
 there and after seeing always stocking 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.160
 When I got back to Brasilia I was 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.449
 disturbing my parents and they give me a 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.760
 guitar 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.980
 Then one day they tired of hearing 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.850
 It could only have ended up giving me one of 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.100
 gift 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 I do not know if they thought I would 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.570
 stop disturbing and such a by chance 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.610
 of them and I was even more annoying than 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.320
 happens I could not play anything was 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.570
 knocking on the ropes like crazy 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.790
 condemned up and down and only 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.250
 made an unbearable noise with my 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.560
 but then I learned in 5th grade and played 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.390
 music the first of my life that she 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.909
 start warduni ivana 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.100
 I was super happy and I kept playing 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.320
 she the whole time I 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.909
 I think it's cool to talk about that too. 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.970
 Since I was little I got used to hearing 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.430
 nirvana metallica by jimmy and others 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.560
 several great trash target bands is the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.969
 of rock by the influence of my cousins 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.100
 there is beautiful horizon 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.840
 And then when I won that guitar I 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.719
 I thought learning to play would be 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.820
 Smoke only so that the bugre is in the 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.399
 fifth grade and played the lego time 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.130
 one had much advantage in 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.469
 true because the girls liked it 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.329
 more of the buritis that played ball and there 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.000
 I left the side of the guitar which leaves 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.619
 My father was very pissed and I went to try 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.509
 play soccer 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.149
 Then I joined the Futsal 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.039
 mackenzie and kanju grandson 8th grade 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.690
 It was just terrible because I never had 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.990
 played against either the teacher or the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.420
 my father 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.130
 Beautiful horizon too but there with the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.280
 the time passed I started playing 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.900
 I think for a little while I thought 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.370
 in being a football player I played in 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.290
 school selection 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.360
 only I realized that I was very 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.840
 more time on the bench drinking water than 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.030
 actually playing field and was 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.790
 So I decided to leave futsal to become a 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.440
 time away from the cuts only on the 7th 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.940
 I saw that the team had 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.610
 basketball and I thought it would be really cool 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.020
 If I came in and to my surprise and 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.850
 certainly to the surprise of the team 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.270
 was able to enter the 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.980
 time and so who would say that a boy 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.300
 than a meter and a half and I played 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.100
 bag basketball 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
 nobody would say like no one saw me 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.360
 and then what I did in training was 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.970
 able balls after everyone left the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.590
 court and if I had any hope is 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.410
 I wish I could have a 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.470
 Girl playing ball, it went by water. 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.360
 below 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.310
 So to comfort me I started to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.500
 think it was simply too good 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.180
 to play with other people and and by 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.640
 No one had ever given me space. 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.830
 in school teams and a while later 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.450
 All my friends were leaving a farm. 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.670
 to do high school and also 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.700
 decides to go out and do mine there at sea 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.860
 they are there I thought for being a place 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.930
 could start from scratch not only to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.210
 everybody was very fucking in sports 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.550
 to finally conquer the little girls 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.260
 Only when I got to show this, I 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.760
 was running after the judge who was playing 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.900
 guitar that used part of a band 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.490
 I was half 5 that I remembered that in case 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.590
 of a saved guitar 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.600
 only at that time also a game appears 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.130
 saved my life and it was fashionable 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.600
 who was the guitarist's tal 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.280
 I thought it would be much easier 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.290
 learn to play this game that was in the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.920
 game and try to get closer to the 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.310
 girls who were lighter 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.050
 against all odds and even 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.510
 get and get some 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.560
 girls because of the game and was the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.360
 that I thought I could make a 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.200
 for much greater damage if the 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.180
 play guitar 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 Only when I started playing the guitar 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.400
 My parents decided to get divorced because 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.350
 somehow helped a lot for the 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.269
 artists will show to the world and 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.090
 I ended up getting very close to the music and 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.830
 of art from there and it was legal 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.290
 how much more the car but I wanted 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.180
 to study because I was even in the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.700
 school after all meditating on it. 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.700
 holidays in december and tie pib da sacu 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.080
 Good and early 2009 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.660
 I won my first guitar and 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.520
 I joined my first band 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.500
 Then we played the music festival. 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.060
 I realized that the unita can do a lot 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.490
 more damage with a guitar 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.500
 already in the best years I've had in 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.210
 my life I want 3rd year of high school 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.560
 I was with all my best friends 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.840
 in the class 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.820
 only this time I decided to study - and 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.979
 I stayed there for a little longer 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.080
 early gay my father was happy and I 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.700
 I was happy because finally about 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.190
 How cool is it to take a vacation along with everything? 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.590
 world, not even when I started my 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.270
 authorial own band and I discovered something 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.620
 interesting even about me that was 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.240
 about graduation 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.490
 When I left the sea, I wanted to 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.830
 to train in music at college 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.050
 My father was against almost wanted to kill me. 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.280
 My mother was very much against and 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.229
 That mine was the real one with the 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.860
 the victim's stepfather and even convinced my 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.889
 mother my new guitar gift 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.020
 finally there I was with my band in 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.610
 It was a year and we were in the 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.129
 weekend and they did think for 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.379
 back of 15 concerts in Brasilia in two 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:39.479
 years we played together and got to the 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.550
 to record a CD for fun only when 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.789
 the staff went to college there is 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.770
 The band's scenario completely changed the 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.060
 drummer and bassist decided to move 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.520
 to rio de janeiro to do 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.009
 college and singer went to são paulo 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.449
 and I stayed here in Brazil even though 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.009
 I liked the advertising course and 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.719
 Catholic propaganda 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.479
 That's when I decided to drop all the 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:02.009
 bands to devote even both colleges 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.529
 that in the third semester of my course 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.960
 I got my first internship in the 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.969
 I'll do advertising attention and 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.060
 how I was losing a lot on the course 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.560
 since the internship there is deeply 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.409
 and was invited to become a director. 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.120
 area and vice president of the agency only 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.430
 that the head is in the vice presidency and 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.139
 to assume the deputy board but despite the 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.419
 number of vice chants of the way of being 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.699
 vascaíno that hunger and thirst when I am 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.449
 Little one so yes I really love it 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.569
 soccer 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.969
 finally I got one year there was a mother 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.469
 Sensational boy, that's it for work 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.419
 with convent attendance test 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:38.250
 I learned some interesting things or 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.870
 how to have a great customer with brasal 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.940
 and a second club 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.830
 only in a band for your job 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.509
 as the main detail in the 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.289
 to go after that old dream of being 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.870
 musician 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:50.520
 I spent a few months in the band rehearsing a 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.169
 little only he misses the routine 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.360
 to be an advertiser 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.819
 so I decided to go back to active on saba a 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.279
 advertising that when I got in touch 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.599
 advertising planning and was 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.599
 that's when I started thinking about the idea of 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.580
 change my area of ​​expertise 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:07.500
 then in a typical young half as boss 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.930
 until he let me plan for the 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.330
 customer and I really enjoyed the work and 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.430
 That's when I really decided 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.629
 to walk only as I talked to 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.220
 she did not give me the opportunity to 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:18.169
 work with the planner and it was when 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.789
 I decided to leave even with the point is something 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.789
 new like flemish 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.490
 I ended up doing some courses in 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:28.520
 planning and meeting, I talked to 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.169
 some people from the market and that's where 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520
 I was really sure it was with 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:34.430
 This is what I wanted to work for my 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.080
 life and today I'm reading studying and 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.240
 by designing an entry in the 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.629
 I work, right. 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.189
 and the story of my life so far 

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:45.169
 I know I have much more to write and 

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:46.520
 say about me but I think the video of 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.050
 A few minutes will not say exactly 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.699
 all that I am 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.680
 so if you want to know more about 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:54.050
 I can continue reading the more text 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.729
 blog access to social networks and stay 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.909
 feel free to meet me but it's a 

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:57.909
 pleasure
