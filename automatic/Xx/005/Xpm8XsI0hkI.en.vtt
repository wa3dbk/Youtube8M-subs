00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello everyone today I'm going to record about 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.450
 videos about the fashionable deck 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.670
 lately that is the white mira calls 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.929
 of the red sunset so white challenge 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.789
 miracle contract and good the deck many 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.249
 you will know others maybe I have seen it 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.199
 for the first time it is a very very 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.449
 very control was with counter balance 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.159
 four volumes with der bands with infinities 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.550
 counter if it goes to four fouls two points 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.889
 for the e3 themselves and then then the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.370
 Typical 20 snack snacks until is that 

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:35.840
 always go well 4 shorts naturally 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.060
 some cracks like that a bit to the bulge 220 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.340
 lions 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.670
 the miracles that are three terms like 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.500
 you know the new era quite everything by 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.780
 one bad all the bugs in quotes 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.630
 and one day there are people who say that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.800
 bring two instead of the tickets 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.800
 well I have put one 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.730
 and good and changing the truth is that the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.620
 deck copied it so as you see 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.050
 that there are things that I like air 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.460
 changing etcetera good as you see the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.280
 techno has a lot explained in 5 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.260
 seconds is about controlling the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.570
 heading to close it with the counter balance 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.240
 and kill with the 695 presents twice 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.520
 more with 61 4% of the rest plus the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.200
 Angels accounts and 1% more than you are 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.080
 killing hit all the cards and 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.870
 williams the truth is that with the term 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.550
 yes all obviously then the snack astaire 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.430
 serves to block or little else 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.530
 week 22 lands the typical one 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.230
 control deck are a bit surprising 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.790
 thanks, good, I'll tell you 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.320
 showing do not usually come into play 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.310
 the first turn is very rare 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.860
 it's a hand like that 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.270
 and they are good for the subject of resistance 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 to the shock the truth is that as an idea 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.320
 I do not like it either because 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.100
 because this deck that could have a 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.200
 shuffle a mana base like a rock 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.240
 could take away the volcanics and get 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.729
 others you will have to give to caracas 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.880
 social all everything and put only plains 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.880
 Y 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.950
 and I would have a mana base 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.960
 indestructible now instead has it 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.040
 quite fragile because the truth because 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.660
 them with only three basic 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.630
 It is true that you have eight dates to 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.550
 look for them but 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:23.510
 1 2222 fall in x 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.750
 per game but the insurance is good 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.640
 I threw splice because they have recommended me 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.140
 is testing we'll see at the end and the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.680
 site because as I told them the plages 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.030
 networks that goes very well I've put the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.140
 cages seem to me very cars in this the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.850
 xxi it's true that you play in the caste 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.420
 I hope you control spering if you want the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.030
 cages that is see right and re 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.740
 food is basically just gives you na 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.530
 caster what it is to create a cage and 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.360
 winning against Derek took all the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 cons you are wearing that are 3 spears all 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.560
 this against all this with strong suit 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.760
 this 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.349
 it is very difficult that it is being removed 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.520
 over animator good have the gloves 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.310
 and they also carry cons but 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.580
 is still tot the mon so the cage 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.380
 it does not matter to me to spend 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.850
 and then what else do we have here we have 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.350
 fret around to the best is too much 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.620
 Nazi against how this site really 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.090
 I'm going to remove the 33 lathes because you're going 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.280
 conservancy the 500 counter on the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.970
 networks and on top of this you do not know to 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.030
 the best is a little nazi 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.270
 another 20 meters that it contracts very tongue 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.720
 well 2 also ferments that I do not either 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.110
 they just convinced because against burn 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.930
 it is a ride in played against abundant 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.150
 it is a walk and cons 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.769
 I do not know against sun Marc counterattacks 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.280
 more than what you laugh against green white 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.170
 I would put it against show it does not look almost like that 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.459
 that the best ones that I have 26 in char me 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.640
 they seem pretty basic against 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.590
 shocks and many more things that out there and 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.450
 the pass east that originally allies 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.700
 but what do I do by removing one and again 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.129
 put it back 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.840
 the truth is that the site is not just 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.160
 get the best put another shinchan 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.170
 you another peace for the others to have in 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.629
 football from before we will see also me 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.640
 like to put a guest but we generate 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.120
 They are very expensive and at the moment I do not have the 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.120
 budget 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.660
 so nothing we are going to record games
