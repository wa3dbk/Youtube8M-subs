00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.779
 it is certain that the clear saint that symbolizes 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.109
 love respect 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.769
 admiration 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.249
 the affection that you vascaíno fan 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.330
 Hello guys 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.070
 how to help the Basque will enter the story in a unique way the classic 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.849
 it's our second skin 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.449
 we will honor the warrior spirit of this team that the Basque supporter 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.490
 can show its strength its greatness 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.550
 is acting like cachaça with which he discussed the subway 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.540
 topuz the new Basque shirt became known as it was adopted by the organ 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150
 on contracts 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.120
 then it became a symbol of the order of Christ 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.540
 which directly financed Portuguese maritime expansion 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.080
 so all the caravelas Portuguese explorer I even think that each one 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.180
 were identified with the tax authorities 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 this cross on the first very low disc is being redeemed with the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.140
 new third club shirt 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.030
 bringing back the warrior spirit the courage and nobility of the great 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.680
 browsers 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.040
 The story of the cross she is beautiful claimed that she had with 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.680
 Brazil, then, we also think that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 was to value this in a way 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300
 It's different from having a shirt 3 d 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.460
 so you Basque 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.700
 I'm calling 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.860
 Why together? 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.920
 Can you do this tattoo? 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.020
 will symbolize on par than ever the union of the holy Basque family 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.960
 February of another reminder came back to call the serving period is a shirt and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.780
 balls and the secult or chaunac clothes shirt 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.030
 yet Basque 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.950
 the team is not 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.790
 wearing that shirt 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.980
 but recorded 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.370
 in your thesis 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.370
 I'm counting on you 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.720
 mineral 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.740
 now 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.750
 so far 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.750
 I need 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.529
 goal 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.879
