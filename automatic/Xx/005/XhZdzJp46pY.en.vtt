00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.019
 questions namely how to make a video 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.170
 master video program and more complex 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.449
 sony vegas takes a little time 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.779
 program video master find and download 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.750
 the trial version will not make for you 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 labor just hammer in the search add 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.430

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.540
 we have here here 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.110
 now we will make them black so take 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.280
 go to the effects and select the effect here 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.820

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 here it will not be displayed let 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.230
 make our file 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.890
 shorter for speeding up work even though he 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.890
 so do a little but so here 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.970
 click save cropping pay 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.310
 note that this will be applied when 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.200
 conversion that is now we have it 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.420
 trimmed but here too will 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.470
 play initial long 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.439
 clip for converting ie conclusions 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.950
 files up to our black and white we press 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.950
 convert 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.810
 video is processed and it is reported that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 you can open the folder and see our 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 new black and white video but here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.790
 actually all hope you with this 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 can handle 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:59.780
 let's move on to another program 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.270
 namely the vegas scene here we chose 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:09.320
 another footage let's do it all 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.320
 first open the program 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:17.170
 choose a video that will and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.490
 handle before with whom it is in this window 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:25.880
 either just dragging it on 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:29.540
 timeline so all we got 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.260
 go to the fix video tab here 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.980
 the second effect is about black 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.110
 and white 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.680
 that is, the effect that makes the video 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.770
 here in black and white it is possible to make 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.610
 its one hundred percent black and white and 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.760
 various percents can take 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.980
 effects drag on your video 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.070
 so we got completely black and white 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.070
 video 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:04.970
 with this slider we can adjust 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:11.360
 the degree and strength of the effect after that to us 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:14.320
 it only remains to convert the video to 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.530
 we need the format you can select the desired 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:24.200
 slice 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:28.550
 Click the bell file with and select that format. 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.570
 which we will display by default 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.040
 icon and 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.710
 equally the program offers a certain 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:44.330
 but where the format can be displayed can be 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:51.970
 choose xdk yes you can 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.970
 select windows media video 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.910
 but we select 5 3 megabits per second 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.270
 see what happens in quality 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.910
 empty will it suit you or not 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.450
 just how to choose the right format 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.549
 click render 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:18.690
 and there is a miscalculation of your video 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:21.209
 I hope you understand, I work in sony 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.520
