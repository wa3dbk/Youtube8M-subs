is where the back door leads to if you
use<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> back<00:00:31.080> door<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.460> could<00:00:32.610> have

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
use the back door so we could have

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.459 
use the back door so we could have
completely<00:00:33.300> skipped<00:00:33.719> through<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.290> but

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
completely skipped through all that but

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.420 
completely skipped through all that but
I<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.530> wanted<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> show<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.070> guys<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I just wanted to show you guys the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
I just wanted to show you guys the
castle<00:00:35.880> ok<00:00:36.180> I'll<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> camera<00:00:37.230> looks

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
castle ok I'll see how the camera looks

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.760 
castle ok I'll see how the camera looks
with<00:00:37.800> light<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:39.739> without<00:00:40.739> light<00:00:42.230> uh<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.559> think

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
with light and without light uh I think

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700 
with light and without light uh I think
it<00:00:44.010> seems<00:00:44.399> better<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.050> without<00:00:46.050> without

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it seems better with without without

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.510 
it seems better with without without
light<00:00:47.010> honestly<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:49.190> just<00:00:50.190> beat

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520

the<00:02:21.250> back<00:02:21.400> door<00:02:22.080> all<00:02:23.080> right<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.410> gonna<00:02:23.709> be

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
the back door all right this is gonna be

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.310 
the back door all right this is gonna be
a<00:02:23.980> lot<00:02:24.220> shorter<00:02:24.280> than<00:02:24.820> i<00:02:24.910> thought<00:02:25.180> they<00:02:25.480> are

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
a lot shorter than i thought they are

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.360 
a lot shorter than i thought they are
she<00:02:26.500> say<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.680> thought<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.459> jump<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:29.019> ok<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
she say you thought and jump in ok the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.610 
she say you thought and jump in ok the
slowdown<00:02:31.120> screwed<00:02:31.600> me<00:02:31.840> up<00:02:31.870> did<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.380> see<00:02:32.590> that

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
slowdown screwed me up did you see that

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.930 
slowdown screwed me up did you see that
ok<00:02:34.170> we<00:02:35.170> try<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.620> again<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:37.269> to<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.230> castle

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
ok we try that again and to the castle

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.610 
ok we try that again and to the castle
into<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.090> sheer<00:02:40.390> darkness<00:02:40.959> it's<00:02:41.290> actually

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
into the sheer darkness it's actually

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.140 
into the sheer darkness it's actually
not<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:41.769> dark<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.489> do<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.640> completely

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
not that dark you can do a completely

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.780 
not that dark you can do a completely
without<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.600> light<00:02:43.870> but<00:02:44.200> i<00:02:44.519> think<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.610> light

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
without this light but i think the light

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.730 
without this light but i think the light
might<00:02:46.209> just<00:02:46.480> be<00:02:46.660> more<00:02:47.170> helpful<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.769> me

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
might just be more helpful to me

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.690 
might just be more helpful to me
because<00:02:50.740> those<00:02:50.920> ninjas<00:02:51.460> are<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> pretty<00:02:52.000> dark

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
because those ninjas are a pretty dark

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.420 
because those ninjas are a pretty dark
and<00:02:55.740> hopefully<00:02:56.740> you'll<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:56.920> able<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.250> see

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
and hopefully you'll be able to see

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.990 
and hopefully you'll be able to see
things<00:02:57.580> better<00:02:57.880> with<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.210> light<00:02:58.390> on<00:02:58.420> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
things better with the light on and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.400 
things better with the light on and
careful<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:01.870> we've<00:03:02.200> made<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.120> wait

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
careful I think we've made it wait

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.880 
careful I think we've made it wait
midpoints<00:03:05.520> but<00:03:06.520> why<00:03:06.880> didn't<00:03:07.090> i<00:03:07.260> huh<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.560> should

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
midpoints but why didn't i huh I should

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.280 
midpoints but why didn't i huh I should
have<00:03:08.950> started<00:03:09.190> there<00:03:09.430> before<00:03:10.020> or<00:03:11.020> maybe<00:03:11.140> I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
have started there before or maybe I

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.290 
have started there before or maybe I
start<00:03:12.070> at<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.250> beginning<00:03:12.370> or<00:03:12.670> something<00:03:13.090> well

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
start at the beginning or something well

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.360 
start at the beginning or something well
whatever<00:03:13.540> was<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.440> midpoint<00:03:14.680> there<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
whatever was that midpoint there the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.070 
whatever was that midpoint there the
first<00:03:15.610> time<00:03:15.790> I'm<00:03:16.210> gonna<00:03:16.330> have<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.600> check<00:03:16.840> that

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
first time I'm gonna have to check that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.170 
first time I'm gonna have to check that
it's<00:03:17.560> already<00:03:17.710> pretty<00:03:17.950> silly<00:03:18.310> if<00:03:18.490> it<00:03:18.640> wasn't<00:03:19.000> I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
it's already pretty silly if it wasn't I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's already pretty silly if it wasn't I
don't<00:03:19.930> know<00:03:20.020> how<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.200> could've<00:03:20.470> possibly

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
don't know how I could've possibly

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.710 
don't know how I could've possibly
missed<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.430> if<00:03:21.580> it<00:03:21.730> was<00:03:21.850> there<00:03:22.120> maybe<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.570> was

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
missed it if it was there maybe I was

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.510 
missed it if it was there maybe I was
just<00:03:22.750> talking<00:03:23.740> and<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.160> know<00:03:24.220> how<00:03:24.490> that

third<00:05:12.230> phase<00:05:12.530> coming<00:05:13.010> up<00:05:13.130> which<00:05:13.370> is<00:05:13.550> arguably

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
third phase coming up which is arguably

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.540 
third phase coming up which is arguably
the<00:05:14.270> hardest<00:05:14.660> phase<00:05:14.870> of<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:15.230> three<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.770> think

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
the hardest phase of the three I think

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.050 
the hardest phase of the three I think
honestly<00:05:17.240> number<00:05:17.690> two<00:05:17.930> is<00:05:18.110> harder<00:05:18.530> because

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
honestly number two is harder because

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.580 
honestly number two is harder because
you<00:05:20.060> have<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.300> kind<00:05:20.420> of<00:05:20.540> lead<00:05:20.840> him<00:05:21.050> in<00:05:21.110> number

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
you have to kind of lead him in number

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.070 
you have to kind of lead him in number
two<00:05:22.300> but<00:05:23.300> in<00:05:23.840> number<00:05:24.230> three<00:05:24.910> yeah<00:05:25.910> we<00:05:26.450> are<00:05:26.660> safe

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
two but in number three yeah we are safe

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.060 
two but in number three yeah we are safe
