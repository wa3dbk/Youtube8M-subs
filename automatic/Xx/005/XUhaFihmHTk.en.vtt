00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 marshmallows on this classic from 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.519
 pastry has its origins 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.650
 in ancient Egypt he invented ronnie 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.570
 marshmallows adding honey to the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.540
 sap of the root of the plant of the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.060
 mauve modern marshmallows contain 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.689
 jelly instead of sap extracted from 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.820
 mauve roots if you have a sweet tooth 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.769
 quality control of apple goods 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.470
 it would be your ideal job 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.820
 just a quick first to make sure 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.700
 that the coating is enough 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.590
 often it's hard and then someone's taste 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 he must do it to make the dough for the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.030
 sweets base mix together 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.640
 wheat flour baking soda salt 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.329
 sodium yeast wheat starch in milk 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.289
 powder and potassium sorbate 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.719
 subsequently they are added 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.000
 numerous liquid ingredients it causes 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.020
 a chemical reaction making the dessert 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.120
 lighter 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.600
 this cream-colored liquid is free of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.640
 vegetable oils 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.580
 this transparent liquid and glucose 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.159
 fructose a sweetener the proportions 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.159
 of the ingredients that remain secret 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.950
 from the mixer the dough passes to one 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.990
 machine called chopper that 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.060
 cut the dough into small parts of the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.920
 size of a stopper 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.869
 this makes the pasta more manageable 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.789
 facilitating the work of the next 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.789
 rotator mold machine 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.730
 inside this car a big one 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.530
 roller flattens the dough 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.350
 turning it into a puff of the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.330
 about half a centimeter thick e 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.280
 subsequently this sheet passes 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.480
 under another roller with shapes 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.160
 preformed the industry uses the 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.130
 rotary mold for different types of 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.020
 cookies simply by installing the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.740
 roll equivalent to the biscuit in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.740
 production 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.680
 for the bases of the marshmallows the cavities 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.680
 of the mold only round 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.830
 to the rotating mold the bases e 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.850
 reach a mobile tray that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.850
 inserts into an oven 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.830
 cooking time and temperature 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.830
 I am once again secret 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 cooked masi of cakes come out of the oven 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.019
 and reach a conveyor belt 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.500
 that transfers them to an area of 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.500
 cooling down 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.650
 after reaching the temperature 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.620
 environment the bases are introduced 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.139
 within a car they come here 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.730
 lined up to receive the filling and the 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:50.410
 chocolate coating 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.470
 the process requires precision 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.570
 military technicians of the industry must 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.130
 adjust this machine daily 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.040
 to ensure accuracy 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.170
 millimeter a portion of filling 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.150
 must be placed perfectly in the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.940
 center of each base and ending with a 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.940
 curl the industry brand 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.040
 the company is not willing to disclose the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.810
 marshmallow filling amount 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.720
 introduced in every biscuit and even less 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.240
 reveal the marshmallow recipe 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.700
 but generally this consists of 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.700
 sugar syrup and gelatin 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.959
 and now for the final layer the cover 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.360
 of chocolate the melted chocolate covers 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.700
 the marshmallows and bases float in the 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.329
 chocolate that even penetrates into the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.329
 bottom 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.030
 chocolate in not cookies e 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.420
 it is made to harden inside one 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.220
 cooling tunnel 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.980
 the duration of the process and the temperature 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.569
 as you can imagine only one top 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.220
 secret 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.930
 as soon as the cookies come out of the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.940
 gallery a control officer of 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.790
 quality ensures that the crust of 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.790
 chocolate is thick and hard homogeneous 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.140
 in the packaging chain the desserts 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.760
 they are placed in plastic trays 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.610
 to speed up the process the workers 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.370
 they must grab 4 sweets in each hand 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.990
 without breaking and covering the trays 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.360
 they go through a car that is there 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.160
 wraps in a plastic film that 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.210
 keeps them fragrant and prevents it 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.210
 leaking from the tray 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.170
 meanwhile another machine seems to be 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.920
 boxes explaining them by gluing them and 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.920
 closing the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.180
 after the workers load the trays la 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.890
 machine closes the last open side 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.840
 stop boxes after passing 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.790
 quality control is the shelf 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.790
 confectionery from your supermarket
