carbon<00:00:17.650> this<00:00:18.070> is<00:00:18.130> a<00:00:18.310> refresh<00:00:18.760> of<00:00:18.939> the<00:00:19.119> carbon

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
carbon this is a refresh of the carbon

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.960 
carbon this is a refresh of the carbon
ultrabook<00:00:20.650> and<00:00:20.830> as<00:00:21.040> you<00:00:21.220> can<00:00:21.430> see<00:00:21.670> it's

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
ultrabook and as you can see it's

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.580 
ultrabook and as you can see it's
definitely<00:00:22.240> had<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.599> redesign<00:00:23.110> its<00:00:23.260> not<00:00:23.410> just

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
definitely had a redesign its not just

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.350 
definitely had a redesign its not just
that<00:00:23.740> there's<00:00:23.920> Intel<00:00:24.279> Haswell<00:00:24.520> inside<00:00:25.119> which

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
that there's Intel Haswell inside which

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.650 
that there's Intel Haswell inside which
by<00:00:25.540> the<00:00:25.599> way<00:00:25.779> there<00:00:25.989> is<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:27.220> design<00:00:27.610> it's<00:00:28.239> it's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
by the way there is the design it's it's

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.479 
by the way there is the design it's it's
reminiscent<00:00:29.529> certainly<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.980> last<00:00:30.189> gen

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
reminiscent certainly of the last gen

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.790 
reminiscent certainly of the last gen
carbon<00:00:30.939> but<00:00:31.119> it's<00:00:31.300> gotten<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.960> lot<00:00:32.200> slimmer<00:00:32.619> and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
carbon but it's gotten a lot slimmer and

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.979 
carbon but it's gotten a lot slimmer and
now<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:32.980> weights<00:00:33.280> down<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.670> 2.8<00:00:34.270> pounds<00:00:34.600> still

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
like as we take a look at the side you

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.800 
like as we take a look at the side you
can<00:01:00.460> see<00:01:00.490> we<00:01:00.730> have<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.030> one<00:01:01.240> link<00:01:01.510> cord

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
can see we have the one link cord

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.210 
can see we have the one link cord
connector<00:01:02.230> and<00:01:02.350> this<00:01:02.440> works<00:01:02.650> with<00:01:02.800> a<00:01:02.829> new<00:01:03.040> one

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
connector and this works with a new one

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.730 
connector and this works with a new one
link<00:01:03.490> Pro<00:01:03.820> dock<00:01:04.150> so<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.600> get<00:01:04.900> two<00:01:05.470> video

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
link Pro dock so you get two video

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.740 
link Pro dock so you get two video
outputs<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.700> new<00:01:06.880> dock<00:01:07.180> which<00:01:07.540> is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
outputs on that new dock which is

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.830 
outputs on that new dock which is
showing<00:01:08.020> us<00:01:08.229> right<00:01:08.590> over<00:01:08.920> here<00:01:09.479> four<00:01:10.479> USB

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
showing us right over here four USB

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.190 
showing us right over here four USB
ports<00:01:11.110> USB<00:01:11.860> 3.0<00:01:12.609> at<00:01:12.789> that<00:01:12.969> too<00:01:13.359> so<00:01:13.780> that's<00:01:13.990> kind

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
ports USB 3.0 at that too so that's kind

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.889 
ports USB 3.0 at that too so that's kind
of<00:01:14.229> nice<00:01:14.469> you<00:01:15.159> also<00:01:15.310> get<00:01:15.689> DisplayPort<00:01:16.689> and

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
of nice you also get DisplayPort and

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
look at the other side you see we have

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.849 
look at the other side you see we have
another<00:02:00.729> USB<00:02:01.170> 3.0<00:02:02.170> port<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:02.590> that's<00:02:02.649> a

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
another USB 3.0 port and that's a

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.980

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
proprietary Ethernet jack right there so

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.480 
proprietary Ethernet jack right there so
you<00:02:05.049> have<00:02:05.079> to<00:02:05.200> use<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.409> USB<00:02:05.619> port<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
you have to use a USB port and the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.400 
you have to use a USB port and the

dongle adapter is included and then we

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.949

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
you can see you can customize those

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.780 
you can see you can customize those
somewhat<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.770> can't<00:03:11.980> roll<00:03:12.190> your<00:03:12.400> own<00:03:12.430> for

somewhat but you can't roll your own for
a<00:03:12.820> different<00:03:13.209> application<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.290> touch

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
a different application and that touch

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.120 
a different application and that touch
strip<00:03:15.880> up<00:03:16.060> top<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.660> basically<00:03:17.410> that's<00:03:17.650> eating

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130

carbon well its touch by the way but
they<00:03:47.140> don't<00:03:47.290> use<00:03:47.440> touch<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.980> name<00:03:48.130> anymore

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.050 

right<00:03:55.860> so<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.099> break<00:03:56.310> in<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:57.860> cheeseburgers

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
right so you break in the cheeseburgers

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.050 
right so you break in the cheeseburgers
so<00:04:00.060> here<00:04:00.269> we<00:04:00.360> have<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.629> old<00:04:00.900> x1<00:04:01.680> carbon<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.400> new

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
so here we have the old x1 carbon a new

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.760 
so here we have the old x1 carbon a new
excellent

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.830
