and<00:01:41.180> may<00:01:41.330> be<00:01:41.360> considered<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.080> be<00:01:42.200> tank<00:01:43.190> a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
and may be considered to be tank a

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.340 
and may be considered to be tank a
specialist<00:01:44.030> at<00:01:44.240> cars<00:01:44.480> and<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.810> would<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.080> more<00:01:45.320> I

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
specialist at cars and I would be more I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.680 
specialist at cars and I would be more I
think<00:01:45.560> they're<00:01:45.860> moving<00:01:46.460> out<00:01:46.550> up<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.210> notch<00:01:47.420> into

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
think they're moving out up a notch into

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.150 
think they're moving out up a notch into
sort<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.020> luxury<00:01:48.440> cars<00:01:48.710> where<00:01:48.920> they<00:01:48.980> can

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
sort of luxury cars where they can

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.910 
sort of luxury cars where they can
compete<00:01:49.610> with<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.850> Porsche<00:01:50.660> or<00:01:50.750> Ferrari<00:01:50.920> into

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
compete with a Porsche or Ferrari into

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.980 
compete with a Porsche or Ferrari into
the<00:01:52.040> proper<00:01:52.340> car<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.390> what<00:01:53.540> do<00:01:53.630> you<00:01:53.690> think<00:01:53.900> of

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
the proper car so what do you think of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.450 
the proper car so what do you think of
the<00:01:54.110> major<00:01:54.320> differences<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:55.280> car

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
the major differences in this car

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.920 
the major differences in this car
obviously<00:01:56.030> there's<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.300> lot<00:01:56.330> more<00:01:56.540> power

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
obviously there's a lot more power

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.750 
obviously there's a lot more power
compared<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> street<00:01:57.770> guy<00:01:57.920> thing<00:01:58.100> like<00:01:58.220> 75

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
compared to the street guy thing like 75

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.550 
compared to the street guy thing like 75
or<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.090> extra<00:01:59.840> horsepower<00:02:00.110> what<00:02:00.350> are<00:02:00.470> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
or so extra horsepower what are the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.650 
or so extra horsepower what are the
differences<00:02:00.860> do<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.130> have<00:02:01.310> yes<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.360> mean<00:02:02.510> it's

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
differences do you have yes I mean it's

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.000 
differences do you have yes I mean it's
actually<00:02:02.810> probably<00:02:03.140> about<00:02:03.410> 100<00:02:03.770> horsepower

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
actually probably about 100 horsepower

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.000 
actually probably about 100 horsepower
more

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
more

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.320 
more
obviously<00:02:07.010> when<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.190> take<00:02:07.400> any<00:02:07.550> road<00:02:07.790> car<00:02:08.090> and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
obviously when you take any road car and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.030 
obviously when you take any road car and
turn<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.570> into<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.810> race<00:02:08.990> car<00:02:09.290> in<00:02:09.440> terms<00:02:09.680> of<00:02:09.830> your

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
turn it into a race car in terms of your

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.680 
turn it into a race car in terms of your
prepping<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.520> suspension<00:02:11.090> making<00:02:11.450> sure<00:02:11.570> the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
prepping the suspension making sure the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.750 
prepping the suspension making sure the
rubber<00:02:12.320> pushes<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.890> suspension<00:02:13.460> making

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
rubber pushes in the suspension making

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760 
rubber pushes in the suspension making
everything<00:02:14.000> solid<00:02:14.330> getting<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.230> as<00:02:15.320> stiff<00:02:15.620> as

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
everything solid getting it as stiff as

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.720 
everything solid getting it as stiff as
you<00:02:15.920> can<00:02:16.130> stiffen<00:02:16.910> English<00:02:17.300> a/c<00:02:17.780> Michelle

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.820 

very<00:02:22.730> good<00:02:22.970> basis<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:23.990> order<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.319> start<00:02:24.590> with

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
very good basis in order to start with

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.860 
very good basis in order to start with
so<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.760> means<00:02:26.000> obviously<00:02:26.360> going<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.630> be

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
so that means obviously going to be

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.330 
so that means obviously going to be
straight<00:02:27.110> away<00:02:27.410> very<00:02:27.590> very<00:02:27.800> good<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.160> DS

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
straight away very very good with the DS

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.900 
straight away very very good with the DS

means<00:02:47.170> all<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.470> i'll<00:02:47.590> be<00:02:47.710> doing<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.980> little

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
means all that i'll be doing a little

means all that i'll be doing a little
bit<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> egg<00:02:48.550> sauce<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:48.940> I'm<00:02:49.060> very<00:02:49.090> excited

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
bit in the egg sauce so I'm very excited

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.800 
bit in the egg sauce so I'm very excited
about<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.370> car<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.610> about<00:02:51.700> four<00:02:52.690> or<00:02:52.720> five

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
about that car for about four or five

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.050 
about that car for about four or five
years<00:02:53.140> six<00:02:53.500> years<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.280> it'd<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:54.790> nice<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
years six years now so it'd be nice to

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060 
years six years now so it'd be nice to
get<00:02:55.240> it<00:02:55.360> back<00:02:55.450> into<00:02:55.660> something<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.140> all

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
get it back into something that all

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.590 
get it back into something that all
intents<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.460> purposes<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.150> certainly<00:02:58.420> along

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
intents and purposes is certainly along

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.840 
intents and purposes is certainly along
the<00:02:58.720> lines<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.230> weight<00:02:59.560> to<00:03:00.130> power

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.280 

it'll<00:03:04.240> always<00:03:04.330> be<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.540> lot<00:03:04.690> closer<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
it'll always be a lot closer to the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.140 
it'll always be a lot closer to the
sillim<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.740> prototypes<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.520> what<00:03:07.060> I've

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
sillim on prototypes that I what I've

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.390 
sillim on prototypes that I what I've
been<00:03:07.210> used<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.510> driving<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.110> gt4<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.280> I'm

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
been used to driving the gt4 is so I'm

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.470 
been used to driving the gt4 is so I'm
really<00:03:09.610> looking<00:03:09.850> forward<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.210> should<00:03:10.420> be

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
really looking forward to that should be

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.000 
really looking forward to that should be
a<00:03:10.600> lot<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.750> fun<00:03:10.840> in<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.200> car<00:03:11.380> just<00:03:11.710> looks

obviously<00:03:48.340> until<00:03:48.850> they<00:03:48.940> actually<00:03:49.000> drive<00:03:49.360> it

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390

themselves I guess they weren't really
really<00:03:51.670> actually<00:03:51.820> know<00:03:52.330> for<00:03:52.630> sure<00:03:52.810> but<00:03:53.050> I
