I think me and James are pretty much

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.119 
I think me and James are pretty much
undefeated<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.739> goes<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.099> show

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
undefeated and that just goes to show

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.190 
undefeated and that just goes to show
like<00:02:27.580> what<00:02:28.000> I'm<00:02:28.090> saying<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.540> true<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:28.989> if

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
instead of one and that's the other

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.259 
instead of one and that's the other
thing<00:02:54.010> about<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.519> game<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.000> like

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
separates it from the rest is because

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.349 
separates it from the rest is because
