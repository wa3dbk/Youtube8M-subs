00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.170
 it was fabio here we are 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.059
 experiments 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.190
 today on the ground yes today we talk about 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.349
 experimental archeology here we go to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.270
 see how they lit the fire already 500 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.369
 thousand years ago when the man lived 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.320
 erectus that as was the first who 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.809
 he began to master the use of fire 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 what we have something this is 

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:29.669
 I created this fluff here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 treating that mushroom in front of you 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.340
 you this smoke that is called formaz 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.640
 comentarios and is the so-called mushroom 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.770
 the fungus also comes out the system we are 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.130
 using the so-called system a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.230
 percussion after the piece now 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.910
 however the stones with this flint a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.900
 of the iron sulfide that the simple one 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 pyrite should stick to these 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.170
 photo fomenta you succeeded bait will start 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.360
 slowly to light up to form 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.790
 of the embers here now we live cannot 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.790
 because we have formed some dust 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.259
 cast and see how they are already formed 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.829
 there are sparks of smoke 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.399
 going up 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.020
 I see that from many places it seems to me here 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.810
 now let's try to feed 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.569
 this smoke and we isolate the part that is 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.340
 the fire then catches fire 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.990
 take this arms once it has 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 started to catch fire at 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.850
 take root and make a kind of nest with 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.819
 that dry grass that obviously here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.079
 exact is the same as we take this 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.380
 this is the one that makes more smoke though 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.859
 it should take root faster 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.069
 agree help we do a lot of 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.069
 embers 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.979
 do you still remember me 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.719
 the man of prehistory right in between 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.750
 the other the men of prehistory 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.189
 will be the protagonists of some 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.549
 documentaries that we will propose in 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.590
 next weeks in which we will then do a 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.020
 travel back in time we will try to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.940
 understand what happens when homo 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.769
 sapiens meet other species of humans 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.530
 I don't remember this mind a little 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.230
 now we are playing almost format species 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.670
 nest you are now this you have to put 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.620
 the inside and the way we put it here and then 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.489
 we have to start blowing days of i 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.410
 long regular at short intervals like 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.170
 in short, fireplace 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.940
 we rightly see potential one 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.620
 show as we put it inside 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.079
 now let's start and among other things these 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.220
 Experimental archeology experiments 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:47.030
 they are also made in neuchÃ¢tel at the museum 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.280
 the knowledge I know here is here 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.329
 we begin to see that besides being there 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.769
 also a lot of smoke and it starts to 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:03:00.019
 also see the fire 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:01.430
 we made our fire and this is it 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.190
 a technology that comes directly 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.380
 for more than hundreds of thousands of years 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.609
 ago and I have to thank a person who me 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.959
 he taught how to light the fire like 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.489
 the primitive men did that 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.400
 Signor Alfio Tommaselli 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.389
 experimental archaeologist I understood fabio 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.389
 thank you very much
