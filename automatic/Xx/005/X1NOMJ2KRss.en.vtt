00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.830
 this breed 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.000
 maximum number of rabbits 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.670
 which I had in one rabbit 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.790
 it was ten pieces well naturally we 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.420
 transplanted into another rabbit in order 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.280
 so well 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.620
 load to slow down so rabbit 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.020
 You can be already 4 years old 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.140
 half a month naturally before that 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.180
 you and weigh and see how much she 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.430
 weighs if she weighs more than four 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.980
 kilogram there four and a half four 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.790
 204 300 then it can be safely mated 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:47.200
 let four and a half months grow 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.810
 they very well gain weight very much 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.240
 well three and a half months can already 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.830
 hammer rabbits first when they 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.600
 they are born 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.120
 dark color then from ages 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.190
 a month and a half they begin to change their 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.290
 color ie dark color gradually 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.540
 gradually becoming so silvery 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.140
 by color 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.150
 I'll show you a rabbit with two 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.310
 half a month about how they change 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:21.760
 and here is one rabbit 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.340
 a cub of the rabbit that you 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.850
 showed you just see the head yet 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.850
 dark 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.660
 and here is the second rabbit 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:46.260
 so at the age of three and a half months 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.000
 you can clog colic and their soul without 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.090
 heads 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 it turns out about a kilo four hundred kilo 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.250
 five hundred kilo kilo 600 that is it is very 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.320
 such a normal weight is very good 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.070
 even the weight they are not every person can 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.290
 may have the opportunity to buy a rabbit in 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.090
 23 kilograms but naturally taste already 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:12.480
 the meat is not that skins sell well 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:16.050
 again they are used as separate 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:20.430
 products make of them that is especially 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:24.000
 not used as Viennese 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:31.200
 blue new zealand red and there 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.960
 chinchillas are there each other but so skin 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:37.050
 somewhere in the 20-30 hryvnia did not come out on it as 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.460
 dried pelt here it costs me 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:45.560
 being attacked did not sell on this all I 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.560
 I think that answered your question so far
