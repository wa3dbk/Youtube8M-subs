react with the lower part of the snuffle
I<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:44.380> go<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.890> center<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.789> snaffle<00:01:46.360> to

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
I can go to the center of the snaffle to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.380 
I can go to the center of the snaffle to
make<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.140> direct<00:01:47.770> train<00:01:48.189> or<00:01:48.549> direct<00:01:49.030> contact

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
make a direct train or direct contact

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.350 
make a direct train or direct contact
which<00:01:50.259> I<00:01:50.469> can<00:01:50.710> use<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:50.950> bring<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.909> head<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.149> the
