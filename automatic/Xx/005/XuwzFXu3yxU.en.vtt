out<00:00:58.739> strong<00:00:58.910> well<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.329> team<00:01:00.510> has

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
out strong well I think this team has

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.170 
out strong well I think this team has
found<00:01:01.859> their<00:01:02.719> level<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:04.190> commitment<00:01:05.190> I<00:01:05.640> think

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
found their level of commitment I think

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
found their level of commitment I think
we<00:01:06.300> were<00:01:06.420> committed<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.020> some<00:01:07.770> aspects<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we were committed in some aspects of the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
we were committed in some aspects of the
game<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:09.330> think<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.140> were<00:01:10.350> committed<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
game I think we were committed to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.980 
game I think we were committed to
practicing<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.299> certain<00:01:12.630> people<00:01:12.659> were

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
practicing you know certain people were

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.530 
practicing you know certain people were
but<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.590> feel<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.130> team<00:01:14.400> we've<00:01:15.030> made<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
but I feel like the team we've made that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.469 
but I feel like the team we've made that
turn<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> better<00:01:16.909> they<00:01:17.909> realized<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
two segments into packed in play so I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.050 
two segments into packed in play so I
think<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.560> team<00:01:43.770> again<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
think with this team again they have a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
think with this team again they have a
different<00:01:45.450> sense<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.750> urgency<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.799> are

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
different sense of urgency and they are

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
different sense of urgency and they are
really<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:47.610> stepping<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.299> their

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
really really stepping up their

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109 
really really stepping up their
defensive<00:01:49.110> pressure<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:50.549> taking

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
defensive pressure and really taking

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.429 
defensive pressure and really taking
notice<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> fact<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.990> we've<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
notice of the fact that we've got to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.889 
notice of the fact that we've got to
control<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> boards<00:01:53.180> we<00:01:54.180> even<00:01:54.689> brought<00:01:54.750> up

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
control the boards we even brought up

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.210 
control the boards we even brought up
dramatically<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> think<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.920> look<00:01:55.950> at

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
dramatically I think when you look at

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.980 
dramatically I think when you look at
the<00:01:56.399> our<00:01:57.299> first<00:01:57.570> years<00:01:58.130> with<00:01:59.130> Walker<00:01:59.369> and

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
the our first years with Walker and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.859 
the our first years with Walker and
Williams<00:02:00.990> those<00:02:01.890> two<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.130> better<00:02:02.430> than<00:02:03.000> when

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
Williams those two are better than when

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
Williams those two are better than when
they<00:02:03.990> started<00:02:04.189> when<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.280> add<00:02:05.399> jasmine<00:02:05.909> dixon

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
they started when you add jasmine dixon

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.109 
they started when you add jasmine dixon
to<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.439> roster<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.009> well<00:02:08.190> we're<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.850> much

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to the roster as well we're a much

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
to the roster as well we're a much
better<00:02:09.390> team<00:02:09.709> because<00:02:10.709> she<00:02:10.739> gives<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.190> scoring

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
better team because she gives a scoring

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.699 
better team because she gives a scoring
rebounding<00:02:11.879> toughness<00:02:12.840> defensive<00:02:13.530> pressure

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
rebounding toughness defensive pressure
