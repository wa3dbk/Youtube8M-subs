is that sharp gradient in snowfall
accumulation<00:01:00.420> expectations<00:01:01.230> meaning<00:01:01.649> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
accumulation expectations meaning that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
accumulation expectations meaning that
if<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.129> system<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.789> deviate<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> little

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
if this system is to deviate a little

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.260 
if this system is to deviate a little
bit<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> west<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> east<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.790> snowfall

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.850 
bit to the west or the east the snowfall
accumulations<00:01:06.990> could<00:01:07.229> change<00:01:07.500> quite<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.799> bit

accumulations could change quite a bit

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280
