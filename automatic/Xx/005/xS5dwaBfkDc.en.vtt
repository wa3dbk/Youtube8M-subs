00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.600 
although the teeth didn't look too bad
before<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.630> braces<00:05:18.020> they<00:05:18.590> are<00:05:18.740> moving<00:05:19.070> so

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
before the braces they are moving so

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.640 
before the braces they are moving so
it's<00:05:19.760> only<00:05:19.850> a<00:05:19.970> matter<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.300> time<00:05:20.540> before<00:05:20.650> the

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
it's only a matter of time before the

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.040 
it's only a matter of time before the
two<00:05:21.830> front<00:05:22.070> teeth<00:05:22.280> go<00:05:22.790> like<00:05:22.970> that's<00:05:23.210> so<00:05:23.810> right

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
two front teeth go like that's so right

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.050 
two front teeth go like that's so right
now<00:05:24.200> I'm<00:05:24.350> trying<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.740> stop<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.520> teeth<00:05:25.760> from

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
now I'm trying to stop the teeth from

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.580 
now I'm trying to stop the teeth from
moving<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.570> once<00:05:26.750> these<00:05:26.930> come<00:05:27.200> off<00:05:27.230> I'm<00:05:27.500> going

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
moving and once these come off I'm going

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.140 
moving and once these come off I'm going
to<00:05:27.650> have<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.800> bar<00:05:28.040> part<00:05:28.310> on<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.460> back<00:05:28.580> which

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
to have a bar part on the back which

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.300 
to have a bar part on the back which
should<00:05:29.360> stop<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.870> moving<00:05:30.110> once<00:05:30.530> and<00:05:30.740> for<00:05:30.920> all

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
should stop the moving once and for all

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.400 
should stop the moving once and for all
or<00:05:31.520> for<00:05:31.820> about<00:05:31.940> five<00:05:32.120> years<00:05:32.150> or<00:05:32.450> so<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.870> somehow

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
or for about five years or so I somehow

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.830 
or for about five years or so I somehow
managed<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:33.890> fix<00:05:34.250> my<00:05:34.490> bottom<00:05:34.910> set<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.270> teeth<00:05:35.510> in

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
managed to fix my bottom set of teeth in

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.620 
managed to fix my bottom set of teeth in
this<00:05:36.020> way<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:36.290> few<00:05:36.530> years<00:05:36.980> ago<00:05:37.130> I<00:05:37.490> have<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.120> bar<00:05:38.330> at

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
this way a few years ago I have a bar at

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.840 
this way a few years ago I have a bar at
the<00:05:38.810> bottom<00:05:39.140> yes<00:05:39.800> but<00:05:40.160> disgusting<00:05:40.610> seeing

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
the bottom yes but disgusting seeing

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.760 
the bottom yes but disgusting seeing
inside<00:05:41.090> my<00:05:41.150> mouth<00:05:41.330> but<00:05:41.600> yeah<00:05:41.780> that<00:05:42.140> holds<00:05:42.590> my

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
inside my mouth but yeah that holds my

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.190 
inside my mouth but yeah that holds my
teeth<00:05:43.010> together<00:05:43.340> in<00:05:43.850> their<00:05:44.030> shape<00:05:44.330> they<00:05:44.930> don't

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
teeth together in their shape they don't

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.330 
teeth together in their shape they don't
move<00:05:45.410> they've<00:05:45.770> been<00:05:45.890> like<00:05:46.010> this<00:05:46.130> for<00:05:46.280> about

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
move they've been like this for about

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.310 
move they've been like this for about
two<00:05:46.580> years<00:05:46.610> that's<00:05:47.540> what<00:05:47.750> I'm<00:05:47.840> hoping<00:05:47.990> to

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
two years that's what I'm hoping to

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.380 
two years that's what I'm hoping to
achieve<00:05:48.410> with<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.100> top<00:05:49.340> another<00:05:50.030> thing<00:05:50.270> is

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
achieve with the top another thing is

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.790 
achieve with the top another thing is
that<00:05:50.419> my<00:05:50.600> teeth<00:05:50.780> aren't<00:05:51.080> lined<00:05:51.380> up<00:05:51.590> properly

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
that my teeth aren't lined up properly

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.100 
that my teeth aren't lined up properly
so<00:05:52.250> I'm<00:05:52.550> bashing<00:05:52.880> my<00:05:53.180> teeth<00:05:53.419> together<00:05:53.720> so

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
so I'm bashing my teeth together so

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.960 
so I'm bashing my teeth together so
hopefully<00:05:54.260> this<00:05:54.740> should<00:05:54.950> move<00:05:55.250> them<00:05:55.550> so<00:05:55.790> that

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
hopefully this should move them so that

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.720 
hopefully this should move them so that
they<00:05:56.090> fit<00:05:56.419> with<00:05:57.140> the<00:05:57.230> bottom<00:05:57.530> sets<00:05:57.830> better<00:05:58.340> oh

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
they fit with the bottom sets better oh

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.090 
they fit with the bottom sets better oh
my<00:05:59.270> gosh<00:05:59.480> this<00:05:59.660> is<00:05:59.840> so<00:05:59.990> confusing<00:06:00.440> but<00:06:00.980> that's

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
my gosh this is so confusing but that's

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.520 
my gosh this is so confusing but that's
move<00:06:01.400> on<00:06:01.580> from<00:06:01.880> all<00:06:01.970> the<00:06:02.090> questions<00:06:02.540> I<00:06:02.900> didn't

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
move on from all the questions I didn't

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.050 
move on from all the questions I didn't
really<00:06:03.710> talk<00:06:03.860> about<00:06:03.919> my<00:06:04.190> braces<00:06:04.580> when<00:06:04.820> I<00:06:04.880> had

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
really talk about my braces when I had

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.760 
really talk about my braces when I had
them<00:06:05.210> before<00:06:05.330> because<00:06:05.690> they<00:06:06.500> sort<00:06:06.710> of

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
them before because they sort of

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.010 
them before because they sort of
coincided<00:06:07.310> when<00:06:07.640> I<00:06:07.669> first<00:06:07.970> started<00:06:08.360> really

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
coincided when I first started really

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.170 
coincided when I first started really
making<00:06:09.380> videos<00:06:09.710> so<00:06:10.460> I<00:06:10.490> was<00:06:10.700> talking<00:06:11.000> about

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
making videos so I was talking about

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.060 
making videos so I was talking about
subject<00:06:11.600> matters<00:06:11.840> as<00:06:11.990> opposed<00:06:12.260> to<00:06:12.350> my<00:06:12.500> teeth<00:06:12.740> I

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
subject matters as opposed to my teeth I

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.740 
subject matters as opposed to my teeth I
will<00:06:13.580> probably<00:06:13.760> end<00:06:13.910> up<00:06:14.150> doing<00:06:14.390> more<00:06:14.419> brace

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
will probably end up doing more brace

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.960 
will probably end up doing more brace
videos<00:06:15.169> in<00:06:15.500> the<00:06:15.650> future<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:16.280> hope<00:06:16.700> that<00:06:16.880> this

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
videos in the future I hope that this

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.610 
videos in the future I hope that this
wasn't<00:06:17.270> too<00:06:17.390> boring<00:06:17.570> and<00:06:17.930> that<00:06:18.200> this<00:06:18.350> has

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
wasn't too boring and that this has

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.770 
wasn't too boring and that this has
answered<00:06:19.010> your<00:06:19.160> questions<00:06:19.669> and<00:06:20.030> yeah<00:06:20.540> because
