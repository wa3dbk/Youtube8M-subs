00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.660
 what was the announced electronic or 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.120
 launched in 2014 that most called the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.480
 industry attention 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the midst of so many novelties it is difficult 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 list a few that have potential 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.820
 to revolutionize the market in the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.890
 years 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.890
 check the six indicated in the category 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 electronics of the year in 2014 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.590
 the calls and I do not give civilians was one of the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.050
 attractions of acs 2014 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.480
 they are TV sets that are capable 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.510
 to bend to your screen according to the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 conditions of the environment. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 first models still have prices 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.910
 prohibitive 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.219
 but do not stop being rather curious 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.010
 and differentiated 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.260
 the virtual reality theme has never been 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.109
 as much evidence now as 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 the leader of this revolution is the sunglasses hits 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.140
 which was acquired by facebook in 2014 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.260
 the final product is still in the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.439
 but it is practically impossible not to 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.970
 impressed with it certainly still 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.619
 Let's hear a lot about the novelty. 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.689
 innovation in the smartphone market is not 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.720
 an easy task and not always the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.619
 news brought in right on the galaxy 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.780
 note at 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.930
 samsung pioneered by including a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.360
 side screen for notifications 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.720
 the device that is practically unique in its 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.120
 category 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.120
 in the same way the Japanese sony also 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.610
 showed his weapons in this fight 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.890
 the difference is that the accessory of the company 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.620
 which is still a prototype was thought 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.720
 as a complement to playstation 4 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.760
 the project still has no date to arrive 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.010
 the shops 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.320
 talking in virtual reality 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.630
 samsung was fast and became one of the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.580
 first to put on the market a model 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.100
 of virtual glasses 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.500
 the vr guide works coupled to a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.990
 smartphone and is able to provide a 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.660
 experience similar to that of ift but 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.770
 price and the winner is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.200
 rift glasses 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.290
 much has been said about this accessory 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.530
 2014 and on the market value of the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.610
 of the company that reached 2 billion 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.470
 dollars 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.740
 but this is just a sample of the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.260
 potential behind the project. 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.030
 educational games and even new 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.910
 ways to buy products 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.269
 practically everything is possible with glasses 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.570
 rift the year 2015 can mark the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.150
 consolidation of the technology that 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.670
 more will have opportunities in the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.380
 several segments 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.450
 stay connected also in the other 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.610
 categories of the best of the year
