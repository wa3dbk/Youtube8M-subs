00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
hi this is Linus a performance bike and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.190 
hi this is Linus a performance bike and
we're<00:00:11.790> talking<00:00:12.000> about<00:00:12.240> how<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> clip<00:00:12.809> into

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
we're talking about how to clip into

we're talking about how to clip into
mountain<00:00:13.530> bike<00:00:13.679> pedals<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
mountain bike pedals you know the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.640 
mountain bike pedals you know the
decision<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.690> clipless<00:00:16.020> pedal<00:00:16.470> has<00:00:16.620> a

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
decision to go to a clipless pedal has a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.920 
decision to go to a clipless pedal has a
ton<00:00:17.040> of<00:00:17.070> benefits<00:00:17.610> especially<00:00:18.480> when<00:00:18.600> mountain

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
ton of benefits especially when mountain

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.990 
ton of benefits especially when mountain
biking<00:00:19.320> we're<00:00:19.560> being<00:00:20.190> connected<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> bike

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
biking we're being connected to the bike

biking we're being connected to the bike
gives<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.450> ton<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> control

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
gives you a ton of control

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.830 
gives you a ton of control
it<00:00:23.160> also<00:00:23.310> allows<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> dial<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.450> your<00:00:24.600> fit

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it also allows you to dial in your fit

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.940 
it also allows you to dial in your fit
because<00:00:25.020> your<00:00:25.200> feet<00:00:25.410> aren't<00:00:25.590> moving<00:00:25.740> around

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
because your feet aren't moving around

bike in a train or something like that

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.130 
bike in a train or something like that
where<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.400> can<00:00:44.550> hold<00:00:44.850> yourself<00:00:44.970> up<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.990> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
where you can hold yourself up just so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
where you can hold yourself up just so
that<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.380> can<00:00:46.530> practice<00:00:47.030> clipping<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that you can practice clipping in and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.760 
that you can practice clipping in and
out<00:00:48.450> every<00:00:48.690> pedal<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.410> little<00:00:49.650> bit

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
out every pedal is a little bit

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
out every pedal is a little bit
different<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.970> far<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.210> how<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.360> feels<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
different just as far as how it feels to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.800 
different just as far as how it feels to
clip<00:00:52.230> into<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:54.030> knowing<00:00:54.630> your

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
clip into so just you know knowing your

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.260 
clip into so just you know knowing your
gear<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> getting<00:00:56.040> used<00:00:56.310> to<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
gear and getting used to how you use it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.460 
gear and getting used to how you use it
is<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.020> thing<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:58.320> really

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
is going to be one thing that's really

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.990 
is going to be one thing that's really
important<00:00:59.040> once<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.700> get<00:00:59.820> out<00:00:59.850> into

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
important once you actually get out into

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
important once you actually get out into
the<00:01:00.270> real<00:01:00.450> world<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.050> some<00:01:01.260> trails<00:01:01.500> out

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the real world and on some trails out

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.939 
the real world and on some trails out
riding<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.460> starting<00:01:03.390> off<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.079> know<00:01:04.229> get

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
riding so starting off just you know get

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920 
riding so starting off just you know get
up<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.250> bike<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.630> steady

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
up on your bike and just you know steady

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.719 
up on your bike and just you know steady
yourself<00:01:07.080> against<00:01:07.590> something<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> practice

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
yourself against something and practice

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.360 
yourself against something and practice
practice<00:01:09.270> clipping<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.080> most<00:01:10.920> mountain<00:01:11.250> bike

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
practice clipping in most mountain bike

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.740 
practice clipping in most mountain bike
pedals<00:01:11.729> are<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.180> dual<00:01:12.420> sided

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
pedals are going to be dual sided

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.330 
pedals are going to be dual sided
meaning<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.350> tops<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> bottoms<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
meaning the tops and bottoms are the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.100 
meaning the tops and bottoms are the
same<00:01:14.550> so<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.420> makes<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.690> faster<00:01:15.870> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
same so it just makes it faster and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.550 
same so it just makes it faster and
easier<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.560> clip<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.030> most<00:01:18.030> SPD<00:01:18.659> style<00:01:19.080> cleats

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
easier to clip in most SPD style cleats

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
easier to clip in most SPD style cleats
as<00:01:20.159> well<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.490> Crankbrothers<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> few<00:01:21.479> other

manufacturers<00:01:22.350> work<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:22.950> much<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> same

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
manufacturers work pretty much the same

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.330 
manufacturers work pretty much the same
way<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.020> slide<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.770> foot<00:01:25.950> along

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.240 
cleat engage with the body of the pedal
and<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:31.890> downward<00:01:32.070> pressure

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and then just put some downward pressure

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
and then just put some downward pressure
and<00:01:32.670> you'll<00:01:32.760> hear<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> nice<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.540> know

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and you'll hear a nice you know

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.080 
and you'll hear a nice you know
typically<00:01:34.200> satisfying<00:01:34.860> click<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.790> lets<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
typically satisfying click that lets you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
typically satisfying click that lets you
know<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.240> you're<00:01:36.720> clipped<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.140> once<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
know that you're clipped in once you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.560 
know that you're clipped in once you
hear<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.250> know<00:01:38.310> give<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.820> tug<00:01:39.030> make

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570

it's ok if you need to pedal a little

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.410 
it's ok if you need to pedal a little
bit<00:03:11.400> before<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.700> clip<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.000> just<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.300> get

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
bit before you clip in just to get

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.880 
bit before you clip in just to get
through<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.630> once<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.200> do<00:03:13.319> have<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.680> other

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
once you do have that other foot in

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.400 
once you do have that other foot in
though<00:03:15.569> then<00:03:15.780> you're<00:03:15.870> going<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.110> ready<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
though then you're going to be ready to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.039 
though then you're going to be ready to
roll<00:03:16.590> when<00:03:17.400> you're<00:03:17.550> coming<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> stop<00:03:18.510> you

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
roll when you're coming to a stop you

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.199 
roll when you're coming to a stop you
typically<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.620> opposite<00:03:20.160> leg<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.970> going<00:03:21.150> to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
typically that opposite leg is going to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.870 
typically that opposite leg is going to
be<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.420> one<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.780> plant<00:03:22.380> with<00:03:22.880> meaning

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
be the one that you plant with meaning

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.039 
be the one that you plant with meaning
just<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.269> going<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> first<00:03:24.780> foot

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
just that's going to be the first foot

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.470 
just that's going to be the first foot
you<00:03:25.140> put<00:03:25.350> down<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:26.160> that's<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.940> one<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.299> want

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
you put down so that's the one you want

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.420 
you put down so that's the one you want
to<00:03:27.570> clip<00:03:27.810> out<00:03:27.959> first<00:03:28.380> as<00:03:28.620> you're<00:03:28.920> coming<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
to clip out first as you're coming to a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.130 
to clip out first as you're coming to a
stop<00:03:29.820> clip<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.450> out<00:03:30.570> before<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.900> need<00:03:31.079> to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
stop clip it out before you need to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.560 
stop clip it out before you need to
obviously<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.130> then<00:03:32.459> as<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.970> gently<00:03:33.180> apply

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
obviously and then as you gently apply

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.479 
obviously and then as you gently apply
the<00:03:33.600> brakes<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.110> come<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> stop

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
the brakes and come to a stop

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.490 
the brakes and come to a stop
you<00:03:35.760> put<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.090> foot<00:03:36.390> down<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:37.200> know<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.410> you

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
you put that foot down you know if you

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.140 
you put that foot down you know if you
need<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.799> clip<00:03:38.010> out<00:03:38.160> both<00:03:38.400> feet<00:03:38.670> just<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.000> feel

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
need to clip out both feet just to feel

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.370 
need to clip out both feet just to feel
a<00:03:39.180> little<00:03:39.450> bit<00:03:39.540> more<00:03:39.690> comfortable<00:03:40.049> that's

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
a little bit more comfortable that's

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.259 
a little bit more comfortable that's
okay<00:03:40.769> but<00:03:41.280> typically<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:41.850> because<00:03:42.150> you're

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
okay but typically just because you're

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.460 
okay but typically just because you're
putting<00:03:42.540> more<00:03:42.690> weight<00:03:42.900> on<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.140> foot<00:03:43.440> that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
putting more weight on the foot that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.319 
putting more weight on the foot that
stays<00:03:43.799> clipped<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:44.820> a<00:03:44.910> good<00:03:45.030> idea<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
stays clipped in it's a good idea to

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.640 
stays clipped in it's a good idea to
leave<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.660> clipped<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.410> can't

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
leave it clipped in so that it can't

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.229 
leave it clipped in so that it can't
slide<00:03:46.950> around<00:03:47.130> again<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.670> have<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> little<00:03:48.090> bit

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
slide around again you have a little bit

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.910 
slide around again you have a little bit
more<00:03:48.420> tread<00:03:48.780> than<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.350> might<00:03:49.500> with<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> road

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
more tread than you might with a road

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.530 
more tread than you might with a road
shoe<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:50.519> it's<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.700> good<00:03:50.850> idea<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.359> get

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
shoe but it's a good idea just to get

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.910 
shoe but it's a good idea just to get
used<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.810> clipping<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.260> one<00:03:52.410> foot<00:03:52.620> out<00:03:52.739> and

used to clipping that one foot out and

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.050 
used to clipping that one foot out and
landing<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.430> before<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.730> clip<00:03:53.940> your

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
landing with it before you clip your

it's<00:04:23.820> probably<00:04:24.389> worth<00:04:24.540> noting<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.230> know

it's probably worth noting that you know
as<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.770> get<00:04:26.070> used<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.370> doing<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:26.850> doing

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
as you get used to doing this and doing

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.310 
as you get used to doing this and doing
it<00:04:27.300> on<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.510> trail<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:28.050> going<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.230> be

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
it on the trail it's going to be

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.360 
it on the trail it's going to be
different<00:04:28.470> than<00:04:28.680> doing<00:04:28.920> it<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.040> your<00:04:29.160> kitchen

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
different than doing it in your kitchen

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.020 
different than doing it in your kitchen
so<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:31.200> know<00:04:31.370> just<00:04:32.370> about<00:04:32.520> everybody<00:04:32.970> that

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
so you know just about everybody that

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.490 
so you know just about everybody that
starts<00:04:33.450> off<00:04:33.570> writing<00:04:33.810> clipless<00:04:34.080> pedals<00:04:34.410> is

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
starts off writing clipless pedals is

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.990 
starts off writing clipless pedals is
going<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.680> fall<00:04:34.830> down<00:04:35.040> once<00:04:35.280> or<00:04:35.370> twice<00:04:35.580> it

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
going to fall down once or twice it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.940 
going to fall down once or twice it
happens<00:04:36.419> just<00:04:36.600> get<00:04:36.900> back<00:04:37.080> up<00:04:37.260> keep<00:04:37.500> writing

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
happens just get back up keep writing

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.550 
happens just get back up keep writing
but<00:04:38.760> once<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.120> do<00:04:39.240> get<00:04:39.389> used<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:40.169> just

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
but once you do get used to it it just

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.020 
but once you do get used to it it just
becomes<00:04:40.860> part<00:04:40.950> of<00:04:41.220> riding<00:04:41.370> your<00:04:41.639> bike<00:04:41.820> and

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
becomes part of riding your bike and

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.950 
becomes part of riding your bike and
it's<00:04:42.210> just<00:04:42.360> going<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.510> make<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.930> much

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
it's just going to make it that much

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.650 
it's just going to make it that much
more<00:04:43.139> enjoyable
