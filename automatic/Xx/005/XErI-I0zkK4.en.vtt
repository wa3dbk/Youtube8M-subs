00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.240
 hi hello live is one more day too 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.759
 general and today I bring you a 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.889
 previous video of a product that I bought 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.879
 recently the review is then about 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.549
 this lip lipstick is this brand 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:19.779
 comfort and good let's eat to start 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:23.650
 then for the packaging the packaging is 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:26.890
 like it's a strong plastic ok and it's 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.710
 in a dark brown tone it is not black ok 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.130
 It is a somewhat smooth surface and 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.290
 it has the corners in gold as you see it ok 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.830
 in the upper part up here then 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.660
 has the initials of the product according to 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.670
 my personal taste I would have liked that 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.860
 the name had it here or at 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.550
 side where it could be seen easier not 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.770
 I know from my point of view and here below 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.500
 It has the name and number of the 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.890
 product that is the color of the labial 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.410
 question 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.190
 in the packaging it is quite heavy it is 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.190
 heavy and touch 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.280
 inside because this color broken degree 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.020
 the tone that I chose is 12 no 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.150
 Vanilla is called and it's a nude tone 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.810
 as you can see in nude or pulling tone 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.160
 it is quite clear a little pinkish in 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.340
 the violence then has the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.990
 product initials up here 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.000
 Precisely about where does the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
 labial is one of the things that I do not 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.230
 liked it because when you put on your lipstick 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.150
 twice this is the aviary has 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.220
 used three times today 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.990
 to do the review and look at the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.390
 letter is practically erasing 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000
 therefore I did not like that one 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.580
 product of a high-end lipstick 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.870
 because it has such a high pressure 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.460
 They are good as for example those of Jean 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.110
 which have the name then here below 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.030
 and as much as I use it, it's going to 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.060
 have the name engraved for a long time 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.060
 weather 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.450
 the first thing that I did not like about the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.080
 presentation well this is the tone that I 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.479
 I chose ok it 's a tone because it's clear 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.959
 This is in question because it is not 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.940
 important because then tonality go 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.470
 to choose depending on the taste 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.570
 personal of each person and what 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.680
 wants violence so let's go 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.860
 then now with the following 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.170
 product features color smells 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.490
 quite nice is fine is nothing 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.739
 from the other world is an incredible honor 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.640
 but it looks a bit like the smell that 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.650
 have others for example ok texture 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.540
 the texture also a texture is me 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.040
 mate is not completely quite a 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.140
 little creamy also very similar to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.810
 amplified from sea and I do not feel totally 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.150
 mates are a bit creamy ok ok 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.860
 then this price the price of this 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.040
 labial here in germany in douglas where 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.170
 I bought it is 46 euros in the US I have 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.239
 understood that they are $ 49 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.640
 good quality pressure than what it offers 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.470
 the product that I think I'm going to 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.209
 say that then after I get you 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.940
 showing them how to use the product 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.440
 first let's see at the moment that 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.720
 I use it as has been the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.569
 lips up close and then we continue with 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.780
 Well what I think about the product 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.670
 to final mode 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.690
 to delineate my lips I will use 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:27.209
 this marc pencil that is called naked 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.209
 rose and is like that anthony tone 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.960
 do not 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.550
 and with this same tone I'm going to fill in the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.430
 sides 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.810
 now I'm going to use the lipstick that I eat 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.140
 they saw the top because it has the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.890
 then free brand logo says of 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.890
 more or less like that 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.610
 and I do is that he finished shaping the 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.440
 lips to give a little more 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.360
 dimension since this with everything 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.270
 pretty clear with another tone or color 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.739
 Well maybe they should not do it 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.200
 can finish then you outline the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.209
 lips teams then with the blonde and 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.190
 in my loves since they saw when in the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.260
 when the duration of the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.040
 product is pretty good enough 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.620
 long coverage is also quite 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.850
 good as they saw with a last area 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.729
 Well, it's pure enough, but here 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.280
 comes some dogs first is the plane 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.229
 it looks a lot like one that I have 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.150
 marc will then see what and how 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:51.410
 it looks good this is comfort and this 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.600
 labial here is mine from sea that has 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.060
 this appearance like this 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.870
 and put one next to the other then 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.870
 seeds 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:12.100
 in terms of normality and we finish 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:16.390
 they seem quite the sea ​​mail has a 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.890
 slightly whiter than against the light 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.780
 and the finish is exactly the tenth 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.240
 this is also a zapping and let's see 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.190
 both together as land and that's how it is 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.910
 as seen in one next to the other young 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.310
 the tones are pretty similar too 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.130
 the shape of the brightness they have and so on 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.860
 etcetera then at the end I say 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.710
 then of this lipstick the lipstick is very 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.800
 pretty the package looks amazing 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.830
 elegant very nice the smell is also 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.620
 pretty nice hard heap the lips 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.900
 it covers quite well the tone that I chose 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.370
 I liked it a lot for what I 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.720
 I wanted because for a vial of that 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.490
 I wanted a lipstick that I 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.280
 could use on any occasion 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.840
 out of evening evening day for a 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.470
 party for is for a wake like 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.510
 they say because then it's versatile 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.850
 it was not the idea as to tonality 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.689
 it does not have to be exactly because this 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.179
 tonality that you 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:14.649
 yes obviously true but law 

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:17.409
 is therefore for these reasons well 

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:21.009
 so what do I think the product is 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:26.199
 very good but in my opinion it is very very 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:28.059
 high its price for what is offered 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.459
 same that offers this lipstick that does not 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:33.279
 offers any of the others by 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:35.349
 example in this tone because this one from the sea 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.439
 it's going to be pretty much the same 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:40.360
 so honestly I do not 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.860
 I would buy again for that reason because 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.939
 what this lipstick is offering me 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.589
 with me offers any other the viral 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.849
 of Marc for example and possibly 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:50.940
 also from other brands with which 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.710
 can also compare 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.360
 good mass for being something that I wanted 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.860
 then show him from the aviary but that 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.210
 the video you liked it is already 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.210
 until the next bye
