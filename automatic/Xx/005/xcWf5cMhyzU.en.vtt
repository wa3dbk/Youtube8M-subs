00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello everyone has often played trick 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.180
 online I'll show the following 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.180
 trick 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.469
 good as you see this trick is very basic 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 and the truth that is very easy is not a 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.070
 trick to turn off directly to the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.110
 opponent but it's very useful for 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.390
 combine it with other tricks so that the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.829
 opponent that a little more confused this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 trick seems silly and it seems 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.100
 too easy that you do not even want to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.449
 learn it but you do not have to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 learn what you have to practice because 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.780
 this is going to give you a lot of coordination 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.820
 and a lot of control of the ball because 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.039
 that's what street football is about 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.140
 example we can do it by itself 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.370
 in this way or we can also 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.290
 combine with those tricks like 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.720
 example this this alone is a 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.990
 trick if we want to combine how is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.119
 there 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.810
 we do a little bit of this and we continue 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.979
 with the trick and so with many others if 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.270
 you want to learn the trick with what 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.860
 I just combined I'll leave you here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.360
 screen so you can click and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 watch the video I'll also leave you link the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 description then you will be able to 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.649
 practice that trick and you will be able to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.479
 look exactly how you have just 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.680
 show example what we are going to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.970
 Apply the trick step by step though 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.470
 neither does it have much mystery 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.570
 we do is step on the ball with the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.979
 sole of the dominant foot and we're going to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.659
 drag to the inside of the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.520
 dominant right away that we dragged 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.110
 we tread with the non-dominant in front of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 the ball and the ball goes up in 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.069
 direction to the dominant foot not when the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.600
 ball is about to reach the dominant foot 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.759
 obviously we have it with the part 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.110
 internal to the side on which it came and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.450
 before we leave, we will step on it again 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 with the sole of the non-dominant all 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.690
 together it would be like that dragged we stepped 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.759
 We'll beat him in the front before he leaves 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.409
 we think again the trick can you 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.149
 do twice three times four times 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.530
 five times in a row every time 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 you think convenient to fool the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.720
 important opponent when they read the touch 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.670
 with the inner part it has to be a 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.289
 very soft touch we're just going to put 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.269
 force to what is the touch with the part 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.519
 internal because the ball already comes 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.720
 rolling towards our inner part and already 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.470
 comes with power then nothing else 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.120
 enough with 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.520
 play the pennies so the ball 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.020
 come back if you hit with more power that 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.670
 force is going to double it is going to go very 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.590
 away and it's not going to happen that when you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.720
 we stick we will not be able to grab it and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.850
 continue with the trick as I always say no 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 try to do it super fast do it 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.880
 slowly because this trick needs 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.560
 coordination and you need good control 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.540
 of the ball once you go 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.920
 coming out automatically you go 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.120
 doing well every time you will get more 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.890
 fast your legs are going to be more 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.450
 agile and the tube is going out faster and 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.340
 the opponent is going to create more but 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.890
 always start step by step do not want 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.130
 go to the top before going through the most 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.130
 down 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.110
 good people I hope you liked it 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.610
