00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.490
 should still be used for documentation 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.779
 I'm doing a test drive here 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.360
 looking for the mistake why sometimes 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.650
 during the ride just something like 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.190
 Engine brake enters via the Audi A4 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.190
 you hear now 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.380
 that has so funny art behind then in 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:40.470
 the fuel bill I have here 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:45.510
 thus controls the type control of the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.110
 fuel pump is optimal 13 5 now pulls 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110
 he is not anymore 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.250
 that's the mistake and the song 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.770
 One hundred percent of the fuel pump or 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.400
 something in the direction because you hear 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.300
 she starts grinning again now and again 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.300
 right now not pull anymore 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.649
 so now he does not pull more than if only 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.659
 engine brake a switch i have now 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.540
 vollgas 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.189
 you notice it starts again as soon as 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.560
 it is clear as daylight at the sprit 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.560
 lie points one stops 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.479
 talk 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.420
 So if you're running just enough 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.219
 if you are unlucky he goes out it has you 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:56.119
 So usually always sometime the traffic light 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:58.789
 is now you can hear it very clearly so 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.920
 that it is something we are not 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.039
 trying to give gas he goes out he 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.729
 no performance can jump you 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.729
 do not consume anymore 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.519
 Now it's curious again so there 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.630
 I'm pretty sure that must 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.200
 something with either 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.750
 Tank ventilation and are thanks to ventilation 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.280
 or fuel-pump have yet to do a 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.069
 further advice why I am from 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.900
 At first I am sure that it is something 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.989
 with the fuel pump must be 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.670
 who is looking for such errors when 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.630
 I drive and the car and take no 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.440
 gas more 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.900
 And the speed is still 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.390
 displayed in the instrument cluster then can 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.290
 There will be no ignition when the speed 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.109
 actually fits in addition to the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.560
 sand hills from the car to driving behavior 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.970
 then it can be yes then it can 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.220
 do not ignite then react here 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.120
 built when the ignition fails then 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.620
 showed in the tachometer nothing more 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.209
 then you usually have that too 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.540
 then swallowed to the curve or something 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.480
 In this case, it is so the injection 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.280
 is being phased out and that way 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.870
 far that he stops for the first time and how art 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.769
 Motor brake makes and eventually remains 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.980
 he stopped and then he goes out of the end 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.480
 it's all on the highway 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.850
 so it just stops brother 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.920
 burned is the speed of people 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.690
 Speed ​​indicator continues to run 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.450
 continues to come only no fuel in 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.310
 fashion rainha and sometime if the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.319
 gasoline pump has rummaged again 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.000
 then he continues to drive normally that is 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.000
 then this principle yes 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.330
 if you stop the whole course in the new one 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.040
 and go or city ​​traffic as if it were 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.930
 Appell to and the fuel pump starts 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.090
 and no gas anymore 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.700
 then you'll just understand anyway 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.290
 yes then it's just over forest easy 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.480
 too little speed too little 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.340
 speed has that you can through 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.110
 probably no longer compensate by rolling 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.760
 let then you just stay 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.040
 sometime the intersection will stand or go out 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.519
 that is clearly true 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.050
 differentiate at the place 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.860
 Well that was it for the first time on the subject 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:18.620
 search for errors at audi a4 16 ag 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.620
 fuel pump
