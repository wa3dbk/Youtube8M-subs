00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
his channel is exploding and rightly so

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
his channel is exploding and rightly so
because<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.790> went<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.140> know

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170

because I went there just to you know
have<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.409> browse<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> quick<00:01:46.979> look<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
have a browse have a quick look and I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.499 
have a browse have a quick look and I
ended<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.670> sitting<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:48.479> or

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
ended up sitting there for about two or

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.569 
ended up sitting there for about two or
three<00:01:48.600> hours<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.229> watching<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
three hours just watching the all of the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.060 
three hours just watching the all of the
the<00:01:51.450> quick<00:01:51.689> MOA<00:01:52.020> B's<00:01:52.290> are<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:52.619> impressive

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the quick MOA B's are some impressive

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.830 
the quick MOA B's are some impressive
first<00:01:53.220> streaks<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.759> though<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
first streaks on though and that's the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.240 
first streaks on though and that's the
sign<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.290> channel<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> click<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sign of a good channel if you click on

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.649 
sign of a good channel if you click on
there<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.610> can't<00:01:56.820> peel<00:01:57.060> yourself<00:01:57.420> away

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
there and you can't peel yourself away

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.209 
there and you can't peel yourself away
you<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.380> they're<00:01:58.560> doing<00:01:58.740> something<00:01:58.950> right

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you know they're doing something right

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.969 
you know they're doing something right
and<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.729> was<00:02:00.600> definitely<00:02:01.049> motivated<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> jump

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
and I was definitely motivated to jump

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.730 
and I was definitely motivated to jump
on<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.280> try<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.790> some<00:02:03.079> quick<00:02:04.079> MOA<00:02:04.439> B's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
on and try and get some quick MOA B's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.429 
on and try and get some quick MOA B's
myself<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.610> I've<00:02:06.360> had<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> since<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.259> started

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
myself and I've had to since I started

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.740 
myself and I've had to since I started
watching<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.160> perhaps<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.209> taken<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.569> step

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
watching so perhaps I have taken a step

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.820 
watching so perhaps I have taken a step
in<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> right<00:02:10.020> direction<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.470> learned<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.709> few

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
in the right direction and learned a few

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.420 
in the right direction and learned a few
tricks<00:02:10.890> from<00:02:11.190> him<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.870> two<00:02:13.020> M

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
tricks from him this is one of the two M

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.280 
tricks from him this is one of the two M
these<00:02:13.549> and<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.090> other<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.390> I'm<00:02:14.989> not<00:02:15.140> sure

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
these and the other one I'm not sure

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.479
