 bought the pack crest a monster wolves 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.240
 werewolves and radio so ben I'm doing the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.980
 review right after i showed you 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.110
 the box here we go the locals like that 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.600
 we see them there houses they are a 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.220
 little inverted so 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.200
 moment not the color me I describe is 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.680
 almost at one so do not know 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.270
 not too much how do I go maybe 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.910
 to buy 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.720
 a rade may be express for the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.380
 dredge 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.380
 maybe make heroin or 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.520
 and the back of the box so here you go 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.660
 is struggling 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.000
 plon since he is small 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.470
 they came 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.920
 e 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.200
 I think guys actually they are 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.430
 all inverted mix all the vampire 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.770
 I wanted too much who was with another 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:16.270
 mayor but he was not a station or kg 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.640
 So these two are here they are 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.409
 brooms with the brush all those to whom 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 all 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 once the box last july 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.659
 all 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.720
 so I roll to I lose the review there 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:38.710
 so there is 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:44.700
 bah there either the sell like that why 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 I know that we can be 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.380
 thu huong allan poe with scales 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.290
 morose and the kinds of tattoo a little 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:59.430
 green here and there on cooking did not and 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.430
 our arms will not 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.850
 I believe that held normally 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.799
 was work it's more so actually 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.770
 I reversed 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.330
 what I think it looks like and 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.050
 so this makeup 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.840
 he is green with the eyes towards the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.930
 eyebrows it's a little spikes have 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.080
 about 3 it's a little bit of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.260
 a little snake makeup if we see 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.260
 well 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.819
 it was wonderful 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.439
 then she has one to the greens with 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.690
 points 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.940
 a people 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.870
 or black and white then he a little bit of 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.530
 the green light green and young 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.370
 then to a skirt 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.860
 because in fact I think it was 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.020
 a dress actually it was a skirt that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.610
 the same motives when a little skin of 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.950
 snake like that will mean like she 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.130
 and the same colors because it's 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:08.830
 united then adl a little flexible what 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:11.090
 stay there then she has little names 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.890
 people of my joy a little like the 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.210
 kunar and it's not the same thing when 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.340
 even green 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.270
 and here is not really there for icade 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.890
 here we see well so it's when god 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.790
 then she has ears a little bit 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.380
 wing shape 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.970
 I'm not that weird at last - like the 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.970
 street like that 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.860
 either odd 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.520
 these are small cros and a red to 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.660
 biolay lips i'm trying to find a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.030
 wig and she has little crouching hands 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.180
 yeah 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.690
 I leave a little like that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.440
 who's going to be snapped up something persie 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.440
 are funny six months 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.440
 a bit like that 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.440
 then 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.700
 the logan so maybe I'm going 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.380
 call it actually I got the idea of 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.430
 mix the name of hole in and of 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.800
 Peter I think I'll call him 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.580
 to be closed line or audi because in 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.930
 may it be sisters 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.530
 binoculars something like that where the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.450
 troops or fake binoculars and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.650
 she feels wall or a little or not 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.030
 a lot what they are the spells to 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.500
 Peter the big sisters and they 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.020
 will be a first after cloud and have 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.700
 caused sequences and big sisters 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.480
 cheer the little sisters also to a 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.750
 club I think and if I find another 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.880
 because that may be so and so I 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.040
 thought to call it maybe the cloud in 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.470
 or out in for all not or lilly wood I 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.330
 do not know too much so here's the 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.920
 break so we do that it's 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.150
 little ears that feels a little pale 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.270
 bar but a little bit like that 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.290
 that they success important it is not 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.420
 to be who settles where I can look 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.820
 it does not need at all but good 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.260
 I tried a little cachets so 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.970
 she has her hands with the writing way 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.730
 like claudio the others the guardian for 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.960
 she a pale purple makeup a little 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.060
 like the cellars a little as if I can 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.750
 in fact his hair they have wicks 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.740
 a little 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.880
 purple light pink it's weird but 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:28.020
 it's nice then she a black top 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.970
 with people of violet mun a little 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.310
 to June 20th 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:40.290
 finally not actually a europe wes not a 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.430
 black dress here with black patterns here 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.620
 with a purple background with moons 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.900
 kinds of spira since a little 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.900
 weird so how's that here I believe 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.729
 there too I'm not really much 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:06:00.360
 then you said shoes like that 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.840
 with moons as gray as that c 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.840
 they compensated 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.050
 these are really too beautiful 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.310
 I told myself that I rather 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.680
 put these three there because it was going 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.840
 better with his hair the clampins his 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.950
 makeup and his shoes because 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.710
 it's the ear of the slope is not 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.290
 too high so here we leave hole 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.440
 a wig later for for the 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.330
 poor of aragon because otherwise it's going 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.250
 not there I do not know yet how 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.480
 I will call it at all from 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:34.960
 everything it is remembered that I called line 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:38.010
 I do not know I 'm gonna be nothing bomb 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.010
 salty saplings 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.270
 no
