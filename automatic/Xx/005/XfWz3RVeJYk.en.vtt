00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
a valve silly the valve makes it much

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.679 
a valve silly the valve makes it much
easier<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:04.130> do<00:02:04.250> than<00:02:04.429> using<00:02:04.819> a<00:02:04.909> flat<00:02:05.479> blade

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
easier to do than using a flat blade

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.170 
easier to do than using a flat blade
screwdriver<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:08.750> we've<00:02:08.959> got<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.849> bar<00:02:10.849> so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
screwdriver and here we've got a bar so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.339 
screwdriver and here we've got a bar so
you<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.330> actually<00:02:11.660> fit<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.870> into<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.110> first

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
you can actually fit it into the first

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.140 
you can actually fit it into the first
stage<00:02:12.560> even<00:02:12.980> at<00:02:13.099> low<00:02:13.160> pressure<00:02:13.400> up<00:02:13.519> or<00:02:13.940> high

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
stage even at low pressure up or high

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.000 
stage even at low pressure up or high
pressure<00:02:14.420> port<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.840> gives<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.079> a<00:02:15.140> platform

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
pressure port and gives you a platform

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.860 
pressure port and gives you a platform
to<00:02:16.130> work<00:02:16.280> from<00:02:16.579> so<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.239> can<00:02:17.269> hold<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.660> steady

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
to work from so you can hold it steady

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.559 
to work from so you can hold it steady
and<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.500> can<00:02:18.590> also<00:02:18.739> use<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.190> tool<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.760> undo

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
and you can also use a tool to undo

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.589 
and you can also use a tool to undo
different<00:02:20.870> bits<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:22.069> basement<00:02:22.700> games<00:02:23.209> first

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
different bits so basement games first

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.729 
different bits so basement games first
stages<00:02:23.840> apart<00:02:24.290> much<00:02:24.440> easier<00:02:27.849> this<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.739> valve

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
stages apart much easier this is a valve

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.250 
stages apart much easier this is a valve
setting<00:02:31.099> tool<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:32.480> your<00:02:32.599> hose<00:02:32.750> screws<00:02:33.079> onto

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
setting tool so your hose screws onto

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.620 
setting tool so your hose screws onto
this<00:02:33.470> end<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.220> screen<00:02:34.489> end<00:02:34.760> screws<00:02:35.209> into<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
this end this screen end screws into the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.930 
this end this screen end screws into the
second<00:02:36.380> stage<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.010> basically<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.459> turn

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
second stage and basically you can turn

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.259 
second stage and basically you can turn
the<00:02:38.390> control<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.709> adjusts<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.030> valve

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
the control and that adjusts the valve

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.990 
the control and that adjusts the valve
inside<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.410> if<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.590> do<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> an<00:02:43.670> overly

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
inside so if you do have a an overly

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.270 
inside so if you do have a an overly
sensitive<00:02:44.239> or<00:02:44.720> not<00:02:45.410> so<00:02:45.680> sensitive<00:02:45.889> enough

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
sensitive or not so sensitive enough

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.309 
sensitive or not so sensitive enough
valve<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.359> can<00:02:47.510> adjust<00:02:47.810> using<00:02:48.079> this

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
valve you can adjust using this

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.789 
valve you can adjust using this
basically<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> prongs<00:02:49.639> just<00:02:49.910> fit<00:02:50.090> into<00:02:50.269> the

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
basically the prongs just fit into the
