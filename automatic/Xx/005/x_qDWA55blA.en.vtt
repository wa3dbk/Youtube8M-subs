00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello everyone in today's video like me 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.680
 I will tell you about the summer collection 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.420
 Clara and to be honest when I saw 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.389
 The first many photos I was a little 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.000
 disappointed because I didn't see 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.430
 pallets and I think that Clarence can 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.010
 exceptionally beautiful summer palettes and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.680
 it seemed to me that the browser in this 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.779
 The collection is similar to the previous bronze 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.029
 years and I honestly was previously at clarans not 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.779
 really like it but when I saw 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.969
 I live the collection I was pleasantly surprised 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.870
 because clarence is in this collection 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.760
 shows amazing color play 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.739
 Now I will show this collection in general 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.410
 so you can appreciate it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.770
 the lines that i acquired are water resistant 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.129
 ink 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.370
 in aquatic green shade this base under 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.559
 makeup in shade 04 and the arrival is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 eyeliner and in shade cover 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.920
 green 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.109
 This is a bronzer for the face and three shades 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.890
 cream shadows 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.710
 aquatic green aquatic roses and aquatic gray 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.909
 inspect the collection perhaps we will start with 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.610
 Bronzer but where are you without it? 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.950
 said clarence hand bronze to me not very 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 I don't like them very much 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.869
 packaging she seems to me some 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 a little bit poor such plastic 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.100
 bad latch about which i am incessantly 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.780
 breaking nails 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.380
 but this is of course my personal impression 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.170
 because I heard that a lot of packaging 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.119
 browsers clarence seems very chic 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 but nevertheless filling the packaging is not 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.890
 compensates because usually the pond 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.929
 lawrence is too dark for 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.090
 vinyl and too red 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.329
 Basically, the bronzer is not out 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.009
 total row so smart there is therefore in 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.170
 as the sole bronzer a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.969
 purchased in summer collections or 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.149
 God forbid the only broder 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.209
 I don't recommend it to you unless 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.689
 you have very dark skin or very much 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.750
 tan of course in a shaded because he doesn't 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.849
 will look so brick but 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.190
 no less obvious bright 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:19.410
 then I bought all three shades of cream 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.930
 shadows clarence because 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.560
 I like the cream shades of Klarans 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.629
 and I like them even more than 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.930
 let's say cream shade zhivanshi 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.650
 or chanel they have quite dry 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.290
 texture meaning they are closer to dry shadows 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.959
 but it demonstrates exceptional 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.989
 color returns in the summer collection of clarence 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.910
 gave the covers of the jars the color of those shades 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.970
 shadows that are inside 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.120
 I think this is a very good idea and 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.910
 that it is very convenient I want to show you 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.840
 Swatches of cream shade from the summer collection 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.849
 bottom shade is aquatic roses which 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.250
 is a golden hue with 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:08.780
 impurity pink medium hue 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.950
 aquatic green which I thought would be 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.590
 turquoise but fortunately turned out to be 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.069
 green so deep water and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.829
 very decorating bright eyes and finally 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.680
 last shade this shade is aquatic 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.139
 gray which is a shade 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.269
 chameleon and depending on the lighting he 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:31.620
 may look absolutely gray 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:35.030
 either blueberry so blue dark 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.850
 deep and very beautiful 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.760
 then the water stand is also a shade 03 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.430
 akvatel green in this carcass to me 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.400
 I liked the fact that she is quite black 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.800
 i can apply sol without black 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.110
 I think this is very convenient and 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.840
 it will increase the effect of your makeup 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.170
 The key tones of the collection are as follows 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.870
 pencil comes also in aquatic shade 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.459
 green pencil and bright well gives color 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:13.730
 and completely repeats the shade stew and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:16.160
 shadow mascara and pencil and finally it 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.040
 famous base of Clarens and for there 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.829
 permanent collection she is represented in 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.950
 three shades and in the summer collection came out 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.780
 fourth shade and coming in principle 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.760
 when applied, it seems that 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.280
 the base is a bit dark and has too 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.350
 pronounced apricot shade well on 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.740
 really as you understand and put 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.150
 gas it flawlessly merges with the skin and 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.680
 only slightly lends it so light 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.320
 tanned has therefore if you have on 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.500
 the face is visible imperfections which 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.390
 you want to hide this base you will 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.570
 not enough you will have to top 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.760
 apply tonal but nevertheless for a very 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.400
 hot summer days when normal 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.700
 tonal flow seems too dense 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.470
 or feel like a mask on his face, I think 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.140
 that this base may well be 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.440
 used solo is very convenient 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.960
 therefore rivers 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.700
 you look at this product well 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.520
