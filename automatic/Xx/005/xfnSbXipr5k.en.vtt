00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.609 
and I did have to swatch these three
times<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> very<00:02:06.450> thin<00:02:06.930> nail

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
times because it is a very thin nail

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.109 
times because it is a very thin nail
polish<00:02:07.979> which<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.220> kind<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
polish which I kind of like because you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.639 
polish which I kind of like because you
can<00:02:09.300> build<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> three<00:02:10.050> coats<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.410> really

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
can build it up to three coats to really

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.550 
can build it up to three coats to really
get<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.129> bright<00:02:11.879> shimmer<00:02:12.300> of

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
get like the bright shimmer of

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.589 
get like the bright shimmer of
but<00:02:12.860> it's<00:02:12.980> not<00:02:13.099> going<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.310> chip<00:02:13.550> as<00:02:13.730> easily<00:02:14.090> the

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
but it's not going to chip as easily the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.940 
but it's not going to chip as easily the
problem<00:02:14.959> with<00:02:15.080> three<00:02:15.319> coats<00:02:15.560> with<00:02:15.770> nail

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
problem with three coats with nail

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.920 
problem with three coats with nail
polishes<00:02:16.459> because<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.150> chips<00:02:17.450> like<00:02:17.720> right

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
polishes because it chips like right

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.210 
polishes because it chips like right
away<00:02:18.110> because<00:02:18.380> there's<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.680> much<00:02:18.770> built-up

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
away because there's so much built-up

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.520 
away because there's so much built-up
but<00:02:19.819> these<00:02:19.940> are<00:02:20.090> thin<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.200> thin

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
but these are thin so if you do thin

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.020 
but these are thin so if you do thin
layers<00:02:21.800> it'll<00:02:22.190> build<00:02:22.310> up<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.640> glitter<00:02:22.940> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
layers it'll build up the glitter and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.030 
layers it'll build up the glitter and
the<00:02:23.360> shimmer<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.989> it's<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.410> pretty<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:24.890> this

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
the shimmer and it's just pretty so this

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.150 
the shimmer and it's just pretty so this
almost<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.819> kind<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.209> rose<00:02:26.480> gold<00:02:26.870> color

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
almost is kind of like a rose gold color

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.500
