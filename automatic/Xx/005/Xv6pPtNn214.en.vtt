00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.680
 the nation's security ministry 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.450
 introduced the new four zeros that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.139
 will be incorporated into the police fleet 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.209
 federal argentina it's about 350 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.539
 units most of the ford model 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.520
 focus and the rest of Ford rangers the 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.310
 Ford and Garreta official dealer was 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.990
 the person responsible for marketing 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.870
 we talked with his president ramÃ³n and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.300
 garreta this starts with a need 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.430
 who had the security force in the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 which they were putting all the 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.559
 things that we needed in what 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.749
 order and see if you could get a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.999
 nationally manufactured vehicle with a 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:41.699
 fundamentally national solution 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:44.190
 was in the weight gain that was 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.109
 carries these vehicles due to the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.460
 number of people who carry but 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.999
 fundamentally the equipment 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.150
 electronic weapons etcetera etcetera that 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:57.130
 greatly increases the weight for that then 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.530
 a solution to this issue was sought 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.200
 looked for another solution that is the problem 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.180
 of the bumpers how to avoid and 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.370
 decrease the maintenance costs of 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.590
 the vehicles were also searched in 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.650
 lift a little more from the ground to 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.650
 make it more agile and easier to 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.750
 operate on lands that are not so 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.110
 correct as they were nothing more than 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.510
 asphalt and all that came to the conclusion 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.940
 to go putting everything in one 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.580
 listing and found a solution that is 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.560
 the one you are looking at here 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.360
 we take care of ourselves 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.729
 we discuss comfort what are the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.930
 possibilities of solution and together 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.330
 with fort we have continued to find 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.450
 suppliers that were solving us 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.450
 things and ourselves producing 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.580
 drawings projects the technique to be able 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.230
 perform the vehicle is in terms of 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.300
 shielding is the highest grade available 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.180
 good in terms of armoring that's what 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.640
 I can tell you it's a 360 shield 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.240
 degrees 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 Is absolutely 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.490
 and confiable 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.260
 as for we also see that there 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.060
 security cameras that are 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.300
 permanently transmitting everything 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.090
 who comes to see if that is another 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.700
 provider that has done it and what to 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.140
 we have been given is the consumption 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 they have those teams that really 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.310
 they are tremendously high and where they are 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.140
 placed for example one of the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.540
 problems that these vehicles have is 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.640
 that the heat dissipation they need 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.140
 all these equipment is very high are 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.240
 placed in the trunk so they have 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.700
 forcers to cool the trunks 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.120
 of the vehicle besides that the system 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.560
 electric is a double electrical system 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.750
 a system that is the one that works 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.180
 normally with the vehicle and one 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.360
 second that is nothing more than for the 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.880
 peripherals when they spend the time of 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.440
 use of peripherals the vehicle counts 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.300
 it starts up and it can work and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.130
 automatically the alternator 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.660
 vehicle is the one that loads the other the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.360
 second battery 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.770
 that's all that is a local development 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.300
 we imagine that there were a few months 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.650
 of development to get to the product 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.610
 final 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.439
 well I think they are years is true with 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.209
 this but many years that we are 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.459
 working in these many years for 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.459
 automotive and very good relationship with fort
