00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.890
 from youtube soini to graf counting a 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.899
 Minecraft's direct gameplay is good 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.470
 friends if he asks you why I'm here 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:14.110
 it's because a subscriber asked me to do 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.550
 a good gameplay like I say that the 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.820
 Subscribers asks for the gameplay 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.820
 I'm going to do it 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.739
 39 I have written a comment about 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.759
 special 150 suffer 150 to your game the 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:33.230
 hungry good the comment says a 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.900
 friend question could be the mechanism 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:40.430
 of the artificial ones that you have in 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.430
 one of your videos if friends I will do this 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.700
 promotion ok 39 I hope you subscribe 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.040
 to your channel and also to mine hate 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 well if you do not know it fortifies them 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.100
 I will leave the link in the description of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 good video let's start with the gameplay 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.010
 good 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 It is very easy to make a fire mechanism 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 artificial, what we will need is a 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.770
 block of stone or equal any 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:16.299
 straight torch block 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.240
 lever and dispenser good to start 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.320
 the mechanism we have to do this 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.929
 leave a stone and skip a square 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.350
 and do this 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.860
 well then we make a way to l like this 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.300
 little 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.300
 then we put red ton here 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.080
 here 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.600
 then with the torch we must surround the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.290
 square like this 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.290
 or not 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.510
 and then put the lever and 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.480
 deactivate 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.150
 after putting the dispenser 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.340
 and the first mechanism is already done and it is 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.370
 very easy to do it good to do the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.490
 second we skipped two spaces and 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.430
 we place and the same thing we have to do 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.880
 the same thing we must do what we did 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.560
 with the first good mechanism we do 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.920
 this puts a rest of there proton here 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.790
 here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.670
 and we unite 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.150
 the mechanisms 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.760
 with the torch does the same 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.760
 we surround the stones there 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.920
 the dispenser 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.340
 Well, they're done, you just need to try it 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.340
 we put this here black and white 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.370
 You have to prove it 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.790
 how are you 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:10.219
 put fireworks 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.219
 we put at night to make it look better 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.459
 and it is already 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.459
 work perfectly 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:25.019
 they work perfectly well these 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.340
 mechanisms not only serve to place 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.180
 rockets 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.180
 if they do not serve to cheat like 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.850
 Cheats ask me 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.400
 good traps like with arrows 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.400
 well we put the arrows here 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.459
 and this serves to kill zombies good 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.670
 today they want this position of the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.640
 dispensers can not be looking like this 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:02.440
 but above good but it does not matter is a 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:05.640
 show we turn on the mechanism 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.640
 and they will say arrows 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.930
 as you can see they have arrows 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:20.019
 good friends this has been all very easy 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:23.050
 do all mechanism and greetings to that 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.780
 39 or cardio 29 I do not know how to pronounce 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:30.120
 but this has been all I hope that it 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.120
 subscribe to the antler god
