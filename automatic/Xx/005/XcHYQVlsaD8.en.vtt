has died from a blood magic spell cast I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950

think<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.579> might<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.000> slightly<00:00:36.600> bugged

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
think that this might be slightly bugged

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
think that this might be slightly bugged
because<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.440> couldn't<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.010> work<00:00:38.149> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
because I couldn't get it to work the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.700 
because I couldn't get it to work the
spells<00:00:39.420> work<00:00:39.600> great<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.870> their<00:00:40.079> own<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.649> I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
spells work great on their own but I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
spells work great on their own but I
found<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.250> most<00:00:41.430> effective<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.300> spell<00:00:42.719> sod

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
found will most effective as a spell sod

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.279 
found will most effective as a spell sod
character<00:00:43.879> there<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.360> spell<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.050> might

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
character there was one spell that might

00:00:46.289 --> 00:01:08.600 
character there was one spell that might
be<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.890> strong<00:00:47.280> though

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
now I originally download this mod for a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
now I originally download this mod for a
bit<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.400> laugh<00:01:50.580> not<00:01:51.210> knowing<00:01:51.509> how<00:01:51.600> much<00:01:51.690> fun

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
bit of a laugh not knowing how much fun

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.840 
bit of a laugh not knowing how much fun
it<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.020> actually<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.670> think

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
it was actually going to be and I think

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.760 
it was actually going to be and I think
the<00:01:53.940> shield<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.720> probably<00:01:55.080> my<00:01:55.290> favorite

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the shield is now probably my favorite
