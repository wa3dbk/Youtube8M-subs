I<00:02:11.510> don't<00:02:11.720> think<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.900> little<00:02:12.020> fluid<00:02:12.260> has<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
I don't think a little fluid has the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.770 
I don't think a little fluid has the
heart<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.160> he's<00:02:13.340> not<00:02:13.520> man<00:02:13.700> enough<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.330> step<00:02:14.600> in

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
heart and he's not man enough to step in

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.150 
heart and he's not man enough to step in

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
that's why you know he has to fabricate

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.250
