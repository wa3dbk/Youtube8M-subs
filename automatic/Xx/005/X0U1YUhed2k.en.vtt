00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 well hi to all and it's 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.839
 also today 60 points a little 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.210
 match against mathilde I think it's 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.889
 my tin so here is the nickname of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.259
 the yopougon udc acquired by force of 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.969
 weird to say that 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.300
 always is it that bassam to that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:26.160
 I made live a dish my microphone 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:29.189
 dropped me at the microphone but hey, I got the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.529
 chance of reflex to keep them 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.110
 So it's samba so I want 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.210
 sabotage a cetain but screech 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.250
 this is a mystique of the cost 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.570
 based like that no but it's true 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 that they are ugly it's interesting 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.129
 because I'm really going to try 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 a bit of a blow and I did all 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.239
 calculations and all expectations 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
 which seems to me quite logical but good 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.289
 so there you will go go a lot 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.340
 so help me out the team because 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.289
 that it's true that it's been a long time since 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.430
 I have not played because since it is 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.570
 in fact I had made a live you 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.829
 will treat london besides I am 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.650
 sorry for those who came who is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.150
 a lot of problems and with volt on 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.479
 finally knows the massive flight mandate and - 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.369
 ultimate 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.350
 they kicked me out of pokemon 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.270
 it's not a team of rising non latins 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.070
 30 seconds but the margins so here I 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.659
 go for that of just because I 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.799
 thought you're basically a no 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.570
 stone of which I had just after these 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.549
 traps behind thanks to landos and what 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 will happen now to be able to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.080
 to remove weird because in his team 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.509
 there was no minor shrinkage apart 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.240
 beautiful tonight but I think it's a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.310
 wall with antibes we do not live on a 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.509
 but at least six if they wanted 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.990
 remove those rock pieces with nothing 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.320
 remove the names 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.810
 it was so cool to send likes 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.520
 gray beard adds it's a big 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.390
 threat amatil now a shot that 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.960
 I have a little because I violated our 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.030
 little angel marie it's a little silly 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.340
 suddenly I switch I hesitated between pulled 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.149
 or oulad causeway I did I'm going 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.619
 try to recife 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.270
 and there he will take me out a big 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.829
 facebook friend hydroquinone so 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 it is true that it was super anticipable 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.340
 like action but now I wanted to play 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.380
 safe and I might have had to blow 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.240
 find at the end 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.230
 suddenly it exists at 6 bp it's cool 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.370
 and I thought to myself I think he's going 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.310
 anticipate the fact of their things because I 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.500
 pursuit and age happy pursuit and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.350
 the top so pulls it still well 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.390
 served but two pocketcams the timone 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.460
 two small dogs for matsui were 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.310
 have been almost turning her off 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.620
 sharp on golden trap that dies so 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.390
 the elonva what back and I 'm good at my 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.310
 notice to fly this pure game really cei 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 saw that if I did not wish with pulled 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.750
 because we'll see it done and sigean it 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.550
 sail and the pickaxe he could really 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.380
 I'm st lou so he decides 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.400
 to invest or not 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.100
 it helps in the matter I had nothing 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.240
 for ice martin barrel box not 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.050
 so badly who was fighting jackets and 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.300
 chaos so frankly it's not great 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.650
 manage on the spot and that's it going 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.880
 a lot less doubtful for the match 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.640
 so here I decided to make a big 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.100
 close fight just because a mega 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.080
 scarano to an attack of my sick and 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.150
 as they walked in ice had 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.910
 not sure to overtake him behind blow 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.530
 so I support them but look 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:21.110
 me just the power of this close 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 fight then the armor is really 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.290
 impressive 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.490
 so they were going to rest it's finally in 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.590
 do I try to think what I said 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.140
 when i did live mozilla and rest i 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.610
 I thought he did not look ok 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.140
 scabreuse of the coup it's cool I would not 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.670
 clamor castres brut is very nice 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.250
 because it seems a little bit of 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.570
 do at the half turns then there 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.310
 I had anticipated I remember the 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.950
 lenses haze so he keeps 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.510
 his bichard and I said to myself bah if 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.190
 never done anti haze I can relocate 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.500
 but street trap behind you do 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.770
 two half-time let's anticipate the charter lobby 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.350
 but fortunately voiceless the thing that 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.900
 a little bit the side that makes him that 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.230
 is more of a problem 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.930
 big hyper tld at the game little rougher 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.920
 satim limit even now I think 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.209
 that I would have more yes zeitim if I had 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.189
 had some speed actually because he has 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.070
 a package that will bother us who is 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.289
 not necessarily boring for my team and who 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.889
 will really bother us these hundreds 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.000
 Russian then when I think back 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.130
 now maybe I should have 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.460
 attack directly and not switch in 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.570
 did because I thought he had I 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.259
 do not know I think I had removed the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.880
 rock traps 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.440
 So january draw you do it's 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.460
 cool i'm going to have the storm of 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.280
 sand 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.530
 actually not that you go and morals 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.820
 is in fact I should have should have 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.800
 stay and attack in the worst case 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.039
 I was paralyzed it's not very 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.060
 behind he was left gold gabonews 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.490
 which of the water hotels in all 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.710
 case it exceeded me since I was having 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.030
 seen they were six cards and ben 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.740
 it's true that I did not play very well 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.620
 trying to send riders to the 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.580
 dead so there he anticipated the fast turn 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.419
 so with rudy traps would be 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.340
 dead and I would have been incapacitated 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.590
 to make too fast turn the train station 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.900
 from sharks term to rock looting of which 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.520
 he played well it's true on the self me 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.789
 I did move through the files one 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.410
 saw her waters and I got 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.289
 said yeah it's forced to anticipate the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.479
 late show since basically if I place myself 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.500
 with late show hyper a soup to take 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.159
 so I thought they want 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.750
 to anticipate 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.800
 I still take a lot of 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.780
 damage some of which I am 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.280
 offensive by cons we fight with 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.699
 draw even if he died just a big 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.440
 earthquake 1 unfortunately unfortunately 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.120
 low she does not follow and there frankly 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.050
 in front of the eye I got ok van buyten 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.110
 Russian but I can not afford 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.490
 to do it so I made gfr fric 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.370
 and I should have done so much 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.050
 rockfall fate is so different 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.490
 but it's true that I was hungry as 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.560
 behind jal nothing to go beyond 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.270
 dose literally he could 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.760
 put back to work that explode fox 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.780
 they kill my hope the sadly 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.580
 So it's true that I have bigger 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.849
 thing like com especially wants n 2 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.740
 Russian 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:59.690
 So apart from the jeans so veil sauce 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.349
 now let's have to have jean vasca 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.270
 innocent mac 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.740
 hello the series no which one holds it I 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.449
 knew that some of the ice louvers 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.289
 all morning so that's right 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.110
 the team was a little bit safe 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:15.050
 you have a lot of class weakness in 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:18.689
 makes the momentum of horus on rise and 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.680
 no in this match but in return 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.639
 with ao the husband who could entirely 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.419
 that she finally says the icy wind of 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.099
 that she owes to the fact that she must 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.360
 was rather bad at maxim in general 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.289
 all the aftermath julien so with 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.960
 far on his priorities 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:34.259
 so well they sleep speed like 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.339
 not possible well I'm hot if in 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.309
 I might have done that right now 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.240
 the beginning make a big psy kaixi show 

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:40.469
 laurent weil that she waters behind 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.599
 but at least there will be more thunder 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:44.369
 is it because I think that 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:46.740
 crowd life I might have better of 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:48.059
 kg time and the ice wind I know well 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.990
 how that I do not know how it's 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:53.819
 exactly but with the damage of the 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.279
 form plus the rodbar traps get 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.159
 sell affected areas and suddenly 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:01.499
 behind you who die at this price that 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:03.779
 the lot two russian and two russian 24 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:05.999
 it will hurt so that this e-mail 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:07.409
 missing maybe a score other than tia 

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:10.289
 because it keeps lascars doing well 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:13.740
 but then he basically went into 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.300
 big one to the goal of tiralo low 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.599
 away from the blow it stays a little bit 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.249
 pity 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.749
 this was a little game we are 

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:19.889
 really nice it speaks to me a little bit 

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:21.509
 to put me back in the bath of that 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:24.479
 since a good one to demand that it has me a
