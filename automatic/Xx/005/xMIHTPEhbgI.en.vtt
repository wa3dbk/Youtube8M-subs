00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.010 

so<00:00:05.220> now<00:00:05.339> let's<00:00:05.520> combine<00:00:05.730> snake<00:00:06.359> arms<00:00:06.750> with

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
so now let's combine snake arms with

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.919 
so now let's combine snake arms with
piston<00:00:07.440> hips<00:00:08.120> we're<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.389> start<00:00:09.660> with

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
piston hips we're going to start with

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.860 
piston hips we're going to start with
the<00:00:10.019> snake<00:00:10.230> arms<00:00:10.559> first<00:00:11.300> lifting<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.540> hand<00:00:12.780> at

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the snake arms first lifting one hand at

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.529 
the snake arms first lifting one hand at
a<00:00:12.900> time<00:00:13.130> and<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:16.279> remember<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.490> move<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:18.150> joint

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
a time and to remember to move one joint

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.880 
a time and to remember to move one joint
at<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.050> time<00:00:19.710> lifting<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> shoulder<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.630> elbow

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
at a time lifting the shoulder the elbow

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.060 
at a time lifting the shoulder the elbow
wrist<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.250> releasing<00:00:23.939> through<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.180> hands

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
wrist and releasing through the hands

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
wrist and releasing through the hands
one<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.689> two<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:30.330> walk<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.960> move<00:00:31.230> we

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
one and two to walk for this move we

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.680 
one and two to walk for this move we
need<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.710> coordinate<00:00:31.980> same<00:00:32.520> arm<00:00:32.820> same<00:00:33.090> foot<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
need to coordinate same arm same foot so

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.990 
need to coordinate same arm same foot so
as<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.410> hand<00:00:34.440> lifts<00:00:35.160> I'm<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
as the right hand lifts I'm going to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.569 
as the right hand lifts I'm going to
point<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.719> foot<00:00:36.870> forward<00:00:37.430> push<00:00:38.430> our

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
point the right foot forward push our

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.139 
point the right foot forward push our
weight<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
weight on it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:49.410 
weight on it
and<00:00:39.620> switch

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.229 

next<00:00:50.420> our<00:00:50.630> piston<00:00:51.170> hips<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:53.000> downward

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
next our piston hips so it's a downward

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.840 
next our piston hips so it's a downward
accent<00:00:53.900> you<00:00:54.829> want<00:00:54.950> to<00:00:55.160> make<00:00:55.309> sure<00:00:55.340> that<00:00:55.670> you're

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
accent you want to make sure that you're

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.729 
accent you want to make sure that you're
lifting<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.390> hip<00:00:56.570> up<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.200> you<00:00:57.260> have<00:00:57.379> somewhere

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
lifting the hip up so you have somewhere

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.580 
lifting the hip up so you have somewhere
to<00:00:57.800> go<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:59.000> switch<00:00:59.300> your<00:00:59.510> weight

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.240 

instance<00:01:06.590> you're<00:01:06.770> lifting<00:01:06.890> your<00:01:07.130> foot

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
instance you're lifting your foot

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.130 
instance you're lifting your foot
completely<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:07.910> very<00:01:08.180> easy<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.630> travel<00:01:08.990> with

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
completely it's very easy to travel with

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.920 
completely it's very easy to travel with
this<00:01:09.410> step<00:01:09.710> coming<00:01:10.550> forward<00:01:12.940> or<00:01:13.940> back<00:01:16.720> so<00:01:17.720> for

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
this step coming forward or back so for

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.210 
this step coming forward or back so for
this<00:01:18.020> combination<00:01:18.320> we're<00:01:18.770> going<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.009> travel

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
this combination we're going to travel

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.249 
this combination we're going to travel
forward<00:01:19.759> with<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.940> snake<00:01:20.150> arms<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:20.690> back

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
forward with the snake arms and back

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.770 
forward with the snake arms and back
with<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.710> piston<00:01:22.039> hips<00:01:22.360> taking<00:01:23.360> two<00:01:23.509> steps

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
with the piston hips taking two steps

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.779 
with the piston hips taking two steps
forward<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:25.509> four<00:01:26.509> steps<00:01:26.840> back<00:01:27.110> with<00:01:27.320> piston

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
forward and four steps back with piston

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:39.010 
forward and four steps back with piston
right<00:01:28.789> left<00:01:29.720> right<00:01:30.700> plus

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.100 

let's<00:01:39.619> try<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.770> with<00:01:39.950> music
