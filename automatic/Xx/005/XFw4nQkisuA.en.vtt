created like I say I'm leaving it
loosely<00:02:29.820> colored<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.930> look<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.290> little

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
loosely colored so it can look a little

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.170 
loosely colored so it can look a little
bit<00:02:31.650> streaky<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.000> look

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
bit streaky because that is the look

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.920 
bit streaky because that is the look
that<00:02:33.480> I'm<00:02:34.380> actually<00:02:34.650> going<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:38.570> now<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.630> can

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
that I'm actually going for now you can

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.720 
that I'm actually going for now you can
see<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.350> blended<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.160> first<00:02:41.459> initial

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
see that that blended my first initial

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
see that that blended my first initial
color<00:02:42.120> line<00:02:42.390> quite<00:02:42.690> well<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.140> I'm<00:02:43.290> going<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
color line quite well but I'm going to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.360 
color line quite well but I'm going to
need<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.769> come<00:02:44.100> with<00:02:44.280> my<00:02:44.519> e43<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.320> blend<00:02:46.709> that

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
need to come with my e43 to blend that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:07.670 
need to come with my e43 to blend that
really<00:02:47.910> dark<00:02:48.630> line<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.440> had<00:02:49.850> colored

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.149 

and<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.549> come<00:03:08.849> back<00:03:08.879> with<00:03:09.299> your<00:03:09.480> e<00:03:09.950> 40<00:03:10.950> and

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
and then come back with your e 40 and

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:25.170 
and then come back with your e 40 and
just<00:03:12.120> color

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.569 

and<00:03:25.420> at<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.079> point<00:03:26.379> you<00:03:26.530> can<00:03:26.799> now<00:03:27.010> go<00:03:27.280> right

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
and at this point you can now go right

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:34.440 
and at this point you can now go right
to<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.909> edge<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:33.519> will<00:03:33.760> end<00:03:33.790> up<00:03:34.150> being

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
to the edge and that will end up being

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.770 
to the edge and that will end up being
your<00:03:34.959> lightest<00:03:35.439> shade<00:03:35.469> of<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.129> of<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:37.120> e-40

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
your lightest shade of the of the e-40

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.690 
your lightest shade of the of the e-40
because<00:03:37.959> everything<00:03:38.409> else<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:38.950> gone

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
because everything else you have gone

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.750 
because everything else you have gone
over<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> couple<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.629> times<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:42.189> this<00:03:42.459> very

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
over a couple of times and so this very

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.170 
over a couple of times and so this very
edge<00:03:43.030> will<00:03:43.450> be<00:03:43.569> your<00:03:43.780> latest<00:03:44.280> point<00:03:47.819> now<00:03:48.819> what

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
edge will be your latest point now what

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.140 
edge will be your latest point now what
a<00:03:49.209> fun<00:03:49.450> thing<00:03:49.689> that<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:49.870> want<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.319> do<00:03:50.500> today<00:03:50.739> is

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
a fun thing that I want to do today is

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.789 
a fun thing that I want to do today is
use<00:03:52.150> your<00:03:52.180> blender<00:03:52.750> solution<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.409> you<00:03:53.439> have

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
use your blender solution that you have

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.559 
use your blender solution that you have
if<00:03:54.129> you've<00:03:54.579> got<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> big<00:03:55.000> bottle<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.389> this

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
if you've got a big bottle of this

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.020 
if you've got a big bottle of this
that's<00:03:55.840> great<00:03:56.230> put<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:56.980> little<00:03:57.189> bit<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.639> in<00:03:57.909> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
that's great put a little bit of it in a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.330 
that's great put a little bit of it in a
spritzer<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:59.290> always<00:03:59.439> label<00:03:59.919> my<00:04:00.040> spritzer

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
spritzer and I always label my spritzer

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.490 
spritzer and I always label my spritzer
can<00:04:00.700> because<00:04:01.150> I'll<00:04:01.480> get<00:04:01.780> confused<00:04:02.319> between

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
can because I'll get confused between

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.429 
can because I'll get confused between
water<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.189> blending<00:04:03.939> solution<00:04:04.319> then<00:04:05.319> I'm

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
water and blending solution then I'm

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.440 
water and blending solution then I'm
going<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.620> take<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.889> background<00:04:06.489> stamp<00:04:06.849> stamp

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
going to take a background stamp stamp

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.479 
going to take a background stamp stamp
i'm<00:04:07.750> going<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:07.989> use<00:04:08.439> cornish's<00:04:09.129> we've

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
i'm going to use cornish's we've

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.250 
i'm going to use cornish's we've
backgrounder<00:04:10.269> because<00:04:10.450> i<00:04:10.510> thought<00:04:10.719> it<00:04:10.780> looked

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
backgrounder because i thought it looked

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.469 
backgrounder because i thought it looked
had<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.159> most<00:04:12.310> canvas<00:04:13.000> looking<00:04:15.180> look<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.329> it

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
had the most canvas looking look to it

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.270 
had the most canvas looking look to it
so<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:17.109> thought<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.739> would<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:17.919> great

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
so I thought that that would be great

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.390 
so I thought that that would be great

do is you can see my background ER is

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.700 
do is you can see my background ER is

and<00:04:56.629> when<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:56.930> lift<00:04:57.139> your<00:04:57.289> stamp<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.979> can<00:04:58.189> see

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
and when you lift your stamp you can see

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.270 
and when you lift your stamp you can see
that<00:04:58.759> you've<00:04:59.360> got<00:04:59.629> that<00:04:59.930> weave<00:05:00.439> pattern<00:05:01.069> all

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.219 
that you've got that weave pattern all
throughout<00:05:01.340> your<00:05:02.090> sale<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:02.780> it<00:05:02.960> looks<00:05:03.139> like
