00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
considering it's almost over that means

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
considering it's almost over that means
i<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.530> lot<00:01:22.799> more<00:01:22.979> free<00:01:23.220> time<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.580> do

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
i will have a lot more free time to do

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
like this is what happened my previous

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.259 
like this is what happened my previous
computer<00:04:12.400> crapped<00:04:12.640> out<00:04:12.790> just<00:04:13.060> eventually

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
computer crapped out just eventually

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.979 
computer crapped out just eventually
over<00:04:13.720> time<00:04:13.750> started<00:04:14.620> Wendling<00:04:15.100> down<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.989> so

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
over time started Wendling down and so

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.390 
over time started Wendling down and so
to<00:04:17.049> gain<00:04:17.229> slower<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.829> slower<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.250> slower

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
to gain slower and slower and slower

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.310 
to gain slower and slower and slower
it's<00:04:18.700> not<00:04:18.820> like<00:04:18.910> virus<00:04:19.329> or<00:04:19.479> anything<00:04:19.810> it's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
it's not like virus or anything it's

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.110 
it's not like virus or anything it's
just<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.739> physical<00:04:20.950> memory<00:04:21.430> which<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.849> know<00:04:21.909> is

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
just the physical memory which I know is

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.909 
just the physical memory which I know is
the<00:04:22.240> ram<00:04:22.450> I'm<00:04:22.810> not<00:04:22.990> gonna<00:04:23.110> get<00:04:23.260> into<00:04:23.320> all<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
the ram I'm not gonna get into all the

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.230 
the ram I'm not gonna get into all the
details<00:04:24.250> but<00:04:24.310> it's<00:04:24.610> starting<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.909> crap<00:04:25.060> out

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
details but it's starting to crap out

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.600 
details but it's starting to crap out
I'll<00:04:25.390> just

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
I'll just

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.580 
I'll just
with<00:04:25.849> that<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.509> so<00:04:26.990> that<00:04:27.080> might<00:04:27.229> be<00:04:27.259> a<00:04:27.379> problem

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
with that and so that might be a problem

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.320 
with that and so that might be a problem
in<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:27.949> future<00:04:28.129> but<00:04:28.729> who<00:04:28.849> knows<00:04:29.030> right<00:04:29.300> now

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
in the future but who knows right now

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.820 
in the future but who knows right now
it's<00:04:29.629> it's<00:04:30.159> working<00:04:31.159> workable<00:04:31.939> usable<00:04:32.830> usable

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it's it's working workable usable usable
