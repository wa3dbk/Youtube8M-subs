00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
sure that all the wet ingredients absorb

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.050 
sure that all the wet ingredients absorb
the<00:02:12.750> dry

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
the dry

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.130 
the dry
this<00:02:15.060> would<00:02:15.210> not<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.540> good<00:02:15.720> time<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.050> the
