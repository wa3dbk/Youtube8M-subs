00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
any anything else other than my

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.960 
any anything else other than my
moisturizer<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.920> don't<00:00:23.460> pat<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.880> in

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.480 
moisturizer so I don't pat it in
completely<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.630> leave<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.220> shows<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
completely I leave it so it shows a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.849 
completely I leave it so it shows a
little<00:00:27.000> bit<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.080> when<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.320> actually<00:00:28.500> go

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
little bit so then when you actually go

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.769 
little bit so then when you actually go
over<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:29.609> foundation<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.449> doesn't

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
over with your foundation it doesn't

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
over with your foundation it doesn't
blend<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.140> completely<00:00:31.650> away<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.669> kind<00:00:32.880> of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
blend it completely away so I'm kind of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700 
blend it completely away so I'm kind of
just<00:00:33.149> quickly<00:00:33.390> dabbing<00:00:33.930> over<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> spots<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
just quickly dabbing over the spots that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.639 
just quickly dabbing over the spots that
I<00:00:34.860> needed<00:00:35.130> any<00:00:35.489> sort<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.790> acne<00:00:36.270> scars

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
I needed any sort of acne scars

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.959 
I needed any sort of acne scars
definitely<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> redness<00:00:38.100> around<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.520> nose<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
think that's definitely one of the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.270

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
dab dab dab and then after this stuff I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.490 
dab dab dab and then after this stuff I
can<00:00:47.219> actually<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.640> ahead<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.910> put<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.210> my

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500

can actually go ahead and put on my
foundation<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.039> time<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> am<00:00:50.730> using<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> BB

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
bit more interest just because the shade

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.780

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790

of the brown so I'm going to smudge this
a<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> lower<00:02:03.659> lash<00:02:03.990> line<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
a little bit on the lower lash line and

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.520 
a little bit on the lower lash line and

powder<00:03:05.099> pencil<00:03:05.670> though<00:03:05.819> it's<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.090> waxy<00:03:06.750> like

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
powder pencil though it's not waxy like

powder pencil though it's not waxy like
an<00:03:07.049> eyeliner<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:08.190> almost<00:03:08.340> puts<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
an eyeliner so it almost puts on like a

kind of golden brown color and so it

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.580 
kind of golden brown color and so it
brings<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.150> green<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.810> at<00:03:15.959> first<00:03:16.170> color

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
brings out the green and at first color

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.440 
brings out the green and at first color
I<00:03:16.680> think<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.129> complementary<00:03:17.730> for<00:03:18.120> hazel

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
I think it's complementary for hazel

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.479 
I think it's complementary for hazel
eyes<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:19.019> then<00:03:19.530> there's<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.739> brush<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.370> I'll

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
eyes and then there's a brush that I'll

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.360 
eyes and then there's a brush that I'll
just<00:03:20.700> brush<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.940> out<00:03:21.180> with<00:03:21.419> this<00:03:22.139> is<00:03:22.470> max<00:03:23.040> black

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
just brush it out with this is max black

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.159 
just brush it out with this is max black
fluid<00:03:23.940> line<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.480> take<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> tiny<00:03:24.959> little

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
fluid line and I take a tiny little

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.720 
fluid line and I take a tiny little
brush<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.680> put<00:03:25.889> that<00:03:25.919> on<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.310> tight<00:03:26.519> line

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
brush and I put that on the tight line

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.680 
brush and I put that on the tight line
there<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:28.340> think<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.459> really<00:03:29.609> just<00:03:29.880> thickens<00:03:30.569> up

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
there I think it really just thickens up

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.750 
there I think it really just thickens up
your<00:03:30.870> eyelashes<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.889> then<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.700> outside

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
your eyelashes and then on the outside

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.849 
your eyelashes and then on the outside
edges<00:03:33.299> i'll<00:03:33.750> go<00:03:33.930> ahead<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.139> actually<00:03:34.440> put<00:03:34.799> it

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
edges i'll go ahead and actually put it

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.250 
edges i'll go ahead and actually put it
on<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.220> lash<00:03:35.400> line<00:03:35.669> as<00:03:35.849> well<00:03:36.090> try<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> work<00:03:37.109> it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
on the lash line as well try to work it

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.020 
on the lash line as well try to work it
in<00:03:37.410> as<00:03:37.590> closely<00:03:37.859> as<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.430> sense<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.819> little

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
in as closely as I can sense a little

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.680 
in as closely as I can sense a little
bit<00:03:39.120> more<00:03:39.239> natural<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:41.069> lore'l<00:03:41.690> mascara

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
bit more natural this is lore'l mascara

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.000 
bit more natural this is lore'l mascara
I<00:03:42.930> think<00:03:43.169> it's<00:03:43.290> called<00:03:43.470> million<00:03:43.859> lashes

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
lashes pretty stiff and that's kind of

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.180 
lashes pretty stiff and that's kind of
frustrating<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:54.930> me<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.709> want<00:03:55.889> to<00:03:55.980> tug
