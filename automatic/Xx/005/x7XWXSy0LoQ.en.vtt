application for all the major mobile
operating<00:00:58.620> systems<00:00:59.129> first<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
operating systems first I'm going to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
operating systems first I'm going to
start<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> application<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.559> phone<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
start the application on my phone and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.470 
start the application on my phone and
then<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.520> you'd<00:01:02.670> expect<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.239> need<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
then as you'd expect I need to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.329 
then as you'd expect I need to
authenticate<00:01:03.930> myself<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.860> case<00:01:05.070> we're

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
authenticate myself in this case we're

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.969 
authenticate myself in this case we're
going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.610> use<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> pin<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.920> now<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
going to use a pin and now the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
going to use a pin and now the
application<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.939> walk<00:01:09.210> me<00:01:09.240> through<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
application will walk me through the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
application will walk me through the
setup<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> choose<00:01:11.700> which

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
setup so I'm going to choose which

going to hit the Scan button it will

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
going to hit the Scan button it will
open<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> camera<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.509> my<00:01:21.630> phone<00:01:21.659> they'll

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
open up the camera on my phone they'll

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.020 
open up the camera on my phone they'll

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
take it to scan the 2d barcode and that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.190 
take it to scan the 2d barcode and that
will<00:01:27.150> initiate<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> transaction<00:01:30.079> once<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
will initiate the transaction once the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
will initiate the transaction once the
transaction<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.829> completed<00:01:32.220> my<00:01:32.520> mobile

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
transaction is completed my mobile

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520 
transaction is completed my mobile
application<00:01:33.390> automatically<00:01:34.049> updates<00:01:34.380> with

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
application automatically updates with

application automatically updates with
the<00:01:34.560> confirmation<00:01:34.979> an<00:01:35.579> electronic<00:01:36.240> receipt

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the confirmation an electronic receipt

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899 
the confirmation an electronic receipt
of<00:01:36.810> my<00:01:36.960> transaction<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.729> I've

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
of my transaction so that's it I've

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
of my transaction so that's it I've
completed<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.630> ATM<00:01:39.990> withdrawal<00:01:40.170> using<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
completed an ATM withdrawal using the

completed an ATM withdrawal using the
mobile<00:01:41.460> phone<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.750> a
