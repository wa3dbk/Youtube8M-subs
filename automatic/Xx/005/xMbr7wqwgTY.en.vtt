00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.340 
really clean the inside of the spout
around<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> base<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> faucet<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
around the base of the faucet here and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.549 
around the base of the faucet here and
everything<00:00:53.340> else<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.910> very<00:00:54.210> well

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
everything else you see very well

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.119 
everything else you see very well
especially<00:00:55.559> if<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:55.920> hard<00:00:56.100> water

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
especially if you have hard water

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
especially if you have hard water
because<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:56.850> deposits<00:00:57.180> from<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> hard

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
because those deposits from the hard

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.250 
because those deposits from the hard
water<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:59.000> braid<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.210> these<00:01:00.390> o-rings<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
water will braid on these o-rings and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.520 
water will braid on these o-rings and
make<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.390> thick<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.420> tear<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.140> make<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
make it thick and tear up and make it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
make it thick and tear up and make it
leak<00:01:04.650> again<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
leak again so that's what I'm going to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.950 
leak again so that's what I'm going to
do<00:01:06.830> alright<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> new<00:01:09.510> ring<00:01:09.720> or

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
do alright so I put the new ring or

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.870 
do alright so I put the new ring or
rings<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.439> from<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> kit<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.790> an

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
rings on from the kit and this is an

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.630 
rings on from the kit and this is an
extra<00:01:12.240> simplicity<00:01:12.840> its<00:01:12.990> motion<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.530> two<00:01:14.460> ones

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
extra simplicity its motion so two ones

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
extra simplicity its motion so two ones
on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> top<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> premisis<00:01:15.630> ain't<00:01:15.869> either<00:01:16.140> same

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
on the top of premisis ain't either same

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.600 
on the top of premisis ain't either same
o-ring<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.189> two<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.400> them<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
o-ring so there's two of them and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.670 
o-ring so there's two of them and
identical

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
identical

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.280 
identical
and<00:01:19.130> it'd<00:01:19.250> take<00:01:19.430> more<00:01:19.670> grease<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:21.050> already

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
and it'd take more grease and I already

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.930 
and it'd take more grease and I already
greased<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.620> arms<00:01:21.800> I<00:01:21.890> put<00:01:22.040> them<00:01:22.130> on<00:01:22.220> even<00:01:22.910> more

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
greased the arms I put them on even more

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.040 
greased the arms I put them on even more
grease<00:01:23.390> on<00:01:23.630> them<00:01:23.810> now<00:01:24.670> because<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.060> is<00:01:26.270> what

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
grease on them now because this is what

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.900 
grease on them now because this is what
makes<00:01:27.230> them<00:01:27.470> last<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:28.100> don't<00:01:28.250> grease<00:01:28.550> them

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
makes them last you don't grease them

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.640 
makes them last you don't grease them
now<00:01:29.600> last<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.140> grease<00:01:30.320> helps<00:01:30.620> repel<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.390> the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
now last the grease helps repel the the

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.110 
now last the grease helps repel the the
hard<00:01:33.650> water<00:01:33.860> deposits<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.610> helps<00:01:34.910> lubricate

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
hard water deposits that helps lubricate

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.880 
hard water deposits that helps lubricate
the<00:01:35.690> joint<00:01:36.050> here<00:01:36.230> no<00:01:36.410> we're<00:01:36.530> about<00:01:36.650> getting

here<00:01:48.620> stays<00:01:49.930> moving<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.170> doesn't<00:01:51.470> stick<00:01:51.830> even

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
here stays moving and doesn't stick even

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.280 
here stays moving and doesn't stick even
on<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.940> threads<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.570> retaining<00:01:54.170> that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
on the threads of the retaining that

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.620 
on the threads of the retaining that
keeps<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.430> from<00:01:55.460> seizing<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.150> getting<00:01:56.360> stuck

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
keeps it from seizing and getting stuck

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.300 
keeps it from seizing and getting stuck
because<00:01:56.780> really<00:01:56.990> that's<00:01:57.170> what<00:01:57.590> happens<00:01:58.160> if

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
because really that's what happens if

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.910 
because really that's what happens if
they<00:01:58.490> sit<00:01:58.730> around<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.180> know<00:01:59.590> who<00:02:00.590> knows<00:02:00.710> how

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
they sit around you know who knows how

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.900 
they sit around you know who knows how
long<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.430> they<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:02.480> frosting<00:02:03.080> seizes<00:02:03.470> up

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
long and they have frosting seizes up

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.740 
long and they have frosting seizes up
all<00:02:04.910> right<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.270> now<00:02:05.390> we're<00:02:05.480> to<00:02:05.570> put<00:02:05.660> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
all right so now we're to put the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.750 
all right so now we're to put the
spit-up<00:02:05.990> back<00:02:06.230> on<00:02:06.470> i've<00:02:06.680> lubricated<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
spit-up back on i've lubricated the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.270 
spit-up back on i've lubricated the
inside<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.500> we're<00:02:09.710> going<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.980> slip<00:02:10.160> it

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
inside of it and we're going to slip it

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.980 
inside of it and we're going to slip it
down<00:02:10.310> over<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.120> wiggle<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.510> back<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:11.750> forth

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
down over and wiggle it back and forth

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.130 
down over and wiggle it back and forth
until<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.800> slips<00:02:13.040> down<00:02:13.310> over<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> o-rings<00:02:14.140> and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
until it slips down over the o-rings and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.590 
until it slips down over the o-rings and
those<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.620> turns<00:02:16.520> very<00:02:16.670> nicely<00:02:17.000> nice<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> little

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
those it turns very nicely nice a little

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.220 
those it turns very nicely nice a little
stiff<00:02:17.960> like<00:02:18.140> they<00:02:18.320> get<00:02:18.530> after<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:19.040> while<00:02:20.230> so

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
stiff like they get after a while so

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.380 
stiff like they get after a while so
it's<00:02:21.350> an<00:02:21.410> easy<00:02:21.560> way<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.740> work<00:02:21.950> on<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:23.239> next

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's an easy way to work on that so next

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.330 
it's an easy way to work on that so next
one<00:02:23.600> put<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.870> o-ring<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.410> retaining<00:02:25.220> nut

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
one put the o-ring the retaining nut

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.790 
one put the o-ring the retaining nut
back<00:02:25.850> on<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:27.040> we'll<00:02:28.040> put<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> handle<00:02:28.700> bit

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
back on and we'll put the handle bit

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.880 
back on and we'll put the handle bit
sorry<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.860> put<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.250> nut<00:02:31.459> back<00:02:31.489> on<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:33.590> doesn't

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
have to be too tight it just keeps the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.600 
have to be too tight it just keeps the
the<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:38.060> spout<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.230> doesn't<00:02:39.410> really<00:02:39.739> hold

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the the spout on it doesn't really hold

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.699 
the the spout on it doesn't really hold
any<00:02:40.850> water<00:02:41.060> pewter<00:02:41.540> doesn't<00:02:41.840> hold<00:02:41.989> against

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
any water pewter doesn't hold against

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.229 
any water pewter doesn't hold against
full<00:02:43.220> water<00:02:43.459> pressure<00:02:43.700> all<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.880> time<00:02:43.940> only

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
full water pressure all the time only

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.229 
full water pressure all the time only
when<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.660> faucets<00:02:45.290> running<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:47.090> just

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
when the faucets running so it's just

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.670 
when the faucets running so it's just
more<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.540> retainer<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.050> keep<00:02:48.230> everything<00:02:48.500> in

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
more of a retainer to keep everything in

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.280 
more of a retainer to keep everything in
place<00:02:48.920> than<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.730> actually<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:51.200> know

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
place than it is to actually you know

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.470 
place than it is to actually you know
make<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.470> waterproof<00:02:52.100> seal<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.239> don't<00:02:53.390> have

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
make a waterproof seal so you don't have

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.940 
make a waterproof seal so you don't have
to<00:02:53.660> well<00:02:53.810> on<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.020> stand<00:02:54.350> just<00:02:54.410> like<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.650> Snug<00:02:54.920> it

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
to well on a stand just like to Snug it

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.590 
to well on a stand just like to Snug it
up<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.190> little<00:02:55.370> bit<00:02:55.580> using<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.970> rag<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
up a little bit using the rag and the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.150 
up a little bit using the rag and the
pliers<00:02:56.840> just<00:02:56.989> like<00:02:57.290> how<00:02:57.410> we<00:02:57.470> took<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.800> off

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
pliers just like how we took it off

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.280 
pliers just like how we took it off
all<00:02:58.760> right<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.180> tighten<00:02:59.570> up<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.720> nut<00:02:59.900> now<00:03:00.110> this

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
all right so tighten up the nut now this

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.750 
all right so tighten up the nut now this
is<00:03:00.410> probably<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.739> last<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.070> trickiest<00:03:01.459> part

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
is probably the last and trickiest part

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.699 
is probably the last and trickiest part
of<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:01.880> entire<00:03:02.060> job<00:03:02.450> he<00:03:03.019> is<00:03:03.140> super<00:03:03.410> handle

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
of this entire job he is super handle

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.150 
of this entire job he is super handle
back<00:03:03.860> now<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.730> sounds<00:03:05.030> simple<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:06.290> he's<00:03:07.040> just

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
back now it sounds simple so he's just

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.890 
back now it sounds simple so he's just
want<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.430> get<00:03:07.519> this<00:03:07.640> started<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.300> too

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
want to get this started is too

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.240 
want to get this started is too
to<00:03:09.079> handle<00:03:09.500> all<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.950> way<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
to handle all the way so that the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.979 
to handle all the way so that the
actuator<00:03:13.250> inside<00:03:13.489> comes<00:03:14.150> all<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.599> way<00:03:14.629> out<00:03:14.720> at

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
actuator inside comes all the way out at

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.660 
actuator inside comes all the way out at
the<00:03:15.079> top<00:03:15.319> it's<00:03:15.829> basically<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.280> squeeze<00:03:16.549> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
the top it's basically to squeeze the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.240 
the top it's basically to squeeze the
handle<00:03:16.909> to<00:03:17.000> flip<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.269> full<00:03:17.510> up<00:03:17.629> position<00:03:18.250> now

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
handle to flip a full up position now

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.460 
handle to flip a full up position now
note<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.909> position<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.930> cartridge<00:03:21.349> are

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
note the position of the cartridge are

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.720 
note the position of the cartridge are

trying to be perfectly centered our
minds<00:03:22.909> a<00:03:23.000> little<00:03:23.060> off<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.569> left<00:03:24.189> so<00:03:25.390> you're

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
minds a little off to the left so you're

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.970 
minds a little off to the left so you're
going<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.569> put<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:27.140> by<00:03:27.470> tilting<00:03:27.739> it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
going to put this on by tilting it

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.770 
going to put this on by tilting it
backwards<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.609> then<00:03:28.700> dragging<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.359> over<00:03:29.629> the

top<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.200> faucet<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.489> can<00:03:31.640> look

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
top of the faucet and you can look

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.000

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
it down if you do this right it will go

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.030 
it down if you do this right it will go
all<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.099> way<00:03:37.129> down<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.090> handle<00:03:38.510> will<00:03:38.659> be

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
all the way down and the handle will be

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.500 
all the way down and the handle will be
functional<00:03:40.040> with<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.430> faucet<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.150> won't<00:03:41.329> be

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
functional with the faucet it won't be

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.110 
functional with the faucet it won't be
sitting<00:03:42.349> on<00:03:42.440> top<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:43.549> if<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.730> try<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:43.940> pick

sitting on top like if you try to pick

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.690 
sitting on top like if you try to pick
this<00:03:44.299> up<00:03:44.629> the<00:03:44.989> handle<00:03:45.530> will<00:03:45.680> move<00:03:45.920> right<00:03:46.220> now

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
this up the handle will move right now

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.390 
this up the handle will move right now
it<00:03:46.879> won't<00:03:47.030> be<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.599> stationary<00:03:48.139> because<00:03:49.129> if

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
it won't be just stationary because if

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.830 
it won't be just stationary because if
you<00:03:49.489> don't<00:03:49.670> have<00:03:49.849> it<00:03:50.000> on<00:03:50.090> right<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.510> handle

parts and I will turn the water on
and<00:05:14.479> we'll<00:05:15.050> test<00:05:15.320> this<00:05:15.500> out<00:05:15.680> all<00:05:15.890> right<00:05:15.979> now

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
and we'll test this out all right now

water<00:05:16.580> is<00:05:16.700> back<00:05:16.880> on<00:05:17.150> so<00:05:17.630> don't<00:05:18.200> open<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.530> too

water is back on so don't open this too
much<00:05:18.919> at<00:05:19.130> first<00:05:19.340> because<00:05:19.640> it's<00:05:19.940> probably<00:05:20.060> a

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
much at first because it's probably a

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.909
