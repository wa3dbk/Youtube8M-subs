00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello excuse the voice yet a bar 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.339
 some 5 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.140
 in this video I want to show you the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.510
 products that I use for the care of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.460
 my hair this period then in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.099
 spring early summer 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.230
 we leave immediately with the ios shampoo 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.490
 using this good shampoo 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.740
 so what is called shampoo maybe chi air 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.019
 so it makes the hair silky is one 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.560
 shampoo that I think is fine a bit up 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.460
 all hair types are 150 ml 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.930
 of product costs 399 then in my opinion 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.680
 the value for money really 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 great when you spread your hair ha 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 a scent that looks a lot like 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 launch therefore even perfumed to that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.809
 orange 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.600
 but if you then apply the maximum this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.469
 perfume is completely covered by the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.480
 Balsam perfume is a product that a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.670
 I like it so much because it really makes i 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.879
 very soft hair not dry like 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.129
 they do so much shampoo and hair 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.589
 those days really go unpunished 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.659
 I really feel that he cleans them very much 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.600
 well among other things it is one of the few shampoos 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 eco bio that makes a lot of foam then 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.430
 a product is also of little use but 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.640
 really little coconut to have a lot of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 foam on your hair so this is it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.430
 a product that I am using from a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.190
 some time with which I found myself 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.020
 really well e 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.940
 this is perfect for my hair 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 because it makes it just as good as you like it 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.120
 to me the other product instead of the use 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.810
 the palm and this is extreme of the 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.540
 bioearth hair regenerating balm 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.830
 dried and lifeless treated then goes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 well for more hair types I don't think 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.850
 for the fat ones though if you have 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 used greasy and vi hair events 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.260
 in fact you are well human 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.800
 to know this practically at 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.500
 shampoo with rivera butter choice of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.910
 shea jojoba oil and the extract of 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.050
 chamomile 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.630
 apart from the fact that it has a scent 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.420
 very good really good vinegar 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.600
 those very very soft and very 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.140
 creamy spreads really well on the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.660
 hair and hair remain 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.240
 very fragrant and very soft silky 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.550
 just known that it should untangle the knots 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.890
 so it's something I really like 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.830
 very much and I am very appreciative 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.209
 this balm costs me around 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.220
 in 10 11 euros 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.220
 however it is one of the best balm that 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.870
 have ever found so I recommend you 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.380
 try it in fact I tell you what is there 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.640
 written there is written a rich option 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.970
 nourishing restructuring to see if 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.489
 you weary and or treated used 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.459
 regularly makes strong hair healthy 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.980
 and bright indeed it is known that with this 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.140
 combination then this shampoo in 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.880
 this valls i love my hair is 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.790
 much stronger 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.660
 I always lose a lot less than I do 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.610
 certain periods of the year in which 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.280
 clearly we talk about it more though 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.550
 than last year known who it 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.430
 I lose a lot much less and hair then 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.700
 in the most beautiful most beautiful stronger videos 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.820
 long for more days and I like it 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.540
 just the effect of these two products 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.490
 put together in short is also alone 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.010
 combined with other products in my opinion 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.950
 both shampoo and conditioner are two 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.170
 really great products then once 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.080
 the week and I'm making an impact e 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.630
 base of shea butter and there is the rivera 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.430
 and I made the video of this mask 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.370
 some time ago then here for some 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.320
 part I put the link on which 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.880
 click to go see the video 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.660
 that little man also in the information box 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.000
 below the video it's very easy to do 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.490
 why blend a little shea butter 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.090
 along with some real cell two 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:05.050
 blend all created a kind of cream 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.180
 mounted so we say that then we go to 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.970
 spread on the hair for half an hour 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.370
 hair can be both mobile and 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.320
 dry a half is left in place 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.510
 network then leave you all what 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.170
 applied shampoo and conditioner like 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.750
 the habit 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.240
 I this lactic mask once 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.450
 a week and still known that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.640
 my hair doesn't have that much 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.390
 in short, I need nourishment once 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.840
 per week 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.090

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.530
