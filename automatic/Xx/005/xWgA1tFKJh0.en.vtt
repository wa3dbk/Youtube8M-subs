00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
about this far from my mouth I think

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.770 
about this far from my mouth I think
that's<00:02:19.290> about<00:02:19.410> six<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.310> eight<00:02:20.460> inches<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.600> is

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
that's about six to eight inches this is

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.050 
that's about six to eight inches this is
a<00:02:21.810> great<00:02:22.260> distance<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.160> have<00:02:23.490> if<00:02:23.880> you're<00:02:24.030> going

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
a great distance to have if you're going

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.590 
a great distance to have if you're going
to<00:02:24.390> record<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:25.590> vocals<00:02:26.390> separately<00:02:27.390> from

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
to record your vocals separately from

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.740 
to record your vocals separately from
your<00:02:27.870> guitar<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> guitar

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
your guitar and if you have a guitar

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.300 
your guitar and if you have a guitar
that<00:02:30.780> you're<00:02:31.380> playing<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.890> you're<00:02:31.980> recording

that you're playing and you're recording
with<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.880> suggest<00:02:33.630> putting<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.500> depending<00:02:35.040> on

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
with I suggest putting it depending on

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.949 
with I suggest putting it depending on
the<00:02:35.580> style<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.090> you're<00:02:36.270> playing<00:02:36.540> depending

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the style that you're playing depending

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.690 
the style that you're playing depending
on<00:02:37.020> how<00:02:37.170> loud<00:02:37.440> you're<00:02:37.740> playing<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.520> might

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
on how loud you're playing you might

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.790 
on how loud you're playing you might
want<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.030> put<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.300> about<00:02:39.540> six<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.530> twelve

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
want to put it about six to twelve

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.850 
want to put it about six to twelve
inches<00:02:41.010> from<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.209> twelfth<00:02:42.810> fret<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.830> your

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
inches from the twelfth fret of your

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.670 
inches from the twelfth fret of your
guitar<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:45.300> right<00:02:45.630> here<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.320> then

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
guitar so about right here and then

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.550 
guitar so about right here and then
you're<00:02:46.800> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.280> want<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:48.410> tilt<00:02:49.410> your

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you're going to want to tilt your

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.220 
you're going to want to tilt your
microphone<00:02:50.310> towards<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.209> sound<00:02:51.540> hole<00:02:51.930> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
microphone towards the sound hole of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.720 
microphone towards the sound hole of
your<00:02:52.380> guitar<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:53.370> pick<00:02:53.610> up<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:55.730> full

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
your guitar to pick up the the full

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.060 
your guitar to pick up the the full
effect<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.330> guess<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.530> noise<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.739> you're

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
effect I guess of the noise that you're

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.050 
effect I guess of the noise that you're
making<00:02:59.989> on<00:03:00.989> your<00:03:01.050> guitar<00:03:01.520> that's<00:03:02.520> what<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.730> do

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
making on your guitar that's what I do

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.150 
making on your guitar that's what I do
and<00:03:03.360> there's<00:03:04.260> there's<00:03:04.680> different<00:03:05.070> methods

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
and there's there's different methods

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760 
and there's there's different methods
different<00:03:05.820> ways<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.239> do<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.450> but<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.410> video

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
different ways to do it but this video

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.460 
different ways to do it but this video
is<00:03:07.860> all<00:03:08.010> about<00:03:08.040> how<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.430> do<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:10.020> hopefully

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
is all about how I do it so so hopefully

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.740 
is all about how I do it so so hopefully
that<00:03:10.650> brings<00:03:10.950> some<00:03:11.160> clarity<00:03:11.700> as<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:11.880> how<00:03:12.720> I

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that brings some clarity as to how I

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.880 
that brings some clarity as to how I
record<00:03:13.520> in<00:03:14.520> positioning<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.299> microphone

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
record in positioning the microphone

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.470 
record in positioning the microphone
this<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.220> guitar<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.580> I'm<00:03:17.910> using<00:03:18.209> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
this is the guitar that I'm using the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.060 
this is the guitar that I'm using the
one<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.810> I'm<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.230> I'm<00:03:19.260> holding<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
one that I'm that I'm holding it's a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.750 
one that I'm that I'm holding it's a
Taylor<00:03:20.900> grand<00:03:21.900> symphony<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.549> body

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
Taylor grand symphony that's the body

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.210 
Taylor grand symphony that's the body
style<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.600> think<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.110> can<00:03:25.290> hopefully<00:03:25.590> see<00:03:26.010> that

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
style I think you can hopefully see that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.300 
style I think you can hopefully see that
and<00:03:26.580> that's<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.570> 600<00:03:28.200> series<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.920> beautiful

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
and that's a 600 series it's a beautiful

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.699 
and that's a 600 series it's a beautiful
guitar<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.820> plays<00:03:30.090> really<00:03:30.120> well<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.320> got

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
guitar and plays really well I just got

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.490 
guitar and plays really well I just got
this<00:03:31.950> less<00:03:32.340> than<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.670> year<00:03:32.940> ago<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:34.290> was<00:03:34.410> an

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
this less than a year ago and it was an

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.039 
this less than a year ago and it was an
expensive<00:03:35.010> guitar<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> great<00:03:36.480> guitar<00:03:36.810> that

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
expensive guitar but a great guitar that

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.930 
expensive guitar but a great guitar that
I'll<00:03:37.170> probably<00:03:37.410> hopefully<00:03:38.130> have<00:03:38.519> for<00:03:38.820> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940

separate tracks and what that allows me

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.170 
separate tracks and what that allows me
to<00:04:17.190> do<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.760> mix<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.930> master<00:04:19.620> my<00:04:20.220> songs<00:04:20.669> and
