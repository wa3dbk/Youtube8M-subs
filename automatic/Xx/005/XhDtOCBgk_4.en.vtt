00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
regular right so this part isn't that

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.170 
regular right so this part isn't that
fast<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.190> doesn't<00:01:06.460> have<00:01:06.580> that<00:01:06.700> much<00:01:06.880> torque

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
fast and doesn't have that much torque

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.100

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.080 

okay<00:01:11.830> so<00:01:11.890> some<00:01:12.130> of<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.280> cons<00:01:12.550> in<00:01:12.760> this<00:01:12.880> car<00:01:13.060> is

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
that since the hatchback it kind of

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.440 
that since the hatchback it kind of
limits<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.340> space<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.880> back<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.240> car
