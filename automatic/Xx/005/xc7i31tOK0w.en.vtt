the<00:03:20.440> symbolism<00:03:21.100> before<00:03:21.459> shadowing<00:03:21.970> I<00:03:22.180> think

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
the symbolism before shadowing I think

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.390 
the symbolism before shadowing I think
watching<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.050> movie<00:03:23.380> beforehand<00:03:24.070> kind<00:03:24.310> of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
watching the movie beforehand kind of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.449 
watching the movie beforehand kind of
help<00:03:24.610> that<00:03:24.970> but<00:03:25.720> very<00:03:26.110> well<00:03:26.380> done<00:03:26.440> very<00:03:26.680> smart

help that but very well done very smart

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.729 
help that but very well done very smart
I<00:03:27.730> think<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.330> next<00:03:28.510> deadly<00:03:28.900> sin<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.350> less

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
I think so the next deadly sin is less

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.340 
I think so the next deadly sin is less
