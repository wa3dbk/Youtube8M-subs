00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.090
 what I saw the idea of reads that to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.029
 every time to be able to have a vision 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 complementary in various fields so 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.060
 the economic agronomic domain 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.980
 scientist and landscapers so the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.250
 different stakeholders bring this 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 look at this look at the participants on a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.870
 same theme so the forest landscape 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.640
 today a priori everything tells us 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.950
 that on saint goussaud there was very 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.140
 little forest was all grown and at 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 twentieth century when the railroad is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.329
 arrived there were whole trains that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.870
 went with vegetables 2 5 inches to 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.280
 carrots 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.949
 that you wish famous for 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.949
 carrots and for cereals 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.000
 laugh at agriculture that today finally 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.369
 in 1970 we had 19 thousand 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.659
 farmers 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.600
 nineteen thousand farmers who had 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.530
 on average 19 hectares today 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.280
 we have four thousand five hundred 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.259
 farmers but the average of a 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.729
 part of a farm its 104 hectares in 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.619
 digs but today we find ourselves 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.360
 with peasants who of course have the 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.100
 Hollow that have surfaces on fire 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.780
 the u19 peasants on the village 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.069
 today at 0 peasants the land 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.940
 are still exploited but the seats 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.940
 operating at the popular 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.640
 we have about 50 thousand hectares of 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.510
 resinous 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.620
 so there remains 100 thousand hectares of 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.090
 hardwood on its hundred thousand hectares 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.150
 leaf it is estimated that she was twenty 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.940
 thousand who have always existed right at 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.010
 left so you have 90 hectare is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.500
 Africa actually balboa the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.060
 haddock wood so he's really 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.760
 in the economic circuit far in the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.930
 delirium know the game it will be soon 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.820
 Sunday you have one that will move 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.870
 than for 10 hectares and was worth 4 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:22.620
 hectares you will have plants and they 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.400
 will have to fall alone I come 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.350
 of the region of marseille 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.850
 so it's not at all the same region 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.660
 who if I come here to know how to read 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.630
 the landscape because it's a landscape 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.670
 that I have not seen before I can 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.590
 not compare it because to empty the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.400
 different bed much richer 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.209
 much wetter 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.489
 I am interested in plant species in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.739
 evolution that can not be perceived 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.870
 because we are in a time when I am 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.580
 says sell and it's happening in an angle 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.160
 wide etc for including the report 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.920
 between man and nature and nature 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.920
 and the space created by the living 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.920
 finally
