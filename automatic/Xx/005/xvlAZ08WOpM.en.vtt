00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.049
 a little bit slow 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.180
 that's where you can change everything by 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.500

 it's up to these two there I do not know too much there 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.790
 for example in the accessory there is 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.730

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.210
 you put the little arrow if it wants 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.720
 well 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.720

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.260
 it breaks me to have a bur stop 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.090
 to have a sword a little less 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.860
 powerful but since it's all 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.430
 just use madam annette 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.260

 adam in ide for example and 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.320
 the little trick aptitude there you have 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.420

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.110
 there it will become more interesting because 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.819

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.819
 enchantments that you can have 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:07.120
 when you drink a potion for example 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:10.270
 the potion of battles where we play it on 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.220

 even the ofce terraria so I'm going 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.349
 try if it works 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:21.479

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.180
 the terraria videos will stop 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.250
