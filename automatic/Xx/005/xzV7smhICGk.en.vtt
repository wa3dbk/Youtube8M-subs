00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
if you have studied the tutorial for the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
if you have studied the tutorial for the
dog<00:00:37.290> character<00:00:37.980> rigging<00:00:38.190> you'll<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:39.030> familiar

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
dog character rigging you'll be familiar

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.200 
dog character rigging you'll be familiar
with<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.899> character<00:00:40.670> pivot<00:00:41.670> points<00:00:42.090> are

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
with this character pivot points are

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.600 
with this character pivot points are
also<00:00:42.570> set<00:00:42.840> according<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> movements<00:00:44.489> of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
also set according to the movements of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:01:01.369 
also set according to the movements of
the<00:00:44.760> parts

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 

now<00:01:02.039> let<00:01:02.280> us<00:01:02.309> create<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.940> ground<00:01:03.269> for<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
now let us create a ground for the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.380 
now let us create a ground for the
character<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> walk<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.220> name<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> lair

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
character to walk on and name the lair

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.550 
character to walk on and name the lair
ground<00:01:07.110> level<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.009> new<00:01:08.159> layer<00:01:12.320> draw<00:01:13.320> two

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
ground level on the new layer draw two

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.039 
ground level on the new layer draw two
lines<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.130> both<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:14.909> left<00:01:15.360> sided<00:01:15.659> legs

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
lines for both right and left sided legs

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:27.280 
lines for both right and left sided legs
for<00:01:16.560> proper<00:01:16.920> registration<00:01:17.130> while<00:01:18.119> walking

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.760 

we<00:01:27.920> need<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.640> ground<00:01:28.910> levels<00:01:29.390> because<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.590> two

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
we need to ground levels because the two

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.860 
we need to ground levels because the two
legs<00:01:31.040> on<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.460> other<00:01:31.700> side<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.390> character

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
legs on the other side of the character

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.530 
legs on the other side of the character
will<00:01:33.380> appear<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:34.070> be<00:01:34.220> on<00:01:34.400> a<00:01:34.460> slightly<00:01:35.060> higher

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
will appear to be on a slightly higher

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.640 
will appear to be on a slightly higher
ground<00:01:35.870> level<00:01:36.260> to<00:01:36.440> us<00:01:36.940> you'll<00:01:37.940> see<00:01:38.240> why<00:01:38.870> as<00:01:39.200> we

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
ground level to us you'll see why as we

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.580 
ground level to us you'll see why as we
move<00:01:39.890> ahead<00:01:40.040> in<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.580> tutorial<00:01:41.380> log<00:01:42.380> that

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
move ahead in the tutorial log that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.180 
move ahead in the tutorial log that
ground<00:01:43.280> level<00:01:43.670> layer<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.710> very<00:01:45.890> first

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190

we<00:03:17.460> are<00:03:17.550> simply<00:03:17.940> selecting<00:03:18.390> all<00:03:18.630> three<00:03:18.900> parts

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
we are simply selecting all three parts

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.650 
we are simply selecting all three parts
of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> legs<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:19.890> skewing<00:03:20.670> them<00:03:20.850> using<00:03:21.540> the
