so<00:00:09.410> we've<00:00:09.559> been<00:00:09.650> hearing<00:00:10.010> a<00:00:10.130> lot<00:00:10.160> today<00:00:10.490> about

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
so we've been hearing a lot today about

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.249 
so we've been hearing a lot today about
the<00:00:10.849> importance<00:00:11.360> of<00:00:11.419> improving<00:00:11.570> computer
