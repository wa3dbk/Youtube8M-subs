basically<00:00:09.830> on<00:00:10.830> days<00:00:11.130> when<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.370> feel<00:00:11.460> like<00:00:11.910> crap

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
basically on days when I feel like crap

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.660 
basically on days when I feel like crap
I<00:00:12.509> prefer<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.349> go<00:00:13.500> singles<00:00:14.070> because<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.490> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
I prefer to go singles because this is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
I prefer to go singles because this is
easier<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.030> my<00:00:15.179> body<00:00:15.360> than<00:00:15.630> doing<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> rep

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
easier on my body than doing the rep

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.840 
easier on my body than doing the rep
works<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.560> normally<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.730> that's

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
works that I normally do and so that's

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.220 
works that I normally do and so that's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
going to be an opener type weight I feel

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.529 
going to be an opener type weight I feel
like<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.920> definitely<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.489> ten<00:00:53.910> weeks<00:00:54.090> time<00:00:54.360> I'm

like I definitely in ten weeks time I'm
going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.870> pushing<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.289> lot<00:00:55.469> more<00:00:55.680> weight

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
going to be pushing a lot more weight

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.610 
going to be pushing a lot more weight
than<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.160> I'm<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.430> excited<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
than this I'm really excited about that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.860 
than this I'm really excited about that
afterwards<00:00:58.620> dropped<00:00:59.550> down<00:00:59.730> did<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> flat<00:01:00.600> back

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
afterwards dropped down did a flat back

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.369 
afterwards dropped down did a flat back
bench<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:02.070> haven't<00:01:02.640> done<00:01:02.809> 225<00:01:03.809> 4<00:01:04.019> reps<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
bench I haven't done 225 4 reps in a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.399 
bench I haven't done 225 4 reps in a
very<00:01:04.799> long<00:01:05.070> time<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> figured<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
very long time and so I figured be a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.170 
very long time and so I figured be a
like<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.390> set<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.780> 20<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.200> nice

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
like you know a set of 20 would be nice

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
like you know a set of 20 would be nice
it's<00:01:12.180> been<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> while<00:01:12.689> since<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.049> even<00:01:13.260> went<00:01:13.409> for

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's been a while since I even went for

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.030 
it's been a while since I even went for
it<00:01:13.740> reps<00:01:14.610> felt<00:01:14.850> super<00:01:15.270> easy<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
it reps felt super easy I have to be a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.740 
it reps felt super easy I have to be a
little<00:01:17.159> careful<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> tendency<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
little careful I have a tendency not to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.950 
little careful I have a tendency not to
want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.110> lock<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.780> rep<00:01:21.780> work

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
want to lock out when I do rep work

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740 
want to lock out when I do rep work
anything<00:01:22.259> over<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:23.009> 3<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.520> 4<00:01:23.549> reps<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.180> tend<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
anything over like 3 or 4 reps I tend to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.469 
anything over like 3 or 4 reps I tend to
try<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> cut<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.439> short<00:01:25.729> but<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> end

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
try to cut them short but at the end

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.600 
try to cut them short but at the end
here<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.890> try<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:29.100> sure<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.400> locked

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
here I try to make sure that I locked

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.450 
here I try to make sure that I locked
out<00:01:29.729> each<00:01:29.880> rep<00:01:30.329> individually<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:34.460> don't

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
out each rep individually and I don't

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
out each rep individually and I don't
know<00:01:35.670> where<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.150> right<00:01:36.180> now<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.450> lost<00:01:36.720> count

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
know where I'm at right now I lost count

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.190

most<00:01:58.049> guys<00:01:58.200> when<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.530> setup<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.920> bench<00:01:59.130> press

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
most guys when they setup to bench press

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.700 
most guys when they setup to bench press
they<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.509> kind<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.750> reach<00:02:00.929> out<00:02:01.140> grab<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.530> bar

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
they just kind of reach out grab the bar
and<00:02:01.950> they're<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.610> gonna<00:02:02.729> pick<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.179> like

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

and they're just gonna pick it up like
that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
that
and<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> first<00:02:04.649> thing<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.039> did

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and you see the first thing that I did

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.499 
and you see the first thing that I did
is<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.569> bars<00:02:06.780> line<00:02:07.109> up<00:02:07.289> in<00:02:07.409> my<00:02:07.530> hand<00:02:07.829> is

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
is where the bars line up in my hand is

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
is where the bars line up in my hand is
not<00:02:09.509> directly<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.379> line<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:11.009> wrist

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
not directly in line with my wrist

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.400 
not directly in line with my wrist
because<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.090> straight<00:02:12.480> across<00:02:12.750> from<00:02:13.230> where

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
because it's straight across from where

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
because it's straight across from where
the<00:02:13.500> thumb<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.220> outside<00:02:14.549> of<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> palm

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
the thumb is to the outside of the palm

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.820 
the thumb is to the outside of the palm
and<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:16.700> happens<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.330> bottom

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and so happens when I get to the bottom

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.860 
and so happens when I get to the bottom
I'm<00:02:19.830> gonna<00:02:20.099> come<00:02:20.370> down<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.940> when<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.390> start<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
I'm gonna come down and when I start to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.289 
I'm gonna come down and when I start to
push<00:02:22.280> when<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.370> push<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.819> there's<00:02:24.120> gonna

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
push when I push like that there's gonna

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.870 
push when I push like that there's gonna
be<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.810> little<00:02:24.840> bit<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.380> roll<00:02:25.880> generally

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
be just a little bit of a roll generally

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.819 
be just a little bit of a roll generally
and<00:02:27.120> that's<00:02:27.630> gonna<00:02:27.780> cause<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.049> wrist<00:02:28.530> pain

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
and that's gonna cause that wrist pain

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.280 
and that's gonna cause that wrist pain
and<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.819> also<00:02:30.030> gonna<00:02:30.450> cause<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.140> lose

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and it's also gonna cause you to lose

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.720 
and it's also gonna cause you to lose
some<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> energy<00:02:31.650> from<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> press

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
some of the energy from the press

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.610 
some of the energy from the press
because<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:34.200> not<00:02:34.349> in<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> right

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
because it's just not in the right

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.550 
because it's just not in the right
position<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:39.690> approach<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.170> kind<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.440> with

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
position is to approach it kind of with

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.770 
position is to approach it kind of with
a<00:02:40.590> diagonal<00:02:40.950> take<00:02:41.880> your<00:02:42.030> thumb<00:02:42.239> wherever<00:02:42.569> your

and<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.680> whole<00:03:34.709> time<00:03:35.040> you're<00:03:35.220> focusing<00:03:35.639> on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
and the whole time you're focusing on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.610 
and the whole time you're focusing on
just<00:03:36.000> squeezing<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.840> trying<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.380> break<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
just squeezing and trying to break the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.080 
just squeezing and trying to break the
bar<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:37.919> that<00:03:37.980> should<00:03:38.190> prevent<00:03:38.430> most<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:38.849> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
bar and that should prevent most of the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.550 
bar and that should prevent most of the
wrist<00:03:39.269> pain<00:03:39.419> if<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.750> keeps<00:03:39.870> coming<00:03:40.169> up<00:03:40.349> go

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
wrist pain if it keeps coming up go
