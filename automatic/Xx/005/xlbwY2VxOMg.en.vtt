the supercar game on every aspect has
been<00:01:27.060> analyzed<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.050> re-engineered<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.820> take

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
been analyzed and re-engineered so take

been analyzed and re-engineered so take
these<00:01:30.270> um<00:01:30.660> twelve<00:01:31.470> flippers<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.600> this

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
these um twelve flippers just here this

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.500 
these um twelve flippers just here this
is<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> wing<00:01:34.020> section<00:01:34.680> at<00:01:35.460> low<00:01:35.700> speed<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
is the wing section at low speed the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.300 
is the wing section at low speed the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
radiators behind here low speed the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.040 
radiators behind here low speed the
engine<00:01:38.700> needs<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.120> lot<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.300> air<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.690> keep<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
engine needs a lot of air to keep it

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.590 
engine needs a lot of air to keep it
cool<00:01:40.580> but<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.640> high<00:01:41.850> speed<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.300> course<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
cool but a high speed of course it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
cool but a high speed of course it
doesn't<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.080> there's<00:01:43.229> loads<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.830> in

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
doesn't because there's loads going in

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.320 
doesn't because there's loads going in
there<00:01:44.160> so<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.460> Ferrari<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> done<00:01:45.210> is

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
there so what Ferrari have done is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.530 
there so what Ferrari have done is
they've<00:01:45.840> made<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.380> deform<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.420> air

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
they've made this deform so when the air

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.200 
they've made this deform so when the air
comes<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:49.050> this<00:01:49.650> wing<00:01:49.920> gets<00:01:50.190> pushed<00:01:50.460> down<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
comes in this wing gets pushed down it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.859 
comes in this wing gets pushed down it
stagnates<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.350> area<00:01:52.830> here<00:01:53.220> which<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.510> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
stagnates this area here which when the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.870 
stagnates this area here which when the
air<00:01:54.990> comes<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.410> then<00:01:55.770> gets<00:01:55.920> diverted<00:01:56.190> under

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
air comes in then gets diverted under

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.300 
air comes in then gets diverted under
the<00:01:57.000> car<00:01:57.290> gives<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.410> more<00:01:58.530> downforce<00:01:59.009> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the car gives it more downforce and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.510 
the car gives it more downforce and
importantly<00:02:00.000> less<00:02:00.600> drag<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
importantly less drag and the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.400 
importantly less drag and the
engineering<00:02:02.940> detail<00:02:03.420> continues<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
engineering detail continues on the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.890 
engineering detail continues on the
inside<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.430> dashboard<00:02:05.759> screens<00:02:06.390> look<00:02:06.630> more

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
inside the dashboard screens look more

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.469 
inside the dashboard screens look more
like<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> computer<00:02:07.530> games<00:02:08.130> console<00:02:08.700> whilst<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
like a computer games console whilst the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.480 
like a computer games console whilst the

wipers and indicator stalks have been

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.820 
wipers and indicator stalks have been
replaced<00:02:11.910> by<00:02:12.150> f1<00:02:12.720> style<00:02:13.110> buttons<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.709> the

the<00:02:15.840> four<00:02:16.080> five<00:02:16.320> eight<00:02:16.560> has<00:02:16.769> also<00:02:16.920> got<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
the four five eight has also got a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520 
the four five eight has also got a
bigger<00:02:17.730> brain<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.050> traction

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
bigger brain so it's the traction

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.640 
bigger brain so it's the traction
control<00:02:19.560> gets<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.580> corners<00:02:21.060> about
