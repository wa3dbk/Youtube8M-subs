00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello to all today we find ourselves 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.080
 for a tutorial on the basics of 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.240
 painting so then we'll see keep the 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.400
 dry brushing 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.580
 because we know that it will allow the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.870
 have sanctioned relief detail you 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.390
 see there for example there today we 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.380
 will paint the ropes there that are 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.110
 often too much of the mac 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.760
 so I'm going to show you how reindeer 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.179
 it's technical it's something 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.739
 very simple it's more for the 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:44.390
 beginners and for those who complain 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.440
 lot fills below the mass is 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.760
 so we'll start right away 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.239
 so then I wanted to do will have 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 shame and ned stone for what the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.239
 old aprochim paintings here it goes 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.269
 to be taking a little bit of paint 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:05.930
 at the end of his brush and go 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:07.790
 wipe it on soap until 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.330
 that they more at all times will last 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.410
 almost and so then you will come 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:20.180
 and you go brushed and you go 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.780
 pass the hairs in the opposite direction of 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.780
 your relief 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.850
 here I do not know if you m other kings 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.850
 with this color 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.980
 I will put some paint 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.689
 you always wipe well if you 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.689
 wants to keep a clean effect 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.050
 I'm dad on three is very very 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.050
 well 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.920
 so that's the principle of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.780
 technique is so that you go 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.090
 to be able to do this market in full of 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.540
 details and so the end no here I go 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.400
 show you the powder of the mac 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:39.450
 bell was hanged with his dry ga because 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.800
 that as there are folds yeah the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.390
 painting he'll just put on the 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.470
 folds she will not go into the hollows 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.170
 what will allow to montbre 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.230
 naturally the figurine 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.420
 it is a very beautiful aspect so it's ready 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.260
 to do that you have to alternate 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.360
 layers of paint you have to put gray 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.570
 dark light gray and may end up 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.590
 very very light white and so that's so 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.700
 but normally now that it fr 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.700
 the drybrushing 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.780
 so do not hesitate to subscribe 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.550

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.250
