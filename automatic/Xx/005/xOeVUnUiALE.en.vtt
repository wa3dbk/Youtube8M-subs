00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.540
 tells crowd b br 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.069
 direct from computex in taipei 2013 are 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 here at the gigabyte booth 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.599
 I'm going to show you another one now. 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.410
 release that had here weak of the mother 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.619
 motherboard gigabyte gear if 87 x dash or 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.789
 force a card facing 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.710
 the extreme user you want is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.880
 play with this area of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.640
 overclock 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.270
 This plate she won, I'll show her 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.630
 you she won the year award 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.239
 2013 a plaque highly praised throughout 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.920
 world is showing you now a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.039
 A little bit of her here motherboard already 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.500
 also prepared for the scratch generation 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.969
 chipsets and intel 87 that we can 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 see the help of the staff more thought 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.510
 in everything here one with system of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.070
 refrigeration one cloth per chipsets and 87 and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.320
 takes days to better manage the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.159
 heat and also the cooling system 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 a little stronger for the brmc 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.939
 of the board since during use 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 extreme 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.430
 it really warms up for who 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.799
 has a higher performance in terms of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.350
 thermal dissipation can check here 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.979
 that the board has inputs to the other and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 cooler is a very interesting thing this 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.360
 plate already prepared here, he said. 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 and in the case of more intense use it is 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.890
 recommended to connect a power cord 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.620
 and to provide more energy for 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.240
 lots and that board 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.820
 is very much like almost 87x or being 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.280
 a board also for overclocking 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.760
 it has here all the settings 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.850
 necessary that one that the user needs 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.940
 when it comes to overclocking like setting 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.740
 baseball ok reptile fit all on 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:07.570
 the right fly is up and running 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.380
 20.10.10 turbo tag turns on and off board 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.510
 right 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.870
 the sign also has the bill if in case 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.270
 some problem in updating the psb 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.250
 of the board perceiving dark very well done 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.230
 by a sign that actually has 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.450
 everything to please let's try to make a 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.860
 review it soon so you'll 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 show a little the back of the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:36.250
 to notice a very nice board has the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.400
 most important connections usb 3.0 2.0 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.420
 hdmi thunder bolt on the connectors 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.760
 audio 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.970
 finally an overclocker series that arrives at 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.980
 Haiti is putting on the market is okay 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.739
 doing a pretty damage in the right direction 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.810
 Of course, and we'll wait and see soon. 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.709
 a symbol of this board and make a beautiful 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.050
 review and show the firepower 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.260
 so this is important people of the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.060
 gigabyte computex 2013 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 soon more news for you
