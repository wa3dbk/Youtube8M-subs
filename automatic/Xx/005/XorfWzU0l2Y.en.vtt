00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.530
 two 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.709
 so 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.940
 of the series of eschatological studies 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.970
 let's study the rapture of the church 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.020
 as the sacred scriptures say in the book of John 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.240
 chapter 14 verse 3 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.659
 and if I were them to prepare the place I will come again iosco mariani same 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.410
 so that where I am 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.630
 you are also there 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.550
 father who are in heaven 'we thank you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.320
 why 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.360
 p has manifested to us through your word 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.550
 today we have you in our hearts through your word 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.900
 but one day we will see you as you are because I will be like 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.200
 astiz 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.740
 thank you we give you 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 in the name of Christ Jesus 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.270
 if we read in first d Thessalonians at 4 13 to 17 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.380
 we will find 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.640
 loc how wonderful the Lord expresses us through his word 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.210
 and it says the following 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.030
 we do not want brothers either 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.850
 that hardens near those who sleep so that it does not become sad and as 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 we who have no hope 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.369
 because if we believe that Jesus died and rose again he will also bring 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.540
 his those who slept in him 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.640
 for which the 16th in the word of the Lord that we who live 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.290
 that we will have remained until the coming of the Lord not to precede we have those who 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.350
 they slept 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.290
 because the same combo commander and compotier camil and trumpet god 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.720
 will descend from heaven and the dead in Christ will be resurrected first 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.020
 then we who live locke and have stayed will be raptured 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.640
 together with them in the clouds to receive the Lord in the air and thus 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.739
 we will always be with the sr 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.329
 the word of God 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.329
 it's very clear when it says 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.329
 for his church 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.260
 in turn 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.259
 for his wife 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.099
 Jesus Christ is the husband 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.359
 but this event that is going to happen is because it is an event where we are going to 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:36.389
 receive the Lord in the air and well snatch us in a moment in an open 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.959
 and in an eye close 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.450
 doing a deeper analysis 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.089
 we analyze the concept of biblical term raptured 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:50.930
 since the Greek means ar happened in first this room and it is done 4 17 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.089
 0 I will speak rebolledo 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.979
 and there's this percent when we talk about Greek meeting 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.919
 this is a lawyer 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.530
 the first of Corinthians 5 4 we can see from that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.130
 practically street will talk to us about d in the name of our Lord 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.209
 Jesus Christ gathered you and my spirit with the power of our Lord 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.829
 Jesus Christ 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.469
 of the aek of the word gathered 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.070
 daughter reviewed 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.809
 in first of three Albanians and 4 and 7 what it means is written 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:24.909
 in other words 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.080
 remove 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.399
 remove from the middle remove something from the place 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:30.969
 what belongs to him 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.960
 someone in this case 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.729
 the church belongs to the Lord 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.259
 snatches his church bagpipes church of this world 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.510
 as we can see the rapture takes place when the Lord takes the church and 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.319
 takes her to be with him 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.890
 let's do an analysis 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.519
 as we are told in today's book in fact heard 39 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.160
 7 when the extinct SeÃ±or arrebato ascended from the water 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.079
 everything to felipe yl 1 ko 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.139
 he did not give more 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.989
 and he went on joyfully on his way 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.279
 like so I hauled 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:06.989
 meadow 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.930
 in the written one way 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.930
 how the Lord also 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.690
 2nd Corinthians 12 2 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.299
 says 4 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.259
 with the buy Christ 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.170
 that 14 years ago if in the body I do not know 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.820
 if out of the body I do not know god knows it was topped up to the third heaven 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.490
 and I know eta man 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.490
 without the body outside the body I do not know God knows 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.849
 who was taken to paradise where he fled ineffable word that I have not 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:37.740
 state 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.140
 to man express how we can believe other analyzes that see boateng min in 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.099
 the second Corinthians book 12 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:46.010
 is that 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.100
 this man was for auctioneers here we are referring to the apostle Paul 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.520
 he was caught up to the third heaven that means he is not external he does not 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.919
 I knew the time I could do 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:04:59.730
 taken away 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.639
 in this fact in spirit at that moment 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.169
 that's why the word is said 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.560
 snapped up 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.199
 ar spent 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.560
 he also contrast the floor the buoys 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.680
 refers to the outcome of the candle reduction 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.770
 what does it mean 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.280
 once we were snatched 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.830
 oca reviewed in greek 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.370
 let's go to the next step that the meeting 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.270
 the meeting with Christ 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.009
 the encounter with peres pto 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:30.900
 so 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.499
 these expressions are wonderful now 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.429
 something important that we must defeat this that is rapture 

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:43.860
 so that you can give aisha a transformation of the bodies and that 

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:45.680
 transformation of the bodies 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.830
 she something 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.309
 also mysterious 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:53.130
 but we can scrutinize the scriptures that come and find 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.370
 clarification 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.050
 asismimo soul mahler in first of juan 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.069
 Chapter 3 Persian Lo 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:04.769
 and when we give him the word of God as beloved 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.230
 now we are children of god 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.249
 and still have not detected what she photo 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.660
 but we know that when he manifests 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.060
 we will be similar to him 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.230
 because we will see him 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.480
 just as you are in other words the Lord himself not saying in his 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.110
 word 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.949
 what are we going to do similar er 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.950
 We were going to see him as he is 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.220
 then we also read in the book of mateos 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.890
 chapter di7 verse 2 the following and was transfigured before them that 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.380
 Her face shone like the sun and her dress became white as light 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.280
 as we can observe 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.319
 there is a mass and deep manifestation in that moment of glory 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.290
 where 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.259
 the Lord is transfigured 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.069
 in his face he transforms like the sun 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.599
 now and he can resist the current 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:59.669
 we know that if we see the sun we do not continue 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:05.340
 but the word of God says that the sr his face was transformed like the sun that 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.639
 his investiture were 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.740
 as the light of day 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.240
 but if we see 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.860
 in frames 9 2 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.830
 it still clarifies a little more 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.819
 six days after his take pedro a paco buyo juan 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:21.439
 and took him aside they are the ones to a high mountain and he transfigured before them 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.369
 in those dresses 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:26.619
 they became resplendent 

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:27.419
 listen 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.449
 glowing 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:33.660
 whites very white as snow 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.149
 so much that no scrubber on earth can do it they have also 

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:39.820
 you imagine that it is indescribable 

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.669
 the way the written 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:42.569
 tour 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:45.080
 then do in the word 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.979
 says there is not a washer in the world 

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:49.770
 so we are talking 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.379
 of some describable of something glorious 

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:57.909
 also to daniel 7 9 we read I was looking at attack were put but 

00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:02.179
 us and sat an old man whose tracks were white dress 

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:03.959
 like snow once more
