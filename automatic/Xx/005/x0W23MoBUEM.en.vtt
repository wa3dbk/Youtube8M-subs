00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.389 
they don't trust politicians in my
experience<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.840> believe<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
experience so I believe that that is the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.639 
experience so I believe that that is the
most<00:02:05.579> likely<00:02:05.880> explanation<00:02:06.290> there<00:02:07.290> are<00:02:07.439> of

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
most likely explanation there are of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.889 
most likely explanation there are of
course<00:02:07.680> others<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:09.239> God<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
course others but I think God have to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.020 
course others but I think God have to
settle<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:11.190> I'd<00:02:11.340> like<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.550> say<00:02:11.849> is

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
settle for that what I'd like to say is

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
settle for that what I'd like to say is
that<00:02:12.209> there<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.569> serious<00:02:13.140> possible

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that there is a serious possible
