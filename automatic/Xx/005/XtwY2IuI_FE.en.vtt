00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 what's up with friends stefan here from fifa 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.569
 and gaming tv and welcome to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.069
 an info video and indeed it is today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.620
 because we now have a new one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.070
 partnership or a new sponsor 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.950
 to have 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.719
 this one is called mmk you can 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 actually everything about games &amp; co 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.300
 to buy 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.250
 which then extends from a wow so 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 funny stuff what probably not so 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.300
 the topic should be up to you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 to fifa ultimate team coins for ps3 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.410
 xbox 360 and the pc 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 which would be a bit more interesting then 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 Consumers should actually be 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.290
 quite I want to get to such 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 her hundreds of thousands on the ps3 and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.790
 xbox 360 for about 7 euro 50 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.969
 Of course , there are also 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 still psn cards and microsoft points yes 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.450
 many of you will ask yourself now 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.550
 why do we tell you that we are 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.230
 then probably only money want the coal 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.149
 Maybe that could be done by some 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.070
 Of course that's not true 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 because we invest again, too 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.390
 much for you as for the top 5 gates 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.539
 The week we usually each 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.100
 week a 20 euro psn card or 2100 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.320
 microsoft points to the winner 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.820
 or as another example then serve 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 the pag openings too 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.390
 not exactly cheap and it is clear 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.650
 then a fine thing if you with 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.490
 his hobby a bit something 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.020
 can earn 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.400
 Of course we also have a lot of time 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.240
 spend good videos too 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 present 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.290
 but of course we force you 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.520
 not for sale to any buy that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.869
 we do not want so we want 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.880
 Now do not say throw your money 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.470
 out but we just want you 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 to point out that if you 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 are planning coins or something to 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.020
 fetch is like a link in the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 to do description so that he never and 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.280
 I also have something of it because we have one 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 small commission get so first 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 line is not about us to say 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 buy someone give your money everything 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.780
 what you have only one again 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.280
 No matter how small it is 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.860
 Of course not only if you anyway 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 even before you have coins or a psn 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.490
 card or microsoft points 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.509
 to buy then it would be very nice if 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.310
 her that over a link in the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.590
 could do why description as well 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.180
 then have a trifle of it 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.430
 still very important to say that if you 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.950
 once on the link that mmo guessed 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 For 30 days, you realize that you are through us 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.530
 have come to the side and that we 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 in this period also then the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.099
 get a commission if you like us 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 So it does not help us to help 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.430
 if you just google on google energy 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.200
 seek and then go to the side 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.670
 but it really only brings us one 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.110
 small commission if you then through the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.879
 link in the description clicks on it 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.349
 and then what's up again? 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.599
 conclusively agree for us completely 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.920
 important we do not want any money from you 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.270
 So we pull the bags and we want you 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.349
 Also not necessarily buyda now 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.510
 let's take a bit of it 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.310
 it is not like that but only if 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.720
 you really intend to bring something then 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.310
 you can do that via a link in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.260
 The description is about us 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.760
 support that was so far from me 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.680
 It'll be nice until next time 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.680
 greetings normal front and ciao
