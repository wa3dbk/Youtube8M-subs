 Satto Hamano- Nakamura Suzuki is said to you and then No. 6 Kagaya 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.480

 The third machine is inside 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.350
 After the strikeout number three Sasaki came up to fourth place after that 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.159
 It is not helpful to someone Sato doing slowly 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.770
 It is a place to ask for, but the sixth problem in the corner will be extended 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.200
 The battle is only the room where the fifth Masato Nakamura fifth was sixth 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.909
 Sato Takaya third stuck system has become the No. 4 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.100
 Go about No. 2 in photo Masato Nakamura leader 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:41.040
 I have imminent little by little third Sasaki 奎 little by little from the count Takashi Sato也後filtrate 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 Now Kagaya is going to Masato Nakamura again 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.810
 Sato is high if it is going to enter with a factor 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 I have already finished 4 laps now I say that I will forgive you to Sato Art School 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.159
 Nakamura between 5 No. 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:58.270
 I have been doing ema a little while ago from the back or would have been on the wall 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:03.700
 The top 5 Nakamura and 2nd from the 6th only 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.020
 It is three weeks after I pick up the picture and go up to the 3rd place Masato Nakamura 2nd place in the direct battle line No. 6 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.650
 Third place is the third edition 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.620
 Now you have a new type of in-course 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.600
 Takaya 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.080
 It is a place I want to wear, but it is the third Sasaki-based line that I extended here. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.080
 Stone 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.569
 Operation Sankei went in and went up to the second place 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.880
 Was the battle approaching the 5th Nakamura strike? 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.140
 eat 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.590
 The outpost Nato and the hole Sato of high place will attack from a considerable amount again 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.540
 How about in the course will be to understand the 45 line late is stuck system 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.569
 ni 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.719

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:41.569
 Takamasa Sato third line of Nakamura Maso toka line and 2nd place third pan Sasaki house of Boban is retrospective to Nakamura 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:46.639
 I will go to this point 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.840
 It is likely to continue over the fire from the last out of it Sato Takaya But combat is brought Nakamura is the second fastest 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.040
 Sasaki is the third 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.040
