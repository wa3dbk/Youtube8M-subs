on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.320> under<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> physical<00:01:05.790> side<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> think

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
on the under the physical side I think

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.460 
on the under the physical side I think
that<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.780> there's<00:01:07.050> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.230> be<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> little

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that one there's going to be a little

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
that one there's going to be a little
bit<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.800> of<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> vetting<00:01:08.250> process<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.850> there's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
bit more of a vetting process so there's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
bit more of a vetting process so there's
not<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.510> quick<00:01:09.720> resolution<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
not gonna be a quick resolution on that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.170 
not gonna be a quick resolution on that
one<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:10.950> opinion<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> that's<00:01:11.580> exactly<00:01:11.730> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
one in my opinion and that's exactly the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.970 
one in my opinion and that's exactly the
way<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> read<00:01:12.660> into<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.050> as<00:01:13.230> well<00:01:13.380> nothing<00:01:13.830> new

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
piece of scenario scenario on that one

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.490 
piece of scenario scenario on that one
is<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.940> just<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> ends<00:01:52.050> up<00:01:52.230> being<00:01:52.410> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
is that just kind of ends up being a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190 
is that just kind of ends up being a
misunderstanding<00:01:53.400> maybe<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.330> game<00:01:54.630> maybe<00:01:54.930> not

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

even a game suspension I don't think

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.460 
even a game suspension I don't think
this<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.940> anything<00:01:57.300> that<00:01:57.480> that<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.320> would

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
this is anything that that really would

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.320 
this is anything that that really would
warn<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:59.040> than<00:01:59.220> two<00:01:59.400> games<00:01:59.640> though<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.210> be
