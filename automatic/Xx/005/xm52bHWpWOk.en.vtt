00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello very good today we are going to perform 16 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.290
 with totally homemade materials 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.700
 basically with wire is worth a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.920
 a small imitation of a bonsai 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.440
 It's worth the first thing we should do 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 before you start cutting wire it would be 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.610
 make a sketch for the sketch what 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 we can find then through 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.150
 internet or creating ourselves over 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.390
 a paper 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.940
 I'll leave that to your imagination 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.220
 it's good in my case it would be simply 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.080
 and cut wire is worth and join it together 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.180
 with black tape what is the 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.930
 more sensitive parts that can be 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.100
 disunite and go creating the bag shape 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.770
 later what we should do 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 is to unite everything with this type of cro 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.360
 a velcro or rough that will give a form 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.540
 of 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.370
 as how aging tree and 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.200
 then part that can be painted more 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.329
 easily on him 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.310
 well once we have it all 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.399
 let say 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.560
 with velcro we could also do 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.270
 some small strips 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.130
 ok how can this be 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.130
 using a piece of wire 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.360
 and joining it and joining it when the turn 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.360
 turn around turn until join 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.350
 when we would have to do a few 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 and 82 why 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.530
 so they can see how it looks good then 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.520
 it would be a matter of intertwining the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.700
 want him to look more or less him 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.240
 the ramifications because everything already 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.679
 I say I should go to scale imagine 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.090
 that the tree that is on the stone is 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.000
 much bigger and these are let's say 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.310
 as its branches to hold what is the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.080
 superior vegetation is worth this too 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.760
 would join by velcro 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.610
 It's worth it once we had everything 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.280
 the system with roots and branches and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.000
 its ramifications what we would have to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.060
 to do is with a white tail with or with 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.070
 glue well and with a pincelito 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.770
 giving him by all parties so that he 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.680
 will be the most compact set and if 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.510
 could use better 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.269
 all right 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.730
 after a day of drying it is worth it then 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.680
 would touch what it is to paint it what 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.549
 we would use a reddish color 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.900
 or brown or different shades of brown 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.630
 reddish or a little more white to give 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.740
 shadow dreamed of spears already on taste 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.140
 well once we had the 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.480
 tree structure we would go through the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.330
 from the stone the stone come I 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.910
 basically what I have done has been with 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.130
 transparent tail voucher linked by all 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.310
 the stone by the areas where I wanted 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.930
 that outside grass is worth with a cotton 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.930
 and hitting long don 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.910
 during we go all the stone and during 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.070
 approximately ten minutes criminally 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.450
 so that the tail made its effect and 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.290
 after and ripping the pieces 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.560
 leftovers are worth until a texture is left 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.560
 let's go like this 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.790
 It looks good but basically good 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.980
 logically it would stay white 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.110
 we would have to go with the spray of 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.319
 different colors of green or a green 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.269
 anyone to do tests and 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.269
 painting them until they look like this 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.530
 as if it were a kind of fear 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.340
 oier low or whatever 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.450
 all right 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.160
 for the upper branches so for the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.989
 superior vegetation because we would do what 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.959
 same on a surface that 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.550
 we could paint it because we would shape 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:11.210
 to what is the cup 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:14.490
 and we will paint it on both sides 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.390
 we would let it dry for one hour 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.010
 That's about an hour and a half 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.790
 using always and latex gloves 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.260
 so much so that if I'm not going to put 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.720
 lost of what watercolor is the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.120
 painting is worth and once you have 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.340
 already painted with the form it would be 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.830
 question of the ramifications that 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.230
 You will be tied here with fisher and 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.140
 Glued then throw a bit of parts 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.500
 droplets to all the branches to hold it 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.740
 so it would be more or less 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.740
 A) Yes 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.820
 that for each part of the branch that 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.340
 you want to put vegetation you can put 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.190
 more vegetation less vegetation that 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.170
 you want 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.470
 once we have the whole system with 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.340
 all the ramifications and the part 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.919
 superior with its vegetation 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.190
 well we could also use in the 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.199
 Teflon is worth rolling as if it were 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.040
 a little thread and painting what a color 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.870
 greenish or brown or whatever you want 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.830
 to do is like lianas 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.710
 around the tree or just 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.139
 using parts of leftover branches and 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.330
 giving them laps is worth to stay 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.030
 in flat bigger by the different 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.340
 I still remember parts of the trunk that 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.850
 this is not scale imagine how long 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.850
 of the largest 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:44.460
 and well after that, just 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.930
 we would need a powerful glue to 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.000
 pass it on the stone to leave 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.610
 always a hole 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.090
 pass it on the stone and basically 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:58.240
 wait for us one day approximately for 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.340
 that I hit that well and then finally 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.620
 give the final touch to the tree 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.890
 try to stay in this way of 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.110
 this way basically it would already be 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.390
 matter of going with the brushes giving them 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.080
 for the areas where it was improved it looks worse 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.390
 that and everyone who does as he likes 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.260
 like it good now let's show how 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.740
 the bonsai is already finished 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.460
 course yo 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:29.680
 and we can see what the targets are 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:33.250
 ok the high parts are cottons 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:37.229
 what is the stone with its vegetation of 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:41.590
 put there is an animal and an elephant is worth 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:44.860
 here you can see the teflon is worth everything 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.870
 this this flower painted 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.790
 it's worth the ramifications things 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.009
 as seen in each one doing the 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.120
 structure as bad as you like 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.360
 well 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.710
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.710
 and nothing until the next
