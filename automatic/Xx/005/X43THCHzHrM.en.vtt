00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 potato fits are a very delicious 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.660
 to croquettes alternative plus there's 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.429
 a fresh dip with chives 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.080
 recipe with the exact quantities of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.440
 infobox links or you will find it

 directly on american los cooking.de 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.470
 we start with more the boiling 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.640
 potatoes peeled first and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.050
 roughly diced in lightly 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.130
 salted water will become then 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.130
 cooked until tender 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.300
 then the water will drain off 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.640
 poured and the potatoes into one 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 bowl in which she is about 15 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 minutes should cool slightly 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.010
 You can use time for example 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.680
 to prepare the delicious dips 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.140
 Here are simply sour cream salad 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:01:00.890
 mayonnaise dried chilli flakes 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.890
 chopped chive pepper 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.600
 and salt mix 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.180
 when the potatoes have cooled slightly 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.010
 they are roughly crushed and the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:39.490
 remaining ingredients are given and indeed 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:44.280
 are the common whistle salt butter noble 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.280
 sweet paprika powder and onion powder 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.700
 then fine for the mass 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 crushed 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.230
 and stirred for closing more 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.720
 with lightly floured hands can the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.970
 Potato dough then too small 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.319
 balls are then formed 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.319
 a busy board sets 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.400
 when that's done, they'll be in 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.400
 a coated pan with 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.080
 pay enough attention to golden brown fried oil 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.210
 but that they only open the stove 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:45.780
 Low heat sets because the whole 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:47.880
 otherwise burns very fast if the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.110
 small potato pope should finish 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.830
 to drain on kitchen paper 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.420
 then you can put them 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.600
 with the fat and a fresh salad 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.280
 serve 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.240
