we have the deluxe memory man by

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.590 
we have the deluxe memory man by
electro-harmonix<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.870> we<00:00:04.620> have<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.130> boss<00:00:05.600> it's

a<00:00:06.750> vintage<00:00:06.930> boss<00:00:07.610> g7<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.090> FX<00:00:09.389> loop<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:10.349> I'm

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
a vintage boss g7 in the FX loop and I'm

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.140 
a vintage boss g7 in the FX loop and I'm
gonna<00:00:10.889> kind<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.219> demonstrate<00:00:11.759> how<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.000> can

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
gonna kind of demonstrate how you can

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.359 
gonna kind of demonstrate how you can
tailor<00:00:12.780> your<00:00:12.809> echo<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:15.059> timbre<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
tailor your echo the timbre of it and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.120 
tailor your echo the timbre of it and
they<00:00:17.369> key<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.630> get<00:00:19.439> different<00:00:19.740> sounds

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
they key of it to get different sounds

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.599 
they key of it to get different sounds
from<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:21.170> memory<00:00:22.170> man<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.220> playing<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
from your memory man so I'm playing on a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.330 
from your memory man so I'm playing on a
Fender<00:00:24.000> Stratocaster<00:00:24.410> through<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> Vox<00:00:25.769> ac30

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
Fender Stratocaster through a Vox ac30

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:37.400 
Fender Stratocaster through a Vox ac30
here's<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> clean<00:00:27.449> signal

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500 

all<00:00:38.410> right<00:00:38.500> let's<00:00:38.710> engage<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.370> memory<00:00:40.300> man

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
all right let's engage the memory man

00:00:40.510 --> 00:01:01.810 
all right let's engage the memory man
the<00:00:40.780> equalizers<00:00:41.680> off<00:00:41.920> for<00:00:42.220> right<00:00:42.340> now

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.310 

all<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.269> have<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.719> little<00:01:03.960> curve

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
all right so I have this little curve

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.429 
all right so I have this little curve
here<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.739> I'm<00:01:05.330> cutting<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.570> hundred<00:01:07.020> Hertz<00:01:07.259> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
here which I'm cutting a hundred Hertz a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.539 
here which I'm cutting a hundred Hertz a
little<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.070> I'm<00:01:08.220> starting<00:01:08.399> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
little bit and then I'm starting to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.730 
little bit and then I'm starting to
boost<00:01:08.820> from<00:01:09.420> starting<00:01:10.460> 800<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:11.759> 1.6<00:01:12.390> K

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
boost from starting 800 and then 1.6 K

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.429 
boost from starting 800 and then 1.6 K
3.2<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.729> dipping

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
3.2 a little bit and then I'm dipping

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
3.2 a little bit and then I'm dipping
6.4<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.979> creating<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> mid

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
6.4 so I'm kind of creating like a mid

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
6.4 so I'm kind of creating like a mid
bump<00:01:18.720> Sordo<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.799> let's<00:01:20.009> hear<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
bump Sordo so let's hear what that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.800 
bump Sordo so let's hear what that
sounds<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:21.720> without<00:01:21.899> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.720 

this<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> equalizer

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.300 

I<00:01:37.340> can<00:01:38.340> hear<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.050> repeat<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.350> kind<00:01:40.620> of<00:01:40.710> it's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I can hear it repeat and kind of it's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:02:03.190 
I can hear it repeat and kind of it's
nice<00:01:41.550> mid-range

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.630 

can't<00:02:04.200> even<00:02:04.260> kind<00:02:04.980> of<00:02:05.070> make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.340> even<00:02:05.730> darker

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
can't even kind of make it even darker

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:23.600 
can't even kind of make it even darker
by<00:02:08.640> cutting<00:02:09.510> some<00:02:09.720> more<00:02:10.020> highs

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:37.360 

boost<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> lows

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.340 

starts<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.490> feedback<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.900> got<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.200> watch

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
starts to feedback so we got to watch

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.150 
starts to feedback so we got to watch
the<00:02:40.620> level<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.990> can<00:02:43.230> pretty<00:02:43.560> much<00:02:43.620> make<00:02:43.770> it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
the level so you can pretty much make it

00:02:44.160 --> 00:03:16.050 
the level so you can pretty much make it
brighter<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.860> did<00:02:47.070> here

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.000 

just<00:03:17.060> makes<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.629> delay<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.530> much<00:03:18.739> more

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
just makes the delay so much more

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.309 
just makes the delay so much more
versatile<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.530> can<00:03:22.090> dip<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.330> mids<00:03:23.599> boost

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
versatile so you can dip the mids boost

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.880 
versatile so you can dip the mids boost
them<00:03:24.650> do<00:03:25.519> anything<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.120> want

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.770 

doesn't<00:03:31.890> really<00:03:32.060> feedback<00:03:33.060> too<00:03:33.300> much<00:03:33.510> like

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
doesn't really feedback too much like

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.920 
doesn't really feedback too much like
that<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:35.640> get<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> nice<00:03:36.150> pretty<00:03:36.710> kind<00:03:37.710> of<00:03:37.830> a

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
that and can get a nice pretty kind of a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.410 
that and can get a nice pretty kind of a
analog<00:03:39.930> ish<00:03:40.170> really<00:03:41.160> old<00:03:41.430> analog<00:03:42.060> style<00:03:42.390> echo

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
analog ish really old analog style echo

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.150 
analog ish really old analog style echo
boosting<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> mids

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:05:20.780 

turn<00:03:50.160> on<00:03:50.280> overdrive<00:03:50.850> SS<00:03:51.390> 3p<00:03:51.930> Cornish

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.810 

well<00:05:21.790> that<00:05:22.030> feeds<00:05:22.390> back<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.720> lot<00:05:23.140> so<00:05:24.070> there<00:05:24.670> it

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
well that feeds back a lot so there it

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.580 
well that feeds back a lot so there it
is<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:25.210> little<00:05:25.450> demonstration<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:26.380> the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
is a little demonstration of the

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.740 
is a little demonstration of the
equalizer<00:05:27.190> in<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.580> effects<00:05:28.150> loop<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:28.600> the
