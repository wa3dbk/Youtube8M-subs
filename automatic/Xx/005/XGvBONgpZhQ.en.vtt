of G 906 this phone will be some things
it<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.880> also<00:00:33.090> been<00:00:33.329> called<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.780> galaxy<00:00:34.380> s5

it was also been called like galaxy s5

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.290 
it was also been called like galaxy s5
prime<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.370> phone<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> be

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
prime so this this phone is going to be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.290 
prime so this this phone is going to be
the<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.719> sampling<00:00:40.260> device<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.340> qHD

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910 
the first sampling device with a qHD
display<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> sounds<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
display I think that sounds when I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.850 
display I think that sounds when I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.850 
resolution as we heard the LG g3 would
have<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> mean<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.620> insane

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
have so I mean that's going to be insane

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
have so I mean that's going to be insane
2006<00:00:56.489> x<00:00:56.699> 1440<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.870> epic<00:00:58.020> it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
2006 x 1440 that's going to be epic it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
2006 x 1440 that's going to be epic it's
also<00:00:58.649> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.100> bit<00:00:59.219> bigger

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
also going to be a little bit bigger

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
also going to be a little bit bigger
than<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> current<00:01:00.960> galaxy's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
than the then the current galaxy's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.160 
than the then the current galaxy's
thought<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.460> 2<00:01:02.789> inch

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
thought it's going to be 2 inch

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.270 
thought it's going to be 2 inch
and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:05.100> information

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and then we also have some information

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.750 
and then we also have some information
here<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> galaxy<00:01:06.869> s5<00:01:07.290> mini<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
here about like a galaxy s5 mini and the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.609 
here about like a galaxy s5 mini and the
next<00:01:09.000> generation<00:01:09.110> galaxy<00:01:10.110> mega<00:01:10.320> device

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
next generation galaxy mega device

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
next generation galaxy mega device
second<00:01:11.040> generation<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.950> seems<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
second generation so it seems like the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.700 
second generation so it seems like the
gallic<00:01:15.509> next<00:01:15.840> galaxies<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.360> galaxy<00:01:18.680> s5<00:01:19.680> mini

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
gallic next galaxies and galaxy s5 mini

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.330 
gallic next galaxies and galaxy s5 mini
is<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> 4.5<00:01:21.299> inch<00:01:21.509> device<00:01:22.340> model

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is going to be a 4.5 inch device model

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.399 
is going to be a 4.5 inch device model
number<00:01:23.610> g800<00:01:24.350> gonna<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> 720p<00:01:26.340> display

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
number g800 gonna have a 720p display

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.780 
number g800 gonna have a 720p display
there<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.860> kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> source<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
there was a kind of like a source that

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.560 
there was a kind of like a source that
Jesus<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> marina<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.380> was<00:01:31.500> saying<00:01:32.570> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
Jesus a marina had that was saying that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.350 
Jesus a marina had that was saying that
the<00:01:34.020> some<00:01:34.860> information<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.729> could<00:01:36.210> be

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
the some information here that could be

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
the some information here that could be
maybe<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> s4<00:01:37.290> mean<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.560> gonna<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.829> snap

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
maybe the s4 mean is gonna have snap

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
maybe the s4 mean is gonna have snap
again<00:01:38.189> 800<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.060> seemly<00:01:39.659> nice

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
again 800 that would be seemly nice

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.960 
again 800 that would be seemly nice
because<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> lot<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:40.710> mid-range<00:01:41.520> devices

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because a lot of these mid-range devices

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
because a lot of these mid-range devices
is<00:01:42.119> using<00:01:42.450> Snapdragon<00:01:42.869> 400<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.040> as

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
is using Snapdragon 400 and it's not as

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
is using Snapdragon 400 and it's not as
good<00:01:44.310> definitely<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.119> good<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.420> snapping

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
good definitely not as good as snapping

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.569 
good definitely not as good as snapping
Nissan<00:01:46.110> snapping<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> Hannah<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.250> seen

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
Nissan snapping it Hannah would be seen

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.359 
Nissan snapping it Hannah would be seen
on<00:01:47.790> s5<00:01:48.180> mini<00:01:48.210> would<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.780> epic<00:01:49.070> but<00:01:50.070> I'm<00:01:50.159> really

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
on s5 mini would be epic but I'm really

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.499 
on s5 mini would be epic but I'm really
not<00:01:50.520> sure<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.729> we're<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> see<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.299> but

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
not sure if we're going to see that but

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.230 
not sure if we're going to see that but
that<00:01:51.630> would<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.020> nice<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> 4.5<00:01:54.030> inch

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that would be very nice it's a 4.5 inch

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.560 
that would be very nice it's a 4.5 inch

Europe or in us as well that would be
pretty<00:02:37.700> pretty<00:02:37.970> epic<00:02:38.620> but<00:02:39.620> I'm<00:02:39.709> really<00:02:39.890> not

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
pretty pretty epic but I'm really not

pretty pretty epic but I'm really not
sure<00:02:40.130> about<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:40.700> they<00:02:41.000> will<00:02:41.150> definitely

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
sure about that but they will definitely

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.210 
sure about that but they will definitely
be<00:02:41.630> pretty<00:02:41.840> nice<00:02:42.080> but<00:02:42.380> they<00:02:42.620> definitely<00:02:42.860> the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
be pretty nice but they definitely the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.470 
be pretty nice but they definitely the
galaxy<00:02:43.610> phone<00:02:43.790> mini<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.330> be<00:02:44.420> an

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
galaxy phone mini is going to be an

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.000 
galaxy phone mini is going to be an
interesting<00:02:44.870> device<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.650> look<00:02:45.830> out

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
interesting device to have a look out

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.400 
interesting device to have a look out
for<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.670> also<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.510> next<00:02:47.780> generation<00:02:48.170> make<00:02:48.380> a

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
for and also the next generation make a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.890 
for and also the next generation make a
device<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:49.010> see<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:50.150> kind<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.360> opera<00:02:50.690> sit

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
device to see it what kind of opera sit

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.259 
device to see it what kind of opera sit
down<00:02:51.110> hopefully<00:02:51.560> they<00:02:51.739> made<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.550> display<00:02:52.940> even

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
down hopefully they made it display even

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.280 
down hopefully they made it display even
better<00:02:54.550> especially<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.480> viewing<00:02:56.900> angles

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
better especially the the viewing angles

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.570 
better especially the the viewing angles
on<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.100> galaxy<00:02:58.880> mega<00:02:59.090> needs<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.569> be<00:02:59.959> improved

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
on the galaxy mega needs to be improved

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.759 
on the galaxy mega needs to be improved
so<00:03:01.580> well<00:03:01.910> yeah<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.630> quick<00:03:02.810> video<00:03:03.290> talking

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
so well yeah it's a quick video talking

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.750 
so well yeah it's a quick video talking
about<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.549> so<00:03:04.819> hopefully<00:03:05.239> in<00:03:05.780> joy<00:03:06.380> yeah<00:03:07.100> pick

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
about that so hopefully in joy yeah pick

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.910 
about that so hopefully in joy yeah pick
up
