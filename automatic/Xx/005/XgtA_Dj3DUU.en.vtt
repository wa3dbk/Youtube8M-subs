00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
mk3 for the first time I've plugged it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.799 
mk3 for the first time I've plugged it
in<00:00:40.579> as<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.120> back<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.750> know

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
if you can make that ass kind of dark

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
if you can make that ass kind of dark
back<00:00:44.399> here<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.059> mk3<00:00:45.600> PCB<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> back<00:00:46.649> here

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
back here but the mk3 PCB is back here

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
back here but the mk3 PCB is back here
and<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.640> mk3<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> first

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and so is the you mk3 so for the first

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:59.440 
and so is the you mk3 so for the first
time<00:00:49.110> we'll<00:00:49.289> turn<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450

space<00:03:25.239> right<00:03:25.480> here<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.050> I'll<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.260> mk1

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
space right here for so I'll have mk1

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.440 
space right here for so I'll have mk1
mk2<00:03:28.650> mk3<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:30.070> have<00:03:30.280> no<00:03:30.400> desire<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:30.850> get<00:03:30.910> mk4<00:03:31.420> I

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
mk2 mk3 I have no desire to get mk4 I

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.330 
mk2 mk3 I have no desire to get mk4 I
don't<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.050> k4<00:03:32.440> i<00:03:32.470> just<00:03:32.709> have<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.860> PCB

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
don't like in k4 i just have the PCB

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.740 
don't like in k4 i just have the PCB
just<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.670> have<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.970> collection<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.510> games<00:03:35.410> but

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
just to have the collection of games but

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.970 
just to have the collection of games but
I'm<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:37.959> more<00:03:38.080> happy<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.500> finally<00:03:38.709> got

this as you can see there's only one

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.509 
this as you can see there's only one
combat<00:03:41.049> code<00:03:41.320> left<00:03:41.590> because<00:03:41.799> it's<00:03:41.950> mk3

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
combat code left because it's mk3

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.580 
combat code left because it's mk3
whereas<00:03:42.790> this<00:03:42.940> three<00:03:43.299> so<00:03:44.170> I'm<00:03:44.260> gonna<00:03:44.350> have<00:03:44.470> to

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
whereas this three so I'm gonna have to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.789 
whereas this three so I'm gonna have to
activate<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.310> activate<00:03:45.670> smoke<00:03:46.000> but

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
activate that to activate smoke but

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.220 
activate that to activate smoke but
there<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.630> lot<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.660> people<00:03:49.750> when<00:03:49.989> waiting

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230

there it is a lot of people when waiting
to<00:03:50.290> get<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.590> PCB<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.310> lot<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.580> who<00:03:51.670> have<00:03:51.790> been

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
to get this PCB a lot of who have been

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.289 
to get this PCB a lot of who have been
looking<00:03:52.150> for<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:53.220> finally<00:03:54.220> someone<00:03:55.180> has

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
looking for it and finally someone has
