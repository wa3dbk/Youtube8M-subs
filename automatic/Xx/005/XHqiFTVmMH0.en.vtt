00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.470
 all right 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 + 2 guys we are here back in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:22.289
 minecraft and let's see the review of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.180
 snap 3 114 w32 the first thing you do towards 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.980
 pretty good and does a lot of kind of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.509
 actions are not and I think the only one 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.809
 I did never arrived will publish if you 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.850
 the first and good thing is that we have some 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.440
 measures things that you are seeing in the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.780
 little houses on this stand are a tad 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.239
 see the inventory but no longer colors 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 so that the head is moved but 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.010
 well I'm already seeing here first 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 the box socks as you know the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.050
 unique in my head of many tenible in 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.999
 his rival is that of winter but the lord 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.769
 dinner bonadío that these three are 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.269
 obtainable left their rival I do not know 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.640
 still as I suppose it will be a subject 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.950
 very rare or will be some dalián 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.010
 and then in the player's house everything is 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.560
 being sustainable by now it seems and 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.700
 well now it touches the subject that all the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.010
 world hopes that a lot has been done 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.630
 spoiler and they are the sixth ones that are a 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.079
 kind of banners 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.820
 it's a kind of flags with the 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.560
 colors will bring the 16 colors of 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.110
 laurent currently also kraft is 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.009
 they can rotate as I have done a test 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.750
 also when the copies are a tad 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.290
 mothers I'm going to tell you dry that it's a 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.020
 black 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.470
 as for example it is dry forever 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.380
 the black 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.150
 but good if we put it like that you can see that 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.530
 they rotate as if they were total posters 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 according to one on top of another 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.770
 to the block with a will show you hip hop it 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.390
 up or is it work 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 and also for example when they put on 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.229
 on the wall is very cool but it remains 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.810
 there is also this effect 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:58.479
 block very well targeted this block 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.920
 then the castle with wool with such no 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.689
 then the other one came out 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.970
 it's going to happen 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.220
 just in case made with wool with rope 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.440
 with everything that happened 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.250
 obviously nothing can be one more and it is 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.110
 why 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.100
 to see if well well dies that 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.100
 it can be a thing 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.820
 A) Yes 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.820
 eye like a poster 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.080
 there are houses and here we have other guys 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.560
 with the colored wool and with a poster 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.060
 wood but with wool we do not know if 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.280
 we can have dinner with them for now 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.650
 many people are decorative at least 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.170
 for now and a truth that are very 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.090
 very cool and also is saying something else 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.560
 is that it was rumored a lot that there was going to be 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.700
 rendering an-32 trunks does not feel 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.940
 take a journalist by number not what 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.940
 carries 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.510
 and it was also rumored and that is increased 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.620
 what cbs a handful I've been 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.500
 trying a little bit for this world 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.900
 in another 10 fps improvement as much 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.819
 there has not been so much improvement either 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.650
 photos with two thousand and so many fish and such 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.500
 have seen on twitter and good if not 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.610
 I'll have it on screen but I 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.440
 honestly he did not get anything 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.310
 speed and that at the moment minecraft 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.890
 it raised it to a quite many fps it is but not 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.110
 I know why not if you did not get it and have 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.489
 well you know each attraction of each 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.959
 one of the bands with his kind of his 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.290
 nona color for example the motion 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.290
 yellow 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.170
 and a wool stick and a stick 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.590
 we pick up the table here we put a 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.470
 little stick 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.980
 and if you grana 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.720
 I want to win 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.280
 so guys I hope that I have 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.890
 liked this review is not very big 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.690
 neither and it takes so many things an option 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.530
 I have not seen any command so a 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.510
 new command or nothing 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.740
 but hey guys, I know how 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.900
 fired the personal video and something else 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.680
 very important and it is that I was 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.090
 making and proposing that you want to put 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.190
 we can paint ourselves not only 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.130
 are these 16 patterns can be made 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.569
 things like for example is and good if 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.360
 you want to know how how they are made is very 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.160
 simple we take a show flag 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.190
 more attractive to him where I want 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.260
 for example here and a dye is better 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.900
 green in the center and I have a circle 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.280
 green then I put in this corner a 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.280
 red rose 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.620
 one 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.700
 another here 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.270
 we have another pattern way in re 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.900
 and I can have it this way 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.289
 painting the different pieces the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.849
 patterns and I have not found 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.800
 suppose a handful 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.400
 but it does not matter where they are going to commit 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.620
 simultaneous dye 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.449
 seems to be a tad limited yet 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.190
 but it is assumed that more and more why 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.460
 you can detect ndc1 tags an area 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.460
 girl 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.310
 if we go to this one but 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.800
 and it's not supposed to go anymore 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.190
 as bowling white director leave the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.190
 ninetys and 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.760
 surely you can do more 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.760
 only with a drawing nugget 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.669
 the most sure eye with the serious crisis 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.669
 but this is very classic 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.020
 look look look look for example face 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.020
 of crooper 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:41.759
 or it is very very classic creation 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.759
 classic best the skeleton 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.680
 he does not write if it is very clear that he is going to 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.190
 be the best player 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.190
 steve 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.610
 well you guys know you can make a 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.230
 handful of patterns and good honestly 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.560
 but the green area so let's take 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.550
 the experience really the episode 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.940
 only cut the farewell to 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.940
 previous 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.509
 and this is the same 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:21.660
 and it is already 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.480
 already leaves the flu 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.449
 and it would be flag 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.999
 I have where we place yes 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.999
 and here we have the clipper's flag and 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.210
 on top of this for example here 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.990
 We're going to do things as it is to 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.850
 just write the face 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.360
 better or as I would do it would be 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.360
 First 

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:54.850
 Boys 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.850
 these lateral winds 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.570
 and so 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:11.060
 to place Grüber 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.060
 today he has traveled the island monkey 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.920
 How much is there and good, sure 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.930
 5000 million patterns but good of 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.340
 only against these I hope 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.080
 that you like and see you in the next 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.080
 episode to god
