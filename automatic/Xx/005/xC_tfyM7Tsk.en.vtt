00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.870
 well, this is the road 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.920
 that goes from san agustÃ­n de guadalix to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.920
 old apiary 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.310
 as you see yesterday in the vicinity of 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.460
 madrid and tonight look how they come 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.590
 the cars snowed yesterday in the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.590
 surroundings of madrid new 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.430
 also to the white 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.860
 we go to 3 degrees 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.250
 I do not know I want to teach you how you are going 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.450
 curves the tournament will make the jump 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.450
 slightly wet 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.120
 I hope there is no ice but 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.120
 enough salt had been poured 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.120
 road looks clean 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.320
 and some areas are quite dry 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.320
 of shadow like this 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 if we advance there is a lot of face traffic 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.440
 why 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.920
 they are going to someone in their life 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.650
 and at the exit of the curve, taking advantage 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.650
 we go ahead without any problem 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.060
 Pretty snow is delicate the asphalt 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.820
 without excesses 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.200
 except that an ice plate then 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.360
 It will be an order excess 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.300
 I have the camera connected in case there is 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.100
 an ice sheet 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.400
 and I give three cartwheels out of the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.400
 highway 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.439
 so that it is 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.439
 live recording 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.850
 good as you see it goes up well 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.450
 if you use the change it comes in handy 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.450
 in the curves 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.060
 very variable 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.640
 it's big but to handle you I do not know how much 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.390
 measure that I'll tell you another time 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.390
 because I do not know how much 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.870
 which is going to that I can overtake
