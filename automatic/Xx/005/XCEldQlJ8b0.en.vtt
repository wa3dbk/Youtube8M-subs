00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.420
 we have the weather now so far 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.490
 ready for decoration and so on 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 the jewel and the greenhouse still 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.350
 must be engraved, however, has 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.119
 me the German post to me the online 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.760
 shop still not my package 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.050
 delivered where the materials in it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.730
 so we need something for 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.199
 in between and that's why we do it 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.790
 now wanted the slice of the spit 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.170
 I actually only do it after that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.460
 We'll do that for you now 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.229
 from the ash that we use for sword 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.269
 have used each of the stripes the 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:45.089
 left and right have fallen off and 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:51.330
 then cut our scabbard out of it 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:53.129
 circle is again for that we put 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.720
 at first that hampers with me 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.830
 hangs up and then go with the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:07.860
 then pencil the exact line around 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:09.180
 to get the milling for the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.439
 Milling work can be found again 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.520
 were a table for the last time 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.680
 we need the router in parallel 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.189
 stop for a few different ones 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.189
 frese 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.079
 with the freese we have the last time 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.609
 Milled the cutting edge and this time 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.290
 of course we need the opposite 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.239
 the scabbard fit then get it 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.870
 As you can see, they fit perfectly 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.459
 together 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.120
 only the milling itself becomes the one 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.120
 be a bit different 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.460
 We are now cutting the top of the divorce 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.320
 the jewel for that i have this 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.340
 penciled and taped not the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.340
 then sufficient with the jigsaw 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.630
 the two halves are now ready 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.239
 milled law can stay together 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.430
 Staying together will then be the case 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.209
 cut to the perfect thickness and 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.209
 then grind 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:48.629
 very fresh intermediate box 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.219
 and sword fits next 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.469
 then cut our rowling to the 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.659
 maximum strength to do so I will become one 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.980
 Wall thickness of three to four millimeters 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.230
 let it go everywhere 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.670
 how about it does not necessarily look like 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.500
 let it be like a sword 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.689
 because ours is just a bit difficult 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.109
 Chunkier than this classic movie 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.109
 sword 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.750
 not a basket at home 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.520
 had for the profile on the outside 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.479
 disc along had now again 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.370
 down to the joinery 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.930
 We also have to peel it 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.930
 Let's go 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.210
 do 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.969
 Welcome to the end card I could have 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.800
 not think it's as good hinbekommt 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.139
 it works so well and then too 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.990
 looks so easy is full of 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.699
 giant block or so but again 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.810
 Masterpiece accomplished is really lost 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.979
 because I actually think about it when we do that 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.629
 range from the handle now here with 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.639
 So wrap up blue leather 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.770
 a cross pattern or something like that we have 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.169
 At least once blue with it looks like that 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.300
 as if it really is master 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.960
 hard she stays down in the 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.759
 Comments 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.219
 or on facebook where you can now 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.620
 because some of you have no 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.060
 youtube apparently no account 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.689
 I wish you all a wonderful 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.039
 Weekend until next week then shows 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.810
 all my videos in the world 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.029
 or cat roma and who else everything 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.069
 liked then my thumb goes 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:08.210
 above or two depending on how many 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.909
 from 34 or so if I'm fine then I'm fine 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.159
 of course, down 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.870
 but not much happens 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.110
 you know then I know if I'm something 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.240
 must change or not and then until 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.379
 next video ears stiff and hold 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.129
 do not subscribe 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.129
 see you
