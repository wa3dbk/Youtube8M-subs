00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
who haven't seen Eliza big Christ

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:48.140 
who haven't seen Eliza big Christ
platinum<00:04:45.590> what<00:04:46.590> suppose<00:04:47.070> happened<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.669> cortex

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
platinum what suppose happened to cortex

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.499 
platinum what suppose happened to cortex
and<00:04:48.870> what<00:04:49.289> about<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.770> cortex<00:04:50.310> or<00:04:50.580> tech<00:04:50.880> it's

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
and what about the cortex or tech it's

00:04:51.509 --> 00:05:12.140 
and what about the cortex or tech it's
still<00:04:51.930> up<00:04:52.199> there

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.160 

you<00:05:13.150> wanna<00:05:13.360> quiet<00:05:13.780> all<00:05:14.140> of<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.500> gems

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
you wanna quiet all of the gems

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.440 
you wanna quiet all of the gems
incredible<00:05:19.320> crisp<00:05:20.320> enough<00:05:21.010> only<00:05:21.370> means<00:05:22.090> of

incredible crisp enough only means of

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.360 
incredible crisp enough only means of
harnessing<00:05:22.990> planetary<00:05:23.950> energy<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:26.740> gems

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
harnessing planetary energy the gems

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.300 
harnessing planetary energy the gems
have<00:05:27.820> that<00:05:28.120> ability<00:05:28.450> as<00:05:28.810> well<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.530> with<00:05:30.040> them

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
have that ability as well and with them

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.710 
have that ability as well and with them
I<00:05:30.610> can<00:05:31.210> destroy<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.870> cortex<00:05:32.500> vortex<00:05:33.240> forever

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.760
