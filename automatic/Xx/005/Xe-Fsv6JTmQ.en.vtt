of this nifty knitter you may be using
both<00:00:30.300> ends<00:00:31.550> we<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.230> at

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
both ends we are going to use the one at

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.750 
both ends we are going to use the one at
the<00:00:35.340> beginning<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.380> to<00:00:37.380> anchor<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the beginning here to anchor the the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.170 
the beginning here to anchor the the
yarn<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.329> start<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.309> we<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.940> need

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
yarn to start with we are going to need

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.229 
yarn to start with we are going to need
to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.570> two<00:00:42.989> rows<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.620> weaving<00:00:44.340> before<00:00:44.969> we

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
to do two rows of weaving before we

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.080 
to do two rows of weaving before we
start<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:48.110> moving<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.530> stitches<00:00:50.090> so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
start actually moving the stitches so

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.799 
start actually moving the stitches so
let's<00:00:51.780> start<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:54.420> going

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
let's start and as you can see I'm going

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.160 
let's start and as you can see I'm going
to<00:00:55.199> anchor<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> yarn<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to anchor the yarn I'm just going to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.400 
to anchor the yarn I'm just going to
wrap<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.559> around<00:00:58.859> once<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.000> hold<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.020> down<00:01:01.170> with

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
wrap it around once I hold it down with

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.679 
wrap it around once I hold it down with
my<00:01:01.680> thumb<00:01:01.710> also<00:01:03.500> now<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.519> go<00:01:05.729> around

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
my thumb also now I'm going to go around

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.660 
my thumb also now I'm going to go around
and<00:01:07.490> then<00:01:08.900> come<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.170> an<00:01:10.409> angle<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and then come at an angle to the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.570 
and then come at an angle to the
opposite<00:01:12.270> peg<00:01:12.540> wrap<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.330> again<00:01:15.330> come<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.580> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
opposite peg wrap and again come to the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.060 
opposite peg wrap and again come to the
opposite<00:01:18.150> peg<00:01:18.740> wrap<00:01:19.740> around<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.170> each<00:01:22.170> time<00:01:22.619> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
opposite peg wrap around and each time I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.630 
opposite peg wrap around and each time I
want<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:25.049> yarn<00:01:25.380> crosses<00:01:26.189> over

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
want to see that my yarn crosses over

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.140 
want to see that my yarn crosses over
itself<00:01:27.229> if<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.590> doesn't<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> comes<00:01:29.880> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
itself if it doesn't if it comes this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.569 
itself if it doesn't if it comes this
way<00:01:30.210> straight<00:01:30.930> across<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.310> correct

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
way straight across this is not correct

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.319 
way straight across this is not correct
it's<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.320> go<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.770> an<00:01:34.920> angle

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
it's going to have to go at an angle

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.100 
it's going to have to go at an angle
wrap<00:01:36.329> around<00:01:37.520> around<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
wrap around around and I'm going to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:53.859 
wrap around around and I'm going to
continue<00:01:41.150> going<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:43.560> loom

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.310 

as<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.380> I'll<00:01:56.250> pull<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.909> yarn<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.600> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
as I go I'll pull out more yarn and I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.499 
as I go I'll pull out more yarn and I
also<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:59.040> my<00:01:59.070> thumb<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> hold<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> down

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
also use my thumb to hold it down

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.990 
also use my thumb to hold it down
because<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> release<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:02.729> whole

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
because if you release it the whole

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.809 
because if you release it the whole
thing<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.850> unravel<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
thing is going to unravel for you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:23.980 
thing is going to unravel for you
continue<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.420> move

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.770 

you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.190> also<00:02:25.550> use<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> thicker<00:02:26.630> yarn<00:02:28.780> this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
you can also use a thicker yarn this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.440 
you can also use a thicker yarn this
particularly<00:02:30.380> yarn<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.790> little<00:02:32.150> thinner

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450

that it doesn't unravel now I'm going to

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.470 
that it doesn't unravel now I'm going to
take<00:03:14.510> my<00:03:14.720> fingers<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.410> push<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:17.000> yarn<00:03:17.330> down

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
all the way to the bottom this is very

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.430 
all the way to the bottom this is very
important<00:03:21.470> because<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.730> want<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.840> leave<00:03:24.110> room
