00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.460
 in very good was here continues commenting 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:07.290
 I am again a gameplay of blacos 3 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.059
 and here we have kids playing with the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.249
 weapon that is called normal ceiba 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.990
 semiautomatic have the same damage or a 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.339
 partial damage of the fal but it is a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.749
 slightly slower and Alava will see the 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.220
 gameplay apart from this weapon in this 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.020
 start welcome from those of one of the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.030
 skills with ie the characters 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.290
 more che is 2 of the black ops 3 not 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.580
 surely some of a little bit of 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.770
 disgust but I'm going to go in explains 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 oslo because as I saw it some time ago 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.500
 I was a little shocked and 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.880
 I also wanted to try it as I told you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.039
 when I'm rolling in the compression 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 Germany especially besides making very 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.370
 good games I wanted to try things and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.960
 here you have it kids is the battle 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.400
 definitive but returns with another name 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.280
 that is called king to how are you seeing 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.470
 there in the good field that bracelet does not 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.290
 we could say so good memories 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.550
 is what again, so I tell you that I'm still 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.750
 having white gameplays 3 worth 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.670
 to go up these days talking 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.170
 different little things and such so that you 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.460
 I will upload one every 23 days for the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.720
 visitors videos to the channel still then 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.829
 Take advantage to do it as well 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.720
 during the beta to have a lot of 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.340
 white gameplay 3 and apart good from 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.570
 do as little as you can guides 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.460
 of weapons but surely also 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.379
 we must then arms but do not be 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.940
 everything focused on the beta so good 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.510
 Well, the truth is that I also have to 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.160
 talk before 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.440
 start with the video of the support you had 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.330
 the day before he does not say it, I did not say it 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.160
 by comment that I told you in plan in 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.510
 text and it's that well obviously 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.370
 ok you know that I'm not much of 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 ask for likes but obviously this is a 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.920
 exclusive and good content there is for 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 example one thing I wanted to talk about 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.270
 which then I will focus on what it 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 I wanted to say is that many times 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.140
 for the support because really when 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 activision go see what we have done 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.440
 youtubers say we have 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.940
 invited for us to record the game and 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 for him as 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.630
 let's go let's advertise the game 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 not then if you enter the video and see 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.690
 a lot of likes like the other one 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.370
 obviously they are going to fix 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.050
 more in us so that we can continue 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.150
 going to more events to record more 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.530
 so gameplays either white 3 or 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.030
 in the future of the following games of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.410
 call of duty not then this is going to be 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.910
 good for both you and me 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.050
 here again we have the ability 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.220
 so let's go a little bit to 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.050
 talk about that if it seems good to you before 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 nothing to also tell you that punch 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.690
 that you ask me a lot that I put and not 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.950
 I kill that also happens another day of 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.469
 lempira of the m 8 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.299
 how good in this game does not kill a 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.469
 hit unless you're wearing the 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.810
 knife that in this case it will be 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.280
 when he sees with the shields running 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.470
 then places the uncle you put him a 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.269
 culatazo the gun did not kill a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.370
 milk is worth it you leave it simply touched 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.019
 so it will no longer pass on that that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.610
 you fuck the streak because an uncle is 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.769
 scares gives the button to stab and you 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.690
 stabbed so in that aspect then to 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.640
 I think it's fine because if you want 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.750
 poke a punch gets rebounded and then 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.730
 if it was shot that is a little ball 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.290
 you go to kill him then I see that 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.580
 pretty good so good in terms of 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.200
 the ability to reyal making 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.670
 Obviously, when you have the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.110
 down on the right you see that little circle that 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.819
 has a kind of hard line we're going to 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.799
 say the little symbol because what it does is 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.750
 that when you have it full the subject is 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.940
 in that time you see I have it full when 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.099
 they kill you what happens is that you are left 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.690
 let's say you stay on the floor 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.459
 thrown away you will not see that what you see 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.260
 now inside a ratillo again that 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.760
 is the floor thrown away and you have a period 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.680
 to revive you if you want is not 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.360
 say now for example I think we have 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.340
 a against to lower one against one what 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.780
 you will see and well I do not know why but 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.130
 We do not kill at the same time I kill him 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.690
 obviously to me he does not because I have the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.489
 skill is and as I lay down in the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.739
 soil reactivated it and I escaped not 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.790
 then stability is broken in parts 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.040
 and now it's the most 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.780
 but it has its limitations is to say you 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.219
 you are on the floor to the uncle you can not 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.719
 shoot vale is not like last battle 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.090
 definitive that you are on the floor and the 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.829
 Uncle could shoot you, you can not 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.480
 shoot and in fact he while he 's in 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.769
 The soil can not kill you, it's worth it 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.319
 there is a kind of fog that covers you 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.120
 anyway you when while 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.680
 they are raising vale is when you have 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.790
 take advantage of escape 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.079
 you can shoot you can only shoot 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.250
 when that you take off the bracelet 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.769
 new is as you have seen then 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.970
 is enclosed in quotes yes but no 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.010
 you can kill mental nobody are in the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.239
 soil while practically escaping 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.950
 neither stability is made for 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.269
 save you from the gusts is worth saying no 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.250
 is meant to fuck people 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.989
 valence so to speak part team 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.000
 that fuck their knife not but more than 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.280
 to kill him is to save you 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.720
 that is to say that to kill you you save yourself and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.340
 you pyres and continue your streak you see how 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.930
 it does not take away my streak any time like this 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.310
 which is one of the things I wanted 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.930
 highlight also that it is a 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.099
 skill that helps us to fuck but 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.480
 that serves to save you so I 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.530
 I see pretty well and quite balanced 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.389
 in quotation marks we should then in the 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.439
 game and by the way to tell you also that 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.450
 This weapon, as I said, is a 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.040
 kind of fail is semiautomatic kills 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.450
 two to three shots and it's a little bit 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.709
 slow and raise with rapid fire so that 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.450
 shoot a bit faster but still 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.590
 it's a little sale that's like the uncle 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.180
 the hitch in the two bullets until 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.989
 pretty far 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.630
 so you know that I have to 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.100
 too long so far up here 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.840
 liked to leave your liked 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.840
 favorites and their various problems 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.509
 yes
