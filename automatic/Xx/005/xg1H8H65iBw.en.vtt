00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
way so the students don't even realize

way so the students don't even realize
that<00:02:13.180> they're<00:02:13.540> learning<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:14.560> they're

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
that they're learning because they're

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.920

they're going to use the material I
thought<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.630> was<00:02:40.750> great<00:02:41.079> I'm<00:02:41.410> always<00:02:41.620> happy<00:02:41.950> to

into science and social studies and

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.870 
into science and social studies and
because<00:02:53.799> it's<00:02:53.950> important<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.519> think<00:02:54.670> of

because it's important to think of
Education<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:56.079> it's<00:02:56.200> being<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.500> holistic

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160

instead<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.910> fragmented<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.530> unique<00:03:00.010> and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
instead of fragmented it is unique and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.800 
instead of fragmented it is unique and
nobody's<00:03:02.140> ever<00:03:02.290> talked<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.829> us<00:03:03.010> about

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
nobody's ever talked to us about

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.030 
nobody's ever talked to us about
learning<00:03:04.810> about<00:03:05.079> minerals<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.799> know<00:03:05.890> that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
learning about minerals you know that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.400 
learning about minerals you know that
was<00:03:06.160> somehow<00:03:06.340> relegated<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> chemistry

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
was somehow relegated to a chemistry
