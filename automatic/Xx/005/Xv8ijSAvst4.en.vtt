00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
in the whole entire movie is basically

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.440 
in the whole entire movie is basically
an<00:05:00.040> afterthought<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.550> there's<00:05:00.850> more<00:05:01.030> focus

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
an afterthought and there's more focus

on the overuse of CGI in this film now I
like<00:05:04.090> CGI<00:05:04.480> but<00:05:04.870> if<00:05:04.960> it's<00:05:05.110> not<00:05:05.290> needed<00:05:05.500> then

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
like CGI but if it's not needed then

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.590 
like CGI but if it's not needed then
don't<00:05:06.040> use<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.280> or<00:05:06.640> don't<00:05:06.850> over<00:05:07.150> use<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.480> when

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
don't use it or don't over use it when

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.540
