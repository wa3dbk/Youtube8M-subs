somebody<00:01:30.180> look<00:01:30.360> less<00:01:30.689> attractive<00:01:31.290> because

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

now<00:01:38.430> acne<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.119> clogged<00:01:39.720> oil<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.380> bacteria<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
now acne is clogged oil and bacteria is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.069 
now acne is clogged oil and bacteria is
there<00:01:41.430> more<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:41.700> than<00:01:42.150> there<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.420> back<00:01:42.750> then

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
there more now than there was back then

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.620 
there more now than there was back then
there's<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.340> proof<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.880> cats<00:01:45.210> get

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
there's actually proof that cats get

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
there's actually proof that cats get
blackheads<00:01:46.200> kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.649> by<00:01:46.770> their<00:01:46.950> ears<00:01:47.189> there

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
blackheads kind of by their ears there

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.870 
blackheads kind of by their ears there
is<00:01:48.299> acne<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.049> stems<00:01:49.409> way<00:01:49.770> way<00:01:50.040> back<00:01:50.250> into

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
is acne that stems way way back into

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.480 
is acne that stems way way back into
kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.180> ancient<00:01:51.689> times<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.259> well<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
kind of ancient times as well but it

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.800 
kind of ancient times as well but it
just<00:01:53.520> seemed<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:53.939> there<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.720> an

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just seemed like there is more of an

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.530 
just seemed like there is more of an
influx<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.500> recent<00:01:55.920> years<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.790> could<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> be

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
influx in recent years now could that be

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
influx in recent years now could that be
because<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> food<00:01:58.229> supply<00:01:58.619> could<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.340> be

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
because of the food supply could that be

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
because of the food supply could that be
because<00:01:59.640> of<00:02:00.060> stress<00:02:00.420> factors<00:02:01.070> there<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
because of stress factors there are a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340 
because of stress factors there are a
multitude<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.909> reasons<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> sole<00:02:04.049> point

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
multitude of reasons but the sole point

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.499 
multitude of reasons but the sole point
is<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> acne<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> evolutionary<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.270> its

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
is that acne is evolutionary and its

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
is that acne is evolutionary and its
main<00:02:06.780> purpose<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.829> show<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.069> there's

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
main purpose is to show that there's

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
main purpose is to show that there's
inflammation<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> skin<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.599> problem

are<00:02:10.950> there<00:02:11.190> hormones<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.760> are

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
are there hormones that are

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.470 
are there hormones that are

listened to all this stuff but I have

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.809 
listened to all this stuff but I have
one<00:02:25.060> kidney<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.800> probably<00:02:26.800> have<00:02:27.160> some<00:02:27.400> extreme

digestion issues because of antibiotics

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.130 
digestion issues because of antibiotics
and<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.489> tend<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.880> get<00:02:31.060> my<00:02:31.239> worst<00:02:31.569> cystic

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and I tend to get my worst cystic

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.800 
and I tend to get my worst cystic
pimples<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.830> these<00:02:33.280> areas<00:02:33.730> which<00:02:34.030> correlate

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
pimples in these areas which correlate

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.570 
pimples in these areas which correlate
with<00:02:35.019> hormones<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.769> those<00:02:35.950> kind<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.340> things

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
with hormones and those kind of things

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.699 
with hormones and those kind of things
so<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.150> evolutionary<00:02:37.840> acne<00:02:38.260> was<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.470> way<00:02:38.650> to

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
so so evolutionary acne was a way to

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.369 
so so evolutionary acne was a way to
kind<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.190> indicate<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.640> problem<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:41.019> know<00:02:41.140> just

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
kind of indicate a problem you know just

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.800 
kind of indicate a problem you know just

the wait chickenpox or measles was it's

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.509 
the wait chickenpox or measles was it's
the<00:02:43.959> body<00:02:44.170> fighting<00:02:44.590> off<00:02:44.890> something<00:02:45.280> that's

bad whether it's a virus or bacteria and

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.160 
bad whether it's a virus or bacteria and
evolutionary<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:49.090> think<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.510> it's<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.900> bad

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
evolutionary we think that it's a bad

you<00:02:54.340> know<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:54.880> symmetric<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.900> just

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you know it's not symmetric and just

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.410 
you know it's not symmetric and just
like<00:02:56.709> measles<00:02:56.950> or<00:02:57.340> mumps<00:02:57.400> when<00:02:57.880> we<00:02:58.000> see<00:02:58.239> that

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
like measles or mumps when we see that

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.479 
like measles or mumps when we see that
we<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:58.840> dangerous<00:02:59.410> smallpox<00:02:59.950> chicken<00:03:00.190> pox

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
we think dangerous smallpox chicken pox

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.339 
we think dangerous smallpox chicken pox
this<00:03:00.910> could<00:03:01.090> infect<00:03:01.390> us<00:03:01.599> this<00:03:01.750> could<00:03:01.930> hurt<00:03:02.110> us

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
this could infect us this could hurt us

acne<00:03:03.099> mimics<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.670> even<00:03:04.180> though<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.420> not<00:03:04.540> as

extreme and you're not going to die from
it<00:03:06.549> usually<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.090> don't<00:03:07.209> think<00:03:07.480> there's<00:03:07.630> any

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
it usually I don't think there's any

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.130 
it usually I don't think there's any
case<00:03:08.349> of<00:03:08.769> people<00:03:09.190> dying<00:03:09.549> from<00:03:09.760> acne<00:03:10.180> but

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
case of people dying from acne but

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.860 
case of people dying from acne but
because<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.680> looks<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:12.010> those<00:03:12.190> other<00:03:12.340> things

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870

because it looks like those other things
evolutionarily<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:14.380> think<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.579> less

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
evolutionarily we think that it is less
