several<00:00:09.190> options<00:00:09.670> and<00:00:09.940> I<00:00:10.090> find<00:00:10.420> that<00:00:10.510> those

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
several options and I find that those

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.110 
several options and I find that those
options<00:00:11.050> changed<00:00:11.950> for<00:00:12.160> me<00:00:12.309> depending<00:00:12.820> on<00:00:12.940> what

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
options changed for me depending on what

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
you're walking when you bend over your

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.160 
you're walking when you bend over your
arrows<00:00:36.309> fall<00:00:36.610> out<00:00:36.820> they<00:00:37.030> grab<00:00:37.300> on<00:00:37.570> branches

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
arrows fall out they grab on branches

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.320

shooting<00:00:40.750> and<00:00:40.870> roving<00:00:41.170> because<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.620> carries

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
shooting and roving because it carries

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.969 
shooting and roving because it carries
lots<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.339> arrow<00:00:42.519> another<00:00:43.330> option<00:00:43.900> is<00:00:44.080> the<00:00:44.620> bow

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
lots of arrow another option is the bow

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.280 
lots of arrow another option is the bow
quiver<00:00:45.339> it<00:00:45.699> attaches<00:00:46.269> right<00:00:46.300> onto<00:00:46.479> your<00:00:46.750> bow

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
quiver it attaches right onto your bow

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.439 
quiver it attaches right onto your bow
usually<00:00:47.979> carries<00:00:48.339> between<00:00:48.489> four<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.120> six

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
usually carries between four and six

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.660 
usually carries between four and six
arrows<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.140> it's<00:00:50.680> real<00:00:50.830> simple<00:00:51.159> all<00:00:51.400> you<00:00:51.580> do

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
arrows and it's real simple all you do

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.640 
arrows and it's real simple all you do
is<00:00:51.790> reach<00:00:52.000> down<00:00:52.030> pull<00:00:52.570> your<00:00:52.600> ear<00:00:52.930> off<00:00:53.140> put<00:00:53.559> it

is reach down pull your ear off put it

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.110 
is reach down pull your ear off put it
on<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.920> Strand<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.370> you're<00:00:54.489> ready<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.790> shoot

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
on the Strand and you're ready to shoot

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.149 
on the Strand and you're ready to shoot
not<00:00:55.659> a<00:00:55.690> lot<00:00:55.960> of<00:00:55.989> movement<00:00:56.320> not<00:00:56.799> a<00:00:56.860> lot<00:00:57.129> of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
not a lot of movement not a lot of

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.270 
not a lot of movement not a lot of
jumping<00:00:57.670> around<00:00:57.760> anything<00:00:58.479> like<00:00:58.659> that<00:00:59.280> now

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
jumping around anything like that now

the bow quiver that we carry which is

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.410 
the bow quiver that we carry which is
the<00:01:02.500> Thunder<00:01:02.830> horn<00:01:03.070> quiver<00:01:03.339> one<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.239> nice

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
the Thunder horn quiver one of the nice

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.410 
the Thunder horn quiver one of the nice
things<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.110> work<00:01:05.530> on<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:06.010> recurve<00:01:06.729> it'll

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
things is it work on a recurve it'll

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.200 
things is it work on a recurve it'll
work<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:08.170> flat<00:01:08.710> bow<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.790> work<00:01:10.000> on<00:01:10.180> a

laminated long bow they're very
versatile<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.960> of<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.140> nice<00:01:14.409> simple<00:01:14.950> design

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
versatile one of the nice simple design

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.889 
versatile one of the nice simple design
functions<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.149> bow<00:01:16.270> quiver<00:01:16.689> that's

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
functions of the bow quiver that's

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.660 
functions of the bow quiver that's
simple<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.409> get<00:01:17.530> off<00:01:17.740> all<00:01:18.009> you<00:01:18.130> do<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.369> undo

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
simple to get off all you do is undo

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.649 
simple to get off all you do is undo
that<00:01:18.820> strap<00:01:18.969> pull<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:20.049> quiver<00:01:20.320> off<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:22.479> like

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
that strap pull the quiver off just like

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.660 
that strap pull the quiver off just like
so<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.439> also<00:01:23.590> works<00:01:24.009> if<00:01:24.219> you<00:01:24.340> have<00:01:24.640> a

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
so and it also works if you have a

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.039 
so and it also works if you have a
friend<00:01:25.030> that's<00:01:25.090> left-handed<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:25.780> must<00:01:25.960> a

borrow your quiver you can put it on the

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.450 
borrow your quiver you can put it on the
left-hand<00:01:27.880> side<00:01:28.090> on<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.450> left-handed<00:01:28.960> bow

another<00:01:30.460> option<00:01:31.000> one<00:01:31.299> that<00:01:31.479> I<00:01:31.509> designs<00:01:32.049> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
another option one that I designs the

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.410 
another option one that I designs the
Raptor<00:01:32.710> side<00:01:32.950> quiver<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.549> like<00:01:33.939> this<00:01:34.149> because

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
Raptor side quiver I like this because

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.719 
Raptor side quiver I like this because
all<00:01:34.810> my<00:01:34.990> movement<00:01:35.469> is<00:01:35.560> close<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.979> my<00:01:36.130> body<00:01:36.429> I

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
all my movement is close to my body I

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.999 
all my movement is close to my body I
don't<00:01:37.359> have<00:01:37.570> something<00:01:38.020> on<00:01:38.140> my<00:01:38.350> back<00:01:38.560> I<00:01:38.619> can

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
don't have something on my back I can

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.770 
don't have something on my back I can
wear<00:01:39.189> a<00:01:39.219> backpack<00:01:39.549> with<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.240> quiver<00:01:40.509> or<00:01:40.749> a

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.999 
fanny pack and it's real simple all you
do<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.299> reach<00:01:43.509> down<00:01:43.539> here<00:01:44.020> grab<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.829> arrow

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
do is reach down here grab the arrow

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.080 
do is reach down here grab the arrow
behind<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.609> point

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
behind the point

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.179
