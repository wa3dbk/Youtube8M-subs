00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.609
 Good today 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:13.380
 It's an iron Panasonic or the rule 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:17.120
 We will introduce pink to ni wl nanamaru 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.120
 Then I will open 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.960
 Well I'm entering like this 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.230
 Even if you take out the iron , it is empty inside 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.940
 Yes this is a product 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.640
 This manual was included in 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 It comes with a warranty on the back 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.930
 The rest is only the body 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.550
 Hmm 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.560
 It will look like this if you take out all 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.509
 Yes 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.509
 It looks like this as a design 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.820
 8 Well then, it's actually here in Nanamaru , but for a little while that is that 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:30.640
 I use it several times after opening it 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:35.770
 Yes Well now I'd kinda like this state will look briefly this and 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.730
 There's a button here and it 's just like that. 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.710
 Yes 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:44.430
 There is nothing new 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.460
 Then I think that I want to move the place I am actually using 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.460
 Oh 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.620
 Well then I will use it from now on 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.320
 It is 8 ma kore It is already usually this way 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.630
 Yes 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.700
 Well I'm a little Well not quite of Nante the function and that just introduced here 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.370
 Well , I would like to introduce you as soon as possible. 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.020
 First of all 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.920
 Here now 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.500
 The end 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:25.349
 If this is the nest dry steam switching, it will be something that will be called dry now 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.349
 It's a mode, so it's a coast 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.069
 I do not particularly come out 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.469
 Another technique of this middle 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.469
 If we do something called Normal Steam 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:52.120
 I can see this and there is smoke coming out Steam is really 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.530
 I think this is a bit hard to see on the way , but the city ​​has a steam out 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.530
 And next is the biggest 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.650
 High power steam 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.750
 The most intense thing, Hyper Steam, is the number 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.020
 This looks or Nesu' 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.900
 It is a feeling that the steam comes out of 100 million 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.319
 Effort I may not see here 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.569
 Yes Well it will be such things 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.189
 Yes Next 9 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:29.239
 There is a thing called spray mode, but it is a spray button 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.239
 If you press here 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.830
 It is easy to see this is because water is out 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.250
 I can't see for a moment, but it seems like that in a nutshell 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.130
 And it has spray-like water 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.530
 So yes 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:01.220
 Well I thing that can be used at the time of the fine cyano Bridge or was part stubborn wrinkles 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:08.390
 Yes it's just a blurry power shot 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:09.690
 It is a spray, so the function of being a spray is basically not used anymore, so the tax is 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.770
 Well the truth 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:21.860
 As well body Toka Naa and my still point I feel is the best to say for the country 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:26.380
 Of course Tara say that before the iron was Kaikae so had already been almost the other way 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.930
 There are also some really simple reasons as they are, but after all 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.009
 This is right 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:38.750
 That 9 rhombus 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:45.140
 However, of course , the front part of this was of course also usable in the front like this of course until now 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:50.300
 For example, up to now because the back of the part is by it if is behind the original cum is divided To still all 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:52.590
 Because there is easier to use, which are all I thought Naa difficult to use the teeth to fit even Toka back of the part 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.000
 I did this purposely before 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.610
 Such in here to Fu say you Deko now Komae 10 all at such Fu Once you have that it before 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.020
 Likely turn your wrists and everything 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:08.630
 I went there , but I 'm pointed this time from behind, back and front 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.060
 It can withstand even in the back without Well particular need to turn over high, 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.919
 I think this is the point 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.750
 If you're just thinking about the horse video I'm just ironing 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.639
 I think I did not 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:26.689
 It's kind of like that 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:29.749
 There is no problem at all for using it, and after all this is saying that it is to Nanamar 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:36.079
 I do n't think it is a high-end model, but again you 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:41.269
 Because Well new also the Tteyuu higher models do is I ne so that the slip of the individual Ii' 

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:43.099
 I think that there is also an old iron I used quite well before without any problems 

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:46.710
 I will say this once in a while 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:51.780
 It stops, but it is Fukunishi like a brake on that cloth 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:54.700
 I said that he was not good at sliding, but this time there is no problem with this technique 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.500
 In the I stage I am using right now 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.840
 So well still ordinary 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.340
 Ma'a easy to use iron 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.580
 Yes especially big 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:13.690
 Well, in particular I'd not even point to appeal 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.690
 I think that it is easy to use normally without having a bad place 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:21.730
 Well then today's Panasonic's 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.420
 niw l what is pink 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.420
 It was introduction
