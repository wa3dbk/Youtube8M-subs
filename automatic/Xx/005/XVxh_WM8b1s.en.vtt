00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.050
 we do not stop receiving just received 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.269
 the tarantula x6 almost nothing we are going to 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.780
 perform in a boxing will present before the 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.460
 x6 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.969
 let's open the box to see what we have 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.969
 here 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.700
 i 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.260
 you can see everything here 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.000
 very well packed we have the command 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.480
 the drone the battery the screwdriver 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 mounting 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.129
 and we have behind 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.860
 in this position 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.900
 and the battery charger is to say that the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.090
 Battery charger 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.290
 does not come with the driver 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.040
 of ours 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.010
 you have to buy an adapter like 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.470
 these to be able to adapt it and be able 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.920
 charge the battery i had an adapter 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.900
 since it also comprises tablet has 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.340
 as a tablet but you from 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.340
 buy them in three none 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.049
 but now let's see all the pieces 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.880
 here we have the command 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 but it is small than I thought 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.430
 engage in the palm of your hand 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.710
 but good you can handle well the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.710
 truth is very comfortable to catch 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.649
 we have the battery 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.450
 of one thousand two hundred thousand euros and seven like 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.450
 4 volts 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.920
 the assembly screwdriver are sent 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.920
 to mount the legs and other 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.390
 these are the legs of the tarantula 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.390
 a little lodges that can be doubled with 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.250
 the plastic hand very loose 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.590
 I will try to look for other plants 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.060
 to see if we can dock or something because 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.060
 and this is going to break looking at it 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.970
 here we have the elite correctors 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.970
 that also more of the same 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.360
 completely loose I think this is not 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.360
 it's worth to get to double 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.450
 plastic 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.450
 rubbishy 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.349
 here we have 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.160
 the covers of the lights that they carry 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.960
 it's a little more resistant 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.960
 and here we have the problem 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.930
 well now let's proceed to assemble 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.900
 to mount the legs of the accessories of 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.900
 Plastic least to try and 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.120
 ok now let's assemble the lights 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.670
 I'm going to mount the lights of it 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.800
 color in the same part to know in 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.040
 which direction is going at all times what 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.410
 in the photo here is the height and 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.390
 in the pictures I've seen take to each 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.790
 part one color 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.319
 and so he does not look for me I like him more now 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.730
 same apart the same color so in all 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.730
 moment we know in which direction they are going 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.330
 on equipment in the plastic of the light in the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.070
 extra plastic 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.070
 and then I go to android 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.990
 once we have the protectors 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:37.840
 hooked from behind we will look at the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.350
 drone if we hook up ahead 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.350
 turn 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.069
 for that reason we have subject 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.730
 the protector now let's perform the 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.730
 same steps in our remaining 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.260
 we go after turning all the 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.840
 supports the protectors the propellers and 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.000
 we have our quiet mounted but 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.710
 you can see here it's already mounted now 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.350
 it would only be necessary to put files of the command 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.110
 put on the battery and fly 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.810
 no this video will be a small review 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.660
 I'm going to make another video with the shooting 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.950
 and others and also teach you the command like this 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.200
 that if I liked the video 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.620
 aik and subscribe soon more 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.620
