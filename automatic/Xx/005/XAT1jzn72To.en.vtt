00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
to go around the map I say round six you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.500 
to go around the map I say round six you
could<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.460> wait<00:00:38.790> until<00:00:39.030> around<00:00:39.090> seven

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
could actually wait until around seven

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.389 
could actually wait until around seven
it's<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.379> there's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> chance<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.250> wait

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it's just there's a chance if you wait

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.619 
it's just there's a chance if you wait
that<00:00:41.550> long<00:00:41.700> then<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> might<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.210> overwhelmed

the launcher pads you're going to notice
every<00:01:26.430> time<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.270> launcher<00:01:27.689> pad<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
every time you use a launcher pad one of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.920 
every time you use a launcher pad one of

the little green segments of the rocket

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.490 
the little green segments of the rocket
will<00:01:31.229> light<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> get

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
will light up and get

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.420 
will light up and get
bass<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.220> once<00:01:34.180> you've<00:01:34.330> used<00:01:34.510> all<00:01:34.750> three

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
there's one outside by the PhD flopper

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.450 
there's one outside by the PhD flopper
machine<00:01:39.880> there's<00:01:40.540> one<00:01:40.990> over<00:01:41.440> by<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.800> speed
