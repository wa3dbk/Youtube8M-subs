thought that this was a five and one

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.880 
thought that this was a five and one
concealer<00:01:28.540> I<00:01:28.750> didn't<00:01:29.290> realize<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.680> was<00:01:29.740> an

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
concealer I didn't realize it was an

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.980 
concealer I didn't realize it was an
eyeshadow<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:30.700> it's<00:01:31.510> a<00:01:31.630> little<00:01:31.750> bit<00:01:31.840> of

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
eyeshadow so it's a little bit of

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.990 
eyeshadow so it's a little bit of
surprise<00:01:32.110> for<00:01:32.350> me<00:01:32.590> but<00:01:33.100> still<00:01:33.520> pretty<00:01:33.610> cute

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
surprise for me but still pretty cute

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.170 
surprise for me but still pretty cute
and<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.870> color<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.200> extremely<00:01:36.160> dark<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.970> is

and the color is extremely dark this is

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
and the color is extremely dark this is
definitely<00:01:37.570> not<00:01:37.630> what<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.870> thought<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.080> was

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
definitely not what I thought it was

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.350
