endoscopy goes up the nose goes down the
throat<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.870> then<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.440> looks<00:00:16.619> into<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> lungs

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
times you will not see actually see

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
times you will not see actually see
blood<00:00:55.559> coming<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> nostril<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
blood coming out of the nostril to be a

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.840 
blood coming out of the nostril to be a
bleeder<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> blood

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
bleeder you do not have to see the blood

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
bleeder you do not have to see the blood
it<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.690> leaking<00:01:01.109> back<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> lungs

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
it can be leaking back into the lungs

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.090 
it can be leaking back into the lungs
and<00:01:03.170> truly<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> only<00:01:04.320> way<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.890> truly

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and truly the only way you can truly

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.070 
and truly the only way you can truly
tell<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.729> if<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> endoscope<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
tell is if you do the endoscope but I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
tell is if you do the endoscope but I
like<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> use<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.710> patch<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> preventative

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
like to use the patch as a preventative

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.020 
like to use the patch as a preventative
because<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:13.130> most<00:01:14.130> horses<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
because I think most horses have a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.080 
because I think most horses have a
tendency<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.840> bleed<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.580> 60<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.729> 70

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
tendency to bleed I think 60 to 70

she got sick this winter with a
respiratory<00:01:36.270> infection<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:38.400> know<00:01:39.270> the

respiratory infection and I know the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.440 
respiratory infection and I know the
echo<00:01:39.780> patch<00:01:40.079> works<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:41.070> when<00:01:41.970> she<00:01:42.180> was

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
echo patch works because when she was

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
echo patch works because when she was
coughing<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.110> she<00:01:43.259> was<00:01:43.409> sick<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.740> the

coughing and she was sick with the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
coughing and she was sick with the
respiratory<00:01:44.689> illness

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
respiratory illness

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.560 
respiratory illness
I<00:01:45.899> had<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> scoped<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.549> no<00:01:47.790> blood<00:01:48.090> in

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
I had a scoped and there was no blood in

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.660 
I had a scoped and there was no blood in
her<00:01:48.720> trachea<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.649> means<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.250> even<00:01:50.430> in

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
her trachea so that means that even in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.999 
her trachea so that means that even in
spite<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.270> respiratory<00:01:51.869> infection<00:01:52.409> she

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
spite of the respiratory infection she

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.330 
spite of the respiratory infection she
was<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.460> bleeding<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> very<00:01:56.070> good
