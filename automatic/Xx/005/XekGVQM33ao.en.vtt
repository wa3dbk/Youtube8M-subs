film looks in black and white it's a
non-standard<00:00:49.860> size<00:00:50.219> film<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.539> wouldn't

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
non-standard size film so it wouldn't

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.260 
non-standard size film so it wouldn't
run<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.230> modern<00:00:52.590> projector<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> had<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
run on a modern projector so it had to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.869 
run on a modern projector so it had to
be<00:00:54.360> copied<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.379> did<00:00:55.620> each<00:00:56.100> frame<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
be copied which we did each frame is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.000 
be copied which we did each frame is
very<00:00:57.149> slightly<00:00:57.539> different<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.649> look<00:00:58.800> at

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
very slightly different to look at

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
of the film that's correct we were

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.779 
of the film that's correct we were
helped<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:20.009> mr<00:01:20.520> Turner

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
helped a little bit because mr Turner

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.710 
helped a little bit because mr Turner
had<00:01:21.390> already<00:01:21.599> marked<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> film<00:01:23.509> as<00:01:24.509> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
had already marked up the film as you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
had already marked up the film as you
can<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.050> here<00:01:25.410> there's<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.069> blue<00:01:26.310> frame<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
can see here there's a blue frame a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.639 
can see here there's a blue frame a
green<00:01:27.270> frame<00:01:27.569> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> middle<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.470> red

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
green frame in the middle and a red

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.359 
green frame in the middle and a red
frame<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:31.050> our<00:01:31.200> job<00:01:31.470> was<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.709> try<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
frame there and our job was to try and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.529 
frame there and our job was to try and
restore<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.149> with<00:01:33.929> those<00:01:34.110> colours<00:01:34.440> backing

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
restore it with those colours backing

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.839 
restore it with those colours backing
because<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.690> film<00:01:36.959> is<00:01:37.229> non-standard<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.670> had

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:38.849 
because the film is non-standard we had

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.059 
because the film is non-standard we had
to<00:01:38.970> copy<00:01:39.209> it<00:01:39.390> onto<00:01:39.539> standard<00:01:40.140> 35<00:01:40.619> millimeter

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
to copy it onto standard 35 millimeter

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.100 
to copy it onto standard 35 millimeter
film<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.700> again<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.959> was<00:01:43.050> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
film and again because it was a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.080 
film and again because it was a
non-standard<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.920> had<00:01:44.099> to<00:01:44.220> build<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.550> gate<00:01:44.729> in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
non-standard we had to build a gate in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.290 
non-standard we had to build a gate in
order<00:01:45.239> to<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:48.090> technique<00:01:48.509> was

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
order to do this and the technique was

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.240 
order to do this and the technique was
that<00:01:51.300> we<00:01:51.420> took<00:01:51.599> the<00:01:51.780> film<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.560> was<00:01:52.619> placed<00:01:52.979> in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that we took the film it was placed in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.749 
that we took the film it was placed in
the<00:01:53.280> gate<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:53.989> that<00:01:54.989> some<00:01:55.679> little<00:01:56.099> round<00:01:56.340> pins

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the gate and that some little round pins

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609 
the gate and that some little round pins
here<00:01:57.030> called<00:01:57.300> register<00:01:57.750> pins<00:01:57.989> which<00:01:58.259> hold<00:01:58.289> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
here called register pins which hold the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.699 
here called register pins which hold the
film<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.069> position<00:01:59.929> we<00:02:00.929> would<00:02:01.050> lock<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.470> film

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
film in position we would lock the film

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
film in position we would lock the film
in<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> gate<00:02:03.330> in<00:02:04.200> position<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.610> on

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
in to the gate in position and then on

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.580 
in to the gate in position and then on
an<00:02:05.880> optical<00:02:06.209> printer<00:02:06.720> which<00:02:06.899> consists<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.500> a

that<00:02:10.200> frame<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.489> had<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.849> open<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> gate

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
that frame we then had to open the gate

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.559 
that frame we then had to open the gate
lift<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.420> frame

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
lift the frame

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.410 
lift the frame
and<00:02:16.870> move<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:17.860> next<00:02:18.099> one<00:02:18.400> when<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:19.299> are

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
and move it to the next one when we are

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.360 
and move it to the next one when we are
photographing<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.530> didn't<00:02:20.799> know<00:02:20.950> what<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
photographing it we didn't know what the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.800 
photographing it we didn't know what the
result<00:02:21.700> was<00:02:21.909> until<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.390> film<00:02:22.629> had<00:02:22.780> been

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
result was until the film had been

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.589 
result was until the film had been
processed<00:02:23.469> so<00:02:24.400> he<00:02:24.640> might<00:02:24.790> spend<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.209> whole<00:02:25.359> day

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
processed so he might spend a whole day

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.860 
processed so he might spend a whole day
at<00:02:26.170> 25<00:02:26.769> frames<00:02:27.010> an<00:02:27.310> hour<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.730> when<00:02:28.629> it<00:02:28.719> comes

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
at 25 frames an hour and when it comes

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.410 
at 25 frames an hour and when it comes
back<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.230> might<00:02:29.739> not<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.069> been<00:02:30.099> any<00:02:30.370> good<00:02:30.549> but

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
back it might not have been any good but

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.940 
back it might not have been any good but
it's<00:02:31.540> lovely<00:02:31.719> to<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:32.079> them<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.349> color<00:02:32.590> it's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
it's lovely to see them in color it's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.809 
it's lovely to see them in color it's
really<00:02:33.280> worth<00:02:33.459> it

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
really worth it

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.050 
really worth it
yes<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> main<00:02:35.109> thing<00:02:35.730> having<00:02:36.730> scanned

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
yes that's the main thing having scanned

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.789 
yes that's the main thing having scanned
the<00:02:37.180> film<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.569> then<00:02:37.720> took<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.079> digital<00:02:38.500> files

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
the film we then took the digital files

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.059 
the film we then took the digital files
down<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.689> company<00:02:40.689> in<00:02:40.840> London<00:02:41.019> called<00:02:41.769> prime

down to a company in London called prime

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.030 
down to a company in London called prime
focus<00:02:42.629> they<00:02:43.629> took<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.019> digital<00:02:44.409> files<00:02:44.709> and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
focus they took the digital files and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.699 
focus they took the digital files and
used<00:02:45.220> their<00:02:45.430> digital<00:02:45.790> editing<00:02:46.209> software<00:02:46.840> to

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
used their digital editing software to

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.220 
used their digital editing software to
take<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.159> red<00:02:48.370> egg<00:02:48.609> red<00:02:48.879> frame<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.569> green<00:02:49.900> frame

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
take the red egg red frame a green frame

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.080 
take the red egg red frame a green frame
and<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.739> blue<00:02:50.920> frame<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.519> combine<00:02:51.879> them

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
and a blue frame and combine them

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.110 
and a blue frame and combine them
together<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:53.049> give<00:02:53.200> us<00:02:53.230> our<00:02:53.470> color<00:02:53.739> frame<00:02:54.120> it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
together to give us our color frame it

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.030 
together to give us our color frame it
was<00:02:55.239> important<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.810> we<00:02:56.230> use<00:02:56.439> the<00:02:56.650> technique

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
was important that we use the technique

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.309 
was important that we use the technique
that<00:02:57.280> Turner<00:02:57.819> had<00:02:58.030> used<00:02:58.299> in<00:02:58.569> his<00:02:58.720> projector

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
that Turner had used in his projector

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.879 
that Turner had used in his projector
that<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.799> taking<00:03:00.250> frames<00:03:00.549> 1<00:03:00.939> 2<00:03:01.540> &amp;<00:03:01.840> 3<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.439> then

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
that is taking frames 1 2 &amp; 3 and then

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.710 
that is taking frames 1 2 &amp; 3 and then
taking<00:03:03.340> 2<00:03:03.549> 3<00:03:03.909> 4<00:03:04.209> 3<00:03:04.720> 4<00:03:04.959> 5<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:07.569> was

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
taking 2 3 4 3 4 5 and so on it was

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.170 
taking 2 3 4 3 4 5 and so on it was
quite<00:03:07.930> important<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:08.530> us<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.980> produce<00:03:09.790> the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
quite important for us to produce the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.589 
quite important for us to produce the
result<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.750> also<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> verify<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.889> Turner's

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
result and also to verify that Turner's

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.960 
result and also to verify that Turner's

about sixth time I think it's probably

about sixth time I think it's probably
taken<00:03:53.290> around<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.250> same<00:03:54.459> time<00:03:54.729> as<00:03:55.409> Turner

she's wearing the same outfits we think

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.219 
she's wearing the same outfits we think
that<00:04:02.620> it's<00:04:03.579> most<00:04:03.790> likely<00:04:03.970> that<00:04:04.389> it<00:04:04.659> was<00:04:04.780> shot

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
that it's most likely that it was shot
