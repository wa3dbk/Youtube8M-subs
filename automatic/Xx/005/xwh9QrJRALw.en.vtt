00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
until it's really well combined if the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
until it's really well combined if the
batter<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.939> too<00:01:21.090> dry<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.409> add

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
batter is too dry what we can do is add

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.590 
batter is too dry what we can do is add
in<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.040> tablespoon<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.790> water<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> time

in about a tablespoon of water at a time

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
in about a tablespoon of water at a time

consistency once our cookie dough forms

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
consistency once our cookie dough forms
