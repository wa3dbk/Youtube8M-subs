down to this load out here I chose the
out<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.260> or<00:00:43.440> five<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.850> go-to<00:00:45.120> sniper<00:00:45.600> now

just<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.149> particular<00:00:49.730> this

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
just not on this particular this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.600 
just not on this particular this
particular<00:00:50.879> soldier<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.920> I've<00:00:53.190> got<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
particular soldier so but I've got the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
particular soldier so but I've got the
the<00:00:53.850> US<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> el<00:00:55.050> 15<00:00:55.410> these<00:00:55.710> two

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the US are and the the el 15 these two

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.650 
the US are and the the el 15 these two
are<00:00:56.010> basically<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.550> would<00:00:56.820> say<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.390> best

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
are basically I would say that the best

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.580 
are basically I would say that the best
to<00:00:58.140> wants<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.629> the<00:01:00.629> El<00:01:00.750> 15<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.379> think

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to wants to go for and the El 15 I think

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
to wants to go for and the El 15 I think
is<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.100> bit<00:01:02.520> easier<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> use<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.420> bit

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
is just that bit easier to use that bit

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
is just that bit easier to use that bit
more<00:01:03.780> reliable<00:01:04.350> I've<00:01:04.470> had<00:01:04.619> far<00:01:04.920> less<00:01:04.949> hit

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
more reliable I've had far less hit

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.580 
more reliable I've had far less hit
markers<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.150> gun<00:01:06.390> sofa<00:01:07.049> specially

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
markers with this gun sofa specially
starting<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.700> gun<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
starting out I think this gun is a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.300 
starting out I think this gun is a
really<00:01:09.450> good<00:01:09.600> place<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> start<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:11.010> may<00:01:11.159> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
really good place to start you may not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.560 
really good place to start you may not
have<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.640> straight<00:01:11.880> away<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.090> once<00:01:12.420> you've

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
have this straight away but once you've

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
have this straight away but once you've
been<00:01:12.689> playing<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
been playing for just a little bit you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
been playing for just a little bit you
will<00:01:14.250> unlock<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.360> would<00:01:15.509> definitely<00:01:15.659> go

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
will unlock it and I would definitely go

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
will unlock it and I would definitely go
with<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.369> sure<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> be

with that one I for sure now to be

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.640 
with that one I for sure now to be
honest<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.869> need<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> add<00:01:19.380> any

sort of attachments on it is all down to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.649 
sort of attachments on it is all down to
preference<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.909> armor<00:01:23.909> piercing<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.509> be

preference and armor piercing can be

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
helpful but to be honest the sniper is
really<00:01:26.520> good<00:01:26.729> without<00:01:27.210> any<00:01:27.479> extra<00:01:27.780> add-ons

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
really good without any extra add-ons

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
really good without any extra add-ons
and<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.890> we're<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.310> focus<00:01:29.430> on

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and so we're just going to focus on

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.609 
and so we're just going to focus on
other<00:01:29.820> things<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.869> terms<00:01:31.409> of

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
other things right now at terms of

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.390 
other things right now at terms of
pistols<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.460> founded<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> MP<00:01:33.299> 443<00:01:34.140> graph<00:01:34.619> with

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
pistols I founded the MP 443 graph with

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
pistols I founded the MP 443 graph with
a<00:01:35.430> silencer<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.390> explain<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> silencer<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a silencer not explain the silencer in a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.830 
a silencer not explain the silencer in a
minute<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.650> found<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.909> pistol<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.570> very

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
minute I found that that pistol is very

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.569 
minute I found that that pistol is very
reliable<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.860> gonna<00:01:41.070> give<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> good

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
reliable it's gonna give you a good

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.210 
reliable it's gonna give you a good
amount<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.880> accuracy<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:43.530> normally<00:01:43.950> can

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
amount of accuracy and you normally can

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
amount of accuracy and you normally can
take<00:01:44.700> down<00:01:44.880> enemies<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:45.329> short<00:01:45.540> range<00:01:45.720> it's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
take down enemies at short range it's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.330 
take down enemies at short range it's
never<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.380> let<00:01:46.590> me<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.159> good

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
never really let me down it's a good

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.789 
never really let me down it's a good

allowed<00:01:53.729> silencer<00:01:54.210> I'm<00:01:54.360> trying<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
allowed silencer I'm trying to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.300 
allowed silencer I'm trying to
concentrate<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.350> sort<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.100> mall<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
concentrate this sort of a mall I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.639 
concentrate this sort of a mall I
stealth<00:01:56.850> sort<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> class<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.469> sort

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
stealth sort of class that's what sort

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.170 
stealth sort of class that's what sort
of<00:01:58.710> feel<00:01:58.890> snipers<00:01:59.369> should<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> should<00:01:59.880> be

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
of feel snipers should be it should be

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.749 
of feel snipers should be it should be
you<00:02:00.360> trying<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.020> know<00:02:01.369> take<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you trying to you know take out the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
you trying to you know take out the
enemy<00:02:02.790> without<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> enemy<00:02:03.570> realizing<00:02:04.200> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
enemy without the enemy realizing you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.740 
enemy without the enemy realizing you
know<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.009> sniper<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.820> vantage<00:02:06.360> point

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
know what a sniper a vantage point

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.089 
know what a sniper a vantage point
you've<00:02:06.899> got<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.320> whatever<00:02:07.560> things<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:07.979> that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
you've got or whatever things like that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.949 
you've got or whatever things like that
so<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.360> know<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> silencer

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
so I think that you know the silencer

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.570 
so I think that you know the silencer
really<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.379> help<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:11.009> also<00:02:11.190> include

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
really will help out also include

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.949 
really will help out also include
increases<00:02:12.060> your<00:02:12.120> accuracy<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.629> well<00:02:12.780> which<00:02:12.930> is

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
increases your accuracy as well which is

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.580 
increases your accuracy as well which is
always<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.349> good

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
always a good

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.690 
always a good
thing<00:02:13.769> when<00:02:13.920> you're<00:02:14.010> quickly<00:02:14.220> trying<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.580> take

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
thing when you're quickly trying to take

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.339 
thing when you're quickly trying to take
someone<00:02:15.000> out<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:15.330> who's<00:02:15.450> maybe<00:02:15.629> invaded

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
someone out there who's maybe invaded

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.080 
someone out there who's maybe invaded
your<00:02:16.440> personal<00:02:16.830> space<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.760> know<00:02:17.819> just<00:02:17.970> walk

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
your personal space you know just walk

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.300 
your personal space you know just walk
back<00:02:18.269> there<00:02:18.450> then<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> put<00:02:19.019> an<00:02:19.140> IED<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.860> think

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
back there then I put an IED I think

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.380 
back there then I put an IED I think
this<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.610> great<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:20.910> thing<00:02:21.239> if<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
this is a great little thing if you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.059 
this is a great little thing if you
haven't<00:02:21.720> seen<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.900> before<00:02:22.170> basically<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.920> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
haven't seen it before basically it's a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.479 
haven't seen it before basically it's a
c4<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.989> how<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.739> sensor<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.370> so

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
c4 and that is how the sensor in it so

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.710 
c4 and that is how the sensor in it so
when<00:02:26.610> an<00:02:26.700> enemy<00:02:26.819> gets<00:02:27.060> close<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.480> will

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
when an enemy gets close it will

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.690 
when an enemy gets close it will
automatically<00:02:28.319> destroys<00:02:29.129> that's<00:02:29.370> very<00:02:29.550> very

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
automatically destroys that's very very

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.910 
automatically destroys that's very very
good<00:02:29.849> for<00:02:30.299> sort<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.569> protecting<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.290> an<00:02:31.560> area

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
good for sort of protecting a an area

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.710 
good for sort of protecting a an area
that<00:02:31.980> you're<00:02:32.160> trying<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.700> hold<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.569> just

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that you're trying to hold you can just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240 
that you're trying to hold you can just
throw<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.989> behind<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.530> know<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.129> someone

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
throw it behind you know that if someone

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.380 
throw it behind you know that if someone
comes<00:02:35.400> up<00:02:35.519> behind<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.910> your<00:02:36.060> least<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.360> a

comes up behind you your least have a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.020 
comes up behind you your least have a
warning<00:02:36.660> if<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> free<00:02:37.500> kill<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:38.580> tactical

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
warning if not a free kill the tactical

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.690 
warning if not a free kill the tactical
I<00:02:39.060> thought<00:02:39.330> finds<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.900> concussion<00:02:40.410> here

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
I thought finds the concussion here

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.190 
I thought finds the concussion here
really<00:02:41.700> useful<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.540> know<00:02:42.660> if<00:02:42.840> you're<00:02:42.989> in<00:02:43.170> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
really useful you know if you're in that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.530 
really useful you know if you're in that
really<00:02:43.680> sticky<00:02:44.489> situation<00:02:45.000> song<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.299> quickly

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
really sticky situation song it quickly

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.150 
really sticky situation song it quickly
runs<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.260> runs<00:02:46.530> towards<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.010> can

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
runs it you know runs towards you can

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.530 
runs it you know runs towards you can
throw<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.519> stun<00:02:47.700> out<00:02:47.849> maybe<00:02:48.030> pull<00:02:48.269> out<00:02:48.390> your

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
throw the stun out maybe pull out your

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.970 
throw the stun out maybe pull out your
pistol<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.110> take<00:02:49.290> them<00:02:49.440> out<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.769> quickly

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
pistol and take them out really quickly

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.860 
pistol and take them out really quickly
that<00:02:50.670> paired<00:02:50.970> with<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.150> pistol<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.569> think<00:02:51.750> works

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870

yourself<00:03:27.959> away<00:03:28.170> these<00:03:28.530> are<00:03:28.680> sort<00:03:28.799> of

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
yourself away these are sort of

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.990 
yourself away these are sort of
self-explanatory<00:03:29.130> I'm<00:03:29.639> just<00:03:29.760> gonna<00:03:29.849> go

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
self-explanatory I'm just gonna go

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.160 
self-explanatory I'm just gonna go
through<00:03:30.150> these<00:03:30.269> quickly<00:03:30.420> off<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.780> grid

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
through these quickly off the grid

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.289 
through these quickly off the grid
undetectable<00:03:31.799> by<00:03:31.950> SATCOM<00:03:32.489> yet<00:03:32.760> again<00:03:32.970> stealth

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
undetectable by SATCOM yet again stealth

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.150 
undetectable by SATCOM yet again stealth
and<00:03:33.569> then<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> think<00:03:34.440> one<00:03:34.709> from<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.950> awareness

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
and then I think one from the awareness

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.699 
and then I think one from the awareness
is<00:03:35.370> always<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.639> good<00:03:35.760> thing<00:03:36.170> sitrep<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.349> really

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
is always a good thing sitrep is really

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.920 
is always a good thing sitrep is really
really<00:03:37.950> useful<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.970> know<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.180> don't<00:03:39.420> want<00:03:39.840> to

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
really useful you know you don't want to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.479 
really useful you know you don't want to
accidentally<00:03:40.380> be<00:03:40.530> running<00:03:40.799> into<00:03:41.130> someone

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
accidentally be running into someone

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.819 
accidentally be running into someone
else's<00:03:42.239> trap<00:03:42.630> or<00:03:42.840> things<00:03:43.079> like<00:03:43.169> that<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.650> being

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
else's trap or things like that so being

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.650 
else's trap or things like that so being
able<00:03:43.889> to<00:03:44.040> see<00:03:44.220> also<00:03:44.819> i<00:03:44.849> find<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.269> really<00:03:45.299> good

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
able to see also i find it really good

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.809 
able to see also i find it really good
because<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.959> can<00:03:45.989> detect<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:47.669> can

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
because you can detect and you can

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.620 
because you can detect and you can
detect<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:49.430> satcoms<00:03:50.430> using<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.299> sitrep

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
detect the satcoms using the sitrep

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.319 
detect the satcoms using the sitrep
basically<00:03:52.530> if<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.859> can<00:03:53.040> sort<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.579> see<00:03:54.120> where<00:03:54.299> a

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
basically if you can sort of see where a

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.610 
basically if you can sort of see where a
sack<00:03:54.569> comments<00:03:54.959> in<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.079> distance<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.470> can

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
sack comments in the distance you can

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.530 
sack comments in the distance you can
sort<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:55.980> maybe<00:03:56.489> figure<00:03:56.880> out<00:03:57.000> where<00:03:57.359> the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
sort of maybe figure out where the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.580 
sort of maybe figure out where the
enemies<00:03:57.810> are<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.079> be<00:03:58.139> coming<00:03:58.290> from

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
enemies are going to be coming from

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.199 
enemies are going to be coming from
because<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.579> see<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.730> they<00:03:59.880> put<00:04:00.060> that

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
because you can see that they put that

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.430 
because you can see that they put that
down<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:00.450> know<00:04:00.720> okay<00:04:00.989> they're<00:04:01.260> probably

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
down you know okay they're probably

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.870 
down you know okay they're probably
gonna<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.709> around<00:04:01.919> there<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.310> maybe<00:04:02.609> there's<00:04:02.849> a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
gonna be around there or maybe there's a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.670 
gonna be around there or maybe there's a
guy<00:04:03.030> camping<00:04:03.419> out<00:04:03.540> down<00:04:03.750> there<00:04:03.900> who<00:04:04.079> knows<00:04:04.290> but

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
guy camping out down there who knows but

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.960 
guy camping out down there who knows but
I<00:04:04.739> found<00:04:04.919> that's<00:04:05.069> really<00:04:05.370> useful<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.880> be

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
I found that's really useful to be

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.759 
I found that's really useful to be
honest<00:04:06.180> I've<00:04:06.269> used<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.599> Park<00:04:07.139> on<00:04:07.319> most<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.650> my

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
honest I've used that Park on most of my

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.589 
honest I've used that Park on most of my
classes<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.280> far<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:09.000> has<00:04:09.090> become<00:04:09.269> really

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
classes so far and it has become really

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.360 
classes so far and it has become really
useful<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.349> er<00:04:10.560> when<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.859> comes<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.190> sort

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
useful so er when it comes to the sort

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.409 
useful so er when it comes to the sort
of<00:04:11.459> your<00:04:12.919> strike<00:04:13.919> package<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.700> really

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
of your strike package it's really

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.759 
of your strike package it's really
personal<00:04:15.599> preference<00:04:16.139> this<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.380> pretty<00:04:16.620> much

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
personal preference this is pretty much

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.440 
personal preference this is pretty much
the<00:04:16.829> default<00:04:17.370> one<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:17.849> sort<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.090> done<00:04:18.269> me

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
the default one and it's sort of done me

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.909 
the default one and it's sort of done me
pretty<00:04:18.720> well<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.109> far<00:04:19.139> but<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.620> can<00:04:19.739> really

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
pretty well so far but you can really

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.110 
pretty well so far but you can really
switch<00:04:20.099> this<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:20.280> as<00:04:20.459> much<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:20.729> like<00:04:20.849> it's<00:04:21.000> not

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
switch this up as much you like it's not

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.159 
switch this up as much you like it's not
going<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.299> make<00:04:21.359> much<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.690> difference<00:04:22.019> but

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
going to make much of a difference but

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.950 
going to make much of a difference but
we<00:04:22.469> got<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.650> SATCOM<00:04:23.030> we<00:04:24.030> have<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.750> guard
