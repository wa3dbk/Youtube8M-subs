00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
gimmick that I was talking about you can

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
see we're no longer a car we're a little

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.799 
see we're no longer a car we're a little
boat<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.730> seems<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.210> lost<00:00:09.360> all<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.660> its

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
boat it seems to have lost all of its

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.720 
boat it seems to have lost all of its
power<00:00:10.969> now<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.690> an<00:00:13.440> interesting<00:00:13.730> break

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
power now this is an interesting break

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
power now this is an interesting break
from<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.120> normal<00:00:15.450> gameplay<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
from the normal gameplay it's just a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.320 
from the normal gameplay it's just a
shame<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.190> don't<00:00:17.430> use<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.970> more

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
shame that they don't use it more

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.000 
shame that they don't use it more
although<00:00:18.930> there<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.260> only<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.650> more<00:00:19.830> level

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
although there is only one more level

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.640 
although there is only one more level
after<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.210> still<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:22.380> could<00:00:22.529> have

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
after this one but still they could have

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.960 
after this one but still they could have
used<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.010> earlier<00:00:23.279> parts<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> game

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
used it at earlier parts of the game

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.490 
used it at earlier parts of the game
it's<00:00:24.269> really<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> disappointment<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it's really a disappointment in that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.029 
it's really a disappointment in that
respect<00:00:26.180> now<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.170> harder

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
respect now this is one of them harder

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.669

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
with the water level you transform back

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.380 
with the water level you transform back
into<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.049> car<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.210> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
into the car as you can see and this is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.030 
into the car as you can see and this is
pretty<00:01:15.630> much<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> middle<00:01:16.380> section<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
pretty much the middle section of this

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.670 
pretty much the middle section of this
level<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.330> really<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.720> hard<00:01:18.990> unless

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
level it's not really that hard unless

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
level it's not really that hard unless
of<00:01:19.979> course<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.880> let<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.600> enemies<00:01:21.900> come<00:01:22.049> up

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of course just let the enemies come up

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.350 
of course just let the enemies come up
beside<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.710> shoot<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.180> don't<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
beside you and shoot you don't do that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.450 
beside you and shoot you don't do that
but<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.439> say<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> hard

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
but like I say it's not really that hard

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.830 
but like I say it's not really that hard
and<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> gives<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> chance<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> power<00:01:27.630> up

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and it gives you a chance to power up

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
and it gives you a chance to power up
your<00:01:27.869> car<00:01:28.229> again<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.009> lost<00:01:29.250> life<00:01:29.880> or

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
your car again if you lost life or

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.649 
your car again if you lost life or
anything<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:33.119> only<00:01:33.329> thing<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
anything like that the only thing you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.850 
anything like that the only thing you
really<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> worry<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
really have to worry about in this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.890 
really have to worry about in this
section<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.369> those<00:01:35.490> damn<00:01:35.729> trucks<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.540> there

I mean they the most annoying enemy in
the<00:01:40.500> game<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.159> shoot<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.790> six

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the game because they shoot out like six

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.840 
the game because they shoot out like six
barrels<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.229> crap<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.670> you're

in<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.220> game<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> piece<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.820> cake

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
in this game is a piece of cake

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.630 
in this game is a piece of cake
now<00:01:55.780> we<00:01:55.840> should<00:01:56.050> be<00:01:56.620> about<00:01:56.740> done<00:01:56.920> with<00:01:57.280> this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
now we should be about done with this

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.200 
now we should be about done with this
year<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:59.380> t<00:01:59.950> power<00:02:00.190> would<00:02:00.730> have<00:02:00.880> helped<00:02:01.150> us

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
year that t power would have helped us

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.850 
year that t power would have helped us
but<00:02:01.480> not<00:02:01.930> really<00:02:02.260> we're<00:02:02.410> almost<00:02:02.530> done<00:02:02.830> here

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
but not really we're almost done here

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.980 
but not really we're almost done here
like<00:02:03.160> I<00:02:03.280> say<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.760> we're<00:02:04.420> coming<00:02:04.720> up<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.870> the

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
like I say and we're coming up to the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.440 
like I say and we're coming up to the
second<00:02:05.530> exciting<00:02:06.250> gimmick<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> game<00:02:07.060> of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
second exciting gimmick of the game of

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.960 
second exciting gimmick of the game of
what<00:02:07.750> does<00:02:07.900> our<00:02:08.020> car<00:02:08.260> transform<00:02:08.830> into<00:02:08.979> now<00:02:09.280> but

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
what does our car transform into now but

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.320 
what does our car transform into now but
an<00:02:10.090> a-10<00:02:10.360> warthog<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.440> looks<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:12.090> now<00:02:13.090> some

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
an a-10 warthog it looks like now some

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.610 
an a-10 warthog it looks like now some
interesting<00:02:13.750> things<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.110> note<00:02:14.140> about<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
interesting things to note about the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.430 
interesting things to note about the
plane<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:16.030> number<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:17.200> power

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
plane is that number one you can power

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.850 
plane is that number one you can power
it<00:02:17.650> up<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:17.860> little<00:02:18.010> further<00:02:18.340> than<00:02:18.640> your<00:02:18.850> car<00:02:19.860> so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
it up a little further than your car so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.440 
it up a little further than your car so
even<00:02:21.160> if<00:02:21.220> you've<00:02:21.340> got<00:02:21.520> your<00:02:21.670> full<00:02:21.850> powered<00:02:22.210> car

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
even if you've got your full powered car

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.490 
even if you've got your full powered car
when<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.690> come<00:02:22.870> into<00:02:22.990> this<00:02:23.140> you're<00:02:23.320> going<00:02:23.440> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
when you come into this you're going to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.460 
when you come into this you're going to
need<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.710> collect<00:02:24.100> another<00:02:24.340> power<00:02:24.670> out<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
need to collect another power out and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.830 
need to collect another power out and
you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.500> power<00:02:27.070> up<00:02:27.190> its<00:02:27.550> rapid<00:02:27.970> fire<00:02:28.270> one<00:02:28.630> more

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
you can power up its rapid fire one more

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.350 
you can power up its rapid fire one more
time<00:02:29.080> but<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:30.070> gimmicks<00:02:30.460> don't<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:30.880> there<00:02:31.150> oh

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
time but the gimmicks don't in there oh

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.770 
time but the gimmicks don't in there oh
no<00:02:31.830> instead<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.730> where<00:02:33.940> another<00:02:34.300> variant

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
no instead this is where another variant

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.250 
no instead this is where another variant
of<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.170> auto<00:02:35.890> aim<00:02:36.310> /<00:02:37.120> manual<00:02:37.660> control<00:02:38.050> comes

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
of the auto aim / manual control comes

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260 
of the auto aim / manual control comes
into<00:02:38.470> play<00:02:38.710> if<00:02:38.980> you've<00:02:39.160> got<00:02:39.370> manual<00:02:39.880> control

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
into play if you've got manual control

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.670 
into play if you've got manual control
over<00:02:40.510> your<00:02:40.630> guns<00:02:40.900> when<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.200> come<00:02:41.380> into<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
over your guns when you come into the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.160 
over your guns when you come into the
plane<00:02:41.920> level<00:02:42.370> you'll<00:02:43.210> shoot<00:02:43.390> out<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.570> giant

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
plane level you'll shoot out that giant

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.230 
plane level you'll shoot out that giant
like<00:02:44.350> Tomahawk<00:02:45.220> missile<00:02:45.610> thing<00:02:45.790> there<00:02:46.030> you

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
like Tomahawk missile thing there you

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720 
like Tomahawk missile thing there you
can<00:02:46.390> see<00:02:46.470> yields<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.650> crapload<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.130> damage<00:02:48.580> is

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
can see yields a crapload of damage is

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.480 
can see yields a crapload of damage is
kind<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> difficult<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.959> control<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:51.280> you

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
kind of difficult to control if you

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.460 
kind of difficult to control if you
switch<00:02:51.730> over<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.060> auto<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:53.140> you'll<00:02:53.290> shoot

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
switch over to auto a then you'll shoot

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.800 
switch over to auto a then you'll shoot
out<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.800> dinky<00:02:54.220> little<00:02:54.450> homing<00:02:55.450> missile

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
out this dinky little homing missile

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.720 
out this dinky little homing missile
that<00:02:55.930> deal<00:02:56.260> shit<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:56.770> damage<00:02:57.070> but<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.610> least

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
that deal shit for damage but at least

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.180 
that deal shit for damage but at least
it<00:02:57.940> homes<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.420> which<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.470> homing<00:02:59.800> function

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
it homes in which the homing function

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.390 
it homes in which the homing function
isn't<00:03:00.340> even<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.790> great<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.680> yeah<00:03:02.680> stick<00:03:03.250> with

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
isn't even that great so yeah stick with

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.380 
isn't even that great so yeah stick with
the<00:03:03.520> manual<00:03:03.820> aim<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:06.190> section<00:03:06.580> goes<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:07.000> for

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the manual aim this section goes on for

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.080 
the manual aim this section goes on for
what<00:03:07.630> like<00:03:07.840> five<00:03:08.440> minutes<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.100> just<00:03:09.310> nothing

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
what like five minutes of just nothing

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.729 
what like five minutes of just nothing

speed it up here also I hope none of my

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.300 
speed it up here also I hope none of my
viewers<00:03:16.510> have<00:03:16.750> epilepsy<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.739> anything<00:03:18.280> like

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
what was moving water background they

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.270 
what was moving water background they
have<00:03:23.050> here<00:03:23.320> with<00:03:23.500> all<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.739> crap<00:03:23.980> flying

have here with all the crap flying
around<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:25.600> well<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.350> really<00:03:26.620> not<00:03:26.739> hard<00:03:26.800> to

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
around it's well it's really not hard to

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.580 
around it's well it's really not hard to
understand<00:03:27.700> why<00:03:27.940> not<00:03:28.750> many<00:03:28.959> people<00:03:29.260> were<00:03:29.350> able

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
understand why not many people were able

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.800 
understand why not many people were able
to<00:03:29.680> beat<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:30.010> game<00:03:30.310> it's<00:03:31.030> not<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.480> fact<00:03:31.720> that

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
to beat this game it's not the fact that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.020 
to beat this game it's not the fact that

it's fucking hard as hell it's the
simple<00:03:34.360> fact<00:03:34.630> that<00:03:34.720> if<00:03:34.900> they<00:03:35.019> somehow<00:03:35.290> made<00:03:35.650> it

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
simple fact that if they somehow made it

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.229 
simple fact that if they somehow made it
managed<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.310> make<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.640> this<00:03:36.820> part<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.180> the

the boss now should be coming up to a

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.300 
the boss now should be coming up to a
jet<00:04:04.360> there<00:04:04.599> you<00:04:04.780> saw<00:04:05.049> we<00:04:05.590> sped<00:04:05.860> up<00:04:05.980> our<00:04:06.160> how

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
jet there you saw we sped up our how

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.830 
jet there you saw we sped up our how
fast<00:04:06.580> I<00:04:06.730> was<00:04:06.760> able<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.090> take<00:04:07.269> him<00:04:07.420> out<00:04:07.510> with<00:04:07.720> a

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
fast I was able to take him out with a

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.800 
fast I was able to take him out with a
normal<00:04:08.080> missile<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:09.549> one<00:04:09.760> takes<00:04:09.970> about

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
normal missile this one takes about

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.589 
normal missile this one takes about
twice<00:04:11.110> as<00:04:11.319> long<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:12.459> good<00:04:12.730> at<00:04:12.760> all<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.450> with

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
twice as long not good at all so with

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.119 
twice as long not good at all so with
that<00:04:13.690> out<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.989> way<00:04:14.049> let's<00:04:14.440> speed<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.010> back

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
that out of the way let's speed it back

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.539 
that out of the way let's speed it back
up<00:04:15.449> God<00:04:16.449> yeah<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> perfect<00:04:17.919> example<00:04:18.040> of

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
up God yeah this is a perfect example of

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.640 
up God yeah this is a perfect example of
what<00:04:18.880> makes<00:04:19.180> this<00:04:19.389> game<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:19.690> difficult<00:04:20.410> it's

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
what makes this game so difficult it's

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.620 
what makes this game so difficult it's
not<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:21.010> fact<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.400> enemy<00:04:21.970> placement<00:04:22.240> or

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
not the fact that enemy placement or

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.170 
not the fact that enemy placement or
anything<00:04:22.960> like<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.580> simple<00:04:24.760> fact

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
anything like that it's a simple fact

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.300 
anything like that it's a simple fact
that<00:04:25.330> they<00:04:25.449> use<00:04:25.630> logic<00:04:26.139> against<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:26.680> here<00:04:26.919> all

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
that they use logic against you here all

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.950 
that they use logic against you here all
right<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.729> mean<00:04:27.910> if<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.150> make<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.479> stage<00:04:28.750> is

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
right I mean if you make the stage is

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.600 
right I mean if you make the stage is
long<00:04:29.229> enough<00:04:29.260> you're<00:04:29.919> eventually<00:04:30.100> going<00:04:30.490> to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
long enough you're eventually going to

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.029 
long enough you're eventually going to
get<00:04:30.729> hit<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.120> probably<00:04:31.780> die<00:04:32.020> now<00:04:32.620> this<00:04:32.740> state

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
get hit and probably die now this state

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.740 
get hit and probably die now this state

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
the way we've come to the boss which is

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.950 
the way we've come to the boss which is
a<00:04:49.990> giant<00:04:50.320> ass<00:04:50.620> airship<00:04:51.430> now<00:04:52.389> don't<00:04:52.510> be<00:04:52.630> filled

but excuse me don't be full fooled by

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.960 
but excuse me don't be full fooled by
those<00:04:56.650> propeller<00:04:57.130> things<00:04:57.490> there<00:04:57.760> those<00:04:57.940> are

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
those propeller things there those are

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.820 
those propeller things there those are
actually<00:04:58.510> gun<00:04:58.750> turrets<00:04:59.139> so<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.440> don't<00:04:59.650> want

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
actually gun turrets so you don't want

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.490 
actually gun turrets so you don't want
to<00:04:59.889> hover<00:05:00.039> above<00:05:00.370> those<00:05:00.610> never<00:05:01.389> do<00:05:01.570> that<00:05:01.750> this

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
to hover above those never do that this

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.339 
to hover above those never do that this
is<00:05:02.620> probably<00:05:02.919> I<00:05:03.639> would<00:05:04.300> venture<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:04.840> say<00:05:04.960> the

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
is probably I would venture to say the

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.860 
is probably I would venture to say the
hardest<00:05:05.710> boss<00:05:05.889> in<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.220> game<00:05:06.250> which<00:05:06.789> kind<00:05:07.780> of

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
hardest boss in the game which kind of

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.210 
hardest boss in the game which kind of
makes<00:05:08.080> sense<00:05:08.289> I<00:05:08.500> guess<00:05:08.530> coming<00:05:08.919> off<00:05:09.099> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
makes sense I guess coming off the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.000 
makes sense I guess coming off the
hardest<00:05:09.580> stage<00:05:09.849> in<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.150> game<00:05:10.680> he<00:05:11.680> has<00:05:11.830> two

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
hardest stage in the game he has two

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.310 
hardest stage in the game he has two
attacks<00:05:12.370> well<00:05:13.120> two<00:05:13.330> main<00:05:13.539> attacks<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:14.110> little

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
attacks well two main attacks a little

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.070 
attacks well two main attacks a little
missile<00:05:14.650> launching<00:05:15.039> thing<00:05:15.250> there<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.930> he<00:05:16.930> can

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
missile launching thing there and he can

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.770 
missile launching thing there and he can
also<00:05:17.200> fire<00:05:17.860> off<00:05:18.130> little<00:05:18.430> bullets<00:05:19.330> at<00:05:19.479> you<00:05:19.630> from

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
also fire off little bullets at you from

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.710 
also fire off little bullets at you from
each<00:05:20.050> of<00:05:20.229> those<00:05:20.349> propellers<00:05:21.330> always<00:05:22.330> two<00:05:22.539> at<00:05:22.630> a

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
each of those propellers always two at a

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.050 
each of those propellers always two at a
time<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:23.229> always<00:05:24.039> in<00:05:24.310> usually<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:24.849> same

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
time and always in usually the same

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.770 
time and always in usually the same
pattern<00:05:25.710> now<00:05:27.030> it<00:05:28.030> would<00:05:28.180> be<00:05:28.300> hard<00:05:28.510> to<00:05:28.570> dodge

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
pattern now it would be hard to dodge

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.520 
pattern now it would be hard to dodge
these<00:05:29.050> things<00:05:29.410> except<00:05:30.690> there's<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:32.110> creates

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
these things except there's it creates

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.320 
these things except there's it creates
so<00:05:32.770> many<00:05:32.889> sprites<00:05:33.340> on<00:05:33.550> screen<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.090> if<00:05:34.180> you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
so many sprites on screen that if you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.570 
so many sprites on screen that if you
shoot<00:05:34.599> it<00:05:35.289> slows<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.650> game<00:05:35.979> down<00:05:36.039> and<00:05:36.400> makes

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
shoot it slows the game down and makes

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.360 
shoot it slows the game down and makes
it<00:05:36.729> relatively<00:05:37.090> easy<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.889> keep<00:05:38.889> out<00:05:39.099> of<00:05:39.220> there

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
it relatively easy to keep out of there

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.250 
it relatively easy to keep out of there
keep<00:05:40.090> out<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.270> their<00:05:40.419> path<00:05:40.660> I<00:05:40.870> guess<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.139> could

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
keep out of their path I guess you could

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.800 
keep out of their path I guess you could
say<00:05:41.610> this<00:05:42.610> is<00:05:42.729> the<00:05:42.760> one<00:05:43.030> boss<00:05:43.270> that<00:05:43.510> you<00:05:43.599> simply

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
say this is the one boss that you simply

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.540 
say this is the one boss that you simply
can't<00:05:44.229> shoot<00:05:44.500> right<00:05:44.770> off<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:45.070> bat<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.430> have

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
can't shoot right off the bat you have

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.279 
can't shoot right off the bat you have
to<00:05:45.699> wait<00:05:45.849> until<00:05:46.000> he<00:05:46.180> reveals<00:05:46.570> his<00:05:46.780> wheat<00:05:46.990> swap

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
to wait until he reveals his wheat swap

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.560 
to wait until he reveals his wheat swap
which<00:05:48.070> is<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.400> engine<00:05:48.820> compartment<00:05:49.000> right

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
which is the engine compartment right

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
which is the engine compartment right
there

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
there

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.790 
there
now<00:05:51.040> normally<00:05:51.880> with<00:05:52.630> the<00:05:52.870> manual<00:05:53.290> control

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
now normally with the manual control

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.180 
now normally with the manual control
missile<00:05:54.220> you<00:05:55.060> can<00:05:55.240> take<00:05:55.390> him<00:05:55.540> out<00:05:55.690> in<00:05:55.930> I<00:05:56.860> think

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
missile you can take him out in I think

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.170 
missile you can take him out in I think
two<00:05:57.610> times<00:05:58.110> after<00:05:59.110> he<00:05:59.380> opens<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.710> up<00:05:59.830> twice

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
two times after he opens it up twice

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.940 
two times after he opens it up twice
however<00:06:01.180> here<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.390> kind<00:06:01.720> of<00:06:01.780> screw<00:06:02.080> it<00:06:02.170> up<00:06:02.260> it's

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
however here I kind of screw it up it's

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.460 
however here I kind of screw it up it's
really<00:06:03.190> random<00:06:04.080> because<00:06:05.080> you<00:06:05.200> may<00:06:05.350> have

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
really random because you may have

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.960 
really random because you may have
noticed<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:06.010> steam<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.550> the<00:06:06.670> engine

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
noticed that the steam that the engine

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.880 
noticed that the steam that the engine
was<00:06:07.060> letting<00:06:07.390> off<00:06:07.510> number<00:06:08.110> one<00:06:08.290> it<00:06:08.410> damages

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
was letting off number one it damages

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.490 
was letting off number one it damages
you<00:06:09.100> and<00:06:09.910> number<00:06:10.210> two<00:06:10.360> it<00:06:10.480> blocks<00:06:10.840> your<00:06:11.050> shots

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
you and number two it blocks your shots

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.470 
you and number two it blocks your shots
which<00:06:11.890> can<00:06:12.070> be<00:06:12.190> quite<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:12.640> pain<00:06:12.880> in<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.030> ass<00:06:13.210> so

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
which can be quite a pain in the ass so

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.030 
which can be quite a pain in the ass so
your<00:06:13.630> best<00:06:13.750> strategy<00:06:14.260> is<00:06:14.290> to<00:06:14.410> get<00:06:14.620> right<00:06:14.890> up

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
your best strategy is to get right up

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.520 
your best strategy is to get right up
next<00:06:15.250> to<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.580> core<00:06:15.850> and<00:06:16.090> hope<00:06:17.020> there's<00:06:17.350> not<00:06:17.470> a

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
next to the core and hope there's not a

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.400 
next to the core and hope there's not a
lot<00:06:17.740> of<00:06:17.770> steam<00:06:18.130> coming<00:06:18.700> out<00:06:18.850> where<00:06:19.150> you<00:06:19.300> are<00:06:19.540> if

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
lot of steam coming out where you are if

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.040 
lot of steam coming out where you are if
there<00:06:20.620> is<00:06:20.830> then<00:06:21.550> you're<00:06:21.730> just<00:06:21.760> unlucky<00:06:22.120> now

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
there is then you're just unlucky now

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.380 
there is then you're just unlucky now
unless<00:06:23.470> you're<00:06:23.710> blind<00:06:24.120> you've<00:06:25.120> probably

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
unless you're blind you've probably

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.600 
unless you're blind you've probably
noticed<00:06:25.840> those<00:06:26.110> two<00:06:26.320> swinging<00:06:26.710> balls<00:06:27.160> in<00:06:27.520> the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
noticed those two swinging balls in the

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.350 
noticed those two swinging balls in the
back<00:06:27.760> of<00:06:27.940> the<00:06:28.030> ship<00:06:28.090> which<00:06:28.570> why<00:06:29.940> he<00:06:30.940> has<00:06:31.120> those

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
back of the ship which why he has those

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.330 
back of the ship which why he has those
on<00:06:31.540> the<00:06:31.690> airships<00:06:32.050> beyond<00:06:32.470> me<00:06:32.680> that's<00:06:33.160> all

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
on the airships beyond me that's all

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.330 
on the airships beyond me that's all
right<00:06:33.520> those<00:06:34.180> are<00:06:34.360> insta<00:06:34.720> killers<00:06:35.050> and<00:06:35.340> you

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
right those are insta killers and you

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.770 
right those are insta killers and you
may<00:06:36.490> have<00:06:36.580> also<00:06:36.730> noticed<00:06:36.910> that<00:06:37.270> we're<00:06:37.480> slowly

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
may have also noticed that we're slowly

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.020 
may have also noticed that we're slowly
moving<00:06:38.110> up<00:06:38.380> towards<00:06:38.890> them<00:06:39.130> now<00:06:39.490> we<00:06:39.550> eventually

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
moving up towards them now we eventually

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.750 
moving up towards them now we eventually
get<00:06:40.330> up<00:06:40.450> so<00:06:40.660> far<00:06:40.930> that<00:06:41.200> you<00:06:42.010> can't<00:06:42.310> get<00:06:42.580> down

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
get up so far that you can't get down

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.330 
get up so far that you can't get down
below<00:06:43.240> the<00:06:43.450> engine<00:06:43.840> core<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.440> that's<00:06:44.830> quite

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
below the engine core and that's quite

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.890 
below the engine core and that's quite
dangerous<00:06:45.640> because<00:06:46.000> you<00:06:46.150> have<00:06:46.330> to<00:06:46.450> dodge<00:06:46.660> the

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
dangerous because you have to dodge the

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.590 
dangerous because you have to dodge the
missiles<00:06:47.230> while<00:06:47.440> dodging<00:06:47.770> the<00:06:48.100> insta<00:06:48.600> despite

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
missiles while dodging the insta despite

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.840 
missiles while dodging the insta despite
it<00:06:50.020> the<00:06:50.290> insta<00:06:50.620> kill<00:06:50.800> balls<00:06:51.130> there<00:06:51.550> I<00:06:51.580> guess

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
it the insta kill balls there I guess

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.530 
it the insta kill balls there I guess
you'd<00:06:52.060> say<00:06:52.300> and<00:06:52.740> also<00:06:53.820> it's<00:06:54.820> not<00:06:54.970> simply<00:06:55.360> the

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
you'd say and also it's not simply the

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.180 
you'd say and also it's not simply the
balls<00:06:55.780> that<00:06:56.050> you<00:06:56.140> have<00:06:56.290> to<00:06:56.470> worry<00:06:56.590> about<00:06:56.830> it's

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
balls that you have to worry about it's

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.830 
balls that you have to worry about it's
the<00:06:57.400> chain<00:06:57.700> that<00:06:57.910> they're<00:06:58.090> attached<00:06:58.420> to<00:06:58.660> that

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
the chain that they're attached to that

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.500 
the chain that they're attached to that
kills<00:06:59.500> you<00:06:59.620> instantly<00:06:59.890> as<00:07:00.220> well<00:07:00.460> very<00:07:01.180> deadly

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
kills you instantly as well very deadly

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.160 
kills you instantly as well very deadly
very<00:07:01.990> bad<00:07:03.180> however<00:07:04.180> once<00:07:04.450> you<00:07:04.570> get<00:07:04.750> up<00:07:04.900> to<00:07:05.050> us

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.170 
very bad however once you get up to us

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.740 
very bad however once you get up to us

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
then you'll float back down to the start

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.190 
then you'll float back down to the start
if<00:07:09.910> you<00:07:09.940> don't<00:07:10.240> kill<00:07:10.390> him<00:07:10.510> before<00:07:10.630> then<00:07:11.050> which

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
there's really no reason not to and

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.700 
there's really no reason not to and
you'll<00:07:13.510> start<00:07:13.780> the<00:07:13.960> whole<00:07:14.080> process<00:07:14.110> over

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710 
out of the way I thought this thing

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.170 
out of the way I thought this thing
would<00:07:29.860> float<00:07:30.160> up<00:07:30.310> from<00:07:30.490> the<00:07:30.580> bottom<00:07:30.760> here<00:07:31.030> but

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
would float up from the bottom here but

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.030 
would float up from the bottom here but
this<00:07:31.330> is<00:07:31.450> the<00:07:31.600> one<00:07:31.840> power<00:07:32.140> up<00:07:32.410> vehicle<00:07:32.920> after

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040 
this is the one power up vehicle after

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.520 
this is the one power up vehicle after
the<00:07:33.460> boss<00:07:33.640> that<00:07:34.540> you<00:07:34.690> don't<00:07:34.930> actually<00:07:35.140> have<00:07:35.350> to

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:35.530 
the boss that you don't actually have to

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.680 
the boss that you don't actually have to
destroy<00:07:36.070> and<00:07:36.580> I<00:07:36.670> really<00:07:36.910> fuck<00:07:37.120> myself<00:07:37.300> over
