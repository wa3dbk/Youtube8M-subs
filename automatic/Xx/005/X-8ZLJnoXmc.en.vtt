show us how it works I am so basically

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.940 
show us how it works I am so basically
what<00:00:55.730> we<00:00:55.880> would<00:00:56.030> do<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.360> prep<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.320> eye<00:00:57.350> with<00:00:57.770> a

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
what we would do is prep the eye with a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.520 
what we would do is prep the eye with a
cooling<00:00:58.340> gel<00:00:58.550> pad<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:59.630> why<00:01:00.380> is<00:01:00.470> that

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
cooling gel pad and why is that

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.400 
cooling gel pad and why is that
important<00:01:01.130> we<00:01:01.880> just<00:01:02.570> want<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.840> separate<00:01:03.200> the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
important we just want to separate the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.319 
important we just want to separate the
bottom<00:01:03.829> from<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.100> top<00:01:04.280> lashes<00:01:04.549> go<00:01:05.149> ahead<00:01:05.299> and

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
bottom from the top lashes go ahead and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:06.969 
bottom from the top lashes go ahead and
color<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.780> helps<00:01:06.020> keep<00:01:06.259> those<00:01:06.380> bottom<00:01:06.799> ones

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
color that helps keep those bottom ones

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.819 
color that helps keep those bottom ones
off<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:07.429> it<00:01:07.579> does<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.359> absolutely<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:09.590> really

right<00:01:35.959> on<00:01:36.079> top<00:01:36.319> of<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.529> lash<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.159> lay<00:01:37.459> it<00:01:37.609> down

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
right on top of the lash and lay it down

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.779 
right on top of the lash and lay it down
the<00:01:38.090> lash<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.450> actually<00:01:38.779> applied<00:01:39.159> to<00:01:40.159> the

lash sheds the extension will shed with

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.900 
lash sheds the extension will shed with
it<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.250> would<00:02:46.370> lose<00:02:46.550> them<00:02:46.700> at<00:02:46.820> the

it's going to be affordable for a lot of
people<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.690> for<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.780> initial<00:02:53.990> application

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
people it is for the initial application

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.020 
people it is for the initial application
it<00:02:54.800> can<00:02:54.920> run<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.100> little<00:02:55.280> high<00:02:55.520> it's<00:02:55.790> going<00:02:55.910> to

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
it can run a little high it's going to

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.980 
it can run a little high it's going to
range<00:02:56.240> anywhere<00:02:56.750> from<00:02:56.810> 150<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.920> 225<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:59.360> 200<00:02:59.930> is

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
range anywhere from 150 to 225 so 200 is

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.080 
range anywhere from 150 to 225 so 200 is
the<00:03:00.140> average<00:03:00.520> but<00:03:01.520> once<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.850> get<00:03:01.970> that

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
the average but once you get that
