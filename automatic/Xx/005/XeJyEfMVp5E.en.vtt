relaxed nice smooth swing being loose so

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.500 
relaxed nice smooth swing being loose so
that<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.170> gain<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.860> most<00:00:32.070> efficient<00:00:32.700> racket

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that we gain the most efficient racket

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.959 
that we gain the most efficient racket
head<00:00:33.629> speed<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.260> swing<00:00:34.530> through<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> ball

third<00:00:35.969> thing<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.539> using<00:00:37.379> our<00:00:37.890> whole<00:00:38.219> body<00:00:39.260> good

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
third thing is using our whole body good

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.889 
third thing is using our whole body good
rotation<00:00:40.499> good<00:00:41.249> legs<00:00:41.519> good<00:00:41.850> weight<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
rotation good legs good weight so that

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.349 
rotation good legs good weight so that
we<00:00:42.989> get<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.469> maximum<00:00:43.679> amount<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.640> power<00:00:44.909> for

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
we get the maximum amount of power for

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.590 
we get the maximum amount of power for
our<00:00:45.480> swing<00:00:45.809> yet<00:00:46.109> still<00:00:46.440> keep<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.399> control<00:00:47.879> so

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
our swing yet still keep that control so

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.680 
our swing yet still keep that control so
the<00:00:48.809> first<00:00:49.050> point<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.499> getting<00:00:49.710> more<00:00:50.069> power

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the first point in getting more power

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.380 
the first point in getting more power
committing<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> our<00:00:51.929> shot<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.909> is<00:00:54.149> an

committing to our shot now this is an

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.989 
committing to our shot now this is an
important<00:00:55.019> decision-making<00:00:55.589> process<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
important decision-making process as to

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.149

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.040 
what I'm going to do if it's a softer
slower<00:01:02.339> ball<00:01:02.729> I<00:01:02.760> might<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.389> a<00:01:03.420> more<00:01:03.719> aggressive

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
slower ball I might be a more aggressive

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.990 
slower ball I might be a more aggressive
more<00:01:04.500> offensive<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.370> but<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> need<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> make

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
more offensive on it but I need to make

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300 
more offensive on it but I need to make
that<00:01:06.150> decision<00:01:06.540> early<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.100> feet

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that decision early so I can get my feet

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
that decision early so I can get my feet
in<00:01:08.340> proper<00:01:08.790> position<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:10.259> able<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> finish

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
in proper position and be able to finish

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
in proper position and be able to finish
my<00:01:10.979> swing<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.399> might<00:01:11.520> even<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> neutralizing

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
my swing it might even be a neutralizing

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.069 
my swing it might even be a neutralizing
ball<00:01:12.840> where<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.890> may<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.579> to<00:01:14.850> absorb<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.899> ball

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
ball where I may have to absorb the ball

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.020 
ball where I may have to absorb the ball
a<00:01:16.110> little<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.219> I<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.640> what<00:01:17.939> I'm

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

it's being decisive making a good
commitment<00:01:26.789> to<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.030> shot<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
normal ball or it's right in here

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.469 
normal ball or it's right in here
I've<00:01:30.659> decided<00:01:31.049> right<00:01:31.409> away<00:01:31.469> I<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:33.329> going

to hit through the ball I can get in

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.730 
to hit through the ball I can get in
good<00:01:36.359> position<00:01:36.899> get<00:01:37.079> my<00:01:37.200> weight<00:01:37.409> into<00:01:37.649> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
good position get my weight into the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
good position get my weight into the
ball<00:01:37.829> backing<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:39.359> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> go

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
ball backing up I know I'm going to go

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.649 
ball backing up I know I'm going to go
higher<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.609> little<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.030> lower<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.570> I'm

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
higher this is a little bit lower so I'm

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.359 
higher this is a little bit lower so I'm
going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> attack<00:01:43.109> this<00:01:43.469> I<00:01:43.680> might<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.219> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
going to attack this I might have to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
going to attack this I might have to
absorb<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.939> ball<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
absorb the ball here a little bit and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.099 
absorb the ball here a little bit and
coming<00:01:47.250> forward<00:01:47.789> so<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.240> immediately<00:01:48.899> are

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
coming forward so we immediately are

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.289 
coming forward so we immediately are
seeing<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.500> we're<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.299> making

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
seeing what we're going to do and making

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.870

that decision if we're in good position
everything<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.840> working<00:01:55.049> here<00:01:55.649> sometimes

everything is working here sometimes
it's<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.820> matter<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.179> if<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:58.609> sure<00:01:59.609> what

the<00:02:10.050> second<00:02:10.500> thing<00:02:10.710> is<00:02:10.890> how<00:02:11.160> we're<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the second thing is how we're going to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.649 
the second thing is how we're going to
get<00:02:12.060> more<00:02:12.330> power<00:02:12.629> from<00:02:13.379> our<00:02:13.620> swing<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:15.180> our

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
get more power from our swing and in our

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.180 
get more power from our swing and in our
body<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
body and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.680 
body and
in<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.340> case<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> matter

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
in this case it's going to be a matter

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.690 
in this case it's going to be a matter
of<00:02:18.810> getting<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.680> feet<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.980> great<00:02:20.160> position

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
of getting your feet in great position

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.040 
of getting your feet in great position
because<00:02:20.940> that's<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.330> important

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
because that's so important

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.720 
because that's so important
using<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> legs<00:02:22.800> hips<00:02:23.810> shoulder<00:02:24.810> arm<00:02:25.730> good

racket<00:02:27.030> head<00:02:27.300> speed<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.990> we<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:29.070> able<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.370> get

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
racket head speed and we are able to get

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.190 
racket head speed and we are able to get
the<00:02:29.760> most<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.750> we're<00:02:30.870> doing<00:02:30.990> with

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the most out of what we're doing with

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.610 
the most out of what we're doing with
our<00:02:31.320> swing<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.340> using<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.510> arm<00:02:33.840> we're

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
our swing if we are using just arm we're

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050 
our swing if we are using just arm we're
not<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.160> very<00:02:35.340> efficient<00:02:35.880> because

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
not going to be very efficient because

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.670 
not going to be very efficient because
here<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.360> are<00:02:36.390> swinging<00:02:36.900> trying<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.350> gain<00:02:37.500> more

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
here we are swinging trying to gain more

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.340 
here we are swinging trying to gain more
power<00:02:37.820> you<00:02:38.820> have<00:02:38.940> another<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.240> I'm<00:02:39.930> really

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
power you have another one I'm really

going to hit this ball but it's all with

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.140 
going to hit this ball but it's all with

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
my arm I'm going to hit this wall my arm

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.700 
my arm I'm going to hit this wall my arm
the<00:02:45.630> other<00:02:45.750> time<00:02:45.960> just<00:02:46.170> see<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.350> people<00:02:46.500> are

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
the other time just see as people are

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.610 
the other time just see as people are
trying<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:46.980> hit<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.220> ball<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.550> hard<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:49.080> get

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
trying to hit the ball so hard that get

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.010 
trying to hit the ball so hard that get
tight<00:02:49.860> now<00:02:50.640> they're<00:02:50.940> using<00:02:51.150> their<00:02:51.540> whole<00:02:51.720> body

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
tight now they're using their whole body

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.110 
tight now they're using their whole body
and<00:02:53.360> sometimes<00:02:54.360> my<00:02:55.230> timing<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.710> off<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.700> come

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and sometimes my timing is off so I come

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.470 
and sometimes my timing is off so I come
up<00:02:57.150> with<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.480> legs<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:58.200> rotate<00:02:59.160> too<00:02:59.340> early<00:02:59.820> I'm

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
up with the legs I rotate too early I'm

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480 
up with the legs I rotate too early I'm
just<00:03:00.840> trying<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.110> do<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.620> much<00:03:01.860> with<00:03:02.040> my<00:03:02.250> body

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
just trying to do so much with my body

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.800 
just trying to do so much with my body
so<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.450> combination<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:05.720> letting<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
so it's a combination of letting the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.880 
so it's a combination of letting the
racket<00:03:07.320> go<00:03:08.660> good<00:03:09.660> balance<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.380> I'm<00:03:10.530> being<00:03:10.740> more

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
racket go good balance if I'm being more

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.200 
racket go good balance if I'm being more
aggressive<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:12.020> a<00:03:13.020> nice<00:03:13.440> smooth<00:03:13.910> nice<00:03:14.910> fake

Justin<00:03:15.810> swing<00:03:16.680> pattern<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.910> then<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.180> am<00:03:18.420> able

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
Justin swing pattern so then I am able

point letting my racket go that should

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.530 
point letting my racket go that should
give<00:03:30.000> me<00:03:30.030> plenty<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.630> power<00:03:31.010> yet<00:03:32.010> still<00:03:32.540> having

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
give me plenty of power yet still having

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.930 
give me plenty of power yet still having
the<00:03:33.630> control<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.110> need<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:35.040> put<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> ball<00:03:35.640> where

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
the control I need to put the ball where

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.120 
the control I need to put the ball where
I'm<00:03:36.060> aiming<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.410> third<00:03:37.680> thing<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:37.980> probably

I'm aiming the third thing and probably

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.490 
I'm aiming the third thing and probably
the<00:03:38.489> key<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:39.360> getting<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.870> power<00:03:40.110> with

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the key to getting that power with

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.600 
the key to getting that power with
control<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:43.050> ability<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.560> stay<00:03:43.920> relaxed

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
control is the ability to stay relaxed

tense up and get tight because they're

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.199

and<00:03:54.480> everything<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:55.040> walks<00:03:56.040> up<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.489> freezes

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
and everything just walks up and freezes

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.550 
and everything just walks up and freezes
our<00:03:57.060> head<00:03:57.269> whips<00:03:57.480> around<00:03:57.660> we're<00:03:58.140> doing<00:03:58.410> all

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
our head whips around we're doing all

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.000 
our head whips around we're doing all
this<00:03:58.739> so<00:03:58.920> we're<00:03:59.070> not<00:03:59.160> very<00:03:59.430> efficient<00:04:00.739> if<00:04:01.739> we

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
this so we're not very efficient if we

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.660 
this so we're not very efficient if we
swing<00:04:02.430> smooth<00:04:03.560> using<00:04:04.560> our<00:04:04.890> whole<00:04:05.040> body<00:04:05.310> in

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
swing smooth using our whole body in

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.330 
swing smooth using our whole body in
good<00:04:06.120> timing<00:04:06.750> we<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.650> hit<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.890> ball<00:04:08.070> very

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
good timing we can hit the ball very

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.810 
good timing we can hit the ball very
hard<00:04:09.030> get<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.450> little<00:04:09.720> bit<00:04:09.840> more<00:04:09.989> power<00:04:10.260> and

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
hard get a little bit more power and

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.400 
hard get a little bit more power and
keep<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:12.090> control<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.810> we<00:04:12.930> want<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.260> keep

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
keep that control that we want to keep

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.220 
keep that control that we want to keep
the<00:04:13.590> ball<00:04:13.709> on<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.950> court
