running some 35g rifts and they actually
came<00:00:44.530> in<00:00:44.590> really<00:00:44.859> handy<00:00:45.269> we<00:00:46.269> were<00:00:46.390> able<00:00:47.019> to<00:00:47.379> run

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
came in really handy we were able to run

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.819 
came in really handy we were able to run
most<00:00:48.039> of<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.250> G<00:00:48.489> rifts<00:00:48.879> at<00:00:49.239> 35<00:00:49.960> 36<00:00:50.589> 37<00:00:50.890> at<00:00:51.519> about

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
most of the G rifts at 35 36 37 at about

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.720 
most of the G rifts at 35 36 37 at about
three<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:54.399> four<00:00:54.730> minutes<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:57.070> using<00:00:57.249> focus

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
three to four minutes we're using focus

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.939 
three to four minutes we're using focus
and<00:00:57.879> restraint<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.449> have<00:00:58.749> pain<00:00:59.079> enhancer<00:00:59.589> I'm

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
and restraint I have pain enhancer I'm

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.000 
and restraint I have pain enhancer I'm
not<00:01:00.160> sure<00:01:00.309> if<00:01:00.399> that's<00:01:00.489> optimal<00:01:01.089> but<00:01:01.559> i'm<00:01:02.559> using

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
not sure if that's optimal but i'm using

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.720 
not sure if that's optimal but i'm using
it<00:01:03.100> right<00:01:03.129> now<00:01:03.330> focus<00:01:04.330> being<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.809> powerful

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
it right now focus being the powerful

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.190 
it right now focus being the powerful
also<00:01:06.730> not<00:01:07.060> sure<00:01:07.240> if<00:01:07.330> that's<00:01:07.420> optional<00:01:07.870> but<00:01:08.140> i

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
also not sure if that's optional but i

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.290 
also not sure if that's optional but i
think<00:01:08.590> that's<00:01:08.740> pretty<00:01:08.920> good<00:01:09.190> bandit<00:01:10.030> wrapped

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
think that's pretty good bandit wrapped

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.700 
think that's pretty good bandit wrapped
its<00:01:10.840> only<00:01:10.990> level<00:01:11.230> 25<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.780> death<00:01:13.780> match<00:01:13.990> Death

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
its only level 25 and death match Death

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.610 
its only level 25 and death match Death

now I'm using ice blades because i

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
now I'm using ice blades because i
needed<00:01:23.260> a<00:01:23.500> nice<00:01:23.680> skill<00:01:24.070> at<00:01:24.400> generator<00:01:25.440> so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
needed a nice skill at generator so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.350 
needed a nice skill at generator so
that's<00:01:27.790> what<00:01:28.240> i<00:01:28.270> used<00:01:29.010> force<00:01:30.010> this<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:30.880> helpful

that's what i used force this is helpful

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.250 
that's what i used force this is helpful
when<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.780> restores<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.620> one<00:01:34.230> arcane<00:01:35.230> power

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
when it restores the one arcane power

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.310 
when it restores the one arcane power
but<00:01:36.010> when<00:01:36.220> you<00:01:36.280> get<00:01:36.430> into<00:01:36.550> big<00:01:36.910> packs

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
but when you get into big packs

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.060 
but when you get into big packs
also<00:01:39.220> using<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.820> here<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.830> want

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
also using it here because I just I want

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.260 
also using it here because I just I want
to<00:01:42.190> have<00:01:42.310> as<00:01:42.460> much<00:01:42.580> arcane<00:01:42.940> power<00:01:43.080> as<00:01:44.080> possible

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to have as much arcane power as possible

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.390 
to have as much arcane power as possible
so<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.300> can<00:01:46.360> blink<00:01:46.690> around<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.050> calamity<00:01:47.530> lets<00:01:48.070> it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
so I can blink around a calamity lets it

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.420 
so I can blink around a calamity lets it
do<00:01:48.610> damage<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.210> that's<00:01:49.390> my<00:01:50.040> arcane<00:01:51.040> damage

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
do damage so that's my arcane damage

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.609 
do damage so that's my arcane damage
there<00:01:51.760> so<00:01:52.390> we've<00:01:52.510> got<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.810> frost<00:01:53.229> the

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
there so we've got the frost the

there so we've got the frost the
lightning<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.340> arcane<00:01:55.380> i'm<00:01:56.380> using<00:01:56.770> right<00:01:56.800> now

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
lightning the arcane i'm using right now

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.999 
lightning the arcane i'm using right now
the<00:01:57.130> short<00:01:57.520> fuse<00:01:58.770> for<00:02:00.119> explosive<00:02:01.119> blast<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.710> i

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
might try to switch it to chain reaction

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
might try to switch it to chain reaction
because<00:02:08.170> it's<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.380> little<00:02:08.560> bit<00:02:08.649> more<00:02:08.770> damage

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
because it's a little bit more damage

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.820 
because it's a little bit more damage
and<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.850> it<00:02:10.000> happens<00:02:10.390> more<00:02:10.509> often<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:14.739> fact

I'm going to switch it right now I'll

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.940 
I'm going to switch it right now I'll
see<00:02:16.600> what<00:02:16.720> happens<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.140> then<00:02:17.290> lightning

speed passive so that's illusionist

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.280 
speed passive so that's illusionist
thirty<00:02:25.120> percent<00:02:25.270> moving<00:02:25.840> speed<00:02:26.050> when<00:02:26.200> you

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
thirty percent moving speed when you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.990 
thirty percent moving speed when you
blink<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.010> blink<00:02:27.190> all<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.489> time<00:02:27.670> so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
blink and you can blink all the time so

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.390 
blink and you can blink all the time so
that's<00:02:28.270> okay<00:02:28.620> astral<00:02:29.620> presence<00:02:30.010> which<00:02:30.160> gives

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
that's okay astral presence which gives

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.750 
that's okay astral presence which gives
you<00:02:30.550> regen<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.330> arcane<00:02:32.489> fifteen<00:02:33.489> percent

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
you regen on arcane fifteen percent

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.540 
you regen on arcane fifteen percent
damage<00:02:34.030> when<00:02:34.330> you're<00:02:34.510> within<00:02:35.100> range<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.310> stuff

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
damage when you're within range of stuff

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.040 
damage when you're within range of stuff
because<00:02:36.820> you're<00:02:37.120> going<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.300> be<00:02:37.390> in<00:02:37.450> range<00:02:37.750> and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
because you're going to be in range and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.570 
because you're going to be in range and
then<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.410> one's<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.920> be<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.190> regular

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
then this one's going to be the regular

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.570 
then this one's going to be the regular
tal<00:02:39.760> Rasha<00:02:39.970> stuff<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:41.110> if<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.410> go<00:02:41.890> through<00:02:42.160> here

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
tal Rasha stuff so if we go through here

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.710 
tal Rasha stuff so if we go through here
I<00:02:42.730> need<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.540> key<00:02:44.580> let's<00:02:45.580> get<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.180> couple<00:02:46.420> keys

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
I need a key let's get a couple keys

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.240 
I need a key let's get a couple keys
still<00:02:47.200> waiting<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.959> go<00:02:50.200> through<00:02:50.500> here<00:02:50.830> we

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
still waiting and we go through here we

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.540 
still waiting and we go through here we
can<00:02:51.489> time<00:02:52.049> this

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
can time this

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.890 
can time this
i'm<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.210> start<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.510> timer

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.069 

and<00:02:58.019> start<00:02:58.799> moving<00:02:59.099> this<00:02:59.370> along<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:02.060> starting

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
and start moving this along and starting

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.280 
and start moving this along and starting
now

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.730 

wrong<00:03:07.280> way<00:03:08.110> need<00:03:09.110> more<00:03:09.290> time

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.230 

so<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.880> really<00:03:13.240> helpful<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.990> be<00:03:14.110> able<00:03:14.140> to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
so it's really helpful to be able to

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:23.460 
so it's really helpful to be able to
blink<00:03:16.240> around<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:17.050> this

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.710 

the<00:03:24.470> blink<00:03:24.920> really<00:03:25.280> helps<00:03:25.580> this<00:03:25.820> also<00:03:26.210> really

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
the blink really helps this also really

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.480 
the blink really helps this also really
helps<00:03:27.020> because<00:03:27.050> I<00:03:27.410> can<00:03:27.620> spawn<00:03:27.950> these<00:03:28.190> things

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
helps because I can spawn these things

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.150 
helps because I can spawn these things
whenever<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.000> want<00:03:29.360> or<00:03:30.020> whenever<00:03:30.530> I<00:03:30.710> come<00:03:31.040> in

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
whenever I want or whenever I come in

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.210 
whenever I want or whenever I come in
contact<00:03:31.310> with<00:03:31.700> one<00:03:32.240> of<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.420> shrines<00:03:33.220> we're

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
contact with one of the shrines we're

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.850 
contact with one of the shrines we're
looking<00:03:34.460> at<00:03:34.550> an<00:03:34.610> outside<00:03:34.790> riff<00:03:35.270> so<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:36.680> is

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
looking at an outside riff so this is

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.490 
looking at an outside riff so this is
really<00:03:37.100> good<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.880> probably<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.330> the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
really good this is probably like the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.650 
really good this is probably like the
optimal<00:03:41.410> rift<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.620> want<00:03:42.800> to<00:03:42.860> be<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:46.540> again<00:03:47.540> I'm

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
optimal rift you want to be in again I'm

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.720 
optimal rift you want to be in again I'm
probably<00:03:48.200> not<00:03:48.440> doing<00:03:48.710> this<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.430> most

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
probably not doing this the most

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.060 
probably not doing this the most
efficiently<00:03:50.740> I<00:03:52.930> have<00:03:53.930> forgot<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.410> even

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
efficiently I have forgot that even

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.720 
efficiently I have forgot that even
though<00:03:55.160> it's<00:03:55.310> just<00:03:55.550> two<00:03:55.790> minutes<00:03:56.000> sword<00:03:57.730> you

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
though it's just two minutes sword you

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.980 
though it's just two minutes sword you
know<00:03:58.880> you<00:03:59.210> might<00:03:59.360> be<00:03:59.390> able<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.720> do<00:03:59.810> this<00:03:59.930> a

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
know you might be able to do this a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.500 
know you might be able to do this a
little<00:04:00.110> bit<00:04:00.290> faster<00:04:00.440> than<00:04:00.770> me

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.250 

I<00:04:04.599> think<00:04:05.500> that<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:06.670> has<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.599> potential<00:04:08.049> I'm

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
I think that it has the potential I'm

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.569 
I think that it has the potential I'm
killing<00:04:08.590> stuff<00:04:08.829> that<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.010> probably<00:04:09.220> shouldn't

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
killing stuff that I probably shouldn't

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.360 
killing stuff that I probably shouldn't
be<00:04:09.670> killing<00:04:09.879> here<00:04:10.209> but<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:11.099> think<00:04:12.099> it<00:04:12.220> has<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
be killing here but I think it has the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.939 
be killing here but I think it has the
potential<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.970> be<00:04:13.209> faster<00:04:13.810> than<00:04:16.650> well<00:04:17.650> maybe

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
potential to be faster than well maybe

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.979 
potential to be faster than well maybe
not<00:04:18.130> faster<00:04:18.609> than<00:04:18.639> a<00:04:18.760> month<00:04:19.060> but<00:04:19.389> you<00:04:19.900> know

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
not faster than a month but you know

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.560 
not faster than a month but you know
similar<00:04:20.380> speeds<00:04:20.829> maybe<00:04:21.760> not<00:04:22.000> summer<00:04:22.330> sees<00:04:22.720> it

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
similar speeds maybe not summer sees it

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.480 
similar speeds maybe not summer sees it
it's<00:04:25.570> quick<00:04:25.990> it's<00:04:26.650> not<00:04:26.860> as<00:04:26.979> fast<00:04:27.220> because

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
it's quick it's not as fast because

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.430 
it's quick it's not as fast because
you're<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:27.699> killing<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.270> during<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.840> blink<00:04:29.169> I

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
you're not killing it during the blink I

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.670 
you're not killing it during the blink I
I<00:04:30.250> would<00:04:30.520> say<00:04:30.789> as<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.660> monk<00:04:33.360> because<00:04:34.680> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
I would say as the monk because the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.070 
I would say as the monk because the
Quinn<00:04:35.889> 69<00:04:36.340> builds<00:04:36.729> always<00:04:37.060> have<00:04:37.270> like<00:04:37.870> these

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
Quinn 69 builds always have like these

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.200 
Quinn 69 builds always have like these
like<00:04:38.470> just<00:04:38.710> shredding<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.460> stuff<00:04:39.699> in<00:04:39.940> the

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
like just shredding the stuff in the

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.200 
like just shredding the stuff in the
process<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.889> doing<00:04:41.889> it<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.340> not<00:04:42.850> quite<00:04:43.030> that

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
process of doing it so not quite that

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.050 
process of doing it so not quite that
fast<00:04:43.419> but<00:04:43.720> still<00:04:44.020> pretty<00:04:44.199> fast<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.880> lot

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
fast but still pretty fast and and a lot

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.090 
fast but still pretty fast and and a lot
of<00:04:46.180> fun<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:48.090> think<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:50.020> has<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.289> really<00:04:50.770> good

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
of fun I think that it has a really good

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.040 
of fun I think that it has a really good
potential<00:04:51.610> for<00:04:53.610> key<00:04:54.610> farming<00:04:55.090> not<00:04:55.840> keep

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
potential for key farming not keep

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.590 
potential for key farming not keep
farming<00:04:56.260> but<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:57.630> royal<00:04:58.630> ring<00:04:58.930> and<00:05:00.600> amulet

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
farming but a royal ring and amulet

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.400 
farming but a royal ring and amulet
farming<00:05:02.310> because<00:05:06.060> you<00:05:07.060> can<00:05:07.240> blink<00:05:07.539> I<00:05:07.840> think<00:05:08.260> a

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
farming because you can blink I think a

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.379 
farming because you can blink I think a
little<00:05:08.590> bit<00:05:08.710> faster<00:05:09.250> i'm<00:05:09.340> running<00:05:09.639> out<00:05:09.729> of<00:05:09.789> not

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
little bit faster i'm running out of not

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.490 
little bit faster i'm running out of not
doing<00:05:10.750> this<00:05:10.960> right<00:05:11.110> away<00:05:11.349> but

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
doing this right away but

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.920 
doing this right away but
so<00:05:13.190> that<00:05:13.340> was<00:05:13.490> two<00:05:13.760> minutes<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.300> nine<00:05:14.450> seconds

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
so that was two minutes and nine seconds

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.370 
so that was two minutes and nine seconds
so<00:05:15.710> that's<00:05:15.890> pretty<00:05:16.100> good<00:05:16.870> it's<00:05:17.870> not<00:05:17.990> too<00:05:18.200> bad

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.390 

all<00:05:20.710> this<00:05:20.860> annoying<00:05:21.160> stuff<00:05:23.130> but<00:05:24.130> it's<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.370> it's

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
all this annoying stuff but it's a it's

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.480 
all this annoying stuff but it's a it's
a<00:05:24.880> fun<00:05:25.060> build<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.800> like<00:05:26.800> i<00:05:26.890> said<00:05:26.980> i<00:05:27.100> was<00:05:27.310> able

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
a fun build and like i said i was able

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.810 
a fun build and like i said i was able
to<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:28.180> run<00:05:28.420> a<00:05:28.770> greater<00:05:29.770> rift<00:05:30.010> 35<00:05:30.400> with<00:05:30.640> that

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
to to run a greater rift 35 with that

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.090 
to to run a greater rift 35 with that
and<00:05:31.110> kind<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.230> farm<00:05:32.470> it<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:33.550> know<00:05:35.070> some<00:05:36.070> of

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
and kind of farm it you know some of

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.830 
and kind of farm it you know some of
their<00:05:36.280> money<00:05:36.570> not<00:05:37.570> that<00:05:37.690> i<00:05:37.780> really<00:05:37.930> need<00:05:38.170> this

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
their money not that i really need this

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.240 
their money not that i really need this
but<00:05:40.840> this<00:05:41.230> is<00:05:41.650> what<00:05:42.340> you<00:05:43.000> know<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.150> think<00:05:43.390> that

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
but this is what you know I think that

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.930 
but this is what you know I think that
you<00:05:45.250> don't<00:05:45.370> have<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.610> worry<00:05:45.910> about

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.150 

the<00:05:52.720> spirit<00:05:53.720> regen<00:05:54.050> like<00:05:54.470> you<00:05:54.590> do<00:05:54.710> in<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:54.949> monk

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
the spirit regen like you do in the monk

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.400 
the spirit regen like you do in the monk
I<00:05:55.370> mean<00:05:55.639> it's<00:05:56.180> pretty<00:05:56.600> good<00:05:56.870> but<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.080> think<00:05:57.289> it's

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
I mean it's pretty good but I think it's

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.659 
I mean it's pretty good but I think it's
better<00:05:57.560> than<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.830> spirit<00:05:58.160> regen<00:05:58.460> in<00:05:58.610> the

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
better than the spirit regen in the

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.409 
better than the spirit regen in the
month<00:05:58.850> so<00:05:59.720> I<00:05:59.750> can<00:06:00.460> shoot<00:06:01.460> across<00:06:01.699> here<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.090> lot

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
month so I can shoot across here a lot

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.140 
month so I can shoot across here a lot
faster

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.120 

I<00:06:06.920> mean<00:06:07.920> I<00:06:08.040> didn't<00:06:08.310> need<00:06:08.400> to<00:06:08.490> do<00:06:08.610> that<00:06:08.640> but<00:06:10.130> yeah

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
I mean I didn't need to do that but yeah

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.010 
I mean I didn't need to do that but yeah
the<00:06:11.610> referee<00:06:11.820> is<00:06:11.940> done<00:06:12.150> so<00:06:12.750> that's<00:06:12.810> pretty

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
the referee is done so that's pretty

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.110 
the referee is done so that's pretty
cool
