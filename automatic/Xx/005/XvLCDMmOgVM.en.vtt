00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
a pretty simple setup basically just

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.180 
a pretty simple setup basically just
secure<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:44.080> truck<00:00:44.290> on<00:00:44.530> here<00:00:44.860> on<00:00:45.610> your<00:00:45.730> line

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

and you're going to take your worm and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.020 
and you're going to take your worm and
it<00:00:51.640> helps<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.150> have<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.300> worm<00:00:52.540> that's<00:00:52.809> kind<00:00:53.170> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it helps to have a worm that's kind of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
it helps to have a worm that's kind of
even<00:00:55.030> cited<00:00:55.269> on<00:00:55.540> you<00:00:55.989> know<00:00:57.600> one<00:00:58.600> side<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:58.900> not

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
even cited on you know one side is not

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.079 
even cited on you know one side is not
bigger<00:00:59.260> than<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.409> other<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.830> one<00:01:00.040> is<00:01:00.220> not<00:01:01.030> a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
bigger than the other this one is not a

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.640 
bigger than the other this one is not a
very<00:01:01.300> good<00:01:01.390> example<00:01:01.600> but<00:01:02.110> we're<00:01:02.260> using<00:01:02.440> it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
very good example but we're using it

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.280 
very good example but we're using it
anyway

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.020 

so<00:01:08.950> what<00:01:09.100> you<00:01:09.160> do<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:09.490> take<00:01:09.700> your<00:01:09.880> hook

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
so what you do is just take your hook

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so what you do is just take your hook
and<00:01:11.970> put<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.060> right<00:01:13.090> up<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.660> middle<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.960> this

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
and put it right up the middle of this

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.750 
and put it right up the middle of this
worm<00:01:17.190> now<00:01:18.190> when<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.520> toss<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:18.970> in<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.580> going

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
worm now when you toss it in it's going

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.530 
worm now when you toss it in it's going
to<00:01:21.790> float<00:01:23.640> it'll<00:01:24.640> be<00:01:24.760> something<00:01:25.150> like<00:01:25.330> this

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
to float it'll be something like this

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.290 
to float it'll be something like this
where<00:01:25.840> it's<00:01:26.490> stretched<00:01:27.490> out<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.000> kind

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
where it's stretched out like this kind

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.920 
where it's stretched out like this kind
of<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:29.440> is<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:31.090> way<00:01:31.120> I<00:01:31.300> found<00:01:31.660> that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
of and this is one way I found that

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.250 
of and this is one way I found that
really<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.740> small<00:01:33.700> ponds<00:01:34.060> can<00:01:34.450> attract<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:35.050> lot

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
really and small ponds can attract a lot

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.070 
really and small ponds can attract a lot
of<00:01:35.290> bass<00:01:35.560> as<00:01:35.920> well<00:01:36.700> as<00:01:36.880> some<00:01:37.000> other<00:01:37.090> fish<00:01:38.820> now

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
of bass as well as some other fish now

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.660 
of bass as well as some other fish now
the<00:01:41.080> best<00:01:41.259> way<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.500> do<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.830> we'd<00:01:42.190> list<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.580> to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
the best way to do this we'd list is to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.990 
the best way to do this we'd list is to
get<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.820> weedless<00:01:43.000> hook<00:01:44.009> which<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.190> do<00:01:45.550> not<00:01:45.790> have

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
get a weedless hook which I do not have

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.060 
get a weedless hook which I do not have
on<00:01:46.210> here<00:01:46.420> right<00:01:46.570> now<00:01:46.720> but<00:01:47.229> it's<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.470> same<00:01:47.710> idea

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
on here right now but it's the same idea

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.950 
on here right now but it's the same idea
and<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.380> weightless<00:01:50.740> like<00:01:50.890> does<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.960> has

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
and all the weightless like does is has

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.390 
and all the weightless like does is has
a<00:01:52.990> little<00:01:53.200> thing<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:53.470> goes<00:01:53.619> from<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.009> tip<00:01:54.280> of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
a little thing that goes from the tip of

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.609 
a little thing that goes from the tip of
their<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:56.340> retie<00:01:57.340> on<00:01:57.490> your<00:01:57.640> hook<00:01:57.790> at<00:01:58.619> and

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
their to retie on your hook at and

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.850 
their to retie on your hook at and
that's<00:01:59.800> just<00:01:59.979> gonna<00:02:00.130> keep<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.850> weeds<00:02:01.030> from

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that's just gonna keep the weeds from

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.460 
that's just gonna keep the weeds from
getting<00:02:02.860> caught<00:02:03.040> on<00:02:03.190> your<00:02:03.280> hook
