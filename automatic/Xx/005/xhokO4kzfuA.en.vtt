00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.609 
use for them and the reason I'm posting
a<00:00:14.209> video<00:00:14.299> on<00:00:14.450> it<00:00:14.719> is<00:00:14.839> because<00:00:15.110> I<00:00:15.139> was<00:00:15.320> unable<00:00:15.559> to

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
a video on it is because I was unable to

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.439 
a video on it is because I was unable to
find<00:00:15.799> a<00:00:16.129> video<00:00:16.250> of<00:00:16.400> bismuth<00:00:16.939> dissolving<00:00:17.359> in

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
find a video of bismuth dissolving in

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.359 
find a video of bismuth dissolving in
nitric<00:00:17.810> acid<00:00:18.170> anywhere<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.099> I<00:00:19.130> thought<00:00:19.279> I'd

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
nitric acid anywhere so I thought I'd

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.910 
nitric acid anywhere so I thought I'd
show<00:00:19.550> it<00:00:19.689> so<00:00:20.689> in<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:21.289> beaker<00:00:21.560> right<00:00:21.590> there

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
show it so in the beaker right there

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.480 
show it so in the beaker right there
I've<00:00:22.189> got<00:00:22.400> my<00:00:22.849> concentrated<00:00:23.420> nitric<00:00:23.689> acid<00:00:24.140> and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
I've got my concentrated nitric acid and

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.720 
I've got my concentrated nitric acid and
a<00:00:25.490> shot<00:00:26.060> of<00:00:26.089> bismuth<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:26.919> no<00:00:27.919> reaction<00:00:28.160> is

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
a shot of bismuth and no reaction is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.089 
a shot of bismuth and no reaction is
observed<00:00:29.689> which<00:00:30.349> means<00:00:30.560> I'm<00:00:30.740> gonna<00:00:30.830> need<00:00:30.919> to

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
observed which means I'm gonna need to

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.080 
observed which means I'm gonna need to
be<00:00:31.160> heating<00:00:31.400> it<00:00:32.590> so<00:00:34.539> heating<00:00:35.539> is<00:00:35.629> turned<00:00:35.840> on

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
be heating it so heating is turned on

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.069 
be heating it so heating is turned on
I'd<00:00:38.090> also<00:00:38.270> like<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.510> point<00:00:38.690> out<00:00:38.780> that<00:00:38.840> I<00:00:38.930> have<00:00:39.020> a

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
I'd also like to point out that I have a

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.420 
I'd also like to point out that I have a
watch<00:00:39.199> glass<00:00:39.500> sitting<00:00:39.739> on<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.920> beaker<00:00:40.219> and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
watch glass sitting on the beaker and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.119 
watch glass sitting on the beaker and
the<00:00:41.120> reasons<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:41.600> that<00:00:41.750> is<00:00:42.140> one<00:00:42.710> it'll<00:00:43.010> help

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
the reasons for that is one it'll help

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.130 
the reasons for that is one it'll help
control<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.610> nitrogen<00:00:44.420> dioxide<00:00:44.840> fumes

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
control the nitrogen dioxide fumes

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.619 
control the nitrogen dioxide fumes
coming<00:00:45.469> off<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.920> two<00:00:46.760> if<00:00:47.000> I<00:00:47.180> need<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.480> heat<00:00:47.600> it

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
coming off and two if I need to heat it

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:48.670 
coming off and two if I need to heat it
to<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.809> point<00:00:47.899> where<00:00:48.170> some<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.440> nitric

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
to the point where some of the nitric

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.860 
to the point where some of the nitric
acid<00:00:48.949> starts<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.250> boil<00:00:49.430> then<00:00:50.120> it<00:00:50.300> will<00:00:50.420> reflux

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
acid starts to boil then it will reflux

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.049 
acid starts to boil then it will reflux
some<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:51.350> nitric<00:00:51.590> acid<00:00:51.890> for<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.460> better

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
some of the nitric acid for a better

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.979 
some of the nitric acid for a better
yield<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:55.430> away<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:55.820> will<00:00:56.180> start<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.899> video

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
yield so away I will start the video

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.990 
yield so away I will start the video
again<00:00:57.170> once<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:57.949> see<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.219> bismuth<00:00:58.609> start<00:00:58.910> to

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
again once I see the bismuth start to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.709 
again once I see the bismuth start to
dissolve<00:00:59.239> in<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.359> nitric<00:00:59.629> acid<00:01:01.539> it's<00:01:02.539> been

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
dissolve in the nitric acid it's been

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.890 
dissolve in the nitric acid it's been
about<00:01:02.929> fifty<00:01:03.530> minutes<00:01:03.710> after<00:01:04.640> being<00:01:05.150> bismuth

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
about fifty minutes after being bismuth

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.240 
about fifty minutes after being bismuth
first<00:01:06.140> for<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.320> bubbling<00:01:06.619> in<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.860> solution

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
first for the bubbling in the solution

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.520 
first for the bubbling in the solution
and<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:08.420> second<00:01:08.720> piece<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:09.020> bismuth<00:01:09.290> has<00:01:09.380> been

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
and a second piece of bismuth has been

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.609 
and a second piece of bismuth has been
added<00:01:09.799> since<00:01:09.950> then<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:11.659> reaction<00:01:12.080> did<00:01:12.320> seem

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
added since then the reaction did seem

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.920 
added since then the reaction did seem
to<00:01:12.650> slow<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.220> stop<00:01:13.729> with<00:01:13.970> no<00:01:14.299> nitrogen

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
to slow to a stop with no nitrogen

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.800 
to slow to a stop with no nitrogen
oxides<00:01:15.409> being<00:01:15.619> produced<00:01:15.950> but<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.810> ledge

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
oxides being produced but the ledge

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.649 
oxides being produced but the ledge
graphs<00:01:18.079> of<00:01:18.200> bubbling<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.970> found<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:20.570> this

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
graphs of bubbling and I found that this

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.780 
graphs of bubbling and I found that this
was<00:01:20.720> due<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.020> passivation<00:01:21.590> happening<00:01:22.130> because

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
was due to passivation happening because

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.580 
was due to passivation happening because
the<00:01:23.090> nitric<00:01:23.420> acid<00:01:23.689> became<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.079> concentrated

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
the nitric acid became so concentrated

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.050 
the nitric acid became so concentrated
that<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.890> bismuth<00:01:25.280> formed<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.640> protective

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
that the bismuth formed a protective

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.789 
that the bismuth formed a protective
oxide<00:01:26.180> layer<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.170> when<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.320> added<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.650> small

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
oxide layer so when I added a small

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.160 
oxide layer so when I added a small
amount<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.280> distilled<00:01:28.820> water<00:01:29.170> after

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
amount of distilled water after

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.990 
amount of distilled water after
decomposing<00:01:30.710> some<00:01:30.829> of<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:30.950> nitric<00:01:31.220> acid<00:01:31.579> the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
decomposing some of the nitric acid the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.330 
decomposing some of the nitric acid the
reaction<00:01:32.740> picked<00:01:33.740> up<00:01:33.860> again

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
reaction picked up again

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.630 
reaction picked up again
and<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:35.360> small<00:01:36.290> amount<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.560> bismuth<00:01:37.159> nitrate

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
and a small amount of bismuth nitrate

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.469 
and a small amount of bismuth nitrate
was<00:01:37.759> precipitated<00:01:38.180> in<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.930> solution<00:01:40.479> it

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
was precipitated in the solution it

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.870 
was precipitated in the solution it
dissolved<00:01:42.170> again<00:01:42.290> though<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.460> now<00:01:43.579> the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
dissolved again though so now the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.160 
dissolved again though so now the
reaction<00:01:44.390> looks<00:01:44.479> like<00:01:44.659> it's<00:01:44.810> coming<00:01:45.079> to<00:01:45.110> a

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
reaction looks like it's coming to a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.719 
reaction looks like it's coming to a
stop<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.969> bismuth<00:01:46.969> only<00:01:47.329> slightly<00:01:47.689> bubbling

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
stop the bismuth only slightly bubbling

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.310 
stop the bismuth only slightly bubbling
and<00:01:52.030> I'll<00:01:53.030> wait<00:01:53.360> for<00:01:53.509> that<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.750> finish<00:01:53.780> and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
and I'll wait for that to finish and

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.899 
and I'll wait for that to finish and
then<00:01:54.619> collect<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.159> bismuth<00:01:55.579> nitrate<00:01:56.000> I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
then collect the bismuth nitrate I

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.950 
then collect the bismuth nitrate I
transferred<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:58.969> reaction<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.570> a<00:01:59.600> smaller

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
beaker and as you can see it's virtually

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.850

come<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.380> stop<00:02:05.020> what<00:02:06.020> we<00:02:06.110> have<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.439> bismuth

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
come to a stop what we have is bismuth

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.310 
come to a stop what we have is bismuth

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
nitrate solution with a little bit of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.000 
nitrate solution with a little bit of
nitric<00:02:11.090> acid<00:02:11.390> left

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.410 

interesting<00:02:15.010> thing<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.310> note<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.820> in<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
interesting thing to note is in the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.550 
interesting thing to note is in the
beaker<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.810> did<00:02:16.990> have<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.200> in

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
beaker that I did have it in

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080 
beaker that I did have it in
I<00:02:17.590> poured<00:02:18.130> out<00:02:18.220> much<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.520> solution<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:18.970> then

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
I poured out much the solution and then

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.180 
I poured out much the solution and then
added<00:02:19.390> some<00:02:19.420> water<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.770> white<00:02:20.980> precipitate

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
added some water and a white precipitate

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.130 
added some water and a white precipitate
was<00:02:21.640> formed<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.630> believe<00:02:22.900> what<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
was formed and I believe what the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.410 
was formed and I believe what the
specific<00:02:23.590> tip<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.130> bismuth<00:02:24.700> sub<00:02:25.030> nitrate

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
specific tip is is bismuth sub nitrate

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.900 
specific tip is is bismuth sub nitrate
because<00:02:26.110> bismuth<00:02:26.800> nitrate<00:02:27.190> decomposes<00:02:27.790> in

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
because bismuth nitrate decomposes in

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.890 
because bismuth nitrate decomposes in
water<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.300> form<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.660> sub<00:02:28.900> nitrate<00:02:29.430> which<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.459> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
water to form the sub nitrate which is a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:38.730 
water to form the sub nitrate which is a
other<00:02:31.900> complex<00:02:32.410> ion<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.380> presence<00:02:38.680> of

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
other complex ion so in the presence of

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.070 
other complex ion so in the presence of
nitric<00:02:39.100> acid<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.490> stays<00:02:39.730> as<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.840> myth's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
soon as I'm ready to do that I'm gonna

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.860 
soon as I'm ready to do that I'm gonna
prepare<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.190> solution<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.790> rather<00:03:04.420> strong

sodium hydroxide and add to the beaker

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.760 
sodium hydroxide and add to the beaker
so<00:03:09.610> now<00:03:09.790> we<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.390> bismuth<00:03:11.350> nitrate

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
so now we have the bismuth nitrate

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.900 
so now we have the bismuth nitrate
solution<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.250> bismuth<00:03:12.489> has<00:03:12.640> been<00:03:12.790> done

solution<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.790> see<00:03:15.940> there's<00:03:16.150> a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
solution you can see there's a

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.020 
solution you can see there's a

precipitate of business of nitrate and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.190 
precipitate of business of nitrate and
probably<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.390> little<00:03:19.450> bit<00:03:19.570> Smith<00:03:19.810> oxide

probably a little bit Smith oxide

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.110 
probably a little bit Smith oxide
because<00:03:20.320> I<00:03:20.470> tried<00:03:21.130> adding<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.430> small<00:03:21.670> amount<00:03:21.880> of

because I tried adding a small amount of

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
the nitrate solution now I'm going to

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.490 
the nitrate solution now I'm going to

add it and hope for precipitate I did

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.220 
add it and hope for precipitate I did
read<00:03:29.890> that<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:31.420> reaction<00:03:31.660> might<00:03:31.930> need<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.080> bit

read that this reaction might need a bit

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
of heating to precipitate so that's why

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.030 
of heating to precipitate so that's why
it's<00:03:34.989> on<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.170> hot<00:03:35.290> plate<00:03:35.440> however<00:03:35.799> heating's

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.369 

immediately<00:03:44.299> we<00:03:44.480> see<00:03:44.629> a<00:03:44.659> dense<00:03:45.140> white

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
this was oxide is a yellow color so

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.380 
this was oxide is a yellow color so
heating<00:03:55.189> is<00:03:55.280> added<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:55.760> hopefully<00:03:56.269> with

yellow layer and a white layer so upon

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.509 
yellow layer and a white layer so upon
the<00:04:15.049> addition<00:04:15.230> of<00:04:15.500> some<00:04:15.709> anhydrous<00:04:16.310> sodium

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
the addition of some anhydrous sodium

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.640 
the addition of some anhydrous sodium
hydroxide<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.509> see<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.870> yellow

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
hydroxide you can see the yellow

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.979 
hydroxide you can see the yellow
precipitate<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.400> bismuth<00:04:19.729> oxide<00:04:20.120> formed<00:04:20.449> now

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
precipitate of bismuth oxide formed now

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.300 
precipitate of bismuth oxide formed now
there's<00:04:21.169> still<00:04:21.229> some<00:04:21.530> sub<00:04:21.769> nitrate<00:04:22.160> down

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
there's still some sub nitrate down

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.800 
there's still some sub nitrate down
there<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:22.610> I'm<00:04:22.669> gonna<00:04:22.759> be<00:04:22.910> adding<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.419> little

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
there so I'm gonna be adding a little

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.980 
there so I'm gonna be adding a little
more<00:04:25.270> anhydrous<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.750> sodium<00:04:27.020> hydroxide<00:04:28.960> yeah

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
more anhydrous to sodium hydroxide yeah

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.370 
more anhydrous to sodium hydroxide yeah
careful<00:04:31.030> oils<00:04:32.030> kind<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.300> unpredictably

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.800 

it's<00:04:36.800> always<00:04:37.280> safety<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.210> first<00:04:38.540> though

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
it's always safety is a first though

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.610 
it's always safety is a first though
gloves

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:50.860 
gloves
splash<00:04:40.520> mask<00:04:42.820> very<00:04:43.820> necessary<00:04:49.510> so<00:04:50.510> I'll<00:04:50.690> keep

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
splash mask very necessary so I'll keep

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.980 
splash mask very necessary so I'll keep
heating<00:04:51.230> gently<00:04:51.800> stirring<00:04:52.730> and<00:04:53.030> Adium<00:04:53.450> adding

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
heating gently stirring and Adium adding

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.170 
heating gently stirring and Adium adding
sodium<00:04:54.230> hydroxide<00:04:54.950> until<00:04:55.730> all<00:04:55.970> of<00:04:56.090> the

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
sodium hydroxide until all of the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.270 
sodium hydroxide until all of the
precipitate<00:04:56.720> has<00:04:56.930> turned<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.380> this<00:04:57.500> yellow

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
precipitate has turned to this yellow

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.710 
precipitate has turned to this yellow
bismuth<00:04:58.730> oxide<00:05:01.030> this<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.450> freshly

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
bismuth oxide this is the freshly

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.830 
bismuth oxide this is the freshly
precipitated<00:05:03.410> bismuth<00:05:03.740> oxide<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:05.390> next<00:05:05.660> step

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
precipitated bismuth oxide the next step

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.570 
precipitated bismuth oxide the next step
is<00:05:05.990> going<00:05:06.140> to<00:05:06.230> be<00:05:06.290> filtering<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.920> so<00:05:07.310> I'm<00:05:07.460> gonna

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
is going to be filtering it so I'm gonna

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.790 
is going to be filtering it so I'm gonna
run<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.850> through<00:05:08.030> my<00:05:08.560> gravity<00:05:09.560> filtration

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
run it through my gravity filtration

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.510 
run it through my gravity filtration
setup<00:05:10.310> here<00:05:10.520> using<00:05:10.760> two<00:05:10.910> coffee<00:05:11.120> filters<00:05:11.540> and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
setup here using two coffee filters and

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.240 
setup here using two coffee filters and
straigh<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.640> finished<00:05:13.850> product<00:05:14.980> so<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:16.010> went

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
straigh the finished product so I went

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.180 
straigh the finished product so I went
to<00:05:16.310> filter<00:05:16.670> my<00:05:16.960> this<00:05:17.960> methoxide<00:05:18.530> precipitate

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
to filter my this methoxide precipitate

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.630 
to filter my this methoxide precipitate
and<00:05:19.900> it<00:05:20.900> decanted<00:05:21.650> which<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.430> lot<00:05:22.610> easier

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
and it decanted which is a lot easier

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.990 
and it decanted which is a lot easier
for<00:05:23.000> me<00:05:23.060> so<00:05:23.380> here's<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.530> decanted<00:05:25.040> this<00:05:25.850> is

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
for me so here's the decanted this is

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.670 
for me so here's the decanted this is
oxide<00:05:26.390> i'm<00:05:26.600> just<00:05:26.870> gonna<00:05:26.990> be<00:05:27.080> washing<00:05:27.440> it<00:05:27.560> with

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
oxide i'm just gonna be washing it with

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.950 
oxide i'm just gonna be washing it with
water<00:05:27.940> wants<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.060> remove<00:05:29.270> any<00:05:29.450> soluble

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
water wants to remove any soluble

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.150 
water wants to remove any soluble
impurities<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.940> then<00:05:31.940> letting<00:05:32.450> it<00:05:32.540> dry<00:05:33.160> and

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
impurities and then letting it dry and

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.450 
impurities and then letting it dry and
here's<00:05:34.490> my<00:05:34.640> finished<00:05:34.790> products<00:05:36.280> looks<00:05:37.280> rather

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
here's my finished products looks rather

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:46.600 
here's my finished products looks rather
like<00:05:37.700> sulfur<00:05:41.980> yeah<00:05:42.980> this<00:05:43.850> with<00:05:44.060> oxide<00:05:45.610> thanks

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
like sulfur yeah this with oxide thanks

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.000 
like sulfur yeah this with oxide thanks
for<00:05:46.730> watching
