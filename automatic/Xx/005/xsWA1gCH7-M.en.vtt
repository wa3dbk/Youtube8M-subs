eight and ten minutes most of which are
on<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.800> DVD<00:00:24.830> you<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:25.859> see<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
on this DVD you can see here this is the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.189 
on this DVD you can see here this is the
very<00:00:26.880> beginning<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> lesson<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:27.990> I

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
very beginning of the lesson that I

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
very beginning of the lesson that I
actually<00:00:28.349> started<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.010> lesson<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.519> little

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
actually started the lesson a little

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
actually started the lesson a little
further<00:00:30.119> away<00:00:30.510> from<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.960> trailer<00:00:31.230> because

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
further away from the trailer because

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.319 
further away from the trailer because
she<00:00:32.040> wouldn't<00:00:32.340> really<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.730> close<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.090> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
she wouldn't really go close to it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:42.729 
she wouldn't really go close to it
heavily<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:35.010> taught<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.790> walk<00:00:36.270> forward

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.260 

as<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.250> she's<00:00:44.460> wearing<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.789> bridle

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
as you can see she's wearing a bridle

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.270 
as you can see she's wearing a bridle
which<00:00:45.600> gives<00:00:45.899> me<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> lot<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.260> control<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
which gives me a lot more control but I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.459 
which gives me a lot more control but I
do<00:00:47.340> teach<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> bridle<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.930> course<00:00:49.350> we

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
do teach this in the bridle of course we

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.279 
do teach this in the bridle of course we
never<00:00:49.649> travel<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.100> horse<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> bridle<00:00:51.289> she's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
never travel a horse with a bridle she's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
never travel a horse with a bridle she's
moving<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.680> hind<00:00:52.949> quarters<00:00:53.340> around<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.760> lot

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
moving a hind quarters around a lot

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.779 
moving a hind quarters around a lot
which<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.690> never<00:00:55.350> reprimanded<00:00:56.160> us<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.699> doing

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
which I never reprimanded us for doing

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
which I never reprimanded us for doing
anything<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.289> interested<00:00:58.440> in

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
outside the trailer it's a very easy way

00:02:09.869 --> 00:03:39.680 
outside the trailer it's a very easy way
to<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.830> an<00:02:10.920> accident

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.180 

the<00:03:40.690> horses<00:03:41.050> starting<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.470> settle<00:03:41.680> quite<00:03:41.980> well

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
the horses starting to settle quite well

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.900 
the horses starting to settle quite well
now<00:03:42.960> it's<00:03:43.960> owned<00:03:44.140> by<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.650> woman<00:03:44.830> who<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.640> quite

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
now it's owned by a woman who is quite

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.360 
now it's owned by a woman who is quite
often<00:03:46.120> on<00:03:46.360> her<00:03:46.510> own<00:03:46.750> when<00:03:47.110> she<00:03:47.320> needs<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.100> load

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
often on her own when she needs to load

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.130 
often on her own when she needs to load
the<00:03:48.550> horse<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:49.030> it's<00:03:49.150> very<00:03:49.270> important<00:03:49.840> that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
the horse so it's very important that

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.190 
the horse so it's very important that
the<00:03:50.260> horse<00:03:50.470> learns<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.700> load<00:03:52.420> up<00:03:52.690> nice<00:03:53.170> and

one<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.580> most<00:04:22.729> important<00:04:23.300> things<00:04:23.509> about

one of the most important things about
trailer<00:04:24.879> loading<00:04:25.879> is<00:04:26.000> teaching<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.810> walls<00:04:26.960> to

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110

best thing about this method of teaching

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.369 
best thing about this method of teaching
it<00:04:31.729> is<00:04:31.879> that<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.150> horse<00:04:32.389> learns<00:04:32.659> to<00:04:32.990> come<00:04:33.199> off

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:33.379
