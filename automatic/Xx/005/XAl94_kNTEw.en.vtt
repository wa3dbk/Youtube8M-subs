00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:13.040
 it was this nonsense of noah and much 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.040
 people understand what action today is already 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:34.079
 now because my mother is very happy and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:01:18.180
 now I can say a lot of community 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:01:36.259
 really is the absolute big one that I 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:36.259
 I think those who ask about the reason 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:54.720
 he has and does not have a reference and finishes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.159
 coming from work 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.159
 Of course it's a huge 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.990
 is this important difference to 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.060
 me because I think they might 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.000
 all right squares and it's over 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.790
 being more nike and almost as if it were 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.970
 a sausage factory grandson that today 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.760
 in the beginning and in the week 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:26.030
 40 sausages is but not necessarily 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 they know how to differentiate themselves from the streets is a 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.180
 forrÃ³ thing very good line and what 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.110
 I like is not this is to teach how with 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:41.599
 courage you feel you need snow 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.269
 while also teaching what happened 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:49.069
 here in my mother's training is that she 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:52.280
 learned the tool also learned 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:03:02.319
 even so this freedom is allowed 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:02.319
 also from her soon a different source 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:53.000
 which is something that I myself only dream for me 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:04.810
 does not have the patience to do what he does 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.810
 Everyone in Brazil 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.860
 and differential for me is very good has 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.190
 now more properly yet 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.510
 because you, my mother, was not who you are 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:24.010
 tell me about who is right silence is my 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.020
 family to my sister to prove me and it is eb 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.030
 What she liked the most is the last day. 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.600
 here I asked her the first day to 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.820
 lose markets both the player and liked 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.560
 and she liked it but not only my mother but 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.140
 also my best friend who is also 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:48.550
 hence my mother was very afraid 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:50.670
 older people policies and 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.500
 work on an album meeting people 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.860
 with her methodology and my 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.750
 curiosity to see if she really 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.700
 learn to play again here and to the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.570
 year will be very learn what is spoken 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:12.760
 I am not happy and recommend very close 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:16.060
 also from the river to the bridge but 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.940
 learn everything that I learn and will 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.900
 lose so 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.900
 same
