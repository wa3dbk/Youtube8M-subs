00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.100
 oval fantasy spot on two needles 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.590
 of all the fantasy points that is of 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.690
 the most used for many reasons 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.870
 first it is very very nice 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.080
 second is very easy to make the wool 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.880
 It yields a lot of work that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 you want to make any fabric 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.390
 luck jacket 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.680
 a little blanket is going to look very nice 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.050
 must always find or always mount 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.390
 odd numbers 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.960
 the sample in which I am going to teach you 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.390
 this oval fantasy dot is woven 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.019
 with 17 needle points 4.5 millimeters and the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 about half wool 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:12.079
 This sample comes out the wrong way 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.210
 for the right as you can 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:19.640
 view is very nice but it is not the same no 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.800
 it looks the same 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.650
 the first two races after 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:28.250
 having assembled the 17 points were made 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.260
 in a right point right by the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.659
 right and right on the reverse in the 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.660
 third race we are going to do the design 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.520
 of the stitch this just stitch consists of 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.550
 of four races that are first two 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.070
 races at a right point by the 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.210
 right and at a right point by the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.270
 setback the third race is already the design 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.690
 of the stitch that I'm going to show you now and 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.890
 the fourth race is in again a 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.500
 right point the whole line 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.270
 step by step let's see how it is done 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.270
 this oval fantasy 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.880
 we do first after two 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.610
 races look here are the two 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.670
 racing in right point let's do 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.599
 a right 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.599
 a reverse 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.420
 this is to start the race and from 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.420
 here what I'm going to do now is what 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.340
 that we are going to repeat throughout 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.900
 the race 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.010
 a lasso two stitches together at one point 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.450
 reverse 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.220
 that's all 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:48.170
 a lasso two stitches together at one point 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:51.830
 reverse a lasso two stitches together in a 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.370
 stitch back a loop from left to 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.770
 right two points together at a point 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.630
 back a loop 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:06.440
 two points together in a backhand point a 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.870
 Loop the whole race repeats 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.290
 exactly like thrown 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.300
 and we finish with the two points together 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.910
 in a backhand point to her 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.560
 we finished the stitch and the last stitch 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.140
 it's done in a good right 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.739
 the next race as I told you 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.920
