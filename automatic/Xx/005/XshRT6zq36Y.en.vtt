00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.309
 so this year that war celebrate speed 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.179
 because in fact motor racing is flowing through our veins 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:24.240
 for 150 years in 1916 at 16h charles-auguste pailhÃ¨res inventory 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.869
 finally the first at the first time bad luck the first storyteller will appreciate 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.329
 hundredths of a second hand he was actually doing in alice with three seconds to 1 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.990
 to do a dial turn ok 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.330
 here 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.890
 then again operational this year we launched one at a time when the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.650
 launched two mics rafah if m 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.240
 tressy to the hundredth of a second and in the form of a wrist watch 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.280
 so the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.659
 it's the turn to per second reminded the power plants 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.969
 who in time star wars he abdicated the hundredth of a second and 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.640
 mechanically 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.990
 this is what areva announced then this year 1 that thousandths of 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.360
 second but which team 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.940
 in fact this is the first time that beds mans table that we get to 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.900
 measure the level 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.780
 thousandths of second hand mechanically ie 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.380
 here by electronically I made the herald of innovation a try in 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.370
 our relationship to work by hand and therefore to surrender every year to go 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.270
 represent something 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.490
 out of the box as we say, something that goes beyond 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.380
 calls into question the main features of watchmaking stowage 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.370
 in there you have a purchase by the exhaust that does not beat third 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.530
 signed purpose 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.960
 of vibrations per hour while another normal and low 28 activists 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.840
 So acting is a real technical feat so far. 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.880
 watchmaking a market very well arrive at 6804 alternation besides I 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.470
 do not necessarily say that it is useful to be able to calculate the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.990
 thousandth of a second because anyway the inaccuracy of the human finger 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.010
 these clubs here but excellent for the beauty of the gesture and for the beauty in 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.180
 the sprycel for the idea that mechanically in the state we are able 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.400
 to measure 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.369
 this very small part of time 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.019
 here is this article
