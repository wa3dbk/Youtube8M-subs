00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
feature we had a little more time with

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.690 
feature we had a little more time with
the<00:00:50.590> pastry<00:00:50.920> because<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.190> came<00:00:51.340> out<00:00:51.460> later

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
this year we have gang tackle across the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.590 
this year we have gang tackle across the
board<00:00:53.649> on<00:00:54.040> both<00:00:54.280> platforms<00:00:54.520> and<00:00:55.000> we<00:00:55.060> also<00:00:55.210> have

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
board on both platforms and we also have

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.970

done<00:00:56.020> a<00:00:56.050> lot<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.230> work<00:00:56.440> with<00:00:56.530> our<00:00:56.649> branch<00:00:56.860> of

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
done a lot of work with our branch of

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.010 
done a lot of work with our branch of
technology<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.880> this<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.210> what<00:00:58.360> allows<00:00:58.600> us<00:00:58.870> to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
technology and this is what allows us to

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.750 
technology and this is what allows us to
really<00:00:59.050> get<00:00:59.380> that<00:00:59.530> responsiveness<00:01:00.100> back<00:01:00.399> and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
really get that responsiveness back and

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.280 
really get that responsiveness back and

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.289 
experiences ever first couple years on
next-gen<00:01:06.009> we're<00:01:06.250> building<00:01:06.700> we<00:01:07.030> had<00:01:07.180> the

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
next-gen we're building we had the

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.300 
next-gen we're building we had the
beautiful<00:01:07.420> animation<00:01:08.079> system<00:01:08.290> games<00:01:09.100> look

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
beautiful animation system games look

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.380 
beautiful animation system games look
great<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.030> didn't<00:01:10.210> have<00:01:10.299> the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
great but you didn't have the

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.360 
great but you didn't have the
responsiveness<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.110> man<00:01:11.259> fans<00:01:11.500> are<00:01:11.860> used<00:01:12.220> to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
responsiveness the man fans are used to

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.130 
responsiveness the man fans are used to
so<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:12.820> got<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.120> feedback<00:01:13.510> at<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.780> same<00:01:13.960> time

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
so we got that feedback at the same time

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.690 
so we got that feedback at the same time
we're<00:01:14.620> working<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:15.370> now<00:01:15.400> with<00:01:15.610> our

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
we're working on it so now with our

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.340 
we're working on it so now with our
branch<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:16.060> animation<00:01:16.479> technology<00:01:16.750> we're

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
branch and animation technology we're

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.930 
branch and animation technology we're
actually<00:01:17.409> able<00:01:17.650> to<00:01:17.860> blend<00:01:18.040> out<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.460> any<00:01:18.700> kind

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
actually able to blend out of any kind

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.789 
actually able to blend out of any kind
of<00:01:19.030> animation<00:01:19.360> at<00:01:19.600> any<00:01:19.720> time<00:01:19.990> really<00:01:20.500> give<00:01:20.710> the

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
of animation at any time really give the

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.910 
of animation at any time really give the
user<00:01:20.950> full<00:01:21.220> twist<00:01:21.490> control

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.469 

one<00:01:25.549> of<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.670> biggest<00:01:25.850> things<00:01:26.090> we<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.330> this

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
one of the biggest things we have this

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.149 
one of the biggest things we have this
year<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.780> called<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.200> ring<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.470> champion<00:01:27.890> and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
year is called a ring of a champion and

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.679 
year is called a ring of a champion and
it's<00:01:28.460> built<00:01:28.610> around<00:01:28.700> our<00:01:28.939> gamer<00:01:29.150> level<00:01:29.450> system

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
it's built around our gamer level system

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.510 
it's built around our gamer level system
but<00:01:29.780> we<00:01:29.810> had<00:01:30.020> last<00:01:30.200> year<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:30.950> basically<00:01:31.280> what

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
but we had last year but basically what
