 Fernanda CaÃ±as presenting here at the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.530
 chosen because he has the desire to get 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.620
 to the fifth vergara like this one fernando 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.440
 very well it's not easy sometimes to show up 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.440
 in a scenario and at times it is not easy and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.390
 he is cleaning me with his disorder 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.000
 compulsive with his touch don Ã­talo 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.400
 passalacqua fernanda the first thing you would have 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 that change the tone of voice that voice very 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.480
 squeaky in the fifth vergara does the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.910
 effect that he did today in the public of 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.280
 the other thing is that your thing is 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.590
 raised with a standard in which 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.110
 the character needs to be better 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.480
 developed you were always standing on 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.850
 the same place you did not change the ringtones 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.130
 voice not intention then do that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.950
 it appears absolutely fome 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 to say real merino francisca was 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.900
 what happened to you because I think that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.630
 a comic or a humorist what you have to 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.459
 be 90% that people laugh that the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.740
 people with you did not laugh marcela 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.530
 Varezzaza teaches us what we are going to do 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.300

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.890
 it was not a good night it was not a good 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.170
 night were not good minutes 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.730
 Let's go with don pedro's rubin okotie sachs 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.730
 has a different opinion 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.450
 maybe 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.360
 perhaps 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.360
 I loved 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.160
 I do not think that good 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.930
 It can be overcome in part to the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.050
 clues it 's very difficult to do a routine 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.560
 when they are screaming out way and everything 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.620
 that's super complicated but I think that 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.360
 Of course it was not the correct routine 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.350
 for this scenario and less for the 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.420
 fifth vergara 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.400

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.730
 we face the public that tonight 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.070
 it was a little hard with you the jury in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.070
 the chosen one votes like this 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.479
 only a green light the one of pedro 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.459
 ruminot aita fernanda the cameras of the 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.620
 pack stage to express your 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.479
 feelings that have prevented you from following 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.880
 dreaming about this version with the fifth 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:31.080
 vergara 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:32.700

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.220
 passed through Fernanda's head when 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.860

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.670
 They made me sick to do me well
