ahead of everybody with reading then I

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.319 
ahead of everybody with reading then I

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
can read a harder book and the teacher

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
can read a harder book and the teacher
lets<00:01:42.509> me<00:01:42.630> make<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.930> choice<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.409> myself<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
lets me make that choice for myself and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
lets me make that choice for myself and
with<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.240> teacher<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.869> stresses<00:01:46.439> this

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
with it my teacher really stresses this

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.719 
with it my teacher really stresses this
comes<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.380> responsibility<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.729> I

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
comes a lot of responsibility and I

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
comes a lot of responsibility and I
think<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:51.990> helps<00:01:52.439> out

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
think that that to really helps out

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649 
think that that to really helps out
because<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.030> come<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> real<00:01:54.570> world

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
because when you come to the real world

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.100 
because when you come to the real world
there<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.070> much<00:01:56.610> responsibility<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.719> have

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
there is so much responsibility I have

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.560 
there is so much responsibility I have
to<00:01:58.350> say<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> haven't<00:01:59.070> been<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> real<00:02:00.180> world

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
to say I haven't been in the real world

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.810 
to say I haven't been in the real world
on<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.020> own<00:02:01.049> yet<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> don't<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.340> much

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
on my own yet so I don't know how much

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850 
on my own yet so I don't know how much
responsibility<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.530> I've<00:02:04.649> heard

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
responsibility there is but I've heard

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.740 
responsibility there is but I've heard
that<00:02:05.009> there's<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.750> responsibilities

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that there's a lot of responsibilities

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.680 
that there's a lot of responsibilities
as<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.099> around<00:02:08.190> myself<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.569> it's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
as I look around myself I see that it's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.470 
as I look around myself I see that it's
just<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.110> big<00:02:10.379> experience<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.430> since<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.330> got

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
just a big experience and since we got

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.320 
just a big experience and since we got
like<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.930> arc

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
like this arc

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.810 
like this arc
back<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.660> design<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.140> place<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.770> since<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
back to design this place and since the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.300 
back to design this place and since the
areas<00:02:16.210> are<00:02:16.360> really<00:02:16.600> open<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.470> since<00:02:18.190> it

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
areas are really open and since it

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.900 
areas are really open and since it
really<00:02:18.520> entices<00:02:19.380> teachers<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.530> work<00:02:20.560> together

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
really entices teachers to work together

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.050 
really entices teachers to work together
it<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.180> really<00:02:22.480> makes<00:02:22.780> me<00:02:22.960> feel<00:02:23.020> comfortable

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it just really makes me feel comfortable

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.440 
it just really makes me feel comfortable
we<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.300> many<00:02:25.420> different<00:02:25.920> doors<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.220> open

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
we have so many different doors to open

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.450 
we have so many different doors to open
that<00:02:28.450> once<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.380> set<00:02:29.560> inside<00:02:29.800> those<00:02:30.040> doors<00:02:30.070> we

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
that once we set inside those doors we

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.790 
that once we set inside those doors we
just<00:02:30.670> can't<00:02:31.240> get<00:02:31.390> enough<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.840> because<00:02:32.620> it's

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
just can't get enough of it because it's

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.040 
just can't get enough of it because it's
so<00:02:32.890> awesome
