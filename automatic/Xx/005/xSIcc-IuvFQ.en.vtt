00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:05.160
 well now we are in a tie and the net in infinity 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.140
 i will see here 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.369
 in the map 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.890
 the map 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.130
 the second are down to the tour of that cospedal helicopters 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.589
 carvajal 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.759
 and we can appreciate that this is where people are born or the laws are 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.960
 the programming creates them 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.450
 and the people here come out and salem eisaleh nice and they come out 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.330
 we are in line 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.350
 or what appears to be the row 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.920
 with all the people who have left 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.750
 while I am here 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.980
 and we have killed them with an ordinary gun 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.910
 and how can they give 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 every person who killed to leave their money 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 I'm going to the garbage containers 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 and I come back 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.150
 and all the money he had earned 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.570
 come back 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.650
 only that the police do not stop bothering you 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.650
 so 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.050
 PeÃ±a be attentive with the police 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.820
 because if they kill you 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.700
 there is a low probability that this happens again then they will go back to 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 try again to try to make it come back then 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.710
 pretend not to kill them 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 tandil each person who leaves 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.530
 basis 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.170
 dell was to kill her because if they put together more and more and more and more money 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.090
 we do not turn around 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.010
 we came back 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.020
 and the full eyes appear 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.460
 the eyes are like 5 6 dollars 0 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 me when they put all together for example here 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.690
 it says we're 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.469
 it already assumes like that it must be good money 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.829
 as his 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.829
 then we see that this myth or reality 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.629
 good thank you 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.199
 until next time
