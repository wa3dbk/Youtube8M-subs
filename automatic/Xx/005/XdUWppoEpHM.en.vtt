00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.420
 we can 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.070
 we can practically make the game is 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.470
 bound to this kind of career 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.470
 according to me going up again starting games 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:28.320
 we are always branded in the box one 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.840
 very high difficulty removed all 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.759
 driving aids except our field 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.500
 best result to look at was a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.920
 ninth place the biggest game e 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.920
 if I want to see if I obviously pay 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.920
 with aid you arrive earlier 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.079
 I last air even with the aid but 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:59.800
 for god's sake and cunning 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.800
 15 of whom not 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.070
 in memory 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.540
 perhaps 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.540
 or maybe you 're already looking online 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 which users do not understand self 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:22.670
 driving force I thought the cast was not not 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.520
 I know if you like it the same as we are 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:31.009
 we do a great job when we do it 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.159
 see this race and the curve is fine 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:44.259
 very promised since the former nascar pilot 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:44.259
 coe retired on place the real sale 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.079
 one must remember that it is a v8 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.380
 dates 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.430
 I like it already born thanks a lot 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.430
 perfect for the sun 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:13.360
 and xbox one we always remember that it is 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.360
 happened to see them there before we have the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.460
 century AD always the first round then 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:32.650
 at the end we are the next one not 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.650
 this a beautiful curved now made egg whites 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.990
 and good 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.210
 this asshole 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.220
 ok come on you only have to take the car 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.620
 java madama and do another round without 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.030
 wait exactly nena 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.260
 impossible but weight is not possible 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.060
 weight 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.310
 let's see how it proceeds here is 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.220
 hard derby you're using a big one 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.280
 concentration and here it says remember 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.209
 also of the man plan 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.980
 sometimes it's convenient 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:13.370
 look at that a spectacular curve 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.900
 spain recovers seconds compared to 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.480
 his opponent but a car 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.930
 according to me faster than your throw 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.180
 there and throws it in my opinion can more a 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:29.200
 I hit the bump and the one that definitely is n't 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.299
 but from all the perfect curves though 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.230
 however fireside pitt is passed by 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:39.099
 pinto lindal who makes no mistake lese majesty 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.099
 found fig overtaking 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:51.950
 child has decided to park 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:53.740
 spinger is ruined for life you said no 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.660
 and life in the area 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.620
 to the boys that is not good 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.170
 I feel attentive to moral victory and 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.950
 just started the second round but I think 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:15.280
 that now here a curve a shit 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.280
 that of space is not careful 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:28.090
 yellow car head tail is a head a 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:31.900
 head you are playing it two little ones 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.900
 to this difficulty 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:42.320
 we are facing fireside pitt 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.320
 in a head to head a good banner 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.320
 sportellate 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:55.400
 and there is the incredible pinball overtaking 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.400
 load a thousand 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.410

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.590

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.340
 however it is driving well 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.880

 I don't know but not conditioned either 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.980
 given a bit of shit you now make the curve 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.980
 guys in my opinion 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.450
 Yup 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.450
