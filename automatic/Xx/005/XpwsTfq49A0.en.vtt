his way through it treat something you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.029 
his way through it treat something you
know<00:00:19.430> but<00:00:21.800> it<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.699> swollen<00:00:25.039> next

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
know but it was you know swollen next

sequence<00:00:26.400> without<00:00:27.119> their<00:00:27.539> braids<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> play

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
sequence without their braids the play

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.749 
sequence without their braids the play
but<00:00:29.630> yeah<00:00:30.630> he'd<00:00:31.160> probably<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> middle<00:00:32.640> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
well you know we we obviously didn't

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
understood he knew it's a shooter but we

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.020

so we said that we have the stuff done

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.219 
so we said that we have the stuff done
recovery<00:01:23.310> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.700> situation<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.049> have

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
recovery kind of situation then you have

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.219 
recovery kind of situation then you have
to<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.159> rotate<00:01:26.640> tool<00:01:27.229> we

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to have to have a one rotate tool we

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.410 
to have to have a one rotate tool we
still<00:01:28.470> look<00:01:28.590> good<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> don't<00:01:30.210> know

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
still look good at that so I don't know

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.050 
still look good at that so I don't know
if<00:01:30.930> two<00:01:31.200> games<00:01:31.439> makes<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.920> trend<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.520> any

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
if two games makes a trend but any

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
if two games makes a trend but any
concern<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.869> second<00:01:34.200> half's<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> are

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
concern over these second half's and are

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.200 
concern over these second half's and are
there<00:01:34.950> any<00:01:34.979> similarities<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.030> caused

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
there any similarities and what caused

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.590 
there any similarities and what caused
them<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.790> know<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.240> think

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
them do you think so you know I think

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120 
them do you think so you know I think
that<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:40.860> doing
