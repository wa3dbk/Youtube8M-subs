 has as you can see three months of a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.319
 premium membership of explic to be able 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.909

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:22.909
 we do not want to hurt anything here here with 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:24.290
 careful they should already sell things to 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.420
 open this because the truth all the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.650
 world makes it constructive I've seen the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.709
 that style was under construction 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.099
 bouquet to fear because we get rid of 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.049
 this plastic plastic focus and here is 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.120
 a little stamp that we are going to do with 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:44.689

 that since we already remove it and we will see 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.930
 I think it's to create how it's done 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.520
 here's another one to fuck I do not see it 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.890

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.269
 being there was how nice and good 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.769
 Little girl I told you appears as a 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:41.439
 solar here we do not make the mind the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:45.400
 technology of the tomb and aircraft almost 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:47.700
 like a cell phone do not fuck ok we're going to 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.700
 open it 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.170
 ibermedia live now as you can see 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.090
 here is the capture button 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.440
 just when you want to record a 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.210
 video click here and start recording 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.270
 here as we can also see what they are 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.370
 this the cables here for example we have 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.850
 what gm components I put them 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.130
 here input hdmi components and 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.490
 output and also what are the 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.250
 auxiliary audio in and audio arles 3.5 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.459
 millimeters here is the usb cable for 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.830
 the computer here is the sd entry 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.800
 so you can record them gameplays inc 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.720
 how is it called without a computer that is 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.990
 this is going to be useful for you to be this 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.510
 the tournaments and all that and here is what it puts 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.200
 in capture mode with computer or 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.440
 they just move it like that and already with that 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.780
 of ok let's proceed now 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.340
 Of course it's the cables and those that 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.650
 they come here 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.920
 Czech on the net I think I took this away 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.740
 here and there you are seeing the membership of 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.680
 ex split 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.430
 for three months webber let's see if 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.930
 says something you are a process 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.490
 well here is I will not show you 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.530
 obviously the code comes with the 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.740
 instructions and all and here is 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.949
 explained and gamer media together ok now 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.539
 we are going to remove this from here 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.030
 let me do it all with 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:19.280
 calm 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.280
 I think I think that here 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.000
 do not do not want do not want to see we're going to 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.600
 try 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.600
 that's what I think Ivan 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.310
 let's use our tool 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.510
 destruction that will now be for 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.420
 open this 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:51.040
 very good very well 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:54.330
 I already have what I have here is what they are 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.330
 the cables and all that 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.190
 what is this 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.530
 look at a cover so you can leave 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.840
 this save the capturer is very 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.520
 well, as you can see, this is also the 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.919
 advantage of reporting them away from 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.669
 quality that you have not mentioned that 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:14.539
 record at 1080p at 60 frames per second and 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.889
 to 60 mb as you see this the advantage of being 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.759
 portable that you can take it well 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:23.030
 as if nothing also parents or here 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.340
 we have the cables here is the hdmi and 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.729
 bonifatti with the broken ones to be what 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.280
 distinctive of what is this about the changing 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.259
 on the sides you can not miss you want to 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.580
 something for each studied something of 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:40.000
 space here is fine this cable seems 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.000
 be 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:49.330
 this cable or if not more is very nice 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.159
 it comes to you already all-inclusive is no longer 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.180
 you have to buy anything maybe the cable 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:57.540
 usb as you can see here the cable 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.310
 the components 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.160
 to capture with components in 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.250
 playstation3 and probably play 4 and 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.370
 here are the audio cables because 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.140
 there is gang as you see here is the 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.590
 capturing and everything that brings you 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:17.040
 thank you very much this I can not believe it 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.900
 I'm stunned they already wanted to fret 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.060
 getting there I want to do it always 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.580
 I want to make it the first video no longer 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.410
 can wait so good gang not 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.210
 forget to like me a little while 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.420
 I will also do what is this the 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.610
 software review and quality 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.750
 we see another time take care a lot and 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.540
 here in the description I'm going to leave you 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.220
 the links of the boys of ibermedia the 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.960
 roquillos from ibermedia mexico so that 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.000
 can follow them and they can also 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.430
 get the ibermedia capturer and 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.160
 check organic ok a hug to all 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.580
