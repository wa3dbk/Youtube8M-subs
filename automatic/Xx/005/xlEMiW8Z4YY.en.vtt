00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.220
 Oh 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.970
 well hi to all and all these maxi 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.990
 game I hope everyone is fine 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.270
 it's going very well 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.130
 today we find ourselves for one goes 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.280
 to say the little gameplay it's not 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.420
 really a gameplay because I do not have 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.530
 ended a match it was just for you 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.320
 show a little gameplay of the game 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.500
 history to make you happy so 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.980
 it's nba 2k very long it's out 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.840
 more than a year ago so more specifically 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.890
 October 16, 2012 so it really dates 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.560
 so I make you the little gameplay for 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.650
 to please you and so before 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.239
 start a match you have to create a 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.640
 player I do not know if we are obliged 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.630
 to do it even but in any case you 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.280
 must create a player to be able to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.470
 the experienced afterwards and to make 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.320
 a career with him then you go 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.100
 see that in this game there are three 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.100
 potential 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.069
 that is to say to make a career with his 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.250
 player or then become a manager if I 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.600
 not deceive so you'll see that in 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.190
 this gameplay I'm just going 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.770
 make a quick match 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.140
 story of bringing you in 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.179
 player movements 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.720
 how does it unfold in a match of 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.869
 basketball 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.640
 so to tell you I have not finished 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.910
 completed the pardon game simply 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.679
 because I am very bad so do not 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.330
 do not want for those who are fans of 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.130
 basket even I like the games of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.350
 basketball but it's been a long time since 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.509
 I played basketball it's roy it 's 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.700
 do since playstation 2 I played 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.990
 a basketball game so to tell you I 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.210
 am very bad 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.740
 on these games but it's not for 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.110
 as much as I hate this game well 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.840
 really heard the gameplay and the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.860
 graphics are really not bad at all 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.649
 for a basketball game 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 we have really evolved since everything 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.580
 time there and I think it will evolve 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.900
 still after that so here it goes 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.390
 as you can see the screen we can 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.640
 has the choice so with my player so 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.310
 you simply control your 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.590
 player make a career and be doing 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.500
 a friendly match so a quick match where 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.080
 the teams are already selected 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.670
 so that's to train you before 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.720
 I really advise you to do two 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.640
 three matches before you start 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.519
 a career 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.810
 I think it's more preferable to 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.230
 to train before embarking on a 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.730
 career 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.530
 so at first I had done a little 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.940
 bullshit is that I had started the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.630
 part but I had been selected 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.100
 no team 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.500
 so I had to go to the options 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.670
 to be able to control the players because 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.560
 that if I introduce you no gameplay 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.799
 are controlled players ca has no 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.970
 interest in showing yourself the gameplay and you 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.130
 go see you for a moment I 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.440
 tried to change the game settings 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.570
 that is to say, to lower the level of play 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.579
 players because it was way too much 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.140
 hard even by lowering the I'd 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.980
 really not that to tell you to the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.480
 difficulty of the game 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.269
 at the same time I did not play much 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.750
 so I could not train a lot 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.450
 so I can not help you on this 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.910
 play there so for this game for the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.109
 configuration 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.690
 you must have a configuration 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.600
 really simple basic ie 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.460
 windows xp vista or 7 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.100
 the kart 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:41.920
 graph it can be a ati radeon hd 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.370
 am amply have minimum 5 112 and mo 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.430
 of ram 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.010
 so if you have a windows xp equipped 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.630
 of these trains from there you can play it 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.350
 after I do not know if the game on a 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.830
 fluid 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.570
 I can not tell you that this is the 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.640
 minimum configuration for the 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.860
 configuration advise low it takes 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.120
 obviously giga of ram 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.390
 if you want to have a fluidity 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.670
 perfect to avoid lag the elbows 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.640
 frankly really invites you to have 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.300
 a really high graphics card 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.690
 performances and having two gigas of 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.700
 ram 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.120
 then to play this game you can 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.940
 play with a joystick like that I'm 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.410
 currently playing it is 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.820
 really much easier for me 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.270
 because I'm not used to playing on 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.580
 pc and so that's it so I'll get you 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.230
 leave on this little gameplay it's 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.780
 really even ten minutes 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.550
 no choice so as you search 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.420
 stats speak and options because that's 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.160
 really much too hard and so that's it 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.810
 I hope you had a good 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.770
 little moment but it's true that it's 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.150
 not the longest video the longer the 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.290
 more boring let's say in quotation marks 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.650
 but it was just for you 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.670
 show this little game so there as see 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.770
 the only example is that it's a 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.750
 team to be able to control what 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.030
 is much better for you to do 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.060
 show the gameplay the displacements of 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.450
 players to see that I'm really bad 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.529
 and so here we are 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.529
 a new gameplay 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.899
 in a very short time I hope these 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.579
 little videos you liked do not hesitate 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.359
 to put a green thumb if you liked 

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:23.549
 to comment just below the video 

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:25.109
