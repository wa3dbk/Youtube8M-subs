come on the mono key system

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.680 
come on the mono key system
I<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:26.070> them<00:02:26.190> undone<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:26.910> point<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.330> if

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
I have them undone at this point and if

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
you can come in here really tightly I'm

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.290 
you can come in here really tightly I'm
going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> pull<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.520> Schubert<00:02:29.880> actually<00:02:30.240> I'm

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
going to pull this Schubert actually I'm

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.430 
going to pull this Schubert actually I'm
just<00:02:30.330> going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> tilt<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.960> forward<00:02:30.990> here<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
just going to tilt it forward here a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.440 
just going to tilt it forward here a
little<00:02:31.590> bit<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.000> connection

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
little bit you can see the connection

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.150 
little bit you can see the connection
for<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.660> brake<00:02:33.870> lights<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.680> pre<00:02:34.890> drilled

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
for the brake lights so it's pre drilled

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.680 
for the brake lights so it's pre drilled
in<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> bottom<00:02:35.340> you'd<00:02:35.760> run<00:02:35.940> electricity<00:02:36.390> to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
in the bottom you'd run electricity to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.150 
in the bottom you'd run electricity to
the<00:02:36.750> mounting<00:02:37.110> plate<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.440> then<00:02:37.860> would<00:02:37.980> come

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the mounting plate and then would come

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.320 
the mounting plate and then would come
up<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.400> there's<00:02:38.610> actually<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.090> really

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
up and there's actually it's really

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.720 
up and there's actually it's really
slick<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> way<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.020> done<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.890> also<00:02:41.310> see

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
slick the way it's done you can also see

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
slick the way it's done you can also see
on<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.880> mono<00:02:42.120> piece<00:02:42.330> system<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:43.080> uses<00:02:43.440> the

on the mono piece system that uses the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.350 
on the mono piece system that uses the
GV<00:02:43.890> double<00:02:44.220> wall<00:02:44.400> construction<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> nice

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
big gasket that's going to be not only

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800 
big gasket that's going to be not only
waterproof<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.000> windproof<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.570> also<00:02:48.690> going

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
waterproof and windproof it's also going

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.570 
waterproof and windproof it's also going
to<00:02:48.870> be<00:02:49.020> dust<00:02:49.260> proof<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:49.980> you're<00:02:50.100> riding<00:02:50.340> a

lot<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.210> got<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.390> remember<00:02:51.540> there's<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> high

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
lot you got to remember there's a high

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
lot you got to remember there's a high
