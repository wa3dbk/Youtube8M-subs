00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
reversed Sagan was the one who was very

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
reversed Sagan was the one who was very
timid<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:55.020> shy<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.650> Kepler<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.310> the<00:00:56.430> one

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
timid very shy and Kepler was the one

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.820 
timid very shy and Kepler was the one
who<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.730> crazy<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.420> their<00:00:58.410> roles<00:00:58.650> are

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
who was crazy and their roles are

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.740 
who was crazy and their roles are
completely<00:00:59.430> different<00:00:59.610> in<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.360> last<00:01:00.510> few

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
completely different in the last few

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.350 
completely different in the last few
days<00:01:00.930> Sagan's<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.250> crazy<00:01:02.580> one<00:01:02.880> Kepler's

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
days Sagan's the the crazy one Kepler's

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.179 
days Sagan's the the crazy one Kepler's
just<00:01:03.630> this<00:01:03.750> timid<00:01:04.110> little<00:01:04.350> kitten<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
just this timid little kitten and I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.380 
just this timid little kitten and I
think<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> might<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.820> something<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.360> with

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
think it might have something to do with

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.510 
think it might have something to do with
the<00:01:06.630> fact<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> maybe<00:01:07.860> he's<00:01:08.130> been<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> little

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the fact that maybe he's been a little

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.120 
the fact that maybe he's been a little
sick<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:10.260> don't<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.740> how<00:01:10.890> they're<00:01:11.070> gonna

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
