pretty<00:04:44.780> cool<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.750> so<00:04:49.300> sticky<00:04:50.300> as<00:04:50.570> we<00:04:50.810> see<00:04:51.050> the

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
pretty cool but so sticky as we see the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.410 
pretty cool but so sticky as we see the
levels<00:04:51.560> are<00:04:51.710> pretty<00:04:51.740> well<00:04:52.130> designed<00:04:52.910> like

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
levels are pretty well designed like

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:00.100 
levels are pretty well designed like
there's<00:04:53.810> no<00:04:57.130> glitching<00:04:58.130> really<00:04:58.870> there's<00:04:59.870> not

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110

too<00:05:00.320> much<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:03.200> textures<00:05:03.620> ever<00:05:03.800> just

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
too much of the textures ever just

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.410 
too much of the textures ever just
really<00:05:04.340> well<00:05:04.460> done<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:07.790> frames<00:05:08.120> per

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
really well done and the frames per

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.540 
really well done and the frames per
second<00:05:08.840> though<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.350> think<00:05:10.070> it's<00:05:10.250> right<00:05:10.430> here

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
second though I think it's right here

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.840 
second though I think it's right here
like<00:05:10.790> 60<00:05:11.590> that's<00:05:12.590> really<00:05:13.010> good<00:05:13.280> because<00:05:13.340> look

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
like 60 that's really good because look

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.270 
like 60 that's really good because look
how<00:05:13.880> smooth<00:05:14.360> that<00:05:14.390> is

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.080 

oh<00:05:20.110> yeah<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.790> there<00:05:22.790> is<00:05:23.090> climate<00:05:23.780> of<00:05:24.110> items

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
oh yeah I there is climate of items

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.360 
oh yeah I there is climate of items
which<00:05:26.090> range<00:05:26.360> from<00:05:26.450> like<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.720> tap<00:05:30.370> upside

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
which range from like the tap upside

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.100 
which range from like the tap upside
down<00:05:31.490> fish<00:05:31.760> mark<00:05:32.120> block<00:05:32.389> which<00:05:32.889> it<00:05:33.889> just<00:05:35.110> stops

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
down fish mark block which it just stops

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.080 
down fish mark block which it just stops
you<00:05:36.290> from<00:05:36.320> saying<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.919> there's<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.190> lightning
