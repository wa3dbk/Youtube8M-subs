00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that it will take a longer time but I'm

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270 
that it will take a longer time but I'm
not<00:01:33.049> quite<00:01:34.049> sure<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.530> make<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.100> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
not quite sure if you make more out of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.999 
not quite sure if you make more out of
that<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.790> mean<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.170> faster<00:01:37.560> than<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that I mean like if it's faster than the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.990 
that I mean like if it's faster than the
rush<00:01:38.159> flex<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> think<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.470> yeah<00:01:41.189> so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
rush flex but I think it is and yeah so

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.219 
rush flex but I think it is and yeah so
