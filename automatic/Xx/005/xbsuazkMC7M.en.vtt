00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello friends with you tq today we 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.570
 talk again about great tanks 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 t-62 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.240
 playing the game and starting to understand how 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.730
 I still like her gradually 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.160
 learn new tactics stupidly 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 trust in the enemies you start over 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.170
 detail merge behind enemies for their 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 recharge for their every move because 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 the right choice can sometimes play 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.860
 key role in fighting for a few 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 I liked dozens of fights so much 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 62 how to sell it I just donâ€™t want to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.409
 it is perfect for all my 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.229
 needs 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:52.170
 she can go ahead can shoot 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.330
 when you need to even be able to tank and for 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 all my fights I realized that really 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.449
 the coolest gameplay is just on 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.970
 lunch and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.030
 This tanks wagons that can and 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.940
 push and defense to keep that not small 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.100
 it is important in our game and the most important thing is that 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.890
 dragging them is the easiest thing to do 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.649
 compared to other classes but it 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.710
 doesn't mean it's the easiest class 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.170
 technicians on the contrary he is the hardest of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.450
 you all have a big 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.560
 responsibility namely destroy 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 enemy u bp 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.180
 besides, do not forget to friends that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.030
 in the open area there is a cross 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.690
 artillery therefore priorities just 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.480
 will be just for lunch and 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.190
 gradually starting to meet in battle 4 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.690
 level namely t-64 and wider don 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.470
 Sheridan and usually not in the frontal 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.990
 attack and often 60 fours and most 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.090
 interesting that the t-62 doesn't feel 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.010
 somehow defective in comparison with his 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 older brother he can equal 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.130
 butting with him to the last drop of blood 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.510
 and I will tell you this very much pleases therefore 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.070
 here is my verdict 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.520
 and my opinion of the t-62 is simply wonderful 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.130
 car and leave it in the hangar 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.550
 this friends we finish the analysis of the t-62 but 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.350
 we will return to him in the future in the battles 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.650
 after all, such a tank is ignored 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.960
 just impossible with regard to will 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.500
 we are slaughtered on the air map 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.950
 anxiety 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 the guys and I decided to go on top 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.640
 flank and take up defense there thought that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.160
 experience and begin to be interrupted there but 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.410
 unfortunately we notice that the guys in 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.680
 the opposite team still decided 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.720
 break through the bottom flank yes and break through to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.600
 Our database I already managed to pick up 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.290
 a certain amount of damage in your 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
 the ridge 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.510
 moreover he gave me upset 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.910
 sad for 450 units it was just 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.560
 great then notice love 150 think 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.250
 so as not to shoot back while basically 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.680
 there our kind of beat off our base 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.860
 there is one scorpion just notice here 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.450
 sheridan dangerous machine so her 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.569
 just need to finish 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.510
 but he is hiding behind the hangar I don't see him 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.580
 there vegas and an understanding deuce top 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.190
 trying to understand his father's shot and not 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.030
 unfortunately you notice that 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.680
 Sheridan rolls out of the hangar 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.459
 gradually trying to somehow from there 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.120
 move out 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.220
 but Patton allied interferes leave in 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.250
 alone let him tell him the same treasure 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.349
 manages to sell me now 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.420
 one of our guys will finish it all 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.160
 milking well done thank you very much he helped out 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.799
 our team 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.160
 thereby giving us a chance of running ahead 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.140
 I will say that to win this fight 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.780
 shop kill everyone I think it's time to go 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.780
 to the base because everything is pitiable 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.230
 there in front of the enemies has accumulated there very 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.069
 we need a lot of help to go to our guys 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:04.000
 the viper has already jumped trying to knock down 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:06.459
 capture from our base and as soon as I 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.430
 I'll come to notice there is a certain 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.850
 the number of enemy units already 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 here came the whole deuce by the way youth 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.919
 and died in this place thanks to him 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.370
 huge he helped me a lot 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.490
 it is thanks to his dead body already i'm not 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.580
 managed to survive and shoot at the enemy 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.260
 tanks the whole deuce shoot shoot 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.720
 the tower as I told you in the past video 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.030
 before the turret not bad makes its way into 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.910
 principle top precisely with outfits 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.000
 very good at making some miracle 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.870
 just do not get on a scorpion 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.150
 Well, yes, accuracy certainly happens to us 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.550
 always supportive here I finish 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.550
 Scorpio is already on the rush and here we are with 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.630
 Viper is already shouting at each other Kovacs 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.340
 finish off so i ask him for a whisper 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.730
 shot a shot out says passes 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.970
 ricochet just lessons stalemate 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.550
 there are only two of us left against three 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.800
 Patton manages to finish and here we are 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.230
 run around saying what's behind you now 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.940
 most likely will bypass scorpion here 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.250
 we do not think long turn and go 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.080
 back so he lit up 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.150
 scorpion and now there will be another 60 deuce 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.410
 can deuce appeared viper his about and 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.730
 finishes and that was the key 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.100
 the key role you of course in our 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.669
 Weber's victory is very distinguished in this battle 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.669
 4 frags on the second level well done medal 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.720
 for courage to exactly help out i decide 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.010
 do not invent anything stupidly resist 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.320
 scorpion in principle that he can not 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.360
 make a game viper cover me from behind i 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.760
 I felt soared, in principle, saw damage 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.260
 I'll get it okay 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.140
 food straight on it I charge the cumulative 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.900
 projectile and trying to pick it up one 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.840
 Shot and then shooting from the guard not 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.330
 put a point in the jump runs away me 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.760
 just a funny situation trying 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.340
 aim and gun does not raise declared to 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.520
 this from back smash about and not 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.919
 finish off 30 remains and then the viper his 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 finish victory guys and so 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.840
 interesting we have a pretty fight turned out 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.190
 at first picked up when it was already left 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.220
 very small super 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:26.250
 we still decided to drag this fight and 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.960
 We got good at this I 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.810
 Thank you all very much for your attention 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.950
 friends and see you tomorrow in the new 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.950
 video bye bye
