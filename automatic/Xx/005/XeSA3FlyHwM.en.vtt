00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
have to say it isn't the best audio you

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.190 
have to say it isn't the best audio you
are<00:06:44.710> going<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:44.919> hear<00:06:45.220> but<00:06:46.060> it<00:06:46.720> is<00:06:46.930> definitely

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
are going to hear but it is definitely

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.020 
are going to hear but it is definitely
pretty<00:06:47.680> good<00:06:47.950> I<00:06:48.160> mean<00:06:48.430> it's<00:06:48.580> not<00:06:48.700> terrible<00:06:49.979> but

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
pretty good I mean it's not terrible but

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.490 
pretty good I mean it's not terrible but
it's<00:06:52.030> sort<00:06:52.360> of<00:06:52.389> like<00:06:52.620> in<00:06:53.620> between<00:06:53.830> good<00:06:54.520> and

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
it's sort of like in between good and

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.320 
it's sort of like in between good and
you<00:06:56.500> know<00:06:56.590> pretty<00:06:56.770> crappy<00:06:57.039> it's<00:06:57.280> it's<00:06:57.940> it's<00:06:58.270> a

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
you know pretty crappy it's it's it's a

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.900 
you know pretty crappy it's it's it's a
pretty<00:06:58.479> decent<00:06:59.050> mic<00:06:59.169> so<00:06:59.530> I<00:06:59.830> think<00:07:00.400> it<00:07:00.639> sounds

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
pretty decent mic so I think it sounds

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.730 
pretty decent mic so I think it sounds
really<00:07:00.940> well<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:01.539> I<00:07:01.990> also<00:07:02.200> was<00:07:02.470> just

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
really well and I also was just

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.260 
really well and I also was just
listening<00:07:03.639> to<00:07:03.880> some<00:07:04.539> music<00:07:05.020> on<00:07:05.889> it<00:07:06.010> and<00:07:06.270> a

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
listening to some music on it and a

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.550 
listening to some music on it and a
whole<00:07:07.450> bunch<00:07:07.479> different<00:07:07.720> types<00:07:07.960> of<00:07:08.080> music<00:07:08.320> on

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
whole bunch different types of music on

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.310 
whole bunch different types of music on
some<00:07:08.919> rocks<00:07:09.190> dubstep<00:07:09.880> and<00:07:10.120> sound<00:07:11.080> like<00:07:11.110> that

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
some rocks dubstep and sound like that

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.909 
some rocks dubstep and sound like that
and<00:07:12.000> it<00:07:13.169> sounds<00:07:14.169> really<00:07:14.229> good<00:07:14.500> like<00:07:14.800> the

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919 
and it sounds really good like the

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:17.339 
and it sounds really good like the
headset<00:07:15.310> itself<00:07:15.910> the<00:07:16.510> headphones<00:07:16.900> sound

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349 
headset itself the headphones sound

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:22.020 
headset itself the headphones sound
amazing

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.570 

so<00:07:23.030> the<00:07:23.509> mic<00:07:23.719> is<00:07:23.960> pretty<00:07:24.259> good<00:07:24.409> and<00:07:24.620> this<00:07:25.400> is

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
so the mic is pretty good and this is

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.219
