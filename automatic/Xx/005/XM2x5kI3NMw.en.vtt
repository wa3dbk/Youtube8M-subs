00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.900
 conscious choices in search of a 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.910
 life at work with the proposals 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.140
 I'm here today in newport beach on 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.320
 California 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.870
 It does not say that my luck and I came here. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.059
 because of something that I write 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.290
 my book is what I want about this 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.830
 talk to you today 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.040
 in the book I speak of a phrase a guy who 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.809
 says he knows he's in a speech should 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.960
 seek from the most intelligent person 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.070
 of the room and I'd say even more than you 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.780
 should be next to the most 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.949
 smart gives more is fun too 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.800

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.070
 What do you want to do and have another 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.220
 sentence that also puts a book that is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.680
 our believe that the author of theft as a 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 artist and the show and ourique who still 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.040

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.210
