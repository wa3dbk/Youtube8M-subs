00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.070
 video you will learn everything about eyeliner 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.929
 Deft how to do it and what it does 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.190
 I give different stories 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.540
 Wish you a lot of fun if you have one 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.930
 tutorial and I hope it is 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.160
 enlightening and informative for you 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.490
 helpful, of course, and me 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.189
 wish you much fun meant part of a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.669
 is actually a strength of in the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.380
 normal classic eyeliner and yes that is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.460
 just a bit more extreme though 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.260
 still enough to make me easy 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.500
 we now on the other again 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.500
 page 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.079
 on the other side too 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.790
 pull 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.580
 through the second by a bit more 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.820
 it really is about time 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.400
 Now we come to the cat eye 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.650
 liner and that's the only thing you 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.020
 have to do that is their old 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.950
 estrich pulls a little further forward 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.210
 Beyond Europe and back it stays 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 actually the same but really only 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.650
 Front remembers about the front 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.020
 Partie then really takes something 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.810
 less of the eyeliner and tries 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.119
 to delete something because if you are there 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.030
 then too much of the product will have 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.039
 it is no longer so beautiful and fine 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.460
 especially with the cat a very very 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.460
 important 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 this tip is actually enough 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.429
 minimal rules a little further 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.579
 pulls the front then you connect with 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.770
 the lower eye line and that grow 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.049
 also and please take care that the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.810
 Dane then pushed a little further forward 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.000
 the upper line from inside feels that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.710
 really minimal is most 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.069
 exaggerate as a bit and then see 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.709
 it was a bit too loud and therefore wanted 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.929
 I still say extra and again 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.620
 that you really have not been that long 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.819
 must draw far beyond what 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:25.900
 minimal stroke already enough for one 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:28.870
 have a great effect so to speak the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.049
 classic the weiner strokes so it is 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.230
 really very dramatic and already 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.230
 very expressive and do the same 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.319
 so my dear that was it, too 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.209

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.549
