by Linda Elsie was three

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.300 
by Linda Elsie was three
ok<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:40.040> will<00:01:40.250> see<00:01:40.280> as<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.330> open<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.290> more<00:01:42.860> it's

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
ok you will see as I open it more it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.750 
ok you will see as I open it more it's
going<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.119> be<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.540> equation<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.890> answers<00:01:46.460> and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
going to be the equation the answers and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.109 
going to be the equation the answers and
the<00:01:47.659> rational<00:01:48.170> let's<00:01:49.100> see<00:01:49.369> what<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.820> going<00:01:49.850> to

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
the rational let's see what is going to

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:58.090 
the rational let's see what is going to
be<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.390> next<00:01:50.840> thing<00:01:51.909> ok<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.970> is<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:57.100> book

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
be the next thing ok so this is the book

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.440 
be the next thing ok so this is the book
now

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
now

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.810 
now
actually<00:02:00.229> it's<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.440> board<00:02:00.880> it's<00:02:01.880> portable<00:02:02.390> so

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
actually it's a board it's portable so

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.930 
actually it's a board it's portable so
this<00:02:04.820> is<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> whole<00:02:05.330> board<00:02:07.209> that<00:02:08.209> shows<00:02:09.940> this

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
this is a whole board that shows this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.590 
this is a whole board that shows this
game<00:02:11.239> obviously<00:02:12.610> not<00:02:13.610> only<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.150> for<00:02:14.390> one

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
game obviously not only just for one
