00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699 

so<00:00:00.750> we<00:00:00.840> have<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.199> clean<00:00:01.410> no<00:00:01.500> digital

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
so we have the in clean no digital

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.980 
so we have the in clean no digital
follow<00:00:02.070> focus<00:00:02.310> here<00:00:02.610> from<00:00:02.790> view<00:00:02.970> factor<00:00:03.300> and

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
follow focus here from view factor and

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.050 
follow focus here from view factor and
this<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.290> Imperial<00:00:04.560> micro<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.310> what<00:00:05.940> we're

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
this is Imperial micro and what we're

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.860 
this is Imperial micro and what we're
going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.240> do<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.450> give<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> quick

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
going to do is give a quick

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.930 
going to do is give a quick
demonstration<00:00:07.049> how<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.680> works<00:00:07.859> so<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.760> plug

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
demonstration how this works so you plug

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.720 
demonstration how this works so you plug
in<00:00:09.090> p<00:00:09.240> rho<00:00:09.300> into<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.410> clean<00:00:11.070> o<00:00:11.099> module<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
in p rho into the clean o module and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.640 
in p rho into the clean o module and
then<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.389> plug<00:00:12.570> your<00:00:12.690> power<00:00:12.750> into<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.440> clean

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
then you plug your power into in clean

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.890 
then you plug your power into in clean
oh<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:15.059> happens<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
oh and what happens with this is you

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
oh and what happens with this is you
actually<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> bus<00:00:16.830> architecture<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.609> this

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
actually have a bus architecture on this

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.939 
actually have a bus architecture on this
so<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.090> run<00:00:18.390> power<00:00:19.140> into<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.650> clean

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
so you can run power into one and clean

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.130 
so you can run power into one and clean
oh<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.250> then<00:00:20.369> power<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.210> three<00:00:21.600> edition<00:00:21.990> or

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
oh and then power up a three edition or

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.660 
oh and then power up a three edition or
two<00:00:22.320> additional<00:00:22.710> modules<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.250> addition<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
two additional modules in addition to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.359 
two additional modules in addition to
the<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:23.970> one<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.810> when<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:26.010> plug<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the first one so when you first plug it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.099 
the first one so when you first plug it
in<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.730> doesn't<00:00:27.029> work<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:27.990> what

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
in it doesn't work at all and then what

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.529 
in it doesn't work at all and then what
you<00:00:28.140> do<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.590> hit<00:00:28.769> your<00:00:29.029> zero<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.210> button

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you do is you hit your zero out button

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
you do is you hit your zero out button
here<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.869> it'll<00:00:31.320> actually<00:00:31.500> calibrate<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
here and it'll actually calibrate the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.299 
here and it'll actually calibrate the
lens<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:33.410> it'll<00:00:34.410> go<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.890> extreme<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
lens and it'll go to one extreme and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.720 
lens and it'll go to one extreme and
then<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> other<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> once<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
then it will go to the other and once it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.880 
then it will go to the other and once it
has<00:00:38.850> its<00:00:39.059> limits<00:00:39.420> it'll<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.350> limit<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
has its limits it'll actually limit you

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.889 
has its limits it'll actually limit you
from<00:00:41.160> accidentally<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.180> over<00:00:42.390> travel<00:00:42.750> on

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
from accidentally going over travel on

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
from accidentally going over travel on
it<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> preliminary<00:00:44.219> prototype

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
it and this is a preliminary prototype

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.950 
it and this is a preliminary prototype
so<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.210> still<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.809> work<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
so we still have a little bit of work to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110 
so we still have a little bit of work to
do<00:00:46.170> on<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
do on it but you can see that now it

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
do on it but you can see that now it
works<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.840> P<00:00:48.989> ro<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.500> talking<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
works so in P ro is actually talking to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.060 
works so in P ro is actually talking to
in<00:00:50.610> clean<00:00:51.239> oh<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.289> i<00:00:52.350> unplug<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.890> you'll

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
in clean oh and if i unplug this you'll

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
in clean oh and if i unplug this you'll
see<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.309> doesn't<00:00:53.670> move<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.590> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.710> all

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
see that doesn't move so this is all

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.639 
see that doesn't move so this is all
real<00:00:56.309> time<00:00:56.520> control<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.840> very<00:00:58.199> very

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
real time control so you have very very

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.080 
real time control so you have very very
fine<00:00:58.980> controlling<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> other<00:00:59.879> nice

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
fine controlling this the other nice

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.939 
fine controlling this the other nice
thing<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.480> I'm<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.680> clean<00:01:01.920> oh

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
thing is that I'm in and clean oh

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.529 
thing is that I'm in and clean oh
there's<00:01:02.250> actually<00:01:02.550> zero<00:01:02.760> backlash<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
there's actually zero backlash on the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
there's actually zero backlash on the
gear<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> look<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.860> area<00:01:05.189> follow

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
gear so if you look at your area follow

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
gear so if you look at your area follow
focus<00:01:05.640> you'll<00:01:05.939> notice<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> there's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.510> small

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
focus you'll notice that there's a small

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.940 
focus you'll notice that there's a small
amount<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.960> backlash<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.740> there's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
amount of backlash on this there's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.210 
amount of backlash on this there's
actually<00:01:08.220> none<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.740> our<00:01:10.830> coder<00:01:11.040> has

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
actually none and you know our coder has

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.740 
actually none and you know our coder has
some<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.580> fine<00:01:11.880> control<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.540> move

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
some very fine control so you can move

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.740 
some very fine control so you can move
very<00:01:12.780> slowly<00:01:13.380> move<00:01:13.650> very<00:01:13.950> fast<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:15.450> still<00:01:15.659> have

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
very slowly move very fast we still have

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.179 
very slowly move very fast we still have
to<00:01:15.840> put<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.080> damping<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.040> bit

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
to put some damping on this a little bit

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.359 
to put some damping on this a little bit
more<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> most<00:01:18.450> part<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.869> moves<00:01:19.020> very

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
more but for the most part it moves very

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
more but for the most part it moves very
very<00:01:20.369> quickly<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> Imperial<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
very quickly so that's the Imperial and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.539 
very quickly so that's the Imperial and
in<00:01:23.549> Quino

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.890 

alright<00:01:27.549> so<00:01:27.790> here's<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.150> first<00:01:28.390> mock-up<00:01:28.659> of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
alright so here's the first mock-up of

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.380 
alright so here's the first mock-up of
our<00:01:29.049> record<00:01:29.439> start<00:01:29.710> stops<00:01:29.950> which<00:01:30.240> I'll<00:01:31.240> show

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
our record start stops which I'll show

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.090 
our record start stops which I'll show
you<00:01:31.450> quick<00:01:31.600> operation<00:01:31.840> basically<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.920> plug

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
you quick operation basically you plug

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.530 
you quick operation basically you plug
it<00:01:33.220> into<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.549> auxiliary<00:01:33.880> port<00:01:34.150> on<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.330> top

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
it into the auxiliary port on the top
