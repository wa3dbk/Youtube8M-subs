monitor it has dynamic contrast has a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.700 
monitor it has dynamic contrast has a
magic<00:00:50.820> angle<00:00:51.649> which<00:00:52.969> if<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.379> means

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
magic angle which if I know it means

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.180 
magic angle which if I know it means
that<00:00:55.980> from<00:00:56.969> any<00:00:57.329> angle<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.930> watch<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that from any angle you watch it you

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.880 
that from any angle you watch it you
have<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> crisp<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.109> clear<00:01:01.109> image<00:01:02.210> Eco<00:01:03.210> saving

have a crisp and clear image Eco saving

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.350 
have a crisp and clear image Eco saving
which<00:01:04.890> means<00:01:05.160> that<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> power<00:01:05.789> consumption

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
which means that the power consumption

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.900 
which means that the power consumption
is<00:01:06.539> lower<00:01:06.750> than<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.410> average<00:01:07.530> monitors<00:01:08.369> on

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
is lower than the average monitors on

is lower than the average monitors on
HDMI<00:01:09.720> connection<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.530> VGA<00:01:10.860> connection

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
HDMI connection and the VGA connection

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.490

as well it's an LED monitor it's made by
Samsung<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.479> let's<00:01:18.479> open<00:01:19.009> it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.850 

okay<00:01:43.420> we<00:01:44.420> have<00:01:44.539> got<00:01:44.569> a<00:01:44.929> sticker<00:01:45.640> with<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
okay we have got a sticker with the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.889 
okay we have got a sticker with the
power<00:01:48.860> level<00:01:49.460> consumption<00:01:50.119> something<00:01:50.750> like

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
power level consumption something like

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.090 
power level consumption something like
that<00:01:51.110> it's<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:51.590> bit<00:01:51.770> cause<00:01:53.679> we<00:01:54.679> have<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.979> AC

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
that it's a bit cause we have the AC

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:05.339 
that it's a bit cause we have the AC
adapter<00:01:56.619> here<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> neck<00:02:02.000> full<00:02:02.420> stun

understand<00:02:06.349> itself<00:02:10.959> manual<00:02:11.959> stand<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.560> AC

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
understand itself manual stand the AC

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:20.640 
understand itself manual stand the AC
code<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.900> VG<00:02:14.900> cord<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.410> one<00:02:16.959> here<00:02:18.400> see<00:02:19.400> them

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
code and VG cord this one here see them

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.110 
code and VG cord this one here see them
so<00:02:22.150> moving<00:02:23.150> on<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.420> good<00:02:23.660> stuff<00:02:25.120> the

so moving on to the good stuff the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:36.000 
so moving on to the good stuff the
monitor<00:02:26.599> itself<00:02:29.950> let's<00:02:30.950> get<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.250> over<00:02:31.400> rough
