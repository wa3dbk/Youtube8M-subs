00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
got few sets 02 11 you're going to take

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.920 
got few sets 02 11 you're going to take
three<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.399> five<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.600> you're<00:00:33.750> going<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
three and five and you're going to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.360 
three and five and you're going to
combine<00:00:34.170> them<00:00:34.530> together<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.040> I'll<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
combine them together so I'll take a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.190 
combine them together so I'll take a
picture<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.969> something<00:00:36.120> combine<00:00:37.020> them

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
picture or something combine them

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
picture or something combine them
together<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.430> will<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.670> your<00:00:38.940> final<00:00:39.210> cpu

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
together and that will be your final cpu

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.440 
together and that will be your final cpu
key<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> once<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.670> will<00:00:44.940> loaded<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
key so once that will loaded and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
key so once that will loaded and
everything<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.320> you've<00:00:46.890> got<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> new

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
everything there if you've got the new

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.260 
everything there if you've got the new
version<00:00:49.640> then<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.360> will<00:00:51.840> say<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:53.160> cpu<00:00:54.030> key

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
version then it will say your cpu key

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.900 
version then it will say your cpu key
somewhere<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> say

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
somewhere in about right there so to say

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.709 
somewhere in about right there so to say
my<00:00:57.180> cpu<00:00:57.719> key<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> then<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.940> cpu<00:01:00.420> key<00:01:00.600> if

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
my cpu key and then is your cpu key if

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.299 
my cpu key and then is your cpu key if
you<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:01.050> wait<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.559> longer<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.280> i
