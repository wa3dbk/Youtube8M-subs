this thing so I'm gonna switch into my
own<00:03:29.609> Gliscor<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:31.530> was<00:03:32.220> fearing<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.639> he

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
own Gliscor and I was fearing that he

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.629 
own Gliscor and I was fearing that he
might<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.690> mixed<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.410> G<00:03:34.560> slash<00:03:34.859> with<00:03:35.280> Shadow

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
might be a mixed in G slash with Shadow

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.140
