00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
that but this one is less involved or

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.759 
that but this one is less involved or
less<00:02:49.099> what's<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.730> word<00:02:49.910> mmm<00:02:50.420> anyways<00:02:51.200> you

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
less what's the word mmm anyways you

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.410 
less what's the word mmm anyways you
don't<00:02:51.950> have<00:02:52.129> to<00:02:52.340> really<00:02:52.549> devote<00:02:53.000> as<00:02:53.180> much<00:02:53.209> time

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
don't have to really devote as much time

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.539 
don't have to really devote as much time
to<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.900> less<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.109> time-consuming<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.370> guess

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
to it's less a time-consuming I guess

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.460 
to it's less a time-consuming I guess
you<00:02:55.849> could<00:02:56.000> say<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.209> mesh<00:02:57.019> sword<00:02:57.260> attack

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470
