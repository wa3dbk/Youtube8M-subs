MBA Matthews work specifically on

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.849 
MBA Matthews work specifically on
fundamental<00:00:30.779> math<00:00:30.929> skills<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:31.499> addition

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859

and<00:00:33.600> then<00:00:34.199> things<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.670> analysis<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and then things like analysis of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
and then things like analysis of

program really is provides an avenue for
kids<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> learn<00:00:45.390> math<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> way<00:00:46.110> that's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
kids to learn math in a way that's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.829 
kids to learn math in a way that's
exciting<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.220> more<00:00:48.089> connected<00:00:48.479> to<00:00:48.690> their

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
exciting and more connected to their

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.509 
exciting and more connected to their
daily<00:00:49.079> live<00:00:49.350> they're<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.860> doing<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> worksheet

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
daily live they're not doing a worksheet

daily live they're not doing a worksheet
the<00:00:50.760> end<00:00:50.909> goal<00:00:51.120> isn't<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> math

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the end goal isn't just to get the math

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
the end goal isn't just to get the math
problem<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.250> win<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> game<00:00:53.790> of

it's really cool to bridge basketball

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
it's really cool to bridge basketball
and<00:01:04.710> math<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.250> kids<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.600> they

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
and math for kids as you can see they

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.940 
and math for kids as you can see they
kind<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.869> lose<00:01:07.049> themselves<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.590> forget<00:01:07.830> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
kind of lose themselves I forget that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
kind of lose themselves I forget that
they're<00:01:08.070> doing<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.570> end<00:01:09.900> up

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
they're doing that and then end up

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.020 
they're doing that and then end up
worried<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.130> players<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:11.790> more

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
worried about the players and what more

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.170 
worried about the players and what more
players<00:01:12.299> may<00:01:12.509> watch<00:01:12.750> shot<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.520> connects

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
players may watch shot so it connects

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.510 
players may watch shot so it connects
with<00:01:15.240> our<00:01:15.329> children<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:15.900> because<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.200> like

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
with our children here because they like

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.120 
with our children here because they like
basketball<00:01:18.020> with<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.530> believe<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:19.979> come

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
basketball with this I believe they come

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
basketball with this I believe they come
up<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.909> good<00:01:21.060> concept<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.750> kids

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
up with a really good concept for kids

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.319 
up with a really good concept for kids
to<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.829> grasp<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> fundamentals<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.150> far

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
to really grasp the fundamentals as far

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.330 
to really grasp the fundamentals as far
as<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.630> addition<00:01:25.170> subtraction<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
as like addition subtraction and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.899 
as like addition subtraction and
division<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.970> whatnot<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.540> find<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.530> way<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
division and whatnot just find a way to

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.969 
division and whatnot just find a way to
keep<00:01:29.909> them<00:01:30.090> engaged<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.530> games<00:01:31.770> are

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
keep them engaged you know and games are

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.500 
keep them engaged you know and games are
usually<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.550> best<00:01:32.760> way<00:01:32.940> especially<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
usually like the best way especially the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:43.270 
usually like the best way especially the
math<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:35.729> makes<00:01:35.970> us<00:01:36.240> learn<00:01:36.479> more<00:01:36.510> about<00:01:36.900> math

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.160 

it's<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.400> like<00:01:44.729> normal<00:01:44.940> that<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.960> need

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it's not like normal that you just need

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.500 
it's not like normal that you just need
a<00:01:46.200> write<00:01:46.440> on<00:01:46.590> paper<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.610> you're<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.360> have

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
a write on paper like you're gonna have

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.899 
a write on paper like you're gonna have
fun<00:01:48.810> while<00:01:49.080> doing<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.520> makes<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:50.880> job

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
fun while doing that it makes my job

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
fun while doing that it makes my job
easier<00:01:51.450> normally<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.590> try<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.799> come

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
easier normally we have to try to come

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.030 
easier normally we have to try to come
up<00:01:53.010> with<00:01:53.130> very<00:01:53.250> creative<00:01:53.820> ways<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.299> how<00:01:54.330> to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
up with very creative ways on how to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.780 
up with very creative ways on how to
entertain<00:01:56.040> these<00:01:56.159> kids<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.549> keep<00:01:56.670> them

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
entertain these kids and keep them

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
entertain these kids and keep them
engaged<00:01:56.970> with<00:01:57.540> math<00:01:58.229> hoops<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
engaged with math hoops and the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.260 
engaged with math hoops and the
curriculum<00:01:59.250> I'll<00:01:59.369> give<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.700> us<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.060> one

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
curriculum I'll give it to us like one

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.670 
curriculum I'll give it to us like one
two<00:02:00.420> three<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.720> per<00:02:00.869> usual

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
two three as per usual

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.300 
two three as per usual
we<00:02:02.010> roll<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.580> out<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> they<00:02:02.910> have<00:02:02.940> fun
