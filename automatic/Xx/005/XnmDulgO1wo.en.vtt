00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.349

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
but since I got these these pigs I reach

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.789 
but since I got these these pigs I reach
for<00:04:02.169> them<00:04:02.470> they're<00:04:03.220> pretty<00:04:03.370> nice<00:04:04.439> this<00:04:05.439> glove

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
for them they're pretty nice this glove

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.559 
for them they're pretty nice this glove
when<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.400> hold<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:07.000> still<00:04:07.359> have<00:04:07.449> a<00:04:07.540> really

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
when I hold it I still have a really

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.530 
when I hold it I still have a really
good<00:04:07.930> grip<00:04:08.260> but<00:04:09.250> there<00:04:09.669> is<00:04:09.819> a<00:04:09.849> little<00:04:10.180> bit<00:04:12.540> more

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
good grip but there is a little bit more

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.229 
good grip but there is a little bit more
looseness<00:04:13.900> here<00:04:14.139> it's<00:04:15.040> not<00:04:15.250> quite<00:04:15.310> as<00:04:15.879> tight

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
looseness here it's not quite as tight

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.759 
looseness here it's not quite as tight
and<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:17.440> can<00:04:17.859> still<00:04:18.099> feel<00:04:18.310> through<00:04:19.769> through

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
and so I can still feel through through

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.860 
and so I can still feel through through
the<00:04:20.829> glove<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.279> fill<00:04:21.539> everything<00:04:22.539> that<00:04:22.779> I

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870
