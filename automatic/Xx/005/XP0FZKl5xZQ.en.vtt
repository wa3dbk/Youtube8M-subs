I<00:01:54.520> went<00:01:55.180> ahead<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.420> earlier<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.130> divided<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
I went ahead and earlier I divided the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.050 
I went ahead and earlier I divided the
canvas<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> third<00:01:58.630> sauce<00:01:59.140> tryna<00:02:00.060> think

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
canvas and the third sauce tryna think

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.290 
canvas and the third sauce tryna think
of<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.270> at<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.600> pair<00:02:01.900> be<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.700> focal<00:02:03.700> point<00:02:03.730> if

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
of it at this pair be the focal point if

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.249 
of it at this pair be the focal point if
you<00:02:04.420> will<00:02:04.600> see<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.530> thirds<00:02:05.800> here<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:08.020> way

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
you will see the thirds here to this way

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.050 
you will see the thirds here to this way
so<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.619> will<00:02:08.800> be<00:02:08.979> kind<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.369> like<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.670> focal

so this will be kind of like the focal

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.050 
so this will be kind of like the focal
point<00:02:10.270> for<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.660> most<00:02:10.869> part<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:12.580> orange

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
haven't even put in a line in the back

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.090 
haven't even put in a line in the back
yet<00:03:29.620> but<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.730> know<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.690> shadows<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.739> this

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
yet but I know the shadows to be on this

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.340 
yet but I know the shadows to be on this
side<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:33.670> know<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.570> wine<00:03:34.750> bottle<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.320> the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
side so you know the wine bottle so the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.699 
side so you know the wine bottle so the
shadows<00:03:35.830> gonna<00:03:36.010> be<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.400> side<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.910> then

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
shadows gonna be on this side and then

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.570 
shadows gonna be on this side and then
will<00:03:38.709> be<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.860> shadow<00:03:39.130> side<00:03:39.459> on<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
will be a shadow side on the on the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.300 
will be a shadow side on the on the
fruit<00:03:42.910> here<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.510> shadow<00:03:43.780> side<00:03:44.019> also<00:03:44.290> on<00:03:44.769> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
fruit here the shadow side also on the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.870 
fruit here the shadow side also on the
little<00:03:46.300> dish<00:03:46.510> or<00:03:46.780> bowl<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:48.340> gonna<00:03:48.489> be<00:03:48.730> on

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
little dish or bowl it's gonna be on

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.790 
little dish or bowl it's gonna be on
this<00:03:49.060> side<00:03:49.330> so<00:03:49.989> this<00:03:50.170> would<00:03:50.320> be<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.530> shadow

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
this side so this would be the shadow

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.520 
this side so this would be the shadow
side<00:03:51.100> if<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.370> will<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.810> then<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.200> shadow

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
side if you will and then the shadow

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.160 
side if you will and then the shadow
side<00:03:53.830> also<00:03:54.070> for<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:55.239> guess<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.660> may<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:55.870> made

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
side also for the I guess I may be made

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.640 
side also for the I guess I may be made
up<00:03:56.290> my<00:03:56.410> mind<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.830> is<00:03:56.890> gonna<00:03:57.160> be<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.370> pair

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
up my mind and this is gonna be a pair

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.990 
up my mind and this is gonna be a pair
my<00:03:59.650> lights<00:03:59.860> gonna<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.190> coming<00:04:00.459> from<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.790> way

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
my lights gonna be coming from this way

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000 
my lights gonna be coming from this way
