Rover<00:00:06.270> mask<00:00:06.770> um<00:00:07.940> so<00:00:08.940> I'm<00:00:09.210> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.420> start<00:00:09.510> with

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
Rover mask um so I'm going to start with

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
Rover mask um so I'm going to start with
the<00:00:09.780> base<00:00:11.540> um<00:00:12.540> there<00:00:13.019> are<00:00:13.049> two<00:00:13.230> layers<00:00:13.880> this<00:00:14.880> is

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the base um there are two layers this is

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.090 
the base um there are two layers this is
the<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:15.389> layer<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.049> first<00:00:16.289> layer<00:00:16.500> fit<00:00:16.830> over

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the first layer the first layer fit over

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.710 
the first layer the first layer fit over
your<00:00:17.130> head<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.990> just<00:00:18.990> use<00:00:19.230> some<00:00:19.529> foam<00:00:20.600> so<00:00:21.600> it's

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
your head I just use some foam so it's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.710 
your head I just use some foam so it's
comfortable<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.590> padded<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:24.480> just

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
comfortable and it's padded and I just

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.259 
comfortable and it's padded and I just
use<00:00:24.840> some<00:00:24.869> wire<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> a--<00:00:25.760> to<00:00:26.760> help<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
use some wire and it is a-- to help it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.760 
use some wire and it is a-- to help it
keep<00:00:27.390> its<00:00:27.599> shape<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:29.900> I<00:00:31.969> just<00:00:33.260> had<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.620> when

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
keep its shape and I just had it so when

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.220 
keep its shape and I just had it so when
you<00:00:34.860> put<00:00:35.040> over<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.280> head<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.329> bottom<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> um

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
you put over my head the bottom of it um

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.940 
you put over my head the bottom of it um
goes<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.700> ears<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.800> below<00:00:40.800> my

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
goes down to about my ears or below my

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.850 
goes down to about my ears or below my
ears<00:00:41.219> come<00:00:41.820> around<00:00:42.059> there<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.559> easy<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
ears come around there so it's easy to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.110 
ears come around there so it's easy to
get<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:45.170> then<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.590> outer<00:00:46.770> layer<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.430> this

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
get on and then the outer layer is this

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
get on and then the outer layer is this
I<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:49.289> used<00:00:51.050> what's<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> called<00:00:52.379> plastic

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I just used what's it called plastic

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.220 
I just used what's it called plastic
canvas<00:00:53.160> plastic<00:00:54.149> mesh<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.629> strong<00:00:58.079> and

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
canvas plastic mesh so it's strong and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.910 
canvas plastic mesh so it's strong and
there's<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.350> hollow<00:01:01.710> area<00:01:02.480> in<00:01:03.480> between<00:01:03.920> it's

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
there's this hollow area in between it's

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.710 
there's this hollow area in between it's
parted<00:01:05.280> by<00:01:06.140> wooden<00:01:07.140> skewers<00:01:07.790> um<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> holds

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
parted by wooden skewers um and it holds

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.370 
parted by wooden skewers um and it holds
the<00:01:10.020> outer<00:01:10.260> layer<00:01:10.530> up<00:01:10.799> um<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.630> Hollow<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the outer layer up um and it's Hollow I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.210 
the outer layer up um and it's Hollow I
made<00:01:13.650> them<00:01:13.770> hall<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.580> multiple<00:01:15.540> reasons<00:01:16.220> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
made them hall for multiple reasons it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.980 
made them hall for multiple reasons it's
lighter<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.270> more<00:01:18.960> comfortable<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> wear

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
lighter so it's more comfortable to wear

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.969 
lighter so it's more comfortable to wear
it's<00:01:21.990> also<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.259> better<00:01:22.740> ventilation<00:01:23.070> uh<00:01:24.979> what

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it's also a better ventilation uh what

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.460 
it's also a better ventilation uh what
else<00:01:26.130> oh<00:01:27.080> yeah<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.100> also<00:01:29.430> less<00:01:30.420> dice<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.259> less

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
else oh yeah it is also less dice a less

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.609 
else oh yeah it is also less dice a less
heavy<00:01:31.790> head<00:01:32.790> maybe<00:01:33.270> anyway<00:01:33.780> plus<00:01:34.049> heavy<00:01:34.490> and

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
heavy head maybe anyway plus heavy and

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.080 
heavy head maybe anyway plus heavy and
cost<00:01:37.619> less<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> want<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.880> big

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
cost less because if you want to be big

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.560 
cost less because if you want to be big
then<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> use<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.840> much<00:01:39.960> fun

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
then you don't have to use as much fun

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.109 
then you don't have to use as much fun
and<00:01:43.189> it's<00:01:44.189> very<00:01:44.369> important<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:44.939> at

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and it's very important when you're at

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.440 
and it's very important when you're at
putting<00:01:45.509> these<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.869> because<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.070> um<00:01:47.450> shapes

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
putting these on because it um shapes

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
putting these on because it um shapes
the<00:01:48.810> whole<00:01:49.020> head<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:51.350> because<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.470> know<00:01:52.560> when

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the whole head so because you know when

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.209 
the whole head so because you know when
you<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.189> over<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:54.049> yeah<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.649> um<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you put it over then yeah but um and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.760 
you put it over then yeah but um and
it's<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:56.670> hard<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.149> visualize<00:01:57.770> when

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's really hard to visualize when

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.709 
it's really hard to visualize when
making<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.219> least<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.520> me<00:01:59.670> what<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> shape

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
making at least for me what the shape

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
making at least for me what the shape
will<00:02:00.869> look<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.340> because<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.759> bunch

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
will look like because it's just a bunch

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.530 
will look like because it's just a bunch
of<00:02:03.030> sticks<00:02:03.860> sticking<00:02:04.860> up<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.939> what<00:02:06.390> really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
of sticks sticking up but what really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.150 
of sticks sticking up but what really
helped<00:02:07.020> me<00:02:07.409> was<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:09.110> either<00:02:10.110> put<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.530> some

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
helped me was I just either put on some

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.200 
helped me was I just either put on some
foam<00:02:11.610> or

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
foam or

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.370 
foam or
I break<00:02:13.450> over<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:16.120> helped<00:02:16.450> me<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.870> see

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
I break over it and it helped me to see

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.250 
I break over it and it helped me to see
what<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.940> final<00:02:19.120> shape<00:02:19.510> would<00:02:19.660> look<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:19.960> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
what the final shape would look like and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.530 
what the final shape would look like and
if<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.470> need<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.800> change<00:02:20.950> anything<00:02:21.310> um<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.540> it's

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
if I need to change anything um and it's

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.700 
if I need to change anything um and it's
very<00:02:25.720> that's<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:26.020> very<00:02:26.200> important<00:02:26.620> step

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
very that's a very important step

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.480 
very that's a very important step
because<00:02:28.050> when<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.080> was<00:02:29.230> making<00:02:29.380> Rover<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.100> didn't

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
because when I was making Rover I didn't

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.760 
because when I was making Rover I didn't
know<00:02:30.550> what<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:30.880> doing<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.410> shape<00:02:32.620> was

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
know what I was doing and the shape was

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.550 
know what I was doing and the shape was
completely<00:02:33.400> off<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.600> had<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> keep<00:02:35.140> adding

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
completely off so I had to keep adding

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.990 
completely off so I had to keep adding

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
phone and it ended up using I ended up

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.250 
phone and it ended up using I ended up
using<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.390> lot<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.690> foam<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:43.630> was<00:02:43.810> just<00:02:43.990> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
using a lot of foam and it was just it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.960 
using a lot of foam and it was just it
got<00:02:45.240> heavier<00:02:46.440> still<00:02:47.440> comfortable<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.880> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
got heavier still comfortable but it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.440 
got heavier still comfortable but it
gets<00:02:49.150> hotter<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.720> lot<00:02:50.110> quicker<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.920> have<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.550> take

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
gets hotter a lot quicker I have to take

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.710 
gets hotter a lot quicker I have to take
it<00:02:52.630> off<00:02:52.860> every<00:02:53.860> five<00:02:54.250> minutes<00:02:54.720> probably

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
it off every five minutes probably

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.650 
it off every five minutes probably
around<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.490> harder<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.210> breathe<00:02:58.480> in

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
around because it's harder to breathe in

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.870 
around because it's harder to breathe in
it<00:02:58.810> gets<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.140> stuffy<00:02:59.650> um<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.460> it<00:03:03.550> costs

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
it gets really stuffy um so and it costs

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.850 
it gets really stuffy um so and it costs
more<00:03:04.210> because<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.080> had<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.230> buy<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.380> lot<00:03:05.680> more

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
here over i just had to cover it with

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.510 
here over i just had to cover it with
this<00:03:27.430> fun<00:03:27.820> foam<00:03:28.590> because<00:03:29.590> otherwise<00:03:30.190> would<00:03:30.490> be

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
this fun foam because otherwise would be

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.080 
this fun foam because otherwise would be
to<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.960> foam<00:03:32.170> is<00:03:32.200> too<00:03:32.530> thick<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
to the foam is too thick and it the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.640 
to the foam is too thick and it the
shape<00:03:34.300> would<00:03:34.480> be<00:03:34.600> off<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:36.630> um<00:03:39.660> yeah<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:41.050> that's

natura buckram comes in black all I've
seen<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:12.540> white<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:14.900> didn't<00:04:15.900> use<00:04:16.079> paint

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
seen is white so I didn't use paint

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.740 
seen is white so I didn't use paint
though<00:04:16.829> because<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:18.239> was<00:04:18.359> worried<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.630> I

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
though because I was worried that I

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.050 
though because I was worried that I
would<00:04:18.900> clog<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.260> up<00:04:19.459> I'm<00:04:20.459> not<00:04:20.670> sure<00:04:20.880> if<00:04:20.970> it

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
would clog it up I'm not sure if it

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.750 
would clog it up I'm not sure if it
actually<00:04:21.209> does<00:04:21.570> but<00:04:22.040> just<00:04:23.040> in<00:04:23.190> case<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.670> just

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
actually does but just in case I just

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.110 
actually does but just in case I just
use<00:04:24.090> sharpie<00:04:24.540> on<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.500> went<00:04:25.830> over<00:04:25.920> it<00:04:26.160> but

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
use sharpie on and went over it but

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.220 
use sharpie on and went over it but
you'll<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.390> do<00:04:27.570> multiple<00:04:27.720> layers<00:04:28.110> of

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
you'll have to do multiple layers of

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.520 
you'll have to do multiple layers of
sharpie<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:29.490> get<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:29.790> black<00:04:30.170> because<00:04:31.170> it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
sharpie to get this black because it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.150 
sharpie to get this black because it
doesn't<00:04:32.900> show<00:04:33.900> up<00:04:33.930> this<00:04:34.260> black<00:04:34.500> at<00:04:34.710> first<00:04:34.950> you

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
doesn't show up this black at first you

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.510 
doesn't show up this black at first you
need<00:04:35.280> add<00:04:35.870> 5<00:04:36.870> or<00:04:37.050> cell<00:04:37.230> layers<00:04:37.470> however<00:04:38.340> many

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
need add 5 or cell layers however many
