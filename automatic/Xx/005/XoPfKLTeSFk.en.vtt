00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hello, I want to show you live how 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.309
 looks like a suit tied in a technique 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.590
 Irish lace 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:20.390
 my costume consists of a skirt and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:23.660
 jacket jacket I was knitting with a collar 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:29.689
 double breasted collar 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.689
 small stands it can be back to turn back 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:39.420
 or so close the suit is bound from 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.719
 thin cotton mercerized on 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.890
 motives I took cotton thicker he 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:52.710
 goes 560 meters 100 grams she mesh 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 on 100 grams about 1000 meters here 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.620
 so the suit looks from the inside 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:04.199
 mesh knits with the wrong side due to this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:09.950
 on the face it turns out voluminous all the motives and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.170
 not visible where the mesh is attached 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.470
 many motives that i used to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:25.890
 jackets are shown in knitting lessons on 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:28.520
 my channel heart is in the middle 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520
 backrest 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.320

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:05.760

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:08.660
 motives and finished tuck all 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.660
 go well 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:26.200
 due to the mesh in the sleeve turned out 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:37.650
 seamless and on the side of the sleeves also not 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:37.650

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:51.730
 Sew buttons and second sleeve so 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.200

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.170
 buttons for one button 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:25.630

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:28.710

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.240
 more transparent 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.759
 This is how the net looks like inside 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.729

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.820
