00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
this one I broke are there and then

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
this one I broke are there and then
there's<00:00:59.370> another<00:00:59.960> receptacle<00:01:00.960> fare<00:01:01.109> tab<00:01:01.320> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
there's another receptacle fare tab so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.080 
there's another receptacle fare tab so
the<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:01.800> pieces<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.160> slide<00:01:02.489> together

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the two pieces just slide together

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.640 
the two pieces just slide together
but<00:01:03.629> after<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.500> pretty

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
but after you do that that's pretty

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.640 
but after you do that that's pretty
simple<00:01:05.240> then<00:01:06.240> you're<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> come<00:01:07.619> over

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
simple then you're going to come over

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
simple then you're going to come over
here<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.350> find<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.939> red<00:01:12.180> guy<00:01:12.210> over

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
here and find this little red guy over

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.859 
here and find this little red guy over
here<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.549> guess<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.390> ignition

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
here I guess this is like the ignition

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.609 
here I guess this is like the ignition
switch<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.650> there's<00:01:17.580> two<00:01:17.820> screws<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.659> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
switch and there's two screws you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.950 
switch and there's two screws you can
see<00:01:19.979> there<00:01:20.250> they'll<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.000> covered<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> some

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
see there they'll be covered in some

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.350 
see there they'll be covered in some
kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.259> red<00:01:22.470> wax<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:23.130> sealant<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
kind of red wax or sealant you want to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.280 
kind of red wax or sealant you want to
take<00:01:25.280> take<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.850> screws<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.960> one

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
take take these two screws and that one

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.730 
take take these two screws and that one
and<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.509> off<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.259> then

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and then this one over here off and then

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.630 
and then this one over here off and then
this<00:01:35.490> should<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.860> slide<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:40.640> there

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this should just slide off just there

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.969 
this should just slide off just there
you<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.530> slides<00:01:43.920> off<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:45.950> now<00:01:46.950> you

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you go so that slides off and now you

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.590 
you go so that slides off and now you
could<00:01:47.310> start<00:01:47.579> your<00:01:47.700> car<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> screwdriver

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
could start your car with a screwdriver

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.109 
could start your car with a screwdriver
or<00:01:48.869> something<00:01:49.369> using<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.759> switch<00:01:51.090> right

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
or something using that switch right

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.469 
or something using that switch right

chip in the key you'd have to have the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.810 
chip in the key you'd have to have the
key<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.430> ignition<00:01:56.570> there's<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:59.460> little

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you see these two green wires going to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.749 
you see these two green wires going to
it<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> key<00:02:07.680> has<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.489> in

My Luck wasn't it wasn't broken inside
so<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.690> figured<00:02:19.080> I'd<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.230> pull<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:19.980> apart

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
so I figured I'd just pull this apart

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.420 
so I figured I'd just pull this apart
and<00:02:20.490> see<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.150> what<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:21.990> did<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and see and what I did is here on the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.820 
and see and what I did is here on the
end<00:02:23.610> there's<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.060> there's<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.600> bolt<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
end there's this there's a bolt on the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.540 
end there's this there's a bolt on the
end<00:02:25.980> here<00:02:26.750> or<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:28.140> sticking<00:02:28.380> out<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.340> back

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
end here or just sticking out the back

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.840 
end here or just sticking out the back
side<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> turns<00:02:30.330> knots<00:02:30.900> which<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.550> can't<00:02:32.790> see

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850

keeps wigging out

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
keeps wigging out
so<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.660> little<00:02:40.230> switch<00:02:40.440> guy<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.950> goes<00:02:41.310> into

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
so that little switch guy that goes into

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.710 
so that little switch guy that goes into
this<00:02:42.210> white<00:02:42.540> switch<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:45.540> what<00:02:45.690> I

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
this white switch here and so what I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.560 
this white switch here and so what I
found<00:02:46.050> was<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:48.020> was<00:02:49.250> stuck<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.360> was

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
found was this was stuck out it was

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.930 
found was this was stuck out it was
stuck<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.140> off<00:02:52.320> position<00:02:52.560> or<00:02:53.520> in<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> on

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
stuck in the off position or in the on

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
stuck in the off position or in the on
position<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.770> took<00:02:55.950> these<00:02:56.370> pliers

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
position and so I just took these pliers

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.630 
position and so I just took these pliers
turned<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.140> back<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.790> then<00:02:59.790> now<00:03:00.570> my<00:03:00.870> ski<00:03:01.260> key

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
turned it back and then now my ski key

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.850 
turned it back and then now my ski key
it<00:03:04.250> goes<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.430> here<00:03:05.460> and<00:03:05.730> it'll<00:03:06.030> turn<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> that's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
it goes in here and it'll turn so that's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.270 
it goes in here and it'll turn so that's
good

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
good

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.070 
good
so<00:03:08.820> I'm<00:03:09.660> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:09.960> put<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.290> back<00:03:10.350> on<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:12.080> put

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
so I'm going to put this back on and put

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.440 
so I'm going to put this back on and put
that<00:03:13.200> guy<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.890> then<00:03:14.760> see<00:03:14.970> if<00:03:15.060> it'll<00:03:15.180> turn

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that guy on and then see if it'll turn

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.480 
that guy on and then see if it'll turn
I'll<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.900> reconnect<00:03:16.650> my<00:03:16.860> battery<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
I'll have to reconnect my battery and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.750 
I'll have to reconnect my battery and
hopefully<00:03:18.210> that<00:03:18.360> should<00:03:18.510> fix<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:20.610> now

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
hopefully that should fix this so now

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.160 
hopefully that should fix this so now
I'm<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.000> going<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.240> put<00:03:21.420> these<00:03:21.540> two<00:03:21.810> screws

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
I'm just going to put these two screws

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:35.050 
I'm just going to put these two screws
in<00:03:22.380> here

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.750 

there's<00:03:35.630> one<00:03:35.959> there<00:03:36.530> might<00:03:36.709> be<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:36.890> little<00:03:37.520> bit

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
there's one there might be a little bit

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.309 
there's one there might be a little bit
of<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.970> wax<00:03:38.330> covering<00:03:39.110> over<00:03:39.319> these<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.870> should

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
of a wax covering over these that should

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.309 
of a wax covering over these that should
be<00:03:42.500> reddish<00:03:43.069> and<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.780> can<00:03:44.900> just<00:03:45.080> scrape<00:03:45.260> that

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
be reddish and you can just scrape that

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.730 
be reddish and you can just scrape that
off<00:03:45.560> when<00:03:46.069> you're<00:03:46.190> putting<00:03:46.430> taking<00:03:47.270> them<00:03:47.390> off

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
off when you're putting taking them off

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.910 
off when you're putting taking them off
it<00:03:48.850> just<00:03:49.850> kind<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.150> seals<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.780> there<00:03:51.050> so

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
it just kind of seals it on there so

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.710 
it just kind of seals it on there so
that's<00:03:52.250> all<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.760> got<00:03:53.060> these<00:03:53.209> two<00:03:53.420> screws

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
that's all that is got these two screws

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.240 
that's all that is got these two screws
back<00:03:53.930> in<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:56.000> here's<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.480> moment<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.780> truth

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
back in so here's the moment of truth

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.090 
back in so here's the moment of truth
everything's<00:03:58.250> back<00:03:58.430> together<00:03:58.640> that<00:04:00.100> ignition

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
everything's back together that ignition

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.520 
everything's back together that ignition
switch<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.400> back<00:04:01.790> on<00:04:02.030> Mikey<00:04:02.600> seems<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.050> turn<00:04:03.260> I

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
switch is back on Mikey seems to turn I

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.729 
switch is back on Mikey seems to turn I
reconnected<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.489> battery<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.590> here's<00:04:06.590> the

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
reconnected the battery so here's the

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:13.800 
reconnected the battery so here's the
moment<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:07.070> truth<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:10.340> we<00:04:11.060> got<00:04:11.269> take<00:04:11.540> off<00:04:11.780> I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
moment of truth and we got take off I

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.479 
moment of truth and we got take off I
don't<00:04:14.810> know<00:04:14.900> if<00:04:14.989> this<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.170> really<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.160> long-term

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
don't know if this is really a long-term

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.530 
don't know if this is really a long-term
solution

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
solution

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.900 
solution
maybe<00:04:18.290> it'll<00:04:18.530> end<00:04:18.680> up<00:04:18.799> spinning<00:04:19.100> again<00:04:19.519> but

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
maybe it'll end up spinning again but

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.030 
maybe it'll end up spinning again but
for<00:04:20.120> now<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.450> starts<00:04:20.900> I'm<00:04:21.500> going<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.769> put<00:04:21.919> my

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
for now it starts I'm going to put my

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.880 
for now it starts I'm going to put my
covers<00:04:22.370> back<00:04:22.580> on<00:04:23.140> this<00:04:24.140> one<00:04:24.350> just<00:04:24.590> slides

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
covers back on this one just slides

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:33.240 
covers back on this one just slides
under<00:04:25.220> here<00:04:25.400> just<00:04:28.330> slide<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.540> one<00:04:29.750> under

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.280 

kind<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.370> have<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.610> finesse<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:34.970> up<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:36.080> it's

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
kind of have to finesse it up so it's

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.560 
kind of have to finesse it up so it's
kind<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.590> pain<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:37.790> get<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.030> over<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.360> cruise

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
kind of a pain to get it over the cruise

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.020 
kind of a pain to get it over the cruise
control<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:39.680> little<00:04:39.830> piece<00:04:40.400> seems<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.820> bend

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
control this little piece seems to bend

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.100 
control this little piece seems to bend
a<00:04:41.120> little<00:04:41.300> bit<00:04:41.419> more<00:04:41.570> than<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.750> rest<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.050> the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
a little bit more than the rest of the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.280 
a little bit more than the rest of the
plastic<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.250> slides<00:04:43.550> up<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.290> now

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
plastic so that slides up like that now

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.290 
plastic so that slides up like that now
the<00:04:45.410> other<00:04:45.590> piece<00:04:45.940> go<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:47.060> top<00:04:49.030> same<00:04:50.030> deal<00:04:50.270> here

the other piece go on top same deal here
I'm<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.560> pain<00:04:51.740> just<00:04:52.070> Vanessa<00:04:53.410> tried<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.530> be

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
I'm the pain just Vanessa tried to be

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.340 
I'm the pain just Vanessa tried to be
careful<00:04:54.830> it's<00:04:55.250> easy<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.580> break<00:04:55.760> these<00:04:56.030> tabs

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.050 

okay<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:00.410> after<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:01.010> get<00:05:01.190> both<00:05:01.400> pieces<00:05:01.430> on

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
okay so after you get both pieces on

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.029 
okay so after you get both pieces on
then<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:03.050> just<00:05:03.200> have<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.470> snap<00:05:03.740> them<00:05:03.950> together

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
then you just have to snap them together

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.500 
then you just have to snap them together
so<00:05:07.039> just<00:05:07.370> snap<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:08.060> together

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
so just snap it together

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.110 
so just snap it together
be<00:05:08.780> really<00:05:09.020> careful<00:05:09.229> there's<00:05:10.130> four<00:05:10.520> tabs<00:05:10.789> like

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
be really careful there's four tabs like

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.930 
be really careful there's four tabs like
I<00:05:11.150> said<00:05:11.560> it<00:05:12.560> can<00:05:12.890> be<00:05:12.919> done<00:05:13.100> without<00:05:13.400> breaking

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
I said it can be done without breaking

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.630 
I said it can be done without breaking
it<00:05:14.060> but<00:05:14.270> it's<00:05:14.390> kind<00:05:14.570> of<00:05:14.630> difficult<00:05:15.250> all<00:05:16.250> the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
it but it's kind of difficult all the

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.880 
it but it's kind of difficult all the
best
