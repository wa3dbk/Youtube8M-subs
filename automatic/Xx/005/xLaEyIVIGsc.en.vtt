evolve from this to this to that and
once<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:45.970> will<00:04:46.120> reach<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.570> final<00:04:46.750> form<00:04:47.259> it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
once it will reach the final form it

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.830 
once it will reach the final form it
will<00:04:47.830> look<00:04:47.979> like<00:04:48.160> this

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
idea to put the scope on it even though

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.450 
idea to put the scope on it even though
it's<00:04:55.479> not<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.720> accurate<00:04:56.229> not<00:04:56.919> even<00:04:57.220> talking

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
it's not that accurate not even talking

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.820

about<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.970> sneak<00:04:58.240> mode<00:04:58.449> but<00:04:59.110> still<00:04:59.410> it<00:04:59.590> looks

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
about the sneak mode but still it looks

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.400 
about the sneak mode but still it looks
pretty<00:05:00.310> amazing<00:05:00.639> and<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.540> customization
