Information Center to go the bathroom
and<00:00:12.890> came<00:00:13.760> down<00:00:13.910> take<00:00:14.090> some<00:00:14.120> pictures<00:00:14.450> of<00:00:14.570> the

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
and came down take some pictures of the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.950 
and came down take some pictures of the
river<00:00:14.840> and<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.920> entire<00:00:16.600> side<00:00:17.600> of<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.750> river

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
river and the entire side of the river

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.890 
river and the entire side of the river
bed<00:00:18.170> here<00:00:18.620> is<00:00:18.890> mostly<00:00:19.460> made<00:00:19.730> up<00:00:20.000> of<00:00:20.180> this<00:00:20.480> same

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
bed here is mostly made up of this same

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.950 
bed here is mostly made up of this same
rock<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:21.620> it's<00:00:21.740> just<00:00:21.950> nice<00:00:22.100> grey<00:00:22.539> flat<00:00:23.539> stuff

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
rock and it's just nice grey flat stuff

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.200 
rock and it's just nice grey flat stuff
with<00:00:24.260> lines<00:00:24.530> in<00:00:24.890> it<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:25.730> first<00:00:25.880> thing<00:00:26.030> that

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
with lines in it so the first thing that

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.810 
with lines in it so the first thing that
goes<00:00:26.360> through<00:00:26.420> my<00:00:27.020> line<00:00:27.770> is<00:00:28.039> well<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.490> could<00:00:28.670> be

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
goes through my line is well it could be

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.750 
goes through my line is well it could be
sedimentary<00:00:29.300> or<00:00:29.510> it<00:00:29.600> could<00:00:29.750> be<00:00:29.869> metamorphic

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
sedimentary or it could be metamorphic

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.069 
sedimentary or it could be metamorphic
because<00:00:31.760> either<00:00:31.880> those<00:00:32.270> could<00:00:32.599> could<00:00:32.960> have

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
because either those could could have

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.830 
because either those could could have
been<00:00:33.940> originally<00:00:34.940> put<00:00:35.150> down<00:00:35.300> by<00:00:35.480> deposition

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
been originally put down by deposition

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.080 
been originally put down by deposition
and<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:37.160> think<00:00:37.370> I'm<00:00:37.460> gonna<00:00:37.550> have<00:00:37.700> to<00:00:37.760> go<00:00:37.880> with

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
and I think I'm gonna have to go with

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.680 
and I think I'm gonna have to go with
some<00:00:38.660> sort<00:00:38.870> of<00:00:38.930> slate<00:00:39.890> or<00:00:40.190> really<00:00:41.120> closely

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
some sort of slate or really closely

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.850 
some sort of slate or really closely
related<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.140> slate<00:00:43.030> because<00:00:44.620> it's<00:00:45.620> no<00:00:45.829> longer

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
related to slate because it's no longer

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.100 
related to slate because it's no longer
like<00:00:46.399> a<00:00:46.430> shale<00:00:46.790> or<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:47.059> silt<00:00:47.390> stone<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.960> it's

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
like a shale or a silt stone and it's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.430 
like a shale or a silt stone and it's
pretty<00:00:48.380> clear<00:00:48.770> looking<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:49.880> Sun<00:00:50.410> that<00:00:51.410> you

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
pretty clear looking in the Sun that you

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.830 
pretty clear looking in the Sun that you
can<00:00:51.680> see<00:00:51.860> minerals<00:00:52.550> Sparkle<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.510> those

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
can see minerals Sparkle and those

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.690 
can see minerals Sparkle and those
minerals<00:00:54.260> don't<00:00:54.469> typically<00:00:54.860> recrystallize

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
minerals don't typically recrystallize

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.600 
minerals don't typically recrystallize
to<00:00:56.800> something<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:57.920> can<00:00:58.100> see<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:59.480> would<00:00:59.629> look

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
to something you can see that would look

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.490 
to something you can see that would look
different<00:01:01.610> than<00:01:01.760> sandstone<00:01:02.300> or<00:01:02.329> limestone<00:01:02.600> or

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
different than sandstone or limestone or

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.609 
different than sandstone or limestone or
shale<00:01:04.299> until<00:01:05.299> it's<00:01:05.479> been<00:01:05.749> under<00:01:06.259> some<00:01:06.439> heat

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
shale until it's been under some heat

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.319 
shale until it's been under some heat
and<00:01:06.770> pressure<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.639> you<00:01:07.670> know<00:01:07.999> there's<00:01:08.149> not<00:01:08.270> a

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
and pressure so you know there's not a

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.899 
and pressure so you know there's not a
whole<00:01:08.450> lot<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:09.159> stuff<00:01:10.159> in<00:01:10.280> here<00:01:10.520> but<00:01:10.579> it<00:01:10.819> does

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
whole lot of stuff in here but it does

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.969 
whole lot of stuff in here but it does
seem<00:01:11.090> like<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.270> slate<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.899> it's<00:01:12.590> definitely<00:01:12.859> a

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
seem like a slate and it's definitely a

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.499 
seem like a slate and it's definitely a
lot<00:01:13.130> like<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> chalkboard<00:01:13.639> or<00:01:13.999> what<00:01:14.149> you<00:01:14.240> have

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
lot like a chalkboard or what you have

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.769 
lot like a chalkboard or what you have
inside<00:01:14.899> of<00:01:14.929> pool<00:01:15.590> table<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.670> slate<00:01:17.509> is

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:17.779 
inside of pool table so slate is

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:19.749 
inside of pool table so slate is
basically<00:01:18.590> shale<00:01:19.189> that's<00:01:19.219> been

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
basically shale that's been

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.899 
basically shale that's been
metamorphosed<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.979> shale<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.369> essentially<00:01:22.850> a

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
metamorphosed and shale is essentially a

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.019 
metamorphosed and shale is essentially a
sedimentary<00:01:23.450> rock<00:01:23.679> that<00:01:24.850> made<00:01:25.850> from

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:26.029 
sedimentary rock that made from

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.300 
sedimentary rock that made from
deposited<00:01:26.869> silt<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.439> mud<00:01:27.529> really<00:01:28.039> fine

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
deposited silt and mud really fine

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.339 
deposited silt and mud really fine
particles<00:01:28.969> it's<00:01:29.240> much<00:01:29.420> more<00:01:29.599> dense<00:01:29.869> than<00:01:30.139> like

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:30.349 
particles it's much more dense than like

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:33.029 
particles it's much more dense than like
sandstone<00:01:31.219> or<00:01:31.399> something<00:01:31.819> and<00:01:32.149> then<00:01:32.359> it<00:01:32.509> is

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
sandstone or something and then it is

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.629 
sandstone or something and then it is
subjected<00:01:34.039> to<00:01:34.069> heat<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.490> pressure

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:34.639 
subjected to heat and pressure

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.910 
subjected to heat and pressure
underground<00:01:35.359> as<00:01:35.719> mountains<00:01:36.259> are<00:01:36.409> being<00:01:36.590> built

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
underground as mountains are being built

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.359 
underground as mountains are being built
or<00:01:37.990> or<00:01:38.990> it's<00:01:39.409> buried<00:01:39.859> and<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:41.630> makes<00:01:41.959> it

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
or or it's buried and that makes it

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.949 
or or it's buried and that makes it
squeeze<00:01:43.369> together<00:01:43.880> more<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.569> starts<00:01:44.899> to

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
squeeze together more and starts to

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.050 
squeeze together more and starts to
change<00:01:45.169> the<00:01:45.409> mineral<00:01:45.770> structure<00:01:46.069> if<00:01:46.819> you<00:01:46.909> get

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
change the mineral structure if you get

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.330 
change the mineral structure if you get
something<00:01:47.419> that<00:01:47.569> is<00:01:47.599> harder<00:01:48.169> more<00:01:48.709> cohesive

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
something that is harder more cohesive

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.580

name<00:01:51.859> another<00:01:52.179> really<00:01:53.179> cool<00:01:53.389> rock<00:01:54.109> down<00:01:54.439> here

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
name another really cool rock down here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.169 
name another really cool rock down here
is<00:01:54.859> this<00:01:55.069> big<00:01:55.549> honkin<00:01:56.359> fella<00:01:57.609> which<00:01:58.609> looks<00:01:59.119> to

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
is this big honkin fella which looks to

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.289 
is this big honkin fella which looks to
me<00:01:59.359> to<00:01:59.389> be<00:01:59.509> basically<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.560> big<00:02:01.130> chunk<00:02:01.609> of<00:02:01.789> quartz

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
me to be basically a big chunk of quartz

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.409 
me to be basically a big chunk of quartz
and<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.709> typically<00:02:04.459> something<00:02:05.299> that's

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:05.419 
and that is typically something that's

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.359 
and that is typically something that's
going<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.599> come<00:02:05.810> from<00:02:05.840> superheated<00:02:06.709> fluids
