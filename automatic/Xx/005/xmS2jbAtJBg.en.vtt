00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.779 
grabbing the bow too tight it's
definitely<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> cause<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.079> screech

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
definitely going to cause a screech

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
I should I see that you do this like

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.690 
I should I see that you do this like
that<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:07.350> our<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> weight<00:02:08.550> in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that to kind of as our like a weight in

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.150 
that to kind of as our like a weight in
the<00:02:08.729> back<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.479> guide<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.869> bow<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the back to guide the bow so like the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.670 
the back to guide the bow so like the
pinky<00:02:11.610> stiff<00:02:11.940> peak

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
pinky stiff peak

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.459 
pinky stiff peak
straight<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.219> find<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.329> lot<00:02:14.599> with<00:02:15.049> students

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.469 
straight I find that a lot with students

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.149 
straight I find that a lot with students
that<00:02:15.739> they're<00:02:16.599> very<00:02:17.599> very<00:02:17.780> tense<00:02:18.379> right<00:02:18.680> here

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
that they're very very tense right here

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.929 
that they're very very tense right here
so<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.209> bow<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.920> really<00:02:21.920> tense<00:02:22.489> like<00:02:22.700> this

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
so the bow is really tense like this

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.369 
so the bow is really tense like this
that's<00:02:23.359> what<00:02:23.510> causes<00:02:23.689> that<00:02:23.870> sound<00:02:24.109> we<00:02:24.230> just

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
that's what causes that sound we just

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.410 
that's what causes that sound we just
talked<00:02:24.500> about<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:25.909> can<00:02:26.030> try<00:02:26.209> to<00:02:26.269> keep

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
talked about so if you can try to keep

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.110 
talked about so if you can try to keep
your<00:02:26.540> pinkie<00:02:26.900> curved<00:02:27.609> that's<00:02:28.609> a<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:29.000> good

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
your pinkie curved that's a really good

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.830 
your pinkie curved that's a really good
thing<00:02:29.359> to<00:02:29.389> do<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:32.480> think<00:02:32.599> about

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
thing to do that and just think about

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.869 
thing to do that and just think about
just<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.139> pinkie<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:33.799> barely<00:02:34.310> resting

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.839 
want the pinky to be here and later on
to<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.500> want<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.769> be<00:03:00.859> there<00:03:01.010> because<00:03:01.129> of<00:03:01.579> what

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
to we want to be there because of what

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.190 
to we want to be there because of what
we<00:03:02.030> do<00:03:02.120> at<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.329> Frog<00:03:02.540> don't<00:03:02.870> worry<00:03:02.989> about<00:03:03.079> why

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
we do at the Frog don't worry about why

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.780 
we do at the Frog don't worry about why
you<00:03:03.260> said<00:03:03.500> they're<00:03:03.650> low

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
you said they're low

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.199 
you said they're low
so<00:03:05.299> basically<00:03:05.689> bowl<00:03:06.639> tension<00:03:07.639> bow<00:03:08.030> grip

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
so basically bowl tension bow grip

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.449 
so basically bowl tension bow grip
tension<00:03:08.569> is<00:03:08.689> the<00:03:09.049> number<00:03:09.319> one<00:03:09.500> thing<00:03:10.219> that

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
tension is the number one thing that

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.170 
tension is the number one thing that
causes<00:03:10.639> bad<00:03:11.569> sounds<00:03:11.959> for<00:03:12.590> sure<00:03:12.939> okay

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
causes bad sounds for sure okay

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.199 
causes bad sounds for sure okay
next<00:03:15.310> can<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.370> think<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.579> any<00:03:16.729> word<00:03:17.000> would<00:03:17.150> you

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
next can you think of any word would you

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.659 
next can you think of any word would you
like<00:03:17.299> me<00:03:17.449> to<00:03:17.479> continue<00:03:17.690> go<00:03:18.650> for<00:03:18.919> it<00:03:19.010> okay<00:03:19.220> is

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
like me to continue go for it okay is

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.800 
like me to continue go for it okay is
definitely<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.629> arm<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.310> let's<00:03:23.299> say<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.540> have

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
definitely the arm so let's say I have

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.219 
definitely the arm so let's say I have
this<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.199> perfect<00:03:24.500> bow<00:03:25.040> grip<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:26.019> I'm<00:03:27.019> doing

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:27.229 
this the perfect bow grip and I'm doing

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:28.390 
this the perfect bow grip and I'm doing
everything<00:03:27.470> right<00:03:27.769> what<00:03:27.949> we<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.159> talked

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
everything right what we just talked

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.170 
everything right what we just talked
about<00:03:29.109> but<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.979> get<00:03:31.099> back<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.519> forth<00:03:31.790> what<00:03:32.060> I'm

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
about but to get back and forth what I'm

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.309 
about but to get back and forth what I'm
doing<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:32.659> I'm<00:03:32.780> doing<00:03:33.049> this<00:03:33.760> I'm<00:03:34.760> exaggerating

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
doing is I'm doing this I'm exaggerating

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.899 
doing is I'm doing this I'm exaggerating
but<00:03:36.319> I'm<00:03:36.470> basically<00:03:36.650> I'm<00:03:37.010> using<00:03:37.189> the<00:03:37.699> big

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
but I'm basically I'm using the big

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.649 
but I'm basically I'm using the big
muscles<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.569> power<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.560> bow<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:41.120> we<00:03:41.269> that's

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
muscles to power the bow so we that's

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.249 
muscles to power the bow so we that's
going<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:41.989> cause<00:03:42.699> tension<00:03:43.900> basically<00:03:44.900> my<00:03:45.049> arm

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:45.259 
going to cause tension basically my arm

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.740 
going to cause tension basically my arm
is<00:03:45.439> now<00:03:45.889> tensing<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.430> against<00:03:46.669> the<00:03:46.790> bow<00:03:46.939> which

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
is now tensing up against the bow which

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.830 
is now tensing up against the bow which
I<00:03:47.900> can<00:03:48.019> get<00:03:48.169> kind<00:03:48.409> of<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.560> same<00:03:48.739> sound<00:03:49.840> alright

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
I can get kind of the same sound alright

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.569 
I can get kind of the same sound alright
my<00:03:50.989> grip<00:03:51.199> is<00:03:51.319> perfect<00:03:51.739> but<00:03:52.009> now<00:03:52.129> watching<00:03:52.489> my

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
my grip is perfect but now watching my

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
into the claw like this so the number

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.409 
into the claw like this so the number
two<00:04:33.230> biggest<00:04:33.710> reason<00:04:34.520> for<00:04:34.700> bad<00:04:34.820> sounds<00:04:35.300> that

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
two biggest reason for bad sounds that

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
violent is definitely your arm so we

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.580 
violent is definitely your arm so we
have<00:04:38.360> bow<00:04:38.600> grip<00:04:39.550> wave<00:04:40.550> arm<00:04:40.760> okay<00:04:41.630> number<00:04:42.470> three

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
have bow grip wave arm okay number three

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.560 
have bow grip wave arm okay number three
kind<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.220> relates<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.090> what<00:04:44.210> we<00:04:44.270> talked<00:04:44.450> about
