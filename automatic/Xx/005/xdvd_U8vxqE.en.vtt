00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to all I a little 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.080
 presentation of the new wedding anniversary 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.820
 progress 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 so I'll start with the detector 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.690
 here the impoundment of voters is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.690
 done here on the side of a switch 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.609
 here you have the button b which you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.219
 adjusts volume 1 with seven 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.309
 levels whose silence mode your 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.309
 silence 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.350
 here you have the button t that you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 allows you to adjust the tone with seven 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:51.059
 levels also you have the touch in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:57.030
 sensibilities that touch her with four 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:06.780
 levels so a low sensitivity beep 4 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:09.090
 beep strong sensitivity 4a loud 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 sensitivity you have the touch 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.540
 activation night watch this is the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.430
 touch m 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.560
 so you press it for three 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.619
 seconds and here you will have a small 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.090
 led facing him but here you are 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.330
 can increase the intensity of this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.869
 led by pressing the fn key with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.869
 four different levels 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 here 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.350
 for my part it will always be very good 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.250
 to avoid worse consumption 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.070
 you have a plug of accessories 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.070
 bright which is here on the sides 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.210
 so that's theories are sold 100% 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.110
 watertight 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.719
 they are powered by a battery their 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.750
 angular stop which is here on 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.759
 the back then just need to type 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.829
 he via a specific ringtone on them 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.000
 return keys ie on the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.619
 departures before she is is not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.829
 back two tones of sounds 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.829
 different 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.450
 there is an internal memory in 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.400
 the device that allows precisely 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.150
 when you were only keeping the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.930
 volume tone and sensitivity settings 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.879
 against by at the standby 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.830
 night activation is required 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.830
 monfette in manual 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.430
 also detect it at the signal also if 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.640
 you have used batteries 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.870
 she signals it to you with beeps 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.180
 that's about the detector 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.910
 then at the plant 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:05.980
 so getting started is happening here 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:08.370
 on the side here so you have a 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.200
 desired touch also with seven levels 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:21.810
 including in silent mode turn on 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:26.370
 the detectors here you added 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.370
 that allows you to dream the tone 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.860
 you have a touch to memories that 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.360
 allows you to call back the signal 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.950
 last signal received ie 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.600
 if it is necessary to know which is the detector 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.210
 who lived last call you 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.220
 just touch and hand me you 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.060
 tell her that she sahabi readers 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:55.090
 year you have the vibrate mode 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.730
 so vd who so if you operate this 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.290
 vibrate mode you do not have books 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.850
 that is, it's either the sound or 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.320
 either will say so but not both in his 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.970
 purpose you also have a witness of 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.660
 low voltage that is to say that the 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.640
 central be piped 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.340
 if milk patrice we start to 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.470
 so tired the reception distance 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.800
 and variables on an open area the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:26.190
 250 m then you have the touch s 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.760
 here above the device that 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.270
 allows you to re-encode the detectors 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.100
 with the central so I tried 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.900
 frankly it's very well explained to 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.260
 level of the instructions and it works 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.260
 perfectly 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.730
 so the feeding is also done 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.010
 in the arena so you dismount our 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.770
 belt clip here that's it 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.900
 and there you can access but since the 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:00.150
 long he wanders of volts also like 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.670
 on the detectors I will make you 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.550
 a little demonstration between the 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:16.680
 detector and the central to see the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:19.850
 reactivate quickly and cut them I loved the 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.850
 detector big month of silence 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:33.779
 so here's what also see him 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.339
 there is a different sound on the 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:42.360
 keys pavant and back also on 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:45.979
 the central I am now going to you 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.979
 show box as presented 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:56.779
 here is the box 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.700
 with the user manual 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.150
 I am after this little video you 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.690
 will be helpful and wish you a good 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.690
 day to all
