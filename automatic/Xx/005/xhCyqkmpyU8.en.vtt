they're<00:05:06.540> very<00:05:06.870> very<00:05:07.139> similar<00:05:07.470> they<00:05:07.740> could

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
they're very very similar they could

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.230 
they're very very similar they could
have<00:05:08.010> used<00:05:08.220> something<00:05:08.669> a<00:05:08.910> little<00:05:09.060> bit

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
have used something a little bit

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.390 
have used something a little bit
different<00:05:09.630> and<00:05:09.810> then<00:05:10.410> these<00:05:10.650> are<00:05:10.710> pigmented

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
different and then these are pigmented

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.070 
different and then these are pigmented
when<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.180> apply<00:05:12.419> them<00:05:12.630> with<00:05:12.750> your<00:05:12.870> fingers

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
when you apply them with your fingers

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.920 
when you apply them with your fingers
but<00:05:14.010> with<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.220> brush<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.850> need<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.330> pack<00:05:15.630> them

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
but with a brush you need to pack them

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.920 
but with a brush you need to pack them
on<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.620> little<00:05:17.160> bit<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.729> that's<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.840> only

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
on a little bit so that's the only

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.700 
on a little bit so that's the only
downside<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.860> then<00:05:20.040> these<00:05:20.820> being<00:05:21.150> two<00:05:21.710> very

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
downside and then these being two very

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.920 
downside and then these being two very
similar<00:05:23.100> are<00:05:23.639> kind<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.180> like<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.419> downside<00:05:24.900> for

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930
