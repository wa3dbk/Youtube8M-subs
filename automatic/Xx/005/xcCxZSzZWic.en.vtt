00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
bit and talk about this issue of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.840 
bit and talk about this issue of
so-called<00:01:36.359> vanity<00:01:37.319> sizing<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:38.069> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
so-called vanity sizing because the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.120 
so-called vanity sizing because the
whole<00:01:38.999> idea<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.929> retail<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.679> that<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> reason

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
whole idea in retail is that the reason

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
whole idea in retail is that the reason
why<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:42.509> sizes<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.520> gone<00:01:44.520> hey<00:01:45.329> Walker<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
why these sizes have gone hey Walker is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.840 
why these sizes have gone hey Walker is
because<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.890> something<00:01:47.100> called<00:01:47.249> vanity

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
because of something called vanity

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.539 
because of something called vanity
sizing<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.450> obviously<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.159> average

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
sizing because obviously the average

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.239 
sizing because obviously the average
waistline<00:01:50.999> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.359> United<00:01:51.659> States<00:01:51.840> has

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
waistline in the United States has

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.580 
waistline in the United States has
expanded<00:01:53.249> over<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.969> years<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.289> thinking

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
expanded over the years so the thinking

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.690 
expanded over the years so the thinking
goes<00:01:56.069> that<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:56.759> used<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.389> say<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.499> 14<00:01:59.369> is

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
goes that what used to be say a 14 is

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.830 
goes that what used to be say a 14 is
now<00:02:00.299> closer<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.530> 10<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.999> retailers<00:02:03.630> are

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
now closer to a 10 that retailers are

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.870 
now closer to a 10 that retailers are
essentially<00:02:04.350> flattering<00:02:05.100> women<00:02:05.459> getting

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
essentially flattering women getting

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.330

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
War two and the reason there were more

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.200 
War two and the reason there were more
standardized<00:02:34.260> sizings<00:02:34.950> before<00:02:35.790> World<00:02:36.090> War

two and the retail takeover it's because

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.270 
two and the retail takeover it's because
people<00:02:38.790> used<00:02:39.420> patterns<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.920> patterns

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
people used patterns and the patterns

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.090 
people used patterns and the patterns
were<00:02:41.400> based<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.760> geometric<00:02:43.010> proportions<00:02:44.010> that

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
were based on geometric proportions that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.480 
were based on geometric proportions that
were<00:02:44.310> very<00:02:44.390> concise<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.620> retailing<00:02:47.100> became

king<00:02:47.880> they<00:02:48.480> did<00:02:48.810> away<00:02:49.080> with<00:02:49.110> those

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
king they did away with those

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.310 
king they did away with those
proportional<00:02:50.160> pattern<00:02:50.550> sizes<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.300> favor<00:02:52.140> of

proportional pattern sizes in favor of

their own numerical sizes but the reason

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.110 
their own numerical sizes but the reason
why<00:02:55.470> there's<00:02:55.739> now<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.190> much<00:02:56.310> variation<00:02:56.640> is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
why there's now so much variation is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.500 
why there's now so much variation is
because<00:02:57.390> manufacturers<00:02:58.260> will<00:02:59.250> determine<00:02:59.850> how

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
because manufacturers will determine how

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.990 
because manufacturers will determine how
much<00:03:00.780> fabric<00:03:01.200> they<00:03:01.709> want<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.310> put<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.790> two

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
much fabric they want to put in two

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.720 
much fabric they want to put in two
different<00:03:03.390> sizes<00:03:03.750> based<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:05.130> shipping

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
different sizes based on the shipping

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.640 
different sizes based on the shipping
containers<00:03:06.390> because<00:03:06.630> most<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.140> our<00:03:07.320> clothing

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
containers because most of our clothing

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.449 
containers because most of our clothing
now<00:03:08.250> comes<00:03:08.670> from<00:03:09.230> overseas<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.560> also<00:03:11.190> because

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
now comes from overseas and also because

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.970 
now comes from overseas and also because
they<00:03:11.730> need<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.270> save<00:03:12.540> money<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.650> if

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
they need to save money because if

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.160 
they need to save money because if
retailers<00:03:14.459> are<00:03:15.090> constantly<00:03:15.810> ordering<00:03:16.140> a

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
retailers are constantly ordering a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.530 
retailers are constantly ordering a
bunch<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.470> size<00:03:16.709> tens<00:03:17.160> then<00:03:17.850> they're<00:03:18.060> going<00:03:18.360> to

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
bunch of size tens then they're going to

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.750 
bunch of size tens then they're going to
make<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.380> number<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.920> not<00:03:20.130> make<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
make to that number and not make the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.120 
make to that number and not make the
smaller<00:03:21.060> sizes<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.590> more<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
smaller sizes so it's more of a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.860 
smaller sizes so it's more of a
behind-the-scenes<00:03:23.489> kind<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.390> relationship

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
behind-the-scenes kind of relationship

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470 
behind-the-scenes kind of relationship
that's<00:03:25.019> going<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.380> rather<00:03:25.980> than<00:03:26.370> store<00:03:26.940> X<00:03:27.180> Y<00:03:27.420> or

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
that's going on rather than store X Y or

that's going on rather than store X Y or

Z trying to get you in the door but the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
question that I have initially posed was

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.810 
question that I have initially posed was
what's<00:03:33.480> going<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.900> happen<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:35.040> future<00:03:35.250> how

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
what's going to happen in the future how

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.360 
what's going to happen in the future how
are<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:36.630> going<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.840> find<00:03:37.140> clothes<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.950> fit

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
are we going to find clothes that fit

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.550 
are we going to find clothes that fit
because<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.239> admit<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.380> be<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> very

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
because I admit it can be a very

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.240 
because I admit it can be a very
frustrating<00:03:41.370> process<00:03:42.049> so<00:03:43.049> some<00:03:43.470> malls<00:03:43.799> are

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
frustrating process so some malls are

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.330 
frustrating process so some malls are
starting<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.760> institute<00:03:45.769> kiosks<00:03:46.769> where<00:03:46.890> you

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
starting to institute kiosks where you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.729 
starting to institute kiosks where you
can<00:03:47.489> actually<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.330> get<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.480> full<00:03:48.989> body<00:03:49.560> scan

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.460 
can actually go and get a full body scan
and<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.910> step<00:03:51.239> inside<00:03:51.420> these<00:03:51.780> body<00:03:52.019> scanners
