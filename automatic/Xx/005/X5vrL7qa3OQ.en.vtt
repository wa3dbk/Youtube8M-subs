00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 I say that the stars thank the night, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 because on top of another car they can not look so beautiful. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And I say that it is her fault - from the night - the universe, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 which are the guilty verses that there are nights and stars. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I say that there is no one who grows beyond what is worth 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 -And the fool who does not know is the one who stubs on arrest. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And I say that the one that lends itself to the poison pawn 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 He is double fool and I do not want to be a dancer at his party. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 I say that there is no clearer mood than going naked, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 because when you have a shield then you want the gloves. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 And to the one who says that I can stand under a cassock, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 I fit a caravan of giant feelings. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 I say that there is no more singing than the one that comes out of the jungle 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 and that it will be the one that understands it fruit of the highest tree. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And I say it costs so much and that you have to cross the tundra, 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 but in the end the penumbra becomes the rainbow of the song.
