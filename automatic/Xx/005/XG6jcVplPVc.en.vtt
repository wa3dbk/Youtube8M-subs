of<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.540> record<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.260> kind<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.590> hidden<00:02:26.769> gems

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
of the record of kind of hidden gems

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.860 
of the record of kind of hidden gems
maybe<00:02:27.519> not<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.879> most<00:02:27.909> okay<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:30.299> no<00:02:31.299> no<00:02:31.599> songs

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
maybe not the most okay and no no songs

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.289 
maybe not the most okay and no no songs
but<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:33.010> first<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.610> all<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.730> was<00:02:33.879> hesitant

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
but and first of all I was hesitant

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.880 
but and first of all I was hesitant
thinking<00:02:34.659> no<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.810> always<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.349> write<00:02:35.709> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
thinking no I always like write the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.770 
thinking no I always like write the
songs<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.400> that's<00:02:37.000> part<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
songs and that's part of it but then I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.050 
songs and that's part of it but then I
got<00:02:38.019> kind<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.290> excited<00:02:38.379> about<00:02:38.829> it<00:02:39.010> going<00:02:39.430> you

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
got kind of excited about it going you

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.420 
got kind of excited about it going you
know<00:02:40.209> music<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.049> unique<00:02:41.709> in<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.099> can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
know music is unique in that you can

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.099

revisit<00:02:42.819> what<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.209> felt<00:02:43.480> when<00:02:43.659> you<00:02:43.720> listen<00:02:44.079> to

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
revisit what you felt when you listen to

revisit what you felt when you listen to
a<00:02:44.230> song<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.799> I<00:02:45.040> thought<00:02:45.310> about<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.879> in

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
a song and I thought about that in

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.000 
a song and I thought about that in
relation<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.480> my<00:02:46.599> own<00:02:46.750> life<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.769> songs

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
relation to my own life and the songs

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.190 
relation to my own life and the songs
that<00:02:48.310> have<00:02:48.459> been<00:02:48.879> lifelines<00:02:49.359> to<00:02:49.510> me<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.019> then

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
that have been lifelines to me and then

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.559 
that have been lifelines to me and then
did<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:50.500> feel<00:02:50.709> as<00:02:50.980> well<00:02:51.190> because<00:02:51.400> your<00:02:52.329> solo

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
did you feel as well because your solo

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.420 
did you feel as well because your solo
album<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.109> was<00:02:53.170> critically<00:02:53.769> very<00:02:54.129> well

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
album it was critically very well

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.180 
album it was critically very well
received<00:02:55.000> but<00:02:55.870> commercially<00:02:56.440> perhaps<00:02:56.889> didn't

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
received but commercially perhaps didn't

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.190 
received but commercially perhaps didn't
do<00:02:57.310> as<00:02:57.430> well<00:02:57.700> as<00:02:57.879> you'd<00:02:58.269> hope<00:02:58.480> did<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.810> did<00:02:59.109> that

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
do as well as you'd hope did it did that

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.240 
do as well as you'd hope did it did that
knock<00:02:59.379> you<00:02:59.500> back<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.709> wee<00:02:59.889> bit<00:03:00.069> good

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
confidence-wise it must have been

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.640 
confidence-wise it must have been
different<00:03:01.690> thing<00:03:01.989> right<00:03:02.139> I'm<00:03:02.200> going<00:03:02.319> back<00:03:02.530> in

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the studio I'm doing another one yeah

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.770 
the studio I'm doing another one yeah
and<00:03:04.959> maybe<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:06.129> know<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.579> suppose<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:07.599> was<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
and maybe you know I suppose I was a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.710 
and maybe you know I suppose I was a
little<00:03:08.139> disillusioned<00:03:08.409> but<00:03:09.389> at<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:10.510> same

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
little disillusioned but at the same

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.009 
little disillusioned but at the same
time<00:03:10.989> I<00:03:11.379> still<00:03:11.980> felt<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:13.359> know<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.720> took<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
time I still felt you know I took I

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.690 
time I still felt you know I took I
think<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.409> success<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.069> having<00:03:15.370> made<00:03:15.519> the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
think the success is in having made the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.280 
think the success is in having made the
record<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.420> wrote<00:03:16.629> it<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.049> feel<00:03:17.260> really

happy<00:03:17.650> with<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.280> wouldn't<00:03:18.819> change<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.090> thing

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
together as a band at all I think it's I

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.779 
together as a band at all I think it's I
think<00:04:26.080> it's<00:04:26.349> pretty<00:04:26.650> likely<00:04:26.919> yeah<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.639> know<00:04:27.759> I

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
think it's pretty likely yeah you know I

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.670 
think it's pretty likely yeah you know I
mean<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.479> know<00:04:28.599> we<00:04:28.720> never<00:04:28.840> got<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.139> got<00:04:29.500> a

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
mean this you know we never got a got a

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.159 
mean this you know we never got a got a
chance<00:04:30.009> to<00:04:30.280> kind<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.150> go<00:04:31.360> on<00:04:31.509> our<00:04:31.629> individual

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169

passion<00:04:36.909> for<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.900> music<00:04:37.930> but<00:04:38.530> it's<00:04:38.830> kind<00:04:39.039> of

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
passion for the music but it's kind of

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.559 
passion for the music but it's kind of
good<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.340> everybody's<00:04:39.879> getting<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.389> chance

right<00:04:42.729> now<00:04:42.909> but<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.150> think<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.569> it<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:43.990> it's

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
right now but I think that it is it's

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.839 
right now but I think that it is it's
pretty<00:04:44.620> probable<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.250> will<00:04:45.490> do<00:04:45.639> something

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
pretty probable that will do something

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.300 
pretty probable that will do something
exactly<00:04:46.240> thing<00:04:47.020> anyway<00:04:47.379> so<00:04:47.440> are<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.009> family

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
exactly thing anyway so are you a family

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.980 
exactly thing anyway so are you a family
of<00:04:48.610> achievers<00:04:49.000> where<00:04:49.389> did<00:04:49.569> that<00:04:49.690> come<00:04:49.960> from

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990
