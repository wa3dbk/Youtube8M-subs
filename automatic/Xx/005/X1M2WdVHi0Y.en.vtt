around 50 to 55 degrees depending on

where you live by 7:30 this morning but
lots<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> bright<00:01:17.490> sunshine<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> might

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
lots of bright sunshine so you might

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.969 
lots of bright sunshine so you might
want<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.020> about<00:01:19.170> running<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.710> heater

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
want to think about running that heater

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
want to think about running that heater
instead<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.909> air<00:01:21.060> conditioning<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
instead of that air conditioning what a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
instead of that air conditioning what a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.359 
nice switch the deficit continues at
around<00:01:24.000> 16<00:01:24.450> inches<00:01:24.600> should<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.500> around<00:01:25.920> 40

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
around 16 inches should have around 40
