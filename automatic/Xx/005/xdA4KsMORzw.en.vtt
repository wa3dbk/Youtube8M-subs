my<00:04:19.889> question<00:04:20.310> is<00:04:20.609> is<00:04:20.910> if<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.359> were<00:04:21.539> if<00:04:21.810> it

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
my question is is if you were if it

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.960 
my question is is if you were if it
locks<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.160> in<00:04:23.370> then<00:04:24.830> hmm<00:04:25.830> does<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.340> mean<00:04:26.639> that

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
locks it in then hmm does that mean that

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.180 
locks it in then hmm does that mean that
only<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.270> Rayquaza<00:04:28.080> with<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.530> no<00:04:28.740> air<00:04:28.979> lock

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
only a Rayquaza with that no air lock

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.500 
only a Rayquaza with that no air lock
ability<00:04:29.580> can<00:04:29.910> cancel<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.630> out<00:04:30.800> maybe<00:04:32.510> possibly

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
ability can cancel it out maybe possibly

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.370 
ability can cancel it out maybe possibly
and<00:04:33.810> then<00:04:34.770> if<00:04:34.919> not<00:04:35.220> does<00:04:35.639> this<00:04:35.850> mean<00:04:36.150> that

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
and then if not does this mean that

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.200 
and then if not does this mean that
whenever<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.500> send<00:04:37.740> him<00:04:37.889> out<00:04:38.130> like<00:04:38.699> if<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:38.970> sent

bad<00:05:48.250> here<00:05:48.880> is<00:05:48.970> mega<00:05:49.180> Sharpedo<00:05:49.660> for<00:05:49.870> those<00:05:49.990> that

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
bad here is mega Sharpedo for those that

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.180 
bad here is mega Sharpedo for those that
missed<00:05:50.290> it<00:05:52.229> looking<00:05:53.229> very<00:05:53.500> nice

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
I think mega Sharpedo is going to be one

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.680 
I think mega Sharpedo is going to be one
of<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.830> most<00:05:57.340> overpowered<00:05:58.150> ones<00:05:58.389> he's<00:05:58.540> got

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.310 
tough jobs ability or strong jaws
whatever<00:06:02.889> it<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.100> but<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.940> other<00:06:04.120> thing<00:06:04.510> is<00:06:04.720> is

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
whatever it is but the other thing is is

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.670 
whatever it is but the other thing is is
the<00:06:06.010> fact<00:06:06.280> that<00:06:06.400> he's<00:06:06.760> got<00:06:07.169> out<00:06:08.169> what<00:06:08.440> is<00:06:08.560> it

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
the fact that he's got out what is it

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.980 
the fact that he's got out what is it
he's<00:06:09.040> got<00:06:09.190> speed<00:06:09.639> boosts<00:06:09.880> in<00:06:10.090> his<00:06:10.210> preform<00:06:10.810> as

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
he's got speed boosts in his preform as

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.780 
he's got speed boosts in his preform as
regular<00:06:11.320> Sharpedo<00:06:11.740> so<00:06:12.070> he's<00:06:12.250> got<00:06:12.400> a<00:06:12.430> speed

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
regular Sharpedo so he's got a speed

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.640 
regular Sharpedo so he's got a speed
boost<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.150> then<00:06:13.720> mega<00:06:14.020> evolve<00:06:14.380> so<00:06:14.500> that's

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
boost and then mega evolve so that's

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.129 
boost and then mega evolve so that's
gonna<00:06:14.770> be<00:06:14.860> broken<00:06:15.400> already<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:16.030> then<00:06:16.960> of
