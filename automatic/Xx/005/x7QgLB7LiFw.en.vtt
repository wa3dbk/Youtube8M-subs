00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
was Eric yeah the art design looked

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.160 
was Eric yeah the art design looked
really<00:00:56.969> great<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> mean<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.870> definitely

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
really great I mean there was definitely

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
really great I mean there was definitely
a<00:00:58.230> real<00:00:58.440> sense<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> place<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.239> was

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
a real sense of place and so that was

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.729 
a real sense of place and so that was
that<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.660> good<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> wasn't<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.170> relying<00:01:01.530> on

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
that was good it wasn't just relying on

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
that was good it wasn't just relying on
the<00:01:01.859> tech<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:02.910> fancy<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the tech to be all fancy you know it

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.649 
the tech to be all fancy you know it
actually<00:01:04.790> there<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> means<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.390> an<00:01:06.420> end

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
actually there was a means to an end

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
actually there was a means to an end
here<00:01:06.960> yeah<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.220> progress<00:01:08.640> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
here yeah and then so they progress a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.980 
here yeah and then so they progress a
little<00:01:08.939> further<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.689> came<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
little further then they came to a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.280 
little further then they came to a
breaching<00:01:10.320> segment<00:01:11.070> where<00:01:11.900> but<00:01:12.900> before<00:01:13.200> they

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
breaching segment where but before they

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.960 
breaching segment where but before they
breached<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.799> wasn't<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.250> press<00:01:14.490> X<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
breached it wasn't just like press X to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.660 
breached it wasn't just like press X to
breach<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.750> you're<00:01:15.900> ready<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.500> was<00:01:16.830> call<00:01:17.520> up

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
breach when you're ready it was call up

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
breach when you're ready it was call up
a<00:01:17.790> weapon<00:01:18.030> wheel<00:01:18.360> yeah<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> looks<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.110> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a weapon wheel yeah it looks like you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.600 
a weapon wheel yeah it looks like you
got<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> choose<00:01:19.740> sort<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> weapon<00:01:20.580> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
got to choose sort of the weapon that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
got to choose sort of the weapon that
you<00:01:20.759> wanted<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.479> breach<00:01:21.720> maybe<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you wanted to use to breach maybe the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.980 
you wanted to use to breach maybe the
the<00:01:22.770> stealthiness<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.720> whether<00:01:24.900> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the stealthiness of it whether you

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.660 
the stealthiness of it whether you
wanted<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> breach<00:01:25.560> hard<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.070> breach<00:01:26.250> soft<00:01:26.520> was

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
wanted to breach hard or breach soft was

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.830 
wanted to breach hard or breach soft was
really<00:01:26.850> hard<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.060> tell<00:01:27.299> based<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.780> we

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
really hard to tell based on what we

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.149 
really hard to tell based on what we
were<00:01:27.930> seeing<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.590> maybe<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.920> could<00:01:29.070> have

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
were seeing like maybe you could have

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
were seeing like maybe you could have
chosen<00:01:29.369> an<00:01:29.549> explosive<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.630> something<00:01:30.900> but

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
chosen an explosive or something but

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.929 
chosen an explosive or something but
they<00:01:31.259> chose<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.560> shotgun<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> guy<00:01:32.759> just

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
they chose a shotgun and so the guy just

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.870 
they chose a shotgun and so the guy just
blasted<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> lost<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.320> kicked<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.460> at

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
blasted the lost then kicked it in at

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.090 
blasted the lost then kicked it in at
but<00:01:36.630> he<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.900> clear<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> was

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
but he was clear because then it was

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.249 
but he was clear because then it was
just<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.520> coming<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> Venice

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
just you coming in and in the Venice

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.200 
just you coming in and in the Venice
level<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> typical<00:01:41.159> slow<00:01:41.400> motion<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.090> know

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
level the typical slow motion you know

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.760 
level the typical slow motion you know
whatever<00:01:42.450> we've<00:01:42.750> done<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.020> many<00:01:43.259> times<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
whatever we've done this many times and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.030 
whatever we've done this many times and
games<00:01:44.930> yeah<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.439> leads<00:01:46.740> me<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
games yeah but that which leads me to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.910 
games yeah but that which leads me to
wonder<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.759> know<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:49.680> wasn't<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
wonder you know that was that wasn't a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.050 
wonder you know that was that wasn't a
breach<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.280> were<00:01:50.399> doing<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> breach

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
breach you were doing that was a breach

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
breach you were doing that was a breach
you<00:01:51.210> were<00:01:51.270> sort<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> team<00:01:51.780> doing<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.409> like

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you were sort of team doing so like

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.249 
you were sort of team doing so like
there's<00:01:53.340> squad<00:01:53.820> interaction<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> gameplay

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
there's squad interaction in a gameplay

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.590 
there's squad interaction in a gameplay
way<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.549> did<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:56.820> exist<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.299> metal<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
way that did not exist in metal a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.179 
way that did not exist in metal a
brighter<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.740> indicates

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
brighter and do you think that indicates

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.639 
brighter and do you think that indicates
maybe<00:01:59.460> there<00:01:59.640> will<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.759> some<00:02:00.119> co-op<00:02:00.509> play<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
maybe there will be some co-op play is

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.499 
maybe there will be some co-op play is
that<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.159> possibility<00:02:02.579> maybe<00:02:03.030> we're

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that is that a possibility maybe we're

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.999 
that is that a possibility maybe we're
just<00:02:03.540> throwing<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.170> perhaps

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
just throwing that out there perhaps

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.270 
just throwing that out there perhaps
yeah<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.930> got<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.799> an<00:02:07.920> unmanned

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
yeah and then it got to like an unmanned

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
yeah and then it got to like an unmanned
drone<00:02:08.610> sequence<00:02:09.209> yeah<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:09.720> favorite<00:02:10.080> part

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
drone sequence yeah my favorite part

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.010 
drone sequence yeah my favorite part
easily<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> demo<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:12.330> first<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.870> all

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
easily of the demo because first of all

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.730 
easily of the demo because first of all
when<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
when you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.020 
when you
you're<00:02:13.800> underground<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.550> point<00:02:14.820> where

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
you're underground at the point where

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.110 
you're underground at the point where
where<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.540> start<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.020> sequence<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.580> there

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
where you start that sequence and there

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.450 
where you start that sequence and there
was<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.270> real<00:02:18.840> sense<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:19.590> danger<00:02:19.830> down<00:02:20.190> here

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
was a real sense of danger down here

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.370 
was a real sense of danger down here
because<00:02:20.580> you've<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:21.030> enemies<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.260> know

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
because you've got enemies with you know

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.590 
because you've got enemies with you know
with<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:22.830> lights<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.030> know<00:02:24.240> that

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
with with lights that you know that

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.420 
with with lights that you know that
they're<00:02:24.750> allow<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.140> allows<00:02:25.410> them<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
they're allow it allows them to see and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.920 
they're allow it allows them to see and
that<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.730> identify<00:02:27.000> them<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.690> way<00:02:27.810> but

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
that you can identify them that way but

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.960 
that you can identify them that way but
it<00:02:28.080> looking<00:02:28.350> super<00:02:28.920> creepy<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.340> very<00:02:29.670> dark

you were you were just popping death

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.890 
you were you were just popping death
left<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.850> right<00:02:51.000> when<00:02:51.210> once<00:02:51.630> you've<00:02:51.750> got

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
left and right when once you've got

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.660 
left and right when once you've got
behind<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.620> thing<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.220> agree<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:53.520> you

behind that thing but I agree with you
it<00:02:53.790> seems<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.810> drone<00:02:55.230> was<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.940> didn't

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
it seems like that drone was it didn't

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.330 
it seems like that drone was it didn't
you<00:02:57.990> know<00:02:58.080> obviously<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.620> designed<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> be<00:02:59.250> a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
you know obviously it's designed to be a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.190 
you know obviously it's designed to be a
place<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.760> use<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.910> drone<00:03:00.270> but<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.720> didn't<00:03:00.990> feel

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
place to use a drone but it didn't feel

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.080 
place to use a drone but it didn't feel
as<00:03:01.410> contrived<00:03:01.920> as<00:03:02.310> some<00:03:02.700> other<00:03:02.850> drone

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
as contrived as some other drone

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.030 
as contrived as some other drone
sequence<00:03:03.450> right<00:03:03.540> like<00:03:03.750> you're<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.470> through

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
sequence right like you're going through

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.280 
sequence right like you're going through
rubble<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:05.820> very<00:03:06.090> collapsed<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.870> get

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
rubble and it's very collapsed and get

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.990 
rubble and it's very collapsed and get
the<00:03:07.380> impression<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.770> like<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> person

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the impression that like I a person

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.240 
the impression that like I a person
wouldn't<00:03:09.270> fit<00:03:09.540> through<00:03:09.680> unless<00:03:10.680> what<00:03:10.980> do<00:03:11.160> you

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
wouldn't fit through unless what do you

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
like you're working to control parts of

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.510 
like you're working to control parts of
the<00:05:02.900> globe<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.290> mean<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.620> globe<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:04.100> global

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
the globe I mean the globe the global

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.030 
the globe I mean the globe the global
thing<00:05:04.730> is<00:05:04.940> they're<00:05:05.570> sort<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.050> tag<00:05:06.380> word<00:05:06.710> here

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
thing is they're sort of tag word here

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.620 
thing is they're sort of tag word here
that's<00:05:07.220> true<00:05:07.460> it's<00:05:07.790> like<00:05:07.910> they're<00:05:08.120> globally

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
that's true it's like they're globally

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.860 
that's true it's like they're globally
global<00:05:09.050> where<00:05:09.290> no<00:05:09.680> globe<00:05:09.950> has<00:05:10.190> globe<00:05:10.460> before

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
global where no globe has globe before

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.380 
global where no globe has globe before
so<00:05:11.870> you<00:05:12.320> know<00:05:12.350> I<00:05:12.470> assume<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:14.120> know<00:05:14.210> and<00:05:14.330> this

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
so you know I assume you know and this

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.700 
so you know I assume you know and this
is<00:05:14.510> a<00:05:14.540> big<00:05:14.630> assumption<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.200> maybe<00:05:15.470> there's

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
is a big assumption that maybe there's

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.790 
is a big assumption that maybe there's
this<00:05:15.950> kind<00:05:16.430> of<00:05:16.610> you<00:05:16.910> know<00:05:17.210> persistent<00:05:17.990> globe

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
this kind of you know persistent globe

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.590 
this kind of you know persistent globe
which<00:05:19.040> is<00:05:19.190> underscored<00:05:19.610> by<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.940> giant<00:05:20.390> banner

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
which is underscored by the giant banner

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.870 
which is underscored by the giant banner
above<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.080> south<00:05:21.320> hall<00:05:21.590> which<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:21.890> just<00:05:22.190> every

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
above the south hall which is just every

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.850 
above the south hall which is just every
fled<00:05:23.180> nations<00:05:23.570> flag<00:05:23.840> with<00:05:24.170> those<00:05:24.380> acronyms

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
fled nations flag with those acronyms

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.010 
fled nations flag with those acronyms
underneath<00:05:25.370> so<00:05:25.670> I<00:05:25.880> think<00:05:26.600> we'll<00:05:26.810> be<00:05:26.840> seeing

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
underneath so I think we'll be seeing

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.920 
underneath so I think we'll be seeing
more<00:05:27.140> of<00:05:27.350> that<00:05:27.530> this<00:05:28.010> week<00:05:28.700> here<00:05:29.030> at<00:05:29.120> e3<00:05:29.270> so

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930
