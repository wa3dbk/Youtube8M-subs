this game he has virtually no chance of
winning<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.560> getting<00:00:04.920> out<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.279> group

now flash is expected to win it if you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.529 
now flash is expected to win it if you
were<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.070> get<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.580> mirror<00:00:17.789> out<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.150> 16

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
were to get out in the mirror out of 16

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.750 
were to get out in the mirror out of 16
that<00:00:18.690> will<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.960> an<00:00:19.859> epic<00:00:20.220> failure<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.640> looks

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
that will be an epic failure it looks

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.189 
that will be an epic failure it looks
like<00:00:20.880> couple<00:00:21.180> harbors<00:00:21.510> coming<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:21.990> there

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
like couple harbors coming out there

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.620 
like couple harbors coming out there
probably<00:00:22.890> seek<00:00:23.100> air<00:00:23.340> carriers<00:00:23.880> texting<00:00:24.539> is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
probably seek air carriers texting is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.089 
probably seek air carriers texting is
Justin<00:00:24.930> wanted<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> come<00:00:25.320> harbors<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
Justin wanted to come harbors and the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.400 
Justin wanted to come harbors and the
mix<00:00:26.279> though<00:00:26.689> but<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.779> looks<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.080> flash

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
mix though but it looks like flash

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250 
mix though but it looks like flash
despite<00:00:29.220> losing<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.580> CC<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.779> actually

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
despite losing that CC is actually

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.540 
despite losing that CC is actually
managed<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> push<00:00:31.980> through<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.340> didn't

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
managed to push through that I didn't

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.650 
managed to push through that I didn't
realize<00:00:32.790> he<00:00:32.940> managed<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> push<00:00:33.360> through<00:00:33.510> there

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
realize he managed to push through there

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
realize he managed to push through there
so<00:00:33.750> he<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> take<00:00:34.469> out<00:00:34.820> look<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.000> cow

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
so he is going to take out look like cow

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.790 
so he is going to take out look like cow
was<00:00:36.420> trying<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> set<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.110> bottom<00:00:37.620> left

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
was trying to set up a bottom left

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560 
was trying to set up a bottom left
expansion<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.399> he<00:00:38.460> could<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.760> least<00:00:38.790> or

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
expansion or he could have at least or

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.010 
expansion or he could have at least or
maybe<00:00:39.750> he<00:00:39.870> was<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:41.570> gives<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.629> trying<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> set

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
maybe he was just gives me trying to set

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
maybe he was just gives me trying to set
up<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> blockade<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.980> flash<00:00:44.219> couldn't<00:00:44.579> take

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
up a blockade so the flash couldn't take

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
up a blockade so the flash couldn't take
it<00:00:44.760> because<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.809> he<00:00:45.899> had<00:00:46.020> their<00:00:46.200> apparent

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it because all he had their apparent

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
it because all he had their apparent
there<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> cannon<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.129> gateway<00:00:47.489> yeah<00:00:48.000> look

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
there was a cannon a gateway yeah look

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
there was a cannon a gateway yeah look
at<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.300> PC<00:00:49.050> he's<00:00:49.500> blockaded<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
at this PC he's blockaded that that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
at this PC he's blockaded that that
three<00:00:51.059> o'clock<00:00:51.270> expansion<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> pile

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
three o'clock expansion with just a pile

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.869 
three o'clock expansion with just a pile
on<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> few<00:00:52.860> Canada's<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> keep<00:00:53.610> flash

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
on a few Canada's just to keep flash

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
on a few Canada's just to keep flash
from<00:00:54.059> taking<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.809> pretty<00:00:55.050> that's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
from taking it so that's pretty that's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.500 
from taking it so that's pretty that's
actually<00:00:55.920> pretty<00:00:56.219> clever<00:00:56.430> they're<00:00:56.699> just

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
actually pretty clever they're just

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880 
actually pretty clever they're just
making<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.020> harder<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.350> flash<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
making it so it's harder for flash to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.959 
making it so it's harder for flash to
move<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.309> take<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.579> also<00:00:59.730> he's

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
move in there and take it and also he's

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.310 
move in there and take it and also he's
going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:00.570> flash<00:01:00.809> modes<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.199> there

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
going to know when flash modes in there

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.110 
going to know when flash modes in there
so<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.160> mass<00:01:02.399> carriers<00:01:02.789> pumping

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so now we got the mass carriers pumping

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.969 
so now we got the mass carriers pumping
there<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> his<00:01:03.960> flash<00:01:04.290> gonna<00:01:04.559> figure<00:01:04.890> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
there and his flash gonna figure this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
there and his flash gonna figure this
out<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:05.790> goliaths<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> mix<00:01:06.750> in

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
out and get some goliaths in the mix in

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109 
out and get some goliaths in the mix in
time<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.130> question<00:01:08.549> he's<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.880> three

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
time is the question he's got three

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.690 
time is the question he's got three
bases<00:01:09.740> she's<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.920> enough<00:01:11.130> gas<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.549> can

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bases she's got enough gas they can

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760 
bases she's got enough gas they can
still<00:01:11.909> produce<00:01:12.140> tanks<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.260> glass<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> oh

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
still produce tanks and glass and oh

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.260 
still produce tanks and glass and oh
nice<00:01:14.130> recoil<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.820> top<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> states

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
nice recoil right on top of the states

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
nice recoil right on top of the states
Oh<00:01:15.420> storm<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.900> takes<00:01:16.080> sort<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> takes<00:01:16.890> sort<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
Oh storm it takes sort of takes sort of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
Oh storm it takes sort of takes sort of
the<00:01:17.549> takes<00:01:17.729> sort<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.420> takes<00:01:18.630> or<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the takes sort of it takes or just you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.109 
the takes sort of it takes or just you
can<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.189> storm<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> tanks<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.939> guess

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
can just storm one of the tanks I guess

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.429 
can just storm one of the tanks I guess
instead<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.540> three<00:01:21.689> okay<00:01:21.720> now<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.140> finally

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
instead of three okay now you finally

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.240 
instead of three okay now you finally
get<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> storm<00:01:22.920> off<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.250> cluster<00:01:23.909> tank

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
get the storm off on that cluster tank

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
get the storm off on that cluster tank
anyway<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.869> not<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> most<00:01:28.110> effective<00:01:28.530> recall

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
anyway so not the most effective recall

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
anyway so not the most effective recall
though<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
though but to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.300 
though but to
keeping<00:01:30.960> clash<00:01:31.140> apart<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.100> go

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
keeping clash apart and there we go

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.510 
keeping clash apart and there we go
second<00:01:33.270> second<00:01:34.110> poor<00:01:34.410> going<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.040> there's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
second second poor going up and there's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
second second poor going up and there's
the<00:01:35.730> first<00:01:36.000> carrier<00:01:36.420> popping<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.050> right<00:01:37.350> now

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the first carrier popping out right now

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
the first carrier popping out right now
oh<00:01:37.890> my<00:01:38.130> gosh<00:01:38.370> we're<00:01:38.610> gonna<00:01:38.760> see<00:01:38.940> some<00:01:38.970> carriers

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
oh my gosh we're gonna see some carriers

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.590 
oh my gosh we're gonna see some carriers
and<00:01:39.570> flashes<00:01:40.530> now<00:01:40.680> here's<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.390> Cal<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and flashes now here's the thing Cal is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.560 
and flashes now here's the thing Cal is
only<00:01:42.870> at<00:01:43.140> five<00:01:43.590> bases<00:01:43.980> right<00:01:44.160> now<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> believe

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
only at five bases right now I believe

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.450 
only at five bases right now I believe
and<00:01:45.570> flash<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.350> taking<00:01:46.920> his<00:01:47.040> fourth<00:01:47.280> so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and flash is now taking his fourth so

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.540 
and flash is now taking his fourth so
flash<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> pulling<00:01:48.180> back<00:01:48.390> into<00:01:49.340> an<00:01:50.340> even

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
flash is pulling back into an even

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.740 
flash is pulling back into an even
position<00:01:51.120> economically<00:01:52.970> yeah<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> Cal<00:01:54.390> still

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
position economically yeah a Cal still

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.480 
position economically yeah a Cal still
might<00:01:54.930> take<00:01:55.110> another<00:01:55.290> base<00:01:55.530> sometime<00:01:55.920> but

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
might take another base sometime but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.610 
might take another base sometime but
there's<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.760> only<00:01:56.880> mazes<00:01:57.510> many<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.590> many

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
there's not only mazes many not many

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.450 
there's not only mazes many not many
bases<00:01:59.160> left<00:01:59.370> all<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.700> maps<00:01:59.910> you<00:02:00.090> take<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:02.190> I'm

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
bases left all the maps you take so I'm

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.340 
bases left all the maps you take so I'm
not<00:02:02.580> sure<00:02:02.640> how<00:02:02.840> well<00:02:03.840> he's<00:02:03.960> gonna<00:02:04.050> be<00:02:04.140> able<00:02:04.259> do

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
not sure how well he's gonna be able do

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.570 
not sure how well he's gonna be able do
that<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.560> flash<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.130> pushing<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
that and flash is actually pushing it

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.310 
that and flash is actually pushing it
this<00:02:05.729> nine<00:02:05.940> o'clock<00:02:06.180> position<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.990> he<00:02:07.140> takes

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
Cal lost the nine o'clock expansion so

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.870 
Cal lost the nine o'clock expansion so
basically<00:03:10.990> cow<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.650> betting<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.370> these

and here's the thing as it's interesting

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.890 
and here's the thing as it's interesting
that<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:17.770> actually<00:03:18.190> would<00:03:18.520> be<00:03:18.670> almost<00:03:18.900> better

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
that it actually would be almost better

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.620 
that it actually would be almost better
for<00:03:20.860> Cal<00:03:21.100> if<00:03:21.370> he<00:03:21.520> lost<00:03:21.700> his<00:03:22.030> game<00:03:22.270> in<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> way

for Cal if he lost his game in a way

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.420 
for Cal if he lost his game in a way
because<00:03:23.490> well<00:03:24.810> sort<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:26.280> explain<00:03:27.280> why<00:03:27.400> a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
because well sort of explain why a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.950 
because well sort of explain why a
minute<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.910> minute<00:03:28.120> because<00:03:28.360> flash<00:03:28.720> is

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
minute a minute because flash is

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.900 
minute a minute because flash is
actually<00:03:29.200> now<00:03:29.290> pushing<00:03:29.680> down<00:03:29.830> here<00:03:30.700> towards

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
actually now pushing down here towards

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.550 
actually now pushing down here towards
the<00:03:31.060> right<00:03:31.300> side<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.930> Cal<00:03:32.200> has<00:03:32.350> now<00:03:32.500> taken

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
the right side and Cal has now taken

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.200 
the right side and Cal has now taken
that<00:03:33.010> right<00:03:33.160> side<00:03:33.340> bases<00:03:33.670> cannons<00:03:33.970> were<00:03:34.060> not

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
that right side bases cannons were not

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.030 
that right side bases cannons were not
just<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.600> stop<00:03:35.110> flash<00:03:35.350> from<00:03:35.500> taking<00:03:35.740> it<00:03:35.800> but<00:03:35.890> so

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
just to stop flash from taking it but so

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.290 
just to stop flash from taking it but so
he<00:03:36.130> attained<00:03:36.370> himself<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.790> he<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:36.970> actually

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
are the carriers there's the carrier

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.280 
are the carriers there's the carrier
style<00:03:46.270> he's<00:03:46.420> going<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.600> go<00:03:46.690> after<00:03:46.720> flashes

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
style he's going to go after flashes

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.600 
style he's going to go after flashes
expansions<00:03:47.800> it's<00:03:47.920> not<00:03:48.010> gonna<00:03:48.160> try<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.370> protect

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
expansions it's not gonna try to protect

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.890 
expansions it's not gonna try to protect
his<00:03:48.760> old<00:03:48.880> expansion<00:03:49.330> he's<00:03:49.450> going<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.690> try<00:03:49.870> and

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
his old expansion he's going to try and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.690 
his old expansion he's going to try and
get<00:03:50.140> flash<00:03:50.890> one<00:03:51.100> who's<00:03:51.220> vulnerable<00:03:51.370> because

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
get flash one who's vulnerable because

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.460 
get flash one who's vulnerable because
flashes<00:03:52.180> army<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.600> attacking<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.080> top<00:03:53.260> right

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
flashes army is attacking the top right

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.590 
flashes army is attacking the top right
so<00:03:53.890> he's<00:03:54.070> going<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.310> go<00:03:54.430> after<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.940> vulnerable

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
so he's going to go after the vulnerable

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.280 
so he's going to go after the vulnerable
location<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.260> more<00:03:57.190> flashes<00:03:57.780> where<00:03:58.780> flash<00:03:59.050> is

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
location of more flashes where flash is

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.730 
location of more flashes where flash is
horrible<00:04:00.090> anyway<00:04:01.090> oh<00:04:01.270> yeah<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:01.810> if<00:04:01.960> County

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
horrible anyway oh yeah so if County

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.920 
horrible anyway oh yeah so if County
loses<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.520> game<00:04:03.610> then<00:04:04.270> he<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.570> flash<00:04:04.750> will

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
loses this game then he and a flash will

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.390 
loses this game then he and a flash will
both<00:04:05.080> be<00:04:05.260> 21<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.650> they'll<00:04:05.830> both<00:04:06.070> advanced

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
both be 21 and they'll both advanced

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.550 
both be 21 and they'll both advanced
basically<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.090> then<00:04:07.120> how<00:04:07.870> will<00:04:07.930> actually<00:04:08.410> be

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
basically and then how will actually be

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.910 
basically and then how will actually be
in<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.950> number<00:04:09.220> two<00:04:09.490> spot<00:04:09.520> of<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:11.380> people

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
in the number two spot of the people

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.770 
in the number two spot of the people
advancing<00:04:12.160> from<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.670> group<00:04:12.940> which<00:04:13.540> means

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
advancing from the group which means

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.360 
advancing from the group which means
that<00:04:13.840> he<00:04:14.020> will<00:04:14.050> play<00:04:14.320> whoever<00:04:14.890> advanced<00:04:15.280> in

that he will play whoever advanced in
the<00:04:15.460> first<00:04:15.730> spot<00:04:15.850> of<00:04:16.180> another

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
the first spot of another

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.439 
the first spot of another
which<00:04:17.489> means<00:04:17.669> he'll<00:04:17.909> actually<00:04:18.060> playing

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
which means he'll actually playing

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.800 
which means he'll actually playing
someone<00:04:18.780> who<00:04:18.930> theoretically<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.560> not<00:04:19.709> as<00:04:19.799> good

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
someone who theoretically is not as good

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.999 
someone who theoretically is not as good
so<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:22.019> would<00:04:22.109> could<00:04:22.229> be<00:04:22.289> good<00:04:22.409> from<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.650> in

so that would could be good from it in

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.950 
so that would could be good from it in
one<00:04:23.189> sense<00:04:23.430> but<00:04:23.580> if<00:04:23.699> it<00:04:23.999> also<00:04:24.539> it's<00:04:24.719> better

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.469 
chance to made it made me being a player
on<00:04:55.159> I<00:04:56.159> don't<00:04:57.000> know<00:04:57.060> what<00:04:57.120> I'm<00:04:57.240> talking<00:04:57.330> about

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
on I don't know what I'm talking about

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.480 
on I don't know what I'm talking about
anymore<00:04:57.689> I'm<00:04:58.259> just<00:04:58.289> going<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.680> skip<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:59.009> but

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
anymore I'm just going to skip it but

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.760 
anymore I'm just going to skip it but
point<00:04:59.849> being<00:05:00.139> Cal<00:05:01.139> is<00:05:01.349> actually<00:05:01.500> in<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.740> really

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
point being Cal is actually in a really

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.140 
point being Cal is actually in a really
safe<00:05:02.039> position<00:05:02.219> because<00:05:02.610> he<00:05:02.729> can<00:05:02.879> he<00:05:03.120> can

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
safe position because he can he can

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.200 
safe position because he can he can
advance<00:05:03.949> regardless<00:05:04.949> of<00:05:05.069> what<00:05:05.189> happened<00:05:05.490> to

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.279 

but<00:05:09.210> then<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.449> could<00:05:09.599> be<00:05:09.689> a<00:05:09.719> three-way<00:05:10.080> try

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
but then it could be a three-way try

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.589 
but then it could be a three-way try
again<00:05:10.879> so<00:05:11.879> I<00:05:13.819> just<00:05:14.819> remember<00:05:15.089> that<00:05:15.210> yeah<00:05:15.360> so

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
again so I just remember that yeah so

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:16.760 
again so I just remember that yeah so
high<00:05:15.719> ever<00:05:15.839> took<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:16.080> game<00:05:16.229> actually<00:05:16.409> so<00:05:16.680> if

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
high ever took a game actually so if

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.379 
high ever took a game actually so if
Hiva<00:05:17.009> beat<00:05:17.249> corner<00:05:17.639> never<00:05:17.849> mind<00:05:17.999> if<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.240> would

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
Hiva beat corner never mind if I would

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.600 
Hiva beat corner never mind if I would
be<00:05:18.449> funner<00:05:18.839> than<00:05:18.870> then<00:05:19.379> he'll<00:05:19.620> be<00:05:19.650> 21<00:05:20.069> also<00:05:20.400> and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
be funner than then he'll be 21 also and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.800 
be funner than then he'll be 21 also and
so<00:05:20.699> there's<00:05:20.909> still<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.089> chance<00:05:21.150> that<00:05:21.419> there'd

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
so there's still a chance that there'd

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.019 
so there's still a chance that there'd
be<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:21.960> three-way<00:05:22.319> tie<00:05:22.529> how<00:05:23.430> might<00:05:23.610> actually<00:05:23.789> be

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
be a three-way tie how might actually be

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:25.399 
be a three-way tie how might actually be
in<00:05:24.089> trouble<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.449> nevermind<00:05:24.779> I<00:05:24.990> take<00:05:25.229> it<00:05:25.349> all

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
in trouble so nevermind I take it all

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.260 
in trouble so nevermind I take it all
back<00:05:25.439> Cal<00:05:26.069> needs<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.370> win<00:05:26.490> this<00:05:26.580> game<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.909> here

those uh those interceptors I'm a little
bit<00:06:12.500> surprised<00:06:12.830> to<00:06:12.950> be<00:06:13.010> completely<00:06:13.310> honest

that he switched to carriers that was
kind<00:06:16.610> of<00:06:16.640> a<00:06:17.350> an<00:06:18.350> interesting<00:06:18.830> switch<00:06:19.130> there

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
kind of a an interesting switch there

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.320 
kind of a an interesting switch there
because<00:06:19.610> he<00:06:19.700> had<00:06:19.880> plenty<00:06:20.540> of<00:06:20.690> ground<00:06:20.900> units

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
because he had plenty of ground units

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.760 
because he had plenty of ground units
and<00:06:23.330> he<00:06:23.480> had<00:06:23.600> plenty<00:06:23.780> of<00:06:23.900> gateways<00:06:24.320> and<00:06:24.590> he<00:06:24.680> had

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
plenty of basis to make the ground you

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.020 
plenty of basis to make the ground you
didn't<00:06:27.170> see<00:06:27.290> had<00:06:27.440> harbor<00:06:27.770> city<00:06:28.040> recalls<00:06:28.580> I'm

surprised<00:06:29.450> he<00:06:29.570> didn't<00:06:29.750> just<00:06:29.780> stick<00:06:30.050> with<00:06:30.170> that

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
surprised he didn't just stick with that

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.330 
surprised he didn't just stick with that
tactic<00:06:30.620> maybe<00:06:30.800> he<00:06:30.890> was<00:06:30.980> hoping<00:06:31.100> to<00:06:31.280> catch

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
tactic maybe he was hoping to catch

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.450 
tactic maybe he was hoping to catch
flash<00:06:31.730> off<00:06:31.940> guard<00:06:32.180> with<00:06:32.330> a<00:06:32.390> switch<00:06:32.750> but<00:06:33.740> if<00:06:34.250> so

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
flash off guard with a switch but if so

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.160 
flash off guard with a switch but if so
he<00:06:34.640> should<00:06:35.120> have<00:06:35.210> hidden<00:06:35.390> the<00:06:35.570> hidden<00:06:35.870> azteca

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
he should have hidden the hidden azteca

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.670 
he should have hidden the hidden azteca
with<00:06:36.350> my<00:06:36.590> guess<00:06:36.970> anyway<00:06:37.970> Cal<00:06:38.480> you<00:06:39.230> can<00:06:39.380> see<00:06:39.530> him

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
with my guess anyway Cal you can see him

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.700 
with my guess anyway Cal you can see him
just<00:06:39.980> kind<00:06:40.760> of<00:06:40.820> racking<00:06:41.720> his<00:06:41.840> brain<00:06:42.170> for<00:06:42.440> maybe

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
just kind of racking his brain for maybe

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.860 
just kind of racking his brain for maybe
some<00:06:43.100> possible<00:06:43.730> way<00:06:43.910> of<00:06:43.940> getting<00:06:44.510> back<00:06:44.540> into

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
some possible way of getting back into

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.530 
some possible way of getting back into
this<00:06:45.050> but<00:06:45.380> I<00:06:45.920> think<00:06:46.790> we<00:06:47.120> all<00:06:47.210> know<00:06:47.360> it's<00:06:47.510> not

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
this but I think we all know it's not

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.590 
this but I think we all know it's not
going<00:06:47.720> to<00:06:47.810> happen<00:06:47.870> he<00:06:48.170> has<00:06:48.560> no<00:06:48.650> basis<00:06:49.360> he's<00:06:50.360> cut

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
going to happen he has no basis he's cut

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.510 
going to happen he has no basis he's cut
he's<00:06:51.230> just<00:06:51.440> got<00:06:51.590> a<00:06:51.620> squad<00:06:51.920> of<00:06:51.980> carriers<00:06:52.340> which

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
he's just got a squad of carriers which

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.480 
he's just got a squad of carriers which
which<00:06:52.970> is<00:06:53.090> pretty<00:06:53.240> pretty<00:06:53.750> good<00:06:54.490> dangerous

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
which is pretty pretty good dangerous

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.350 
which is pretty pretty good dangerous
thing<00:06:55.520> b<00:06:56.060> squad<00:06:56.300> of<00:06:56.420> carriers<00:06:56.780> that<00:06:56.810> day<00:06:57.080> but<00:06:57.410> i

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
thing b squad of carriers that day but i

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.250 
thing b squad of carriers that day but i
don't<00:06:59.360> think<00:06:59.480> it's<00:06:59.570> gonna<00:06:59.690> be<00:06:59.750> enough<00:06:59.810> there's

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
don't think it's gonna be enough there's

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.690 
don't think it's gonna be enough there's
so<00:07:00.410> many<00:07:00.470> collapse<00:07:00.980> on<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:01.160> ground<00:07:01.370> and<00:07:01.520> flash

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
so many collapse on the ground and flash

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.670 
so many collapse on the ground and flash
still<00:07:01.940> has<00:07:02.060> income<00:07:02.390> so<00:07:02.630> he's<00:07:02.810> able<00:07:03.350> to<00:07:03.530> produce

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
still has income so he's able to produce

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.200 
still has income so he's able to produce
more<00:07:03.890> units<00:07:04.190> oh<00:07:04.250> yeah<00:07:04.400> now<00:07:04.550> flash<00:07:04.820> is<00:07:05.000> almost

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
more units oh yeah now flash is almost

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.250 
more units oh yeah now flash is almost
maxed<00:07:05.450> out<00:07:06.190> so<00:07:07.190> he<00:07:07.640> is<00:07:07.760> gonna<00:07:07.910> be<00:07:08.060> a<00:07:08.230> ton<00:07:09.230> of

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
maxed out so he is gonna be a ton of

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.500 
maxed out so he is gonna be a ton of
goliaths<00:07:09.920> everywhere<00:07:10.580> and<00:07:11.240> he<00:07:11.330> knows<00:07:11.480> that

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
goliaths everywhere and he knows that

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.790 
goliaths everywhere and he knows that
all<00:07:11.750> he<00:07:11.810> has<00:07:11.900> to<00:07:11.930> do<00:07:12.110> at<00:07:12.260> this<00:07:12.350> point<00:07:12.440> is<00:07:12.680> to

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
all he has to do at this point is to

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.920 
all he has to do at this point is to
starve<00:07:13.300> Calot<00:07:14.300> he<00:07:14.390> doesn't<00:07:14.630> really<00:07:14.720> have<00:07:14.810> to

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
starve Calot he doesn't really have to

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.999 
starve Calot he doesn't really have to
do<00:07:15.110> anything<00:07:15.140> else<00:07:15.820> right

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.009 
do anything else right

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:18.859 
do anything else right
but<00:07:17.759> that<00:07:17.909> is<00:07:18.059> pretty<00:07:18.240> hardcore<00:07:18.569> though

00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:18.869 
but that is pretty hardcore though

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:20.390 
but that is pretty hardcore though
that's<00:07:19.080> almost<00:07:19.319> a<00:07:19.469> dozen<00:07:19.650> carriers<00:07:20.129> with<00:07:20.279> ann

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
that's almost a dozen carriers with ann

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.339 
that's almost a dozen carriers with ann
arbor<00:07:20.669> with<00:07:20.819> you<00:07:20.969> guys<00:07:21.180> doesn't<00:07:21.449> hardcore<00:07:22.110> dad

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349 
arbor with you guys doesn't hardcore dad

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:25.159 
arbor with you guys doesn't hardcore dad
squad<00:07:22.710> right<00:07:22.889> there<00:07:23.419> I'm<00:07:24.419> really<00:07:24.659> surprised

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169 
squad right there I'm really surprised

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.320 
squad right there I'm really surprised
that<00:07:25.319> Cal<00:07:25.860> is<00:07:25.889> would<00:07:26.219> be<00:07:26.879> more<00:07:27.089> aggressive

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
that Cal is would be more aggressive

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.959 
that Cal is would be more aggressive
with<00:07:27.629> them<00:07:27.779> like<00:07:27.960> maybe<00:07:28.589> swinging<00:07:29.550> around<00:07:29.729> the

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:29.969 
with them like maybe swinging around the

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:31.489 
with them like maybe swinging around the
back<00:07:30.149> or<00:07:30.719> I<00:07:30.779> guess<00:07:30.930> he's<00:07:31.080> afraid<00:07:31.289> of<00:07:31.379> a

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:31.499 
back or I guess he's afraid of a

00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:33.829 
back or I guess he's afraid of a
counter-attack<00:07:32.039> maybe<00:07:32.279> but<00:07:32.580> he<00:07:33.449> could<00:07:33.599> swing

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:33.839 
counter-attack maybe but he could swing

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:35.809 
counter-attack maybe but he could swing
around<00:07:33.899> the<00:07:34.080> back<00:07:34.289> and<00:07:34.469> an<00:07:34.979> attack<00:07:35.339> flashes

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 
around the back and an attack flashes

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:38.359 
around the back and an attack flashes
main<00:07:36.089> its<00:07:36.869> type<00:07:37.139> some<00:07:37.379> some<00:07:37.889> tech<00:07:38.039> building

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:38.369 
main its type some some tech building

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:40.429 
main its type some some tech building
something<00:07:38.729> like<00:07:38.909> that<00:07:39.119> oh<00:07:39.330> this<00:07:39.779> is<00:07:39.930> distance

00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:40.439 
something like that oh this is distance

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:43.070 
something like that oh this is distance
mining<00:07:40.879> this<00:07:41.879> is<00:07:42.029> mining<00:07:42.360> that<00:07:42.479> third<00:07:42.659> base<00:07:42.869> i

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
mining this is mining that third base i

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.149 
mining this is mining that third base i
think<00:07:43.289> i'm<00:07:43.469> just<00:07:43.589> trying<00:07:43.889> to<00:07:43.919> use<00:07:44.039> this

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:44.159 
think i'm just trying to use this
