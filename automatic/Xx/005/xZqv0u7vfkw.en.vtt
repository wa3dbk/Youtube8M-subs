00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
so you have a turn tracker to mark that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.379 
so you have a turn tracker to mark that
and<00:01:53.200> each<00:01:54.200> each<00:01:54.799> round<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.670> divided<00:01:56.149> into<00:01:56.299> a

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
and each each round is divided into a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:57.669 
and each each round is divided into a
number<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.719> phases<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.200> first<00:01:57.349> phase<00:01:57.529> is

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
number of phases the first phase is

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.919 
number of phases the first phase is
really<00:01:58.159> easy<00:01:58.279> you<00:01:58.429> set<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.999> border<00:01:59.299> right<00:01:59.749> so

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
really easy you set the border right so

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.559 
really easy you set the border right so
we<00:02:00.109> will<00:02:00.229> deal<00:02:00.469> certain<00:02:01.039> cards<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:02.149> certain

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
we will deal certain cards to certain

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.570 
we will deal certain cards to certain
places<00:02:02.719> depending<00:02:03.169> on

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
places depending on

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.060 
places depending on
we're<00:02:04.850> in<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.090> game<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.960> property<00:02:06.620> cards<00:02:06.950> for

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
we're in the game the property cards for

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.800 
we're in the game the property cards for
example<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.940> game<00:02:08.119> starts<00:02:08.540> off<00:02:08.630> with

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
example the game starts off with

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.570 
example the game starts off with
properties<00:02:09.290> /<00:02:09.440> means<00:02:09.680> the<00:02:09.830> game<00:02:10.009> right<00:02:10.430> you

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
properties / means the game right you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
properties / means the game right you
can<00:02:10.670> late<00:02:10.880> around<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.480> deal<00:02:11.630> different<00:02:12.080> cards

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
can late around we deal different cards

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.520 
can late around we deal different cards
to<00:02:12.620> these<00:02:12.740> spaces<00:02:13.070> ok<00:02:13.610> ok<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.180> we<00:02:14.570> deal<00:02:14.780> some

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
to these spaces ok ok so we deal some

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
laptop on the board to say yeah it tells

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.330 
laptop on the board to say yeah it tells
you<00:02:17.720> what's<00:02:17.900> there<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.290> that's<00:02:18.650> phase<00:02:18.890> 1<00:02:19.130> we've

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
you what's there so that's phase 1 we've

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.000 
you what's there so that's phase 1 we've
set<00:02:19.550> up<00:02:19.580> space<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.660> each<00:02:21.200> player<00:02:21.590> gets<00:02:21.620> to

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
right how many messengers they're going

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.980 
right how many messengers they're going
to<00:02:34.160> get<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.370> place<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.910> next<00:02:35.120> worker

the turn order for the next part of the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.810 
the turn order for the next part of the
game<00:02:44.810> ok<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:45.560> with<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.070> player<00:02:46.280> going<00:02:46.610> here

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
game ok so with the player going here

game ok so with the player going here
this<00:02:47.240> space<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.540> weaker<00:02:48.080> but<00:02:48.470> they<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:48.800> get

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
this space is weaker but they will get

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.340 
this space is weaker but they will get
to<00:02:49.130> place<00:02:49.340> first<00:02:49.610> practice<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.570> that's<00:02:51.200> that

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
to place first practice so that's that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.930 
to place first practice so that's that
phase<00:02:51.620> done<00:02:51.830> really<00:02:52.220> quickly<00:02:52.430> place<00:02:52.760> your

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
phase done really quickly place your

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.800 
phase done really quickly place your
worker<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.720> place<00:02:53.900> your<00:02:54.050> advisor<00:02:54.709> draw<00:02:55.220> cards

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
worker you place your advisor draw cards

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.030 
worker you place your advisor draw cards
the<00:02:56.810> next<00:02:57.080> thing<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.320> do<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.650> place<00:02:57.860> these

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the next thing you do if you place these

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.470 
the next thing you do if you place these
messages<00:02:58.550> it's<00:02:58.730> either<00:02:58.880> one<00:02:59.120> or<00:02:59.150> two

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
messages it's either one or two

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.510 
messages it's either one or two
depending<00:02:59.930> on<00:03:00.050> which<00:03:00.200> space<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.590> went<00:03:00.770> on<00:03:00.950> and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
depending on which space you went on and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.980 
depending on which space you went on and
the<00:03:01.550> messengers<00:03:02.060> are<00:03:02.180> placed<00:03:02.420> on<00:03:02.570> any<00:03:02.840> of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
the messengers are placed on any of

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.630 
the messengers are placed on any of
these<00:03:03.140> circular<00:03:03.800> spaces<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> board

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
these circular spaces on the board

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.880 
these circular spaces on the board
remember<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.540> complete<00:03:05.930> prototype<00:03:06.530> so

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
remember this is a complete prototype so

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.920 
remember this is a complete prototype so
even<00:03:07.160> though<00:03:07.190> there<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.490> artwork<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:08.090> this

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
even though there is artwork here this

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.360 
even though there is artwork here this
is<00:03:09.050> this<00:03:09.290> isn't<00:03:09.709> one<00:03:09.800> of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.160> type<00:03:10.340> of

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
is this isn't one of the type of

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.180 
is this isn't one of the type of
contemporary<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:12.350> turn<00:03:12.650> order<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.040> will

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
contemporary so in turn order you will

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.940 
contemporary so in turn order you will
place<00:03:13.670> your<00:03:13.700> piece<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.090> pick<00:03:14.510> your<00:03:14.720> card<00:03:14.959> ok

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
place your piece and pick your card ok

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.100 
place your piece and pick your card ok
and<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.160> goes<00:03:16.370> into<00:03:16.580> your<00:03:16.760> hand<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.750> next

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
and that goes into your hand the next

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.810 
and that goes into your hand the next
phase<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.530> game<00:03:18.560> is<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:18.950> actions<00:03:19.400> face<00:03:19.640> of

phase of the game is the actions face of

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.640 
phase of the game is the actions face of
the<00:03:19.910> game<00:03:20.060> which<00:03:20.420> multiple<00:03:20.989> players<00:03:21.290> have<00:03:21.530> got

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
the game which multiple players have got

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.259 
the game which multiple players have got
used<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> game<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.519> nobody<00:03:22.910> treats
