00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.060
 good morning everyone risks 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.940
 however to go to the Serbian subjects 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.890
 such as 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.930
 I will not be the highest version 65 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.340
 ok 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.230
 it starts now 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.790
 as soon as you open you will also find your own from 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.600
 this solid will think its own 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.040
 transformation 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.619
 first thing you are precisely a 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.160
 level 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.850
 it is not enough 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.300
 we have to move it with respect to the zcs axis 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.300
 height 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.440
 thing 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.440
 Now 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 by clicking the s button this is for stage 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.870
 that is, scale 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 and the z button I am going to indicate the axis 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.650
 resize the cube height by 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.490
 this name 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.970
 now always click the sdk key once 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.100
 historians not 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.490
 that as for you just reduce or 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.250
 enlarge a solid with respect to the axis 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.250
 now let's do a little long like this 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.680
 now we have to resize the figure 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.720
 respected the six handed recall s 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.900
 and then hicks 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.380
 we have to give the high length to him 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.380
 so let's do this number 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.690
 let us give 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.000
 here we want that 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.630
 we can do 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 sync is perfectly alike we click 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.560
 more then this to the context and then where 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.850
 you say and sky 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.409
 that is 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.090
 and the bar here must be a lot 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:05.159
 and let's put the precise dimensions 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.159
 all 24 binds 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.650
 0 92 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.000
 and so 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.540
 a parallelepiped 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.980
 the y axes 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.099
 helix perfectly 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.099
 Uruguay 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:28.120
 and arrived I do not start making lamberto 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.120
 and to do this I call myself top 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.350
 move the thickness 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.350
 practical 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.550
 because they have taboos so it would be steps for 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.110
 she May 20 and we click on mind 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:50.180
 he felt in the not even and to the left 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.990
 you definitely don't go south of valid ones 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.840
 several times 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:01.220
 we click black faces on nurseries several times 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.220
 it's so good 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.989
 where is I going to the corner I say 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.989
 this we select the faces 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.340
 which was like this from the corner 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.060
 this but this like this 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.060
 and will be 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.700
 right key 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.700
 we select the most select 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.950
 the surface and then first golfers 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.430
 make ahead selection 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.430
 in this number 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.530
 now, once done, my name is text is 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.360
 ie ex trillo 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:48.480
 let's begin 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:50.420
 we begin to extend the four years 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.420
 in this way they will be perfectly 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.420
 precise 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.830
 now we return to the cross for a world 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.320
 much hotter 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.750
 here we have created him if then 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.840
 we want to change the size 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.090
 square s 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.810
 az 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:20.880
 and a spx piece 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.880
 sey width 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.750
 in this way recapping first 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
 what we have of 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:34.390
 certainly not the cube then we heard the 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.390
 faces and third what we have 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.020
 we have 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.930
 and arrived I do so 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.310
 from tablets 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.560
 in the same place as we can 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.560
 then create a chair too 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.990
 project 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.549
 the 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.169
 so there were no cubes 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.960
 always in the same way 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.560
 divide the faces 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.120
 we could have said very hard with 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.930
 partition 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.900
 it is not there 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.370
 and then 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.910
 let 's do the studies 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.910
 coat 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.849
 I speak however more here 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.070
 we must select 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.650
 first accept this edge 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.340
 in this way and we do that to him 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.340
 study 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.590
 he was already inside 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:53.330
 now we have to shell out 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.740
 a model heart let's go 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.950
 the lateral head 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.990
 and we click 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:04.000
 change today 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.000
 we have defended well 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.860
 rather 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.340
 this way 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.790
 we have been a modern ie 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.430
 we have 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.830
 on the model wine bottles 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:25.420
 there are different types of burns 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.060
 this is not the classic we can 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:31.419
 that may seem 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:38.009
 what rubbish is coming to me 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:41.230
 always grants defined 30 and is also 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:46.910
 in fact the difference between us goes into it 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:48.960
 then I return to the state 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.610
 report 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.610
 the chair without is saturated 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.110
 the child tutorial adds the same 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.710
 I hope it would have been useful to 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.710
 next
