00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.370
 Matthew Chapter 3 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.370
 the parable of June 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.899
 the kingdom of the heavens is similar to the moment 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.999
 who sowed good seed in his field 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.880
 but while the men slept his ugly enemy 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 sowed a jewel name of wheat and retain talent 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.759
 when the aksel herb and produced fruits 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.060
 appeared also in June 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.710
 Then I came from the servants of the master of the house. 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.480
 do not sow good seed in your field 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.790
 where does the chai come from? 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.730
 he answered 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490
 an enemy did this 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.940
 born you asked me 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.720
 May they go and start June. 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.480
 he did not reply that by separating the weeds and did not start staden with 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 electric 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 let it grow together until the harvest 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.960
 and at harvest time without any effects 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.840
 to join on June 1st 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.770
 apparent bundles to be burned 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.060
 but the wheat 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.460
 gathering 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.940
 milkman 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.760
 gave up success 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.160
 he who sows good seed is the son of man. 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.500
 the field is the world 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.650
 the good seed are the sons of the king 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.630
 the tares 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.030
 they are the children of the evil one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.280
 the enemy wants to be mine is the devil 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.770
 so was the consummation of the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.090
 effects are the angels 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.700
 as well as a judge and colÃ­der thrown into the fire 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 so it will be at the end of the century 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.940
 to send the son of man in his annexes, which shall add to his kingdom all the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.940
 scandals and those who practice lawlessness 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.770
 and cast them into the furnace 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.950
 patience 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.720
 there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth then 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.560
 the righteous shines shall begin 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200
 in his father's kingdom 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.580
 who has ears to hear
