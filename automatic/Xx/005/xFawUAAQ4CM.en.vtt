00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170

probably one of the few games I owned

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.750 
probably one of the few games I owned
and<00:02:57.350> could<00:02:57.470> actually<00:02:57.769> grasp<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.160> concept<00:02:58.609> of

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
and could actually grasp the concept of

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.420 
and could actually grasp the concept of
pretty<00:02:59.030> easily<00:02:59.530> drive<00:03:00.530> forward<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.100> don't

the<00:03:04.040> game<00:03:04.190> also<00:03:04.340> gives<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.790> lead<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.150> time

the game also gives you a lead in time
of<00:03:05.630> about<00:03:05.840> 90<00:03:06.170> seconds<00:03:06.560> where<00:03:06.829> you<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.069> die<00:03:07.220> as

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
of about 90 seconds where you can die as

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
many times as you want but I think the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.860 
many times as you want but I think the
thing<00:03:10.250> I<00:03:10.370> remember<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.819> best<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.630> Peter

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
thing I remember the best is the Peter

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.750 
thing I remember the best is the Peter
Gunn<00:03:12.109> theme<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.650> place<00:03:13.160> throughout<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.579> game

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760

the<00:03:14.600> developers<00:03:15.079> wanted<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.380> use<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> James

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
the developers wanted to use the James

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.170 
the developers wanted to use the James
Bond<00:03:16.100> theme<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.639> I<00:03:16.670> think<00:03:16.880> some<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
Bond theme and I think some of the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.059 
Bond theme and I think some of the
earliest<00:03:17.569> versions<00:03:17.900> actually<00:03:18.200> used<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.620> but

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
earliest versions actually used it but

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.009 
earliest versions actually used it but
due<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.370> rights<00:03:19.549> issues<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.209> got<00:03:20.359> switched<00:03:20.630> and

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
due to rights issues it got switched and

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.809 
due to rights issues it got switched and
now<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.410> my<00:03:21.560> head<00:03:21.769> it's<00:03:21.950> always<00:03:22.310> what<00:03:22.459> comes<00:03:22.670> to

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
now in my head it's always what comes to

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.660 
now in my head it's always what comes to
mind<00:03:23.030> when<00:03:23.269> they<00:03:23.359> think<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.660> Spy<00:03:23.900> Hunter<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.949 
mind when they think of Spy Hunter the
game's<00:03:25.880> biggest<00:03:26.090> criticism<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
game's biggest criticism is the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.110 
game's biggest criticism is the
collision<00:03:27.440> detection<00:03:27.700> there's<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> fairly

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
collision detection there's a fairly

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.370 
collision detection there's a fairly
well-known<00:03:29.299> glitch<00:03:29.780> where<00:03:30.049> you<00:03:30.109> can<00:03:30.260> actually

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
well-known glitch where you can actually

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.379 
well-known glitch where you can actually
drive<00:03:30.709> on<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:30.980> side<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.400> road<00:03:31.609> through

this and there is no ending to the game
so<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.489> isn't<00:03:40.820> really<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.000> beneficial

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.290 

the<00:03:45.040> setting<00:03:45.340> will<00:03:45.489> change<00:03:45.760> from<00:03:45.909> time<00:03:46.120> to

Spy Hunter another criticism of the game
is<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.620> pretty<00:03:59.769> difficult<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.900> that
