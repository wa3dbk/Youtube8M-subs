 top edius it is a living my opinion of them 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.000
 quite neutral but I wouldn't 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.239
 roads and they process it allowed guna 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.340

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.330
 wanted for several years 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.400
 The next three questions are from sony gulin and 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.620

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.460
 because I have only one body for two 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.320
 letters 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.190
 the second question I will do this review for the whole 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.190
 my collection 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.600
 the next question I will combine with the question from 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.330
 Tatyana and plastinin and girls asks 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.870

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.990

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.660

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.030
 invise beat no i really like not 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.140

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.690
 physics move but why was it in 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.900
 last moment to change his hair, I 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.880
 had such a cool hairstyle done like 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.219
 bang became 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.430
 I personally do not like it at all 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.229
 I understand why they do it but can 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.239
 you can cut it like this 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.260
 that we will wait for normal photos 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:19.440

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:22.900

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.269
 straight into the soul 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.880
 new crate and interesting in terms of ideas 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:36.310
 but I would certainly like to consider more 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.050
 in detail to the word 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.510
 at the moment no one is coming to me 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.710
 packages except for lost 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.780
