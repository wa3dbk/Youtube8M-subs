but without further ado let's go ahead

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.750 
but without further ado let's go ahead
and<00:00:18.869> get<00:00:19.050> started<00:00:19.199> before<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.279> start<00:00:20.609> with<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and get started before we start with the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.580 
and get started before we start with the
mtar<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.810> want<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> say<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> game

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
has only been out five days and a lot of

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.450 
has only been out five days and a lot of
things<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.320> may<00:00:25.500> change<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> gun

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
things can and may change with the gun

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.460 
things can and may change with the gun
but<00:00:26.720> furthermore<00:00:27.720> let's<00:00:28.050> go<00:00:28.199> ahead<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.410> get

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
but furthermore let's go ahead and get

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.080 
but furthermore let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.099> best<00:00:29.310> possible<00:00:29.550> class

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
started with the best possible class

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060 
started with the best possible class
setup<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.109> when<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.859> gun

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
setup so when you first get this gun

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.380 
setup so when you first get this gun
it's<00:00:32.340> definitely<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> seem<00:00:33.180> under

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
it's definitely going to seem under

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420 
it's definitely going to seem under
power<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.290> I've<00:00:34.410> discovered<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.250> just

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
power but I've discovered that you just

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.770 
power but I've discovered that you just
have<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> find<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> right<00:00:35.940> attachments<00:00:36.660> for

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
have to find the right attachments for

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
have to find the right attachments for
this<00:00:36.899> gun<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.829> found<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> red<00:00:38.550> dot

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
this gun and I found that the red dot

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
this gun and I found that the red dot
sight<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> foregrip<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> best<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
sight in the foregrip are the best to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
sight in the foregrip are the best to
possible<00:00:40.920> attachments<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> weapon<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
possible attachments for the weapon I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
possible attachments for the weapon I
choose<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> foregrip<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> gun<00:00:44.190> does

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
choose the foregrip because the gun does

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.639 
choose the foregrip because the gun does
have<00:00:44.550> quite<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> bit<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> kick<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
have quite a bit of kick to it and the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.740 
have quite a bit of kick to it and the
foregrip<00:00:47.010> reduces<00:00:47.520> aim<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:47.940> sight<00:00:48.239> recoil

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
foregrip reduces aim down sight recoil

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.290 
foregrip reduces aim down sight recoil
and<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.559> red<00:00:49.710> dot<00:00:49.920> sight<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.090> iron

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and the red dot sight because the iron

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.000 
and the red dot sight because the iron
sights<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.020> aren't<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> best<00:00:52.469> they<00:00:52.829> don't

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
sights just aren't the best they don't

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
sights just aren't the best they don't
fit<00:00:53.309> me<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.510> think<00:00:54.719> they're<00:00:54.870> quite<00:00:55.020> bulky

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
fit me and I think they're quite bulky

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.260 
fit me and I think they're quite bulky
and<00:00:55.500> take<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> screen<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
and take up a lot of the screen now the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.209 
and take up a lot of the screen now the
guns<00:00:57.539> damage<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.050> quite<00:00:58.199> moderate<00:00:58.649> coming<00:00:59.100> in

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
guns damage is quite moderate coming in

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
guns damage is quite moderate coming in
at<00:00:59.370> 4224<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> rate<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> fire<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.609> 720<00:01:02.609> the

reload time isn't too bad coming in at
about<00:01:05.250> 2.5<00:01:06.090> seconds<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> wanted<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
about 2.5 seconds and if you wanted to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.830 
about 2.5 seconds and if you wanted to
be<00:01:07.979> faster<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.760> always<00:01:08.939> use<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.180> wild<00:01:09.659> card

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
be faster you can always use a wild card

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109 
be faster you can always use a wild card
for<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> third<00:01:10.470> attachment<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.220> apply<00:01:11.760> fast

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
for a third attachment and apply fast

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.820 
for a third attachment and apply fast
mag<00:01:12.420> which<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> equivalent<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.409> sleight<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
mag which is equivalent to sleight of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.980 
mag which is equivalent to sleight of
hand<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.729> always<00:01:15.030> experimenting<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
hand I'm always experimenting with the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.050 
hand I'm always experimenting with the
perks<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.770> first<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.400> lightweight<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
perks but my first one is lightweight so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060 
perks but my first one is lightweight so
I<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.299> run<00:01:18.509> faster<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.530> no<00:01:19.680> falling

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I can run faster and take no falling

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.460 
I can run faster and take no falling
damage<00:01:20.450> toughness<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.049> shot<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
damage toughness so when I get shot I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.200 
damage toughness so when I get shot I
don't<00:01:22.680> flinch<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> side<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
don't flinch as much to the side and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.870 
don't flinch as much to the side and
dexterity<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.710> mantle<00:01:26.009> objects<00:01:26.400> faster

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
dexterity so I can mantle objects faster

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.249
