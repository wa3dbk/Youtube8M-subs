00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.470
 a wage waiver gets busy since ca and I'm for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 euro-bonds is the intention of someone to continue the fireworks season 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.079
 the applause was rewarded at construction site in the nato-rat 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.750
 I think without much ado Pig smiles into the race I have 2 m 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.619
 won if won in the last time and won 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.279
 That's why we're going to burn something right away and look at Ticino 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.239
 When the time is up, the car will be on the Liliane Minor Gate 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.849
 use last place in the earth can be his driving skills and remains of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.760
 Lukas Rupp if use it to stop them around your opponent 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.120
 it's the first episode that was going to do that and DRS and not for the elite race 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.460
 to qualify that we will of course try and maybe 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.670
 she will have already found differences 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.620
 It's also important that I crap that done 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.829
 Ulrich Nußbaum 60 No, of course, you do not have to know it for sure 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.950
 what did his throughout 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.940
 hopefully consistently saving 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.250
 Bieler Platz Directions from Walsdorf frames per second and should now parable 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.220
 Let's stay focused now on that, too, that can be done 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.060
 here it is because of the nets but of a CD in the Yen 42 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.270
 Seconds and that's why it's instant 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.170
 two powerplayers have been scolding around a few people since he's been there 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.580
 paralyzed 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.380
 Lauda certainly goes along well so here's one on the squares 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.640
 in 27 26 and 20 seconds the first opponent eliminated altogether will be 7 GW 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.640
 not said mayor of 6 80 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.650
 you would have known beforehand of Abrashi but obviously would not hope to have civil servants 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.650
 Of course he did not land small and secretly practiced a bit 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.460
 Ambiance even better to cut off Really, the men are massively celebrating the number 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.790
 Zero drove 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.010
 Omar to be a bit in multiplayer on Mondays and that were too 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.440
 see and ladies became the first line Peters has been eliminated 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.510
 excreted 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.140
 Unfortunately, he will not score points for this race 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.210
 fly for it and as far as I know on the corner 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.080
 but from now on just put it on 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.659
 Gilles view from the g 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.150
 noisy with that we are also back 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.950
 pretty successful first 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.439
 and of course I have come the best because it looks the other way round 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.960
 have to come to terms 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.130
 At all, I fell a bit Say it is unbelievable like everyone else 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.779
 single runs 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.399
 because crossed 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.399
 if the partner is up and you need to be able to run them pretty well 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.690
 but you do not actually do that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.559
 but today, despite all this, the race continues to do so 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.309
 dat wier markets probably a bit excited then a bit 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.259
 excited because it is 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.499
 on 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.499
 it is clear that just catch up again 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.229
 BCF even hits a 60 feet and that may be just like that 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.859
 good because we are only third 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.859
 Well the car seems very solid 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.219
 Zelaya was eliminated 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.299
 of course it is annoying for balls but that hits and gets further away from that 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.319
 Result 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.779
 that will work 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:55.489
 Do not speak war themselves, but she successfully took the duty 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.509
 In spite of all that, I am still third 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.969
 been 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.430
 informs the consumer should go directly that the Wendler of 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.379
 day before 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.379
 and we are still trying harder to try the natural one 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:13.759
 to become first 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.859
 because of course we want to be the elite race with Nemo and percent 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.909
 that would not be a consequence without the safest are so it always works 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.659
 not at all 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.659
 you know how to solve the problem 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:29.619
 Lorentzen has been eliminated only two out of two players are left 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.619
 Men that means himself and his family 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.539
 Nakheel and I destroyed myself so it probably was 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:35.849
 I as good as history 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.219
 two shots on goal it comes to first place 8 seconds seconds though 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.610
 I'm the first image of the now if I'm with a first that nothing but 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.499
 pretty cool at the same time 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:49.800
 Eschborn School in Iraq this episode was relaxed again until the end relaxed 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.210
 To the bitter end, you do not just have to look forward to more than 250 bands 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.700
 a renunciation would be together 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.249
 yes my new one was never on the slope to Hindus Foul Dr but Mrs. ab Dr 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.329
 These must also collect for TuS Erich Segal let square foot efficiency 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.909
 I'm in for the next round of the championship 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.059
 Championship on the road in the morning and exaggerated »absolute crap 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.040
 Mastery and we are only born 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.040
 and we went see each other next week again 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.319
 as reported by a double Bob 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.419
 The reader again attracts Löw who in the city center gets stage play and 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:24.689
 19 86 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:25.500
 plan now
