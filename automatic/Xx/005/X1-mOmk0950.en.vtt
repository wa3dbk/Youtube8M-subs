many of your vehicles and all I asked in

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
many of your vehicles and all I asked in
return<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.810> mere<00:00:31.140> 18<00:00:31.380> seconds<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.279> your

too many the second tip has to do with
something<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> may<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.700> seem<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> big

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
something that may not seem like a big

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.270 
something that may not seem like a big
deal<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.960> too<00:01:34.170> often<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> difference

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
deal but all too often is the difference

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
deal but all too often is the difference
between<00:01:35.340> life<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> death<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.049> game<00:01:37.200> of

the<00:02:21.890> direction<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.610> your<00:02:22.910> turret<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.690> facing

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
your vehicle that's the side you will

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.260 
your vehicle that's the side you will
exit<00:02:27.890> on<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.220> likewise<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.970> works<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.239> same

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
exit on and likewise it works the same

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
way on the right this seems like a minor

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.430 
way on the right this seems like a minor
thing<00:02:31.819> but<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.000> often<00:02:32.239> see<00:02:32.600> enemies<00:02:32.810> hop<00:02:33.140> out<00:02:33.319> of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
thing but I often see enemies hop out of

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
where I'm blasting them it makes the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.190 
where I'm blasting them it makes the
kill<00:02:37.070> super<00:02:37.340> easy<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.850> me<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.870> plan<00:02:39.050> ahead

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
and right before you hop out you aim the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.940 
and right before you hop out you aim the
