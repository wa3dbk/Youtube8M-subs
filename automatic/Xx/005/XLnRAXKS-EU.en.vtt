00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.889
 517 days that is almost one and a half years 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.870
 so long is the berlin athletics 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.790
 Club in the domestic post stadium 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 undefeated and that should of course 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.230
 to remain so halfway city 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.750
 Coach Jandová confided in goal 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.640
 again stemkeeper marcel höttecke after 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.769
 its barrier and for the easy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
 injured emre turan came rocco again 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.510
 pond man in the four-chain for use 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 the berlin ak set off like the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.320
 fire department after throwing in from henning 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.690
 Lichte had it right in the first minute 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.090
 then go to the big chance to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.520
 leadership but he does not arrive properly 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 the ball and germania half town 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.079
 they wanted to see what in 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.300
 Berlin goes and then the malik 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 bolivard fits emanuel's reason 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.370
 rocco teichmann attacks the ex-Dortmunder 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.500
 too late to be on sven seitz 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.390
 is actually safe but or not 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.449
 a chip that makes short work of it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.620
 own gate that could only be stupid 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.620
 get called up 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 the only correct answer 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.010
 could only look like that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.200
 Lisa mader is here over the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.380
 good left wing and just care 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.960
 two minutes later for the 1st 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.220
 1-balancing everything back in the lot so that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.850
 was also the area 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.850
 apfelce clubs 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.730
 but the guests did not want to stay here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.660
 just like that loser track 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.640
 let deport 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.790
 the diligent boulevard on the left 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.700
 side you check today's in the bak tor 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.310
 nothing happened but then became 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.070
 it is really dangerous in the criminal justice area 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.530
 between each can but tokio 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.400
 and sven seitz the umpire whistles 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.830
 penalty 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.229
 the slow motion shows there was probably one 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.510
 touch on all cases turned 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.200
 digitalglobe here but a bit awkward 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.300
 on 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.300
 Halfway captain Philip Schubert 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.240
 took the responsibility but kept 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.229
 would have guessed the corner and prevented the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.229
 new arrears 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.300
 but the half-dweller remained a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.100
 unpleasant guest with partly high 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.990
 Pressing they did that to the berliners 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.140
 live hard and tried the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.300
 infamous bak pass machine to bother 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.030
 and that came in the first half also 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.280
 only phased in sets here 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.620
 with a good play on then should 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.100
 tour with suspected nasal bone fracture 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 but then had no changes from space for 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.720
 kevin kuske was a striker for him 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.750
 the defender 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.480
 the direction was wackler and kuske 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.700
 also at the last good bak action before 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.489
 the break involved but it remained 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.209
 first at the 1 1 but close to the 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.790
 offside 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.769
 the gates lifted the gates for the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.320
 second half on but shortly after 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.750
 re-whistle was first germania am 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.510
 pusher jan nail nailed the ball here 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.160
 at the bak box but the berliner 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.519
 now with a really strong 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.019
 Presentation checked keeper pascal nail 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.840
 from the distance 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.819
 in the 58 minute was then but 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.280
 powerless malinowski turns on 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.250
 fastest and Sabadell is with his 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.459
 second goal today 2 to 1 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.459
 finally the leadership for the berlin ak 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.470
 now the table leader was gone 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.380
 to hold up huge chance for pond man 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.290
 in the 65 minute after this great 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.750
 flank of djuric but guest-goalkeeper 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.110
 nail prevents with luck and post 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.270
 the 3 to 1 after 75 minutes were yes 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.920
 germania keeper but then powerless 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.860
 kevin kuske used the entry 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.110
 from chesney after him should only 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.260
 publicly had the precedence 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.560
 then arrived and so we could 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.840
 leave directly for that 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.000
 double scorer came to isaver test 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.250
 then akin tugs into the game 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.920
 the bak fans are waiting since his arrival 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.570
 At the end of August, eagerly awaiting his first 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.510
 League goal for Berlin 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.440
 in the 80 minute had the wait then 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.590
 an end 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.959
 4 to 1 there showed the Turkish ex 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.890
 national player can be all and 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.890
 his routine 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.960
 Germany half-city had long been good 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.730
 against it held now it became one 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.730
 Gossip for the guests from the resin 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.580
 Vorland especially as marcel höttecke the box 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.110
 kept clean and it stayed that way 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.480
 Animals should finally be pure 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.730
 reserved the final point on one 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.950
 second half of the season 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.630
 the berlin ak proposes germania 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.920
 Half town at the end clearly and clearly 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.450
 with 5 1 and thus remains table leader 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.980
 very happy that is always from week 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.260
 better week seized upon by the 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.850
 Team marched and their strengths 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.250
 on the square then just on 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.720
 play with ball then still shows and that 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.090
 I think it pleases the audience 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.680
 the second one was the best 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.040
 Half the time of the bak on the season 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.500
 played 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.200
 I think he was partly very good 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.150
 but a coach is not satisfied 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.250
 neustrelitz a bit in the neck 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.720
 but is it really important to you? 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.030
 that's here in the first place 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.520
 within the man clearly self-confidence 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.560
 go to game to play everyone wants 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.960
 know that and that's why 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.610
 that motivates us more with so now 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.130
 really fit that but 90 minutes 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.570
 Yes, I was able to play 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.669
 already reasonably fit 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.400
 this would be problems with the kidneys 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.300
 stone the whole anti dignified one week 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.980
 in the hospital at me again 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.200
 thrown back but now comes again 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.970
 slow does not sound over 20 right now 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.130
 half an hour into the game it comes 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.770
 next week still firmly in the bak 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.290
 currently running everything there was 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.040
 even spontaneously two days off the trainer 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.580
 time for research broken today 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.610
 nothing more 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.290
 I'll rest first and 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.060
 Home is yours with family bit 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.440
 spending time with the family 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.440
 are in berlin 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.110
 if the berliner so it would be the 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.570
 second enjoy 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.300
 on the 20th of october the league goes into operation 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.480
 further then the derby in köpenick 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.450
 at union on the berliner ak remains so 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.450
 initially still at home 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.450
 undefeated
