we<00:00:54.210> definitely<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.840> played<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> lot

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
we definitely could have played a lot

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.080 
we definitely could have played a lot
better<00:00:55.320> defensively<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.370> offensively<00:00:56.520> this

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
better defensively and offensively this

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.750 
better defensively and offensively this
game<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.199> defensively<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.699> I

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
game will or so defensively but I

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
game will or so defensively but I
definitely<00:01:00.149> room<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.539> improvement<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:01.170> both

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
