00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.930 
and hopefully we'll be able to manage it
and<00:03:47.170> pull<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.410> off<00:03:47.680> we<00:03:48.100> should<00:03:48.370> be<00:03:48.519> because<00:03:48.790> now

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
and pull it off we should be because now

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.670 
and pull it off we should be because now
we<00:03:49.000> know<00:03:49.330> what<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.720> kitchen<00:03:50.019> looks<00:03:50.230> like<00:03:50.440> and

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
we know what the kitchen looks like and

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.100 
we know what the kitchen looks like and
where<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:51.010> pots<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.150> pans<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.930> other

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
where the pots and pans and the other

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.949

coming back to say my goodbyes but then

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.469 
coming back to say my goodbyes but then
when<00:05:11.470> I<00:05:11.500> told<00:05:12.490> them<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.669> you<00:05:12.820> know<00:05:12.910> i'm<00:05:13.180> back

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
when I told them that you know i'm back

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.659 
when I told them that you know i'm back
in<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.690> competition<00:05:14.460> everyone<00:05:15.460> had<00:05:15.640> a

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
in the competition everyone had a

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.930 
in the competition everyone had a
surprised<00:05:16.120> face<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:18.100> emotions<00:05:18.490> were<00:05:18.610> mixed

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
surprised face the emotions were mixed

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.600 
surprised face the emotions were mixed
so<00:05:19.390> I<00:05:19.419> really<00:05:20.290> couldn't<00:05:20.500> understand<00:05:20.979> if<00:05:21.310> they

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
so I really couldn't understand if they

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.600 
so I really couldn't understand if they
were<00:05:21.700> happy<00:05:21.880> or<00:05:22.890> had<00:05:23.890> this<00:05:24.040> fear<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.310> you

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
were happy or had this fear that you

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.270 
were happy or had this fear that you
know<00:05:24.729> now<00:05:25.450> instead<00:05:25.720> of<00:05:25.810> competing<00:05:26.280> against

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
know now instead of competing against

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.830 
know now instead of competing against
two<00:05:27.610> there'll<00:05:28.450> be<00:05:28.479> three<00:05:29.290> other<00:05:29.410> competitors

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
two there'll be three other competitors

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.240 
two there'll be three other competitors
so<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:32.229> was<00:05:32.380> pretty<00:05:32.590> much<00:05:32.800> you<00:05:32.950> know<00:05:32.979> what<00:05:33.220> I

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
so this was pretty much you know what I

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.490 
so this was pretty much you know what I
thought
