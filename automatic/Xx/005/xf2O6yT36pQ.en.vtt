00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.830
 hello people here is again euro 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.930
 sido was and yes today there are the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.930
 second part of my classes or classes 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.000
 recommendation what I can give you and 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.610
 though the ska 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.720
 I have now played and me free 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.140
 though they are pretty late in here 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.199
 black ops 2 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.570
 and believe it was 40 or 44 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.559
 Somewhere where the turn from level 46 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.839
 gives the msr 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.059
 and yes the scale is of course right 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.010
 horny right money the assault rifle must 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.449
 I honestly say fire rate is now 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.359
 Although not quite as high as the type 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.969
 25 but makes Nordic states has 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.320
 a decent range and good 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.579
 or sammer a very good precision and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.530
 I've come that far again 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.720
 chosen for three essays that one 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.759
 Practiced here now with the father 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.429
 and you see below how 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.830
 makes another four points of precision 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.649
 as this really right really cool 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.970
 that makes a lot of what's going on 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.920
 I've heard recently, is not it? 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.160
 really very very connection 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.840
 that's why the players depend on me 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.740
 work or fold works but 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.899
 not every game 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.940
 I 've got 12 while I where I am 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.530
 my new optical choir can travel 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.509
 otherwise the rest is all for 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.819
 Trash can actually be said that way 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.250
 but that's another topic for everyone 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.020
 case here with the handle has grabbed 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.789
 you really really good precision 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.069
 I have only recently 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.800
 the shaft and the target area unlocked 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.209
 as I said I have done with 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.259
 the weapon has not been tried yet 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.660
 because I am only now with the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.220
 weapon wants eight which, of course, very well 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.830
 is the reflex up here on this 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.369
 Week on it because the one hand not quite 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.830
 as good as the 25th 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.810
 that's why you also see area 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.459
 below, make another one 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.009
 green point more 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.149
 as well as the harm then on everyone 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.500
 Fall again with the fast 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.650
 you just pull that faster 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.690
 in the target device is 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.129
 you can then, for example, videos 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.629
 quickly the magazine with the increasingly 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.610
 for the people the fast magazine 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.950
 want to change a little faster 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.090
 but I already had that in the last one 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.359
 topic then as secondary weapon the sma 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.159
 w and yes as I said that could then 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.140
 would have to decide which version better 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.840
 Find if he's here with a few more 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.560
 opponents thus sitting in blankets 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.959
 There are certainly rausholen world 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.680
 again to which challenges 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.459
 to complete or if you boo 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.599
 wanted to capture the conversation series goals 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.040
 you have to decide for yourself 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.049
 I have it this time the smw 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.310
 taken away because the very good you 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.749
 Of course, even if he is not with 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.920
 the launchers although I have always 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.469
 saying 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.329
 the sound is always up and it recommends 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.519
 everytime 12 people when you are in 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.930
 to have a part in team play with that one 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.840
 the throne will bring it down right away 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.659
 at least 75 points for your next one 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.909
 points series and as I said the drone 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.459
 is fast or delhi or what stop 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.459
 Upside down sport is relatively fast 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.469
 from the sky so then here again 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.620
 beautiful seht is currently terminator online 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:20.019
 We will look beautiful again as in the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.469
 other browsers without swiss commitments 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.810
 synonymous again link the first video 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:28.680
 hardliner raiders and dead silence 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.150
 although it may be 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.689
 not really that could happen 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.680
 stay with raiders exactly and here 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:41.319
 again grenade is not a problem 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.790
 and yes so much the clocked like clock 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.989
 you said yes you can if it is longer 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.999
 Watch wanted to stop again 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.459
 can express yourself then yours 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.840
 create class and have done since 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.389
 but therefore again only a recommendation 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.739
 of their museums we also best with the 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.049
 Weapons I can find just in 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.010
 Central city that the ksk has very late 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.209
 is unlocked 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:06.909
 so from level 40 was about that and yes 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:09.189
 hello terminator okay so we come 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.510
 now very briefly times also points series 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:15.579
 and I have to say that 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.250
 recommendation from me is in one 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:22.180
 private game for you alone what knows 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.280
 me with or against new pott and tutti 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.380
 recruit the recruit 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.340
 difficulty level and then he takes 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.810
 just here 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.820
 bring these chris schmidt such 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.280
 For example, the note star cites the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.060
 the robot embodies the thing skin 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.530
 really pure 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.620
 hat off in front of the people here in the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.820
 normal game 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.650
 get the thing is absolutely blatant 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.930
 fire too fast the rockets round 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.280
 that is really crazy and if you are there 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.100
 For example, because there is no 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.860
 sports and if it is here for example 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.479
 This is real somewhere in eschborn 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.680
 madness what you kills for that 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.810
 Just try one of the times 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.210
 private lobby takes you the pick 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.970
 just like the dog squad that is 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.690
 as well as how fast you can get 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.030
 Try how fast you get this 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.060
 killstreaks these points are together 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.789
 if you have in the private arcades 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.990
 now in the private game mode that is 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.060
 is a recommendation of me tried 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.000
 Just kazan for the people 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.850
 stop in the normal game to get this 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.669
 is not reaching rieks as i do 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.820
 example is that you are welcome 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.560
 diversion if you like a bit 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.320
 what I am experimenting on 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.330
 can recommend is and you also if 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.660
 if you do it well or if 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.610
 one good lobby inside the tricks is also 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.380
 can reach two to three times 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.300
 Once upon a time the drone is whole 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.710
 clearly and there I find that fine solved 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.660
 when the drone is in the sky and you 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.720
 is not celebrated the same rheumatic the 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.539
 when your team mates graduate 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 you get points but ten pieces 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.970
 per or 10 points per statements which 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.190
 then continue or again for the points 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.810
 this includes the hunter 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.990
 killer the paper plane is not a show 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.060
 bullet highly recommend to me in 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.520
 usually in 90 percent of all operations 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.710
 always a kill 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.570
 You can still choose between preface there 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.789
 you are at 5 150 points 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.860
 but again there is the problem that one 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.340
 the first must come and in the 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.599
 Time 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.190
 that's just bad 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.410
 I was made just always experience 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.940
 Killed and thus could my supplies 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.800
 Therefore do not use the application the 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.380
 According to the as a jerk as a paper error 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.729
 thrown out and ready and then what 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.590
 Proper cabinets are the brightest 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.320
 rocket this is practically a predator 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.300
 which then forms again in five small 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.830
 Rockets and if you're really lucky 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.960
 and the thing in the sport can place 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.530
 then you're doing five with it 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.590
 graduations without whatever else 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.910
 is lightning strikes it like that 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.090
 similar to mortar 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:57.050
 You can have three goals on a continuous basis 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:59.480
 the map put where then practically so or 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.700
 so a grenade stop is discontinued 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.450
 and if you 're lucky you go there 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.100
 also one or the other as I said the 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.820
 should me to the point he is still 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.800
 have been 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.240
 try it out my private 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.040
 Lobby or a private in the game 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.110
 and you take the high killstreaks 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.510
 Casey ever gets tips as well as tricks 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.040
 the point series always tries out 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.150
 totally cool sometimes makes you fun 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.410
 welcome change when it comes to 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.820
 example now a gameplay 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.530
 not at all running a few games 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.310
 one behind the other and it's just going crazy 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.800
 crappy 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.180
 then it goes in is he gets a 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.130
 You can change the frustration as well 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.110
 let out a little bit and yes 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.550
 Just makes fun and you can too 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.840
 times the cards a bit 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.850
 look and look at which 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.420
 buy which points series still 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.530
 really worth it so ok that should be like 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.340
 First said of me again 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.320
 have been 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.210
 I thank you again for first 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.300
 seeing and hearing gives me thumbs up 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:53.840
 bitterly I would be very grateful for you 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:56.630
 of you slip by tapping the 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.130
 others do not say yes as I said 

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.460
 thank you for seeing and hearing
