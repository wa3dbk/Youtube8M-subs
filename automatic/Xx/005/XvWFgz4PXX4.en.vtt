okay and all the pieces of equipment
installed<00:00:09.269> by<00:00:09.510> sky<00:00:09.750> probably<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> handiest

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
installed by sky probably the handiest

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.280 
installed by sky probably the handiest
and<00:00:11.639> also<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> most<00:00:12.300> troublesome<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.080> sky

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and also the most troublesome is the sky

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.829 
and also the most troublesome is the sky
I<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:14.190> been<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.610> quick<00:00:14.849> overview<00:00:14.969> that

with Sky box because on the back of the
sky<00:00:29.460> box<00:00:29.699> you'll<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.330> there's<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> feed<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
sky box you'll see there's a feed in a

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
sky box you'll see there's a feed in a
describe<00:00:33.090> box<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:33.870> allows<00:00:34.309> emeriti

describe box which allows emeriti

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.610 
describe box which allows emeriti
signals<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.850> fed<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> modulator<00:00:37.200> inside

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
signals be fed in and a modulator inside

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
signals be fed in and a modulator inside
box<00:00:37.890> combines<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.730> signal<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> output

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
box combines that signal with the output

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.780 
box combines that signal with the output
from<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> Sky<00:00:40.770> box<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.489> essential

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
from the Sky box now it's not essential

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.760 
from the Sky box now it's not essential
that<00:00:42.090> aerial<00:00:42.510> feed<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> there<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.320> escape<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that aerial feed is there at escape I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
that aerial feed is there at escape I
hope<00:00:44.160> it'll<00:00:44.309> work<00:00:44.370> regardless<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.570> very

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
hope it'll work regardless but it's very

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.930 
hope it'll work regardless but it's very
handy<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.070> particular<00:00:47.309> feed<00:00:47.700> from<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
handy that the particular feed from that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
handy that the particular feed from that
box<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.570> fed<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.410> point<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.250> have

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
box is fed in at that point and we have

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
box is fed in at that point and we have
two<00:00:50.550> outputs<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.840> feed<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
two outputs so you can feed it to the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
two outputs so you can feed it to the
televisions<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> room<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.059> also<00:00:54.539> to

male<00:03:28.239> you'd<00:03:28.510> need<00:03:28.689> to<00:03:28.840> use<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.290> copper<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.220> coax

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
male you'd need to use a copper and coax

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.509 
male you'd need to use a copper and coax
coupler<00:03:31.180> which<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.199> I<00:03:32.709> just<00:03:33.040> don't<00:03:33.189> have<00:03:33.400> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
coupler which and I just don't have the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.460 
coupler which and I just don't have the
hand<00:03:33.729> right<00:03:33.909> now<00:03:33.939> but<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.599> it<00:03:35.260> basically

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
hand right now but and it basically

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.030 
hand right now but and it basically
converts<00:03:36.189> and<00:03:36.519> this<00:03:37.090> would<00:03:37.239> be<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.359> male<00:03:37.659> I<00:03:38.040> put

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
converts and this would be a male I put

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.780 
converts and this would be a male I put
I<00:03:39.220> have<00:03:39.579> which<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.389> and<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:41.049> is<00:03:41.259> a

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
I have which in and this is a

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.229 
I have which in and this is a
female<00:03:42.790> which<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.269> ready<00:03:43.449> for<00:03:43.629> an<00:03:43.750> import<00:03:43.989> okay

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
female which is ready for an import okay

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.729 
female which is ready for an import okay
so<00:03:46.239> I'll<00:03:46.479> turn<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:46.900> box<00:03:47.169> around<00:03:47.409> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
so I'll turn this box around the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.800 
so I'll turn this box around the
hopefully<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.129> can<00:03:48.250> see<00:03:48.430> better<00:03:48.639> and<00:03:48.879> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
hopefully you can see better and the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.050 
hopefully you can see better and the
bottom<00:03:50.169> output<00:03:50.680> here<00:03:50.889> is<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.310> 9-volt<00:03:51.759> one

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
bottom output here is the 9-volt one

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.449 
bottom output here is the 9-volt one
here<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:52.870> what<00:03:53.229> I'll<00:03:53.379> do<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.739> instead<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.310> using

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
here so what I'll do is instead of using

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.399 
here so what I'll do is instead of using
a<00:03:54.699> coupler<00:03:55.060> I'm<00:03:55.299> going<00:03:55.479> to<00:03:55.540> use<00:03:55.659> this<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:56.019> female

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
a coupler I'm going to use this a female

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.640 
a coupler I'm going to use this a female
connector<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:57.009> slide<00:03:57.759> it<00:03:58.000> in<00:03:58.150> here<00:03:58.650> and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
connector and slide it in here and

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.309 
connector and slide it in here and
common<00:04:00.430> arm<00:04:00.579> on<00:04:00.819> our<00:04:00.970> locus<00:04:01.419> end<00:04:01.659> into<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.079> sky

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
common arm on our locus end into the sky

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.300 
common arm on our locus end into the sky
I<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.870> we<00:04:04.989> can<00:04:05.109> see<00:04:05.319> it's<00:04:05.590> getting<00:04:05.889> a<00:04:05.979> signal

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
I and we can see it's getting a signal

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.030 
I and we can see it's getting a signal
from<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.549> sky<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.900> because<00:04:07.900> it's<00:04:08.199> giving<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.680> red

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
from the sky I because it's giving a red

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.039 
from the sky I because it's giving a red
light<00:04:09.280> now<00:04:09.669> I<00:04:09.699> slap<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.209> in<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.569> other<00:04:10.780> output

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
light now I slap it in the other output

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.140 
light now I slap it in the other output
here<00:04:11.470> which<00:04:11.919> is<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.129> passive<00:04:12.549> side<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:15.370> will

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
here which is the passive side it will

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.999 
here which is the passive side it will
not<00:04:16.389> work<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:17.079> that's<00:04:17.199> a<00:04:17.349> very<00:04:17.530> very<00:04:17.680> common

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
not work so that's a very very common

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.909 
not work so that's a very very common
cause<00:04:18.400> people<00:04:19.090> within<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.539> wrong<00:04:19.690> name

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.530 

so<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:24.669> terms<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.600> em<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.730> this<00:04:27.730> how<00:04:28.510> we

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
so and in terms of em and this how we

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.180 
so and in terms of em and this how we
would<00:04:28.870> test<00:04:29.080> this<00:04:29.380> remote<00:04:29.680> control<00:04:29.830> is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
would test this remote control is

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.310 
would test this remote control is
working<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.699> we<00:04:31.120> would<00:04:31.300> block<00:04:31.510> this<00:04:31.780> from<00:04:32.229> the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
working is we would block this from the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.200 
working is we would block this from the
normal<00:04:32.680> view<00:04:32.889> of<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.130> television<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:34.030> this

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
normal view of the television so this

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.090 
normal view of the television so this
cannot<00:04:34.600> always<00:04:34.870> be<00:04:35.139> a<00:04:35.169> huge<00:04:35.530> success<00:04:35.680> because

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
cannot always be a huge success because

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.680 
cannot always be a huge success because
it<00:04:36.430> sometimes<00:04:36.729> signals<00:04:37.060> got<00:04:37.210> routed<00:04:37.479> about

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
it sometimes signals got routed about

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.020 
it sometimes signals got routed about
anyway<00:04:38.110> but<00:04:38.530> if<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.710> go<00:04:38.919> select<00:04:39.250> here<00:04:39.520> now<00:04:39.760> I

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
anyway but if I go select here now I

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.360 
anyway but if I go select here now I
have<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.630> skybox<00:04:40.870> turn<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.530> other<00:04:41.680> way<00:04:41.889> so<00:04:42.310> if

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
have a skybox turn the other way so if

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.700 
have a skybox turn the other way so if
this<00:04:42.490> sky<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.900> wasn't<00:04:43.900> walking<00:04:44.050> I'm<00:04:44.410> actually

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
this sky I wasn't walking I'm actually

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.439 
this sky I wasn't walking I'm actually
changing<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.490> television<00:04:45.850> screen<00:04:46.210> they<00:04:46.360> are

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
changing that television screen they are

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.330 
changing that television screen they are
using<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.840> skyline<00:04:47.260> so<00:04:47.800> it's<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:47.949> very<00:04:48.130> handy

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
using the skyline so it's a very handy

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.159 
using the skyline so it's a very handy
feature<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:48.940> actually<00:04:49.210> tests<00:04:49.600> your<00:04:49.720> skybox

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
feature that actually tests your skybox

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.930 
feature that actually tests your skybox
to<00:04:50.350> make<00:04:50.470> sure<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.770> sky<00:04:50.949> of<00:04:51.130> Sylvia's<00:04:51.580> walking

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
to make sure the sky of Sylvia's walking

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.060 
to make sure the sky of Sylvia's walking
then<00:04:52.330> test<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.780> sky<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:52.990> as<00:04:53.320> well<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.710> make<00:04:53.830> bold

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
then test the sky I as well to make bold

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.770 
then test the sky I as well to make bold
sure<00:04:54.580> walking<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.180> then<00:04:55.540> you<00:04:55.630> can

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
sure walking and then you can

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.230 
sure walking and then you can
step-by-step<00:04:56.680> move<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:57.100> a<00:04:57.160> second<00:04:57.520> room<00:04:57.700> now

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
step-by-step move to a second room now

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240 
step-by-step move to a second room now
another<00:04:58.510> very<00:04:58.840> important<00:04:59.470> thing<00:04:59.500> on<00:04:59.860> this<00:05:00.040> is

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
another very important thing on this is

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.550 
another very important thing on this is
that<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.300> electrical<00:05:01.870> signal<00:05:02.229> is<00:05:02.320> very

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
that the electrical signal is very

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.890 
that the electrical signal is very
sensitive<00:05:03.040> so<00:05:03.639> what<00:05:04.180> we<00:05:04.360> don't<00:05:04.540> want<00:05:04.810> the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
sensitive so what we don't want the

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.480 
sensitive so what we don't want the
situation<00:05:05.110> where<00:05:05.590> we<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:05.800> signal<00:05:06.160> loss<00:05:06.280> is

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
situation where we have signal loss is

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.140 
situation where we have signal loss is
that<00:05:06.610> after<00:05:07.000> M<00:05:07.180> at<00:05:08.020> M<00:05:08.500> joints<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:09.820> it's<00:05:10.000> not

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
that after M at M joints so it's not

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.210 
that after M at M joints so it's not
possible<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.960> use<00:05:11.139> this<00:05:11.380> successfully<00:05:12.010> in<00:05:12.100> my

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
possible to use this successfully in my

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.279 
possible to use this successfully in my
experience<00:05:12.820> where<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.360> have<00:05:13.510> face<00:05:13.750> plates<00:05:14.080> in

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
experience where you have face plates in

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.110 
experience where you have face plates in
between<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:15.100> if<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.280> have<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.400> face<00:05:15.639> plate<00:05:15.880> on

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
between so if you have a face plate on

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.150 
between so if you have a face plate on
the<00:05:16.240> wall<00:05:16.450> you<00:05:16.840> should<00:05:17.020> bypass<00:05:17.260> a<00:05:17.560> face<00:05:17.919> plate

separately<00:05:27.910> what<00:05:28.090> would<00:05:28.270> use<00:05:28.419> at<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:28.840> back<00:05:28.990> of

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
separately what would use at the back of

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.650 
separately what would use at the back of
satellite<00:05:29.950> box<00:05:30.160> here<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.910> jointer<00:05:31.180> as<00:05:31.450> well

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
satellite box here and a jointer as well

okay<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:33.070> one<00:05:34.060> of<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.270> reasons<00:05:34.660> that<00:05:34.720> skybox

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
okay and one of the reasons that skybox

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.050 
okay and one of the reasons that skybox
may<00:05:35.500> stop<00:05:35.889> working<00:05:35.919> is<00:05:36.430> it's<00:05:36.669> been<00:05:36.820> wired

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
may stop working is it's been wired

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.820 
may stop working is it's been wired
perfectly<00:05:37.630> but<00:05:37.810> it's<00:05:37.930> just<00:05:38.080> not<00:05:38.320> working

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
perfectly but it's just not working

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.469 
perfectly but it's just not working
sometimes<00:05:39.250> even<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.580> life<00:05:39.729> is<00:05:39.910> were<00:05:40.030> working

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
sometimes even the life is were working

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.420 
sometimes even the life is were working
on<00:05:40.599> a<00:05:40.630> team<00:05:40.900> but<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.380> can't<00:05:41.620> change<00:05:41.860> channels

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
on a team but you can't change channels

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.600 
on a team but you can't change channels
so<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:44.260> can<00:05:44.440> repeat<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.950> step<00:05:45.160> that<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.370> showed

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
so you can repeat the step that I showed

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.460 
so you can repeat the step that I showed
you<00:05:45.700> earlier<00:05:45.760> which<00:05:46.539> is<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:46.750> go<00:05:46.870> into<00:05:47.320> the

believe it or not this is the most

common fix that most installers use for

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.240 
common fix that most installers use for
fixing<00:05:56.050> sky-high<00:05:56.260> problems<00:05:56.800> where<00:05:57.160> it's

purely a software glitch it's a matter

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.900 
purely a software glitch it's a matter
of<00:05:59.080> turning<00:05:59.320> it<00:05:59.530> off<00:05:59.680> and<00:05:59.889> turning<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.580> back<00:06:00.610> on

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
of turning it off and turning it back on

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.029 
of turning it off and turning it back on
and<00:06:01.260> there<00:06:02.260> are<00:06:02.289> other<00:06:02.500> things<00:06:02.590> that<00:06:02.860> may

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
and there are other things that may

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.100 
and there are other things that may
possibly<00:06:03.280> cause<00:06:03.700> it<00:06:03.940> is<00:06:04.090> that<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.330> sky<00:06:04.570> itself

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
possibly cause it is that the sky itself

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.070 
possibly cause it is that the sky itself
has<00:06:05.320> been<00:06:05.440> damaged<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.900> sometimes<00:06:07.900> it's

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
has been damaged and sometimes it's

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.740 
has been damaged and sometimes it's
obvious<00:06:08.289> that<00:06:08.680> has<00:06:09.099> been<00:06:09.280> damaged<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:09.789> it

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
obvious that has been damaged and it

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.170 
obvious that has been damaged and it
simply<00:06:11.020> fixed<00:06:11.320> by<00:06:11.410> replacing<00:06:11.979> the<00:06:12.430> sky<00:06:12.610> and

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
simply fixed by replacing the sky and

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.450 
simply fixed by replacing the sky and
the<00:06:13.270> final<00:06:13.660> problem<00:06:13.990> is<00:06:14.260> that<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:14.919> sky<00:06:15.160> but

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
the final problem is that the sky but

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.460 
the final problem is that the sky but
the<00:06:15.550> sky<00:06:15.729> box<00:06:15.970> itself<00:06:16.270> is<00:06:16.450> faulty<00:06:16.960> and<00:06:17.110> simply

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
the sky box itself is faulty and simply

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.300 
the sky box itself is faulty and simply
will<00:06:17.680> not<00:06:17.950> power<00:06:18.190> and<00:06:18.639> the<00:06:19.530> sky<00:06:20.530> I<00:06:20.560> which<00:06:21.099> means

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
will not power and the sky I which means

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.129 
will not power and the sky I which means
this<00:06:21.430> go<00:06:21.610> back<00:06:21.760> to<00:06:21.910> self<00:06:22.150> is<00:06:22.300> fine<00:06:22.570> in<00:06:22.840> terms<00:06:23.020> of

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
this go back to self is fine in terms of

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.750 
this go back to self is fine in terms of
general<00:06:23.440> operation<00:06:23.979> but<00:06:24.280> from<00:06:24.400> the<00:06:24.490> sky<00:06:24.729> I

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
general operation but from the sky I

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.600 
general operation but from the sky I
need<00:06:25.090> usage<00:06:25.479> it<00:06:25.660> won't<00:06:25.870> work<00:06:26.080> and<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:27.310> next

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
need usage it won't work and the next

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.600 
need usage it won't work and the next
section<00:06:28.389> would<00:06:28.690> be<00:06:28.720> that<00:06:29.139> the<00:06:29.950> cable<00:06:30.400> in

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
section would be that the cable in

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.430 
section would be that the cable in
between<00:06:30.969> is<00:06:31.330> simply<00:06:31.659> not<00:06:31.780> powerful<00:06:32.200> enough

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440

and<00:06:32.770> it's<00:06:33.370> an<00:06:33.490> old<00:06:33.669> style<00:06:33.880> cave

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:34.439 
and it's an old style cave

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:35.869 
and it's an old style cave
it's<00:06:34.559> been<00:06:34.709> damaged<00:06:35.039> and<00:06:35.339> there's<00:06:35.610> too<00:06:35.729> much

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
it's been damaged and there's too much

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.939 
it's been damaged and there's too much
signal<00:06:36.300> us<00:06:36.449> or<00:06:36.719> the<00:06:36.839> LeBron<00:06:37.259> of<00:06:37.379> cable<00:06:37.679> is<00:06:37.800> too

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
signal us or the LeBron of cable is too

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.639 
signal us or the LeBron of cable is too
long<00:06:38.159> to<00:06:38.429> successfully<00:06:39.059> and<00:06:39.330> walk<00:06:39.959> anything

long to successfully and walk anything

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.529 
long to successfully and walk anything
now<00:06:41.069> that<00:06:41.249> the<00:06:41.369> two<00:06:41.550> things<00:06:41.759> you<00:06:41.909> can<00:06:42.059> use<00:06:42.089> to

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
now that the two things you can use to

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.779 
now that the two things you can use to
overcome<00:06:43.229> that<00:06:43.409> is<00:06:43.619> you<00:06:43.830> could<00:06:43.979> use<00:06:44.159> a<00:06:46.789> powered

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
overcome that is you could use a powered

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.479 
overcome that is you could use a powered
and<00:06:48.179> sky-eye<00:06:48.959> distribution<00:06:49.860> system<00:06:50.189> which

and sky-eye distribution system which

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:51.919 
and sky-eye distribution system which
you<00:06:50.639> can<00:06:50.789> actually<00:06:50.939> use<00:06:51.239> to<00:06:51.269> connect<00:06:51.779> to<00:06:51.869> a
