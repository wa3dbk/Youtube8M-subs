00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.359
 In today's video we are going to see, step by step, how to build the mechanism that makes walking 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.528
 to a spider robot 

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:13.958
 It is also known as hexapod, as it reaches the displacement with it 

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:18.239
 six foot movement. 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.579
 Let's see how it's done. 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.839
 This is the mechanics we will use to build the robot hexapode or spider robot. 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.490
 The horizontal - this one - 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.450
 The robot's frame is part. 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.740
 The legs - here we have the three - the leg 1, this is the 2 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 and this is the pot 3. 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.210
 The leg 1 is the connection point to the frame, and this point of the cell phone. he can not 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.000
 stay fixed The same thing happens with these two transversal bars. This is the bar 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.740
 transverse 1 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.650
 and the cross bar 2. They are mobile points too. 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.280
 It has a mobile point here. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 Mobile point 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.189
 And mobile point with connection that goes 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.459
 in the two transversal bars, and it is connected 

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:11.689
 on foot number 2. 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.299
 In turn, it is connected to this wheel that we see here. Here it is not possible to see, 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.170
 But the axis of the wheel goes at this point where the engine is connected 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.920
 reducer It's going to turn in either way, but the connection has to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 be eccentric Not connected to the center. It is usually done more or less 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.179
 one centimeter. This distance from here was more or less one 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.049
 centimeter From the axis where we will make the connection. At the top it has a point 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.960
 That is not fixed, this must allow mobility 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.709
 just like this one. The only fixed 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.618
 It is this connection that goes to the frame. Of all the connections that we are doing, 

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:49.368
 the only fixes is this one. Otherwise all are mobile. Another option, which 

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:54.069
 Some hexaphons will see that they do it, in this pan they leave a hole and 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.298
 Connect a screw that allows mobility. This can be 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.429
 another option. But the one we are going to build today 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.080
 it is this Let's see how it's done. 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.739
 To start building the spider robot, we must make the shell that will support the legs. 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.719
 That is why I bought a piece of 15 x 15 millimeters and a length of almost 1 meter. 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:16.099
 It was cut into two pieces of 20 centimeters and two 12 centimeters. 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.259
 And a shorter nine centimeters and a half. 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.179
 With the help of four sweet screws, or using glue, as it is easier for them, 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 we began to build the structure. 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.039
 Join the first two. 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:44.439
 And place the one on the other side. 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:54.560
 When we already have this armed structure, we have to place the piece of wood that goes to the inner part. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.960
 This will serve us as a support for reducing gear. 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.639
 This is the figure that we will initially assemble, using these little sticks. 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.679
 What we will do is open holes in all the unions. 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.900
 In this union. 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.219
 In these three. 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.020
 And in these two. 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.639
 Additionally, gaps in half of these two posts. 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.640
 When we already have holes in all the unions, at the midpoint of these two posts 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.239
 And in the superior of this one, we will begin to unite them. 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.659
 To join them, what we take is a normal Clip, we rediscover it 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.879
 And by one end we give you a big turn. 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.979
 Then we take it for the smallest part. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 In such a way that there is such a thing. 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 Then we cut it more or less a centimeter 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.740
 And we made the union. Let's go through one 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.360
 and then on the other. 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 Let us note that it is moving. 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.760
 At the other end we fold it 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.819
 and we started to close it in circles. 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.320
 In the end we are left there are two sticks together at their ends, but they let us generate movement. 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.360
 If you have screw and nut, you can do it without tightening it. 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.900
 Because it's about generating mobility. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.939
 And we do the same for these three points. 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.939
 In some cases we do not want the legs to slip, 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.680
 Then we can take some glass paper, 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.379
 cut a small piece, 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.819
 and with some tail 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.620
 It's the place in the corners. 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.340
 Then the reducing motor we are looking for to add. 

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.279
 In this case I put the tires on it. 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.679
 It is not ideal, the best would be a pulley. 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.379
 And more than a centimeter of radius, we opened a hole. 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.639
 This hole will be used to support the leg, which initially gave movement to the rest. 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.539
 Then with another piece of Clip, 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.819
 We crossed the tiller and the three sticks. 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 Here we have the ribbon and poles, forming a M. 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.420
 What we need is to put other two sticks on him. 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.420
 Here I did it on the top. 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:08.219
 Much shorter, forming this fixed base that will remain. 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.220
 All with unions that generate mobility. 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.480
 Remember that this union does not go in the center of the rim. 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.399
 It goes more or less a centimeter. 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.579
 The connection point. 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.740
 The next thing we do and install the reducing motor. 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.339
 We have to place it in this way and only show the axis. We assure you with 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.959
 a piece of tape. 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.020
 We beat it very well. 

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:35.668
 and we have our engine ready. Now we can mount the legs. We connect the wheel to the axis 

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:39.399
 and we will secure the legs. As balso is a very soft wood 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.919
 And easy to drill, I will use needles with a round head. 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.620
 We discussed it at the other end. 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.519
 And finally we will connect this to the structure. This is the only point that should be fixed. 

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.519
 To this we do not place only one point, 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.799
 but at least two or three points, so that it is completely fixed. 

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.839
 They see it here. In this case, I put three points for it to go completely 

00:06:13.848 --> 00:06:17.588
 fixed Then I remember them. Mobile point in the structure 

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:20.459
 The union between these two sticks no more 

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.468
 point of union to the wheel. 

00:06:22.468 --> 00:06:26.110
 I used a tire but it is not the best one. Mobile point here at the party 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.129
 superior, another mobile point, 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.778
 What is inside is the only fix, a fixed point that must remain (this is not 

00:06:32.778 --> 00:06:36.189
 must move). Phone 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.760
 and mobile point joined to the base. 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.939
 We just have to connect to the nine volts. If we realize it already generates the movement 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.939
 which is going to give off as a spider. 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.360
 It lacks to arm the legs on the other side and our spider robot is ready. 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.480
