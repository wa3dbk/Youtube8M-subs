00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
I gave it a blue base to the piece and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.320 
I gave it a blue base to the piece and
now<00:00:53.890> I'll<00:00:54.220> work<00:00:54.400> with<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.699> white<00:00:54.879> color<00:00:55.150> and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
now I'll work with the white color and

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.930 
now I'll work with the white color and
top<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:56.409> nice<00:00:56.589> thing<00:00:56.830> about<00:00:56.860> crackle<00:00:57.580> is<00:00:57.760> that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
top the nice thing about crackle is that

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.000 
top the nice thing about crackle is that
you<00:00:58.059> can<00:00:58.210> work<00:00:58.479> with<00:00:58.540> two<00:00:58.960> distinct<00:00:59.440> colors<00:00:59.799> a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
you can work with two distinct colors a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.250 
you can work with two distinct colors a
light<00:01:00.309> one<00:01:00.549> and<00:01:00.729> a<00:01:01.030> tars<00:01:01.269> one<00:01:01.479> so<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
light one and a tars one so that the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.130 
light one and a tars one so that the
range<00:01:02.500> can<00:01:02.739> come<00:01:02.920> through<00:01:03.129> let's<00:01:03.790> start<00:01:04.140> we

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
range can come through let's start we

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.200 
range can come through let's start we
use<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.290> one<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.740> half<00:01:05.770> brush<00:01:06.220> it's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
use a one and a half brush it's

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.969 
use a one and a half brush it's
important<00:01:07.780> but<00:01:07.900> it's<00:01:07.960> new<00:01:08.320> or<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.830> the

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
important but it's new or that the

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.070 
important but it's new or that the
threads<00:01:09.280> are<00:01:09.460> nice<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.909> soft<00:01:10.119> so<00:01:10.840> that<00:01:10.869> the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
threads are nice and soft so that the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.140 
threads are nice and soft so that the
technique<00:01:11.470> works<00:01:11.770> properly<00:01:12.100> I've<00:01:12.820> already

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
technique works properly I've already

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.850 
technique works properly I've already
applied<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.600> blue<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.290> waited<00:01:14.560> for<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:14.800> to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860

don't have to fill the whole surface

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.740 
don't have to fill the whole surface
because<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.709> not<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> problem<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:18.450> cool

hair<00:03:55.120> blower<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:57.609> white<00:03:57.790> paint<00:03:58.030> talked<00:03:58.540> in

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
hair blower the white paint talked in

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.709 
hair blower the white paint talked in
reaction<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.859> glue<00:04:00.099> which<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:00.909> didn't<00:04:01.329> wait<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
reaction to glue which we didn't wait to

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.530 
reaction to glue which we didn't wait to
dry<00:04:02.040> when<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.159> starts<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.579> dry<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.090> crackling

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
dry when it starts to dry the crackling

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.990 
dry when it starts to dry the crackling
begins<00:04:04.900> it's<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.829> cheap<00:04:06.069> technique<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.760> it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
begins it's a cheap technique and it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.690 
begins it's a cheap technique and it
gives<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.329> very<00:04:07.599> interesting<00:04:07.780> effect<00:04:08.700> remember

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
gives a very interesting effect remember

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.149 
gives a very interesting effect remember
use<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.090> light<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.959> dark<00:04:10.989> color<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.859> create

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
use a light and a dark color to create

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.449 
use a light and a dark color to create
this<00:04:12.310> effect<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:14.139> order<00:04:14.469> doesn't<00:04:14.680> matter<00:04:14.829> I

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
this effect the order doesn't matter I

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.520 
this effect the order doesn't matter I
made<00:04:15.700> another<00:04:15.969> sample<00:04:16.539> here<00:04:16.780> we're<00:04:16.989> inverted

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
made another sample here we're inverted

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.069 
made another sample here we're inverted
the<00:04:17.620> colors<00:04:17.949> I<00:04:18.160> applied<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.180> blue<00:04:19.389> on<00:04:19.539> top<00:04:19.720> and

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
the colors I applied the blue on top and

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.980 
the colors I applied the blue on top and
the<00:04:20.169> white<00:04:20.349> under<00:04:20.789> it's<00:04:21.789> also<00:04:22.060> nice<00:04:22.360> check<00:04:22.840> it

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
the white under it's also nice check it

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.409 
the white under it's also nice check it
out<00:04:23.110> look<00:04:24.009> at<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.280> crackle<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.240> also

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
out look at the crackle you can also

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.140 
out look at the crackle you can also
finish<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:29.050> off<00:04:29.199> with<00:04:29.710> varnish<00:04:30.150> or

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
finish it off with varnish or

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.200 
finish it off with varnish or
transparent<00:04:31.840> wax<00:04:32.160> in<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.400> wax<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:33.880> can<00:04:33.910> add<00:04:34.180> a

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
transparent wax in the wax you can add a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.659 
transparent wax in the wax you can add a
bit<00:04:34.449> of<00:04:34.479> bitumen<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.440> give<00:04:35.620> it<00:04:35.770> an<00:04:35.979> aged<00:04:36.250> effect

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
bit of bitumen to give it an aged effect

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
to your wood wall or door you can apply

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.540 
to your wood wall or door you can apply
this<00:04:40.180> technique<00:04:40.660> on<00:04:40.930> any<00:04:41.199> surface<00:04:41.770> this<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.430> a

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
this technique on any surface this is a

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.400 
this technique on any surface this is a
technique<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.210> have<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.570> apply<00:04:43.780> very<00:04:44.080> quickly

so<00:04:45.310> it's<00:04:45.430> not<00:04:45.610> recommended<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.539> use<00:04:46.570> on

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
so it's not recommended that you use on

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.070 
so it's not recommended that you use on
a<00:04:46.990> big<00:04:47.229> surface<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:48.460> must<00:04:48.669> do<00:04:48.849> it<00:04:48.970> by<00:04:49.120> parts<00:04:49.509> do

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
a big surface you must do it by parts do

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.899 
a big surface you must do it by parts do
it<00:04:50.169> little<00:04:50.560> by<00:04:50.650> little<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:51.190> you'll<00:04:51.789> achieve

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
it little by little and you'll achieve

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.330 
it little by little and you'll achieve
this<00:04:52.270> nice<00:04:52.449> effect<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.830> thicker<00:04:54.099> the<00:04:54.220> paint

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
this nice effect the thicker the paint
