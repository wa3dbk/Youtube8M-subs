00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.840 

she's<00:00:31.970> so<00:00:32.239> still<00:00:33.250> challenging<00:00:34.250> peace<00:00:34.489> to<00:00:34.670> walk

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
she's so still challenging peace to walk

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.600 
she's so still challenging peace to walk
in<00:00:35.030> but<00:00:35.870> that's<00:00:36.260> really<00:00:36.559> valuable<00:00:36.739> because<00:00:37.190> it

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
in but that's really valuable because it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.549 
in but that's really valuable because it
kind<00:00:38.360> of<00:00:38.450> problems<00:00:38.960> my<00:00:40.510> my<00:00:41.510> dance<00:00:41.870> base<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.410> it

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
kind of problems my my dance base of it

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.000 
kind of problems my my dance base of it
I<00:00:42.590> think<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:43.400> peace<00:00:44.110> you<00:00:45.110> know<00:00:45.230> descends<00:00:45.860> into

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
I think the peace you know descends into

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.439 
I think the peace you know descends into
chaos<00:00:46.100> every<00:00:46.610> night<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:46.850> it<00:00:46.970> also<00:00:47.090> moves

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
chaos every night so it also moves

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.210 
chaos every night so it also moves
between<00:00:47.900> sort<00:00:48.170> of<00:00:48.230> order<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.830> kind<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.100> an

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
between sort of order and kind of an

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.799 
between sort of order and kind of an
hour<00:00:49.339> and<00:00:49.489> was<00:00:49.640> like<00:00:49.790> institutional<00:00:50.420> coding

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
hour and was like institutional coding

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.570 
hour and was like institutional coding
of<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:50.960> space<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.530> then<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.250> sort<00:00:52.519> of

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
of the space and then a sort of

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.220 
of the space and then a sort of
disruption<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.150> that<00:00:53.330> order<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:53.960> there's<00:00:54.170> a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
disruption of that order so there's a

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.009 
disruption of that order so there's a
kind<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.559> sense<00:00:54.800> of<00:00:54.949> pandemonium<00:00:55.760> and

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
kind of sense of pandemonium and

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.390 
kind of sense of pandemonium and
disorder<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.260> disarray<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.010> playing<00:00:58.250> with

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400
