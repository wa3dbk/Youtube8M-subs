you<00:02:00.830> can<00:02:00.979> actually<00:02:01.400> see<00:02:01.880> here<00:02:02.120> my<00:02:02.420> arm<00:02:02.570> goes

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
you can actually see here my arm goes

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.570 
you can actually see here my arm goes
right<00:02:02.930> through<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.320> what<00:02:04.010> they<00:02:04.070> call<00:02:04.100> flying

that's<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.550> smooth<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.450> let<00:03:48.660> off<00:03:48.840> idle<00:03:49.350> down

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
that's so smooth just let off idle down

that's so smooth just let off idle down
here

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
here

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.240

which<00:04:34.790> is<00:04:34.910> pretty<00:04:35.060> me<00:04:35.270> when<00:04:35.420> you<00:04:35.510> think<00:04:35.690> about

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
which is pretty me when you think about

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.940 
which is pretty me when you think about
it<00:04:35.990> it's<00:04:36.080> not<00:04:36.140> something<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.560> expect<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.920> see

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
it it's not something to expect to see

in a Ferrari 599 with the f1

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.110 
in a Ferrari 599 with the f1
transmission<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> manual<00:04:43.760> but<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.000> does

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
transmission it is a manual but it does

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.520 
transmission it is a manual but it does
have<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.360> logic<00:04:44.690> built<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.170> if<00:04:45.260> I<00:04:45.320> hit<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
have the logic built in so if I hit the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.900 
have the logic built in so if I hit the
auto<00:04:45.680> button<00:04:45.980> here<00:04:46.220> it'll<00:04:46.340> actually<00:04:46.460> shift

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
auto button here it'll actually shift

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.510 
auto button here it'll actually shift
for<00:04:47.150> me<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:48.740> now<00:04:48.890> it's<00:04:48.920> like<00:04:49.130> any<00:04:49.340> other

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
for me so now it's like any other

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.910 
for me so now it's like any other
automatic<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:51.200> another<00:04:51.440> neat<00:04:51.650> thing<00:04:51.860> about

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
automatic and another neat thing about

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.590 
automatic and another neat thing about
this<00:04:52.220> engine<00:04:52.430> too<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:52.760> it's<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.030> flexible<00:04:53.240> at

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
this engine too is it's so flexible at

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.630 
this engine too is it's so flexible at
the<00:04:53.690> bottom<00:04:53.990> end<00:04:54.140> it's<00:04:54.320> buttery<00:04:54.950> smooth<00:04:55.340> but

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
the bottom end it's buttery smooth but

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.120 
the bottom end it's buttery smooth but
all<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.030> horsepower<00:04:56.330> at<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.600> high<00:04:56.780> end

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
all the horsepower at the high end

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.880 
all the horsepower at the high end
obviously<00:04:58.130> shows<00:04:58.370> up<00:04:58.600> explosively<00:04:59.770> when<00:05:00.770> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
obviously shows up explosively when the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.550 
obviously shows up explosively when the
car<00:05:01.040> is<00:05:01.070> pushed<00:05:02.140> Plus<00:05:03.140> think<00:05:03.320> of<00:05:03.380> what<00:05:03.470> this

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
car is pushed Plus think of what this

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.040 
car is pushed Plus think of what this
car<00:05:03.740> looks<00:05:04.010> like<00:05:04.160> on<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.490> road<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:05.750> very

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
car looks like on the road it's very

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.760 
car looks like on the road it's very

different
it<00:05:06.860> doesn't<00:05:07.250> look<00:05:07.520> traditional<00:05:10.390> man<00:05:11.390> it's<00:05:11.630> so

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
it doesn't look traditional man it's so

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.500 
it doesn't look traditional man it's so
quiet<00:05:12.260> in<00:05:12.470> here
