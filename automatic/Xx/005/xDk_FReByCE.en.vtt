long and I can't be bothered so what you
can<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.680> heat<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.010> very<00:00:41.250> very<00:00:41.489> gently<00:00:41.790> with

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
can do is heat it very very gently with

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
can do is heat it very very gently with
warm<00:00:42.510> water<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> tap<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.469> can't<00:00:43.800> use

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
warm water from the tap you can't use

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
warm water from the tap you can't use
hot<00:00:44.040> water<00:00:44.160> convincement<00:00:44.760> C<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.059> unstable<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
hot water convincement C is unstable and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.880 
hot water convincement C is unstable and
you<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:45.960> basically<00:00:46.110> kill<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you will basically kill it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so just heat it a tiny bit with lukewarm

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.869 
so just heat it a tiny bit with lukewarm
water<00:00:49.760> it<00:00:50.760> should<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.090> dissolve<00:00:51.420> properly

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
water it should then dissolve properly

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.720 
water it should then dissolve properly
