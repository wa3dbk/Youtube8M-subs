 Tortilla soup said he was rich rich 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.050
 rich or like a little horse as well as 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.760
 cheiser is not rich and good apart 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.370
 we are talking about a recipe very 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.620
 nutritious you have enough sole painful 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.420
 and duplicate or have chilito today 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.130
 anticancer and everything else we are 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.190
 speaking also of a protein that 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.229
 has even so it's a protein of 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.520
 High quality with omega if the whole roll 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.020
 and because they are few are few ingredients 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.870
 these are going to make it I'll put 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.720
 some oil in here in a pan 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:33.650
 and there I will fry the chiles a little 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.090
 and the garlic 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.390
 walk ande 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.390
 and I'm also going to put the tomato 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
 How good the tomato could also be 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.619
 do with green tomatoes if they want to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.750
 It is very good, he reiterated that it is 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.759
 little oil we do not want much we're going to 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.039
 let the tomato release its 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.520
 chick I've already put the boil here 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.200
 water not once has not it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.360
 remarkable because visiting from the water that ten 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.850
 minutitos there is no nervis then 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 you have to have the water already prepared here 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.440
 also we were reducing our 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.380
 good 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.320
 for the patio we are doing them 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.170
 kits with few ingredients already 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.870
 It tastes delicious if you want to grind 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 the carrot can also be liquefied 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.970
 with these ingredients and if not then that 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.510
 back there 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.120
 this tomato looks good eh 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.120
 what would we do if I had bone tomato 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.709
 haiti good john hears squeaky breakfast 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.709
 clowns 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:59.810
 today the fattening clown does not need good 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.340
 we are going to brown the tomatoes a little bit and 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.940
 that are golden we are going to put 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.220
 To who 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.640
 of a point for the blender or if we 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.640
 let's 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.510
 put them in the blender 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.030
 Today begins to bite that is chilito 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.390
 There is no doubt that for Mexican cuisine 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.450
 you have to have windows 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.989
 shine the kitchen 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:38.150
 then go there almost almost almost that 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:41.000
 I'm going to return my pan to the fire and 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.330
 we will do is we will I think 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.530
 that is going to want water right now 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.260
 surely he's going to want water, we're going 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.560
 to put so much water on it because it does not 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.150
 you say come a little bit of water for 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.750
 liquefy the beech and lower it is worth and now if 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.740
 I give this chest 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.740
 concentrated 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.590
 and is responding 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.630
 and I will have gone down well good while 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.620
 liquefy I'm going to put the carrots here 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.620
 little bit 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.940
 and it goes little by little and good the carrot 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.740
 They are also a rich source of 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.010
 antioxidants that we look for supplements 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.840
 food 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.090
 then supplements do not sell them like that 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.670
 like the eighth wonder and this is going 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.280
 to rejuvenate and not to stain 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.230
 true with healthy dishes that have 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.570
 many colors we are going to 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.980
 ensure that we will not need 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.110
 food supplements apart 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.020
 remember that there are supplements that if 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.080
 they have no calories not then they 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.720
 you add calories to your traditional diet 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.090
 and then we do not like to kill and read and 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.009
 they already good with the carrot here 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.749
 little bit golden we are going to 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.749
 to throw the sauce 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.600
 these are Lidl and see how easy 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.790
 it smells rich that maybe right now they're going to 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.090
 come from the sports forum and we are going to 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:26.740
 say that from eating to onetti to school 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:29.230
 hide yourself hahaha nietito is a cute 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.610
 really good or that is already here 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.759
 frying a little 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.969
 excites me and now is when we go to 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.710
 add our faces now options 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.919
 because maybe they do not like them 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.169
 can put fish fillets 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.469
 fish are not normalitos can 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.740
 put shrimp or it can be this is 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:54.050
 also not a little bit like that 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.969
 some little things that are 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.870
 seems that they are not fancy callus 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:01.280
 ax shriek an ax callus 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.780
 this can you put what 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.090
 want to say passions can be done 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.830
 with what you prefer and then in 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.030
 this time we are going to do it with a 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.320
 little of 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.080
 hyde to light 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:20.100

 mike wants chicharrÃ³n 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.760
 visited fish not 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.250
 and let's let it boil a little 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.200
 crab and what we are going to do at the end 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.540
 is to add water to make it 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.040
 calldito now there is another option I already 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:44.160
 I have my water boiling here 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.710
 and the only thing I'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.760
 pass this ready 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.760
 this water 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.289
 and smells delicious and I'll let 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:00.409
 boil and believe this you throw 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.869
 lemon 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:05.119
 we threw to this one it happened to him that not to have 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:06.569
 little bit of peace or tea and he thinks that I 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:11.009
 I forgot 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:13.139
 salt and pepper about two teaspoons and 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:17.309
 already and let it boil quietly of 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:19.469
 this I believe that already is and that and that a 

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:22.529
 that while the actions are cooled not 

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:27.910
 You're listening to the little glass with chilito 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:30.010
 I do not want to pick them and speaker 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.230
 yes the truth that yes today we have seen a 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.940
 cut we do not come back and apart we come with
