bit of fun with also in the v8 in the

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.920 
bit of fun with also in the v8 in the
front<00:05:50.250> of<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.430> car<00:05:50.610> it's<00:05:51.180> got<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.480> ute<00:05:51.630> brakes

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930

from<00:05:52.560> the<00:05:52.680> racing<00:05:53.010> Utes<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.460> stage<00:05:53.700> so<00:05:54.240> I

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
from the racing Utes of the stage so I

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.790 
from the racing Utes of the stage so I
think<00:05:54.360> that's<00:05:54.630> one<00:05:54.810> area<00:05:54.990> that<00:05:55.140> potentially

think that's one area that potentially

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.160 
think that's one area that potentially
needs<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:56.070> little<00:05:56.220> more<00:05:56.400> work<00:05:56.610> but<00:05:57.330> overall

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
needs a little more work but overall

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.170 
needs a little more work but overall
it's<00:05:58.560> still<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.830> pretty<00:05:59.340> good<00:05:59.430> package<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.000> far

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
it's still a pretty good package so far
