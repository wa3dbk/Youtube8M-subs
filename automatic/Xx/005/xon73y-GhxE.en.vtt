have to do it is measure the length of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.689 
have to do it is measure the length of
your<00:00:54.000> course<00:00:54.239> how<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.290> works<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> stand

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
your course how it works it is the stand

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.210 
your course how it works it is the stand
at<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> center<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.480> core<00:00:57.949> straight<00:00:58.949> up

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
at the center of your core straight up

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.870 
at the center of your core straight up
or<00:00:59.400> lift<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.480> hand<00:01:00.720> and<00:01:01.250> your<00:01:02.250> handles<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
or lift up your hand and your handles of

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.520 
or lift up your hand and your handles of
rope<00:01:03.060> actual<00:01:03.420> should<00:01:03.630> be<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:03.989> children<00:01:04.350> well

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
rope actual should be at children well

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
rope actual should be at children well
but<00:01:05.399> as<00:01:05.520> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:06.000> my<00:01:06.240> handles<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> little

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but as you can see my handles a little

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
but as you can see my handles a little
bit<00:01:07.229> lower<00:01:07.410> because<00:01:08.190> my<00:01:08.520> shorts<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.970> shorter

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
bit lower because my shorts are shorter

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
bit lower because my shorts are shorter
when<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.259> shorter<00:01:10.649> cord<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.130> allow<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
when you have shorter cord it allow you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
when you have shorter cord it allow you
to<00:01:11.550> jump<00:01:11.880> faster<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> total<00:01:13.320> motion

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to jump faster because the total motion

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.040 
to jump faster because the total motion
is<00:01:13.920> wet<00:01:14.160> second<00:01:15.090> step<00:01:15.300> is<00:01:15.450> fellow<00:01:15.630> champ

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
is wet second step is fellow champ

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.719 
is wet second step is fellow champ
it<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.290> help<00:01:16.470> secure<00:01:16.649> champ<00:01:17.160> is<00:01:17.280> same<00:01:17.490> rate

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it will help secure champ is same rate

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:27.570 
it will help secure champ is same rate

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
as you can see when I'm camping I'm not

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.720 
as you can see when I'm camping I'm not
jump<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.840> very<00:02:15.020> high<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:16.190> should<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.520> just

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
jump is very high it should be just

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.670 
jump is very high it should be just
enough<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.030> make<00:02:17.390> sure<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.780> you're<00:02:18.020> off<00:02:18.170> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
enough to make sure that you're off the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.100 
enough to make sure that you're off the
four<00:02:19.070> can<00:02:19.310> go<00:02:19.490> through<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.910> through<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.900> gap

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
four can go through it through the gap

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.670 
four can go through it through the gap
and<00:02:22.060> don't<00:02:23.060> try<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:23.720> punch<00:02:23.990> champs<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.590> a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
and don't try and do punch champs in a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740 
and don't try and do punch champs in a
row<00:02:24.830> when<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.670> will<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:25.970> able<00:02:26.090> perform<00:02:26.570> ten

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
row when you will be able perform ten

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.310 
row when you will be able perform ten
jams<00:02:27.020> make<00:02:27.890> next<00:02:28.310> log<00:02:28.490> run<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> down<00:02:29.300> but<00:02:30.230> if

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
jams make next log run it down but if

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.190 
jams make next log run it down but if
you<00:02:30.410> do<00:02:30.560> 20<00:02:30.860> jam<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.550> keep<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.970> champ<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.870> so

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
you do 20 jam to keep the champ and so

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.730 
you do 20 jam to keep the champ and so
on<00:02:37.360> second<00:02:38.360> technique<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.990> an<00:02:39.290> elusive

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
on second technique is an elusive
