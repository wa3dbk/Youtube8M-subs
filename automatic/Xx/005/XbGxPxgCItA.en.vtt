rounds per minute the mag size is 30

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.650 
rounds per minute the mag size is 30
plus<00:00:57.530> 1<00:00:57.710> in<00:00:57.830> chamber<00:00:58.220> and<00:00:58.520> then<00:00:58.850> read<00:00:59.240> the<00:00:59.270> fast

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
plus 1 in chamber and then read the fast

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.630 
plus 1 in chamber and then read the fast
reload<00:00:59.930> speed<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:00.380> 2.1<00:01:00.950> when<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.250> got<00:01:01.370> bullets

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
reload speed is 2.1 when you got bullets

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.539 
reload speed is 2.1 when you got bullets
chambered<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:03.230> mt<00:01:03.530> reload<00:01:03.830> is<00:01:03.980> 3.1

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
chambered and the mt reload is 3.1

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.950 
chambered and the mt reload is 3.1
seconds<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.059> it's<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.210> pretty<00:01:05.390> fast<00:01:05.630> reload

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
seconds so it's a pretty fast reload

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.460 
seconds so it's a pretty fast reload
compared<00:01:06.409> to<00:01:06.590> most<00:01:07.040> other<00:01:07.400> assault<00:01:08.000> rifles<00:01:08.470> so

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
compared to most other assault rifles so

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.640 
compared to most other assault rifles so
the<00:01:09.560> recoil<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.130> got<00:01:10.310> nor<00:01:10.579> point<00:01:10.880> 36<00:01:11.540> up<00:01:11.840> recoil

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the recoil is got nor point 36 up recoil

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.800 
the recoil is got nor point 36 up recoil
vertical<00:01:13.369> recoil<00:01:13.490> no<00:01:14.240> problem<00:01:14.509> on<00:01:14.630> five

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
vertical recoil no problem on five

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.990 
vertical recoil no problem on five
recall<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.440> left<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.950> 1.25<00:01:16.460> pull<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.970> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
recall to the left and 1.25 pull to the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.540 
recall to the left and 1.25 pull to the
right<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.500> first<00:01:18.740> shot<00:01:18.920> multiplier<00:01:19.040> is

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
right and the first shot multiplier is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.450 
right and the first shot multiplier is
do<00:01:19.850> this<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.930> when<00:01:21.230> you<00:01:21.350> first<00:01:21.680> buy<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.220> first

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
do this so when you first buy that first

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.220 
do this so when you first buy that first
bullet<00:01:22.670> then<00:01:22.970> we'll<00:01:23.240> multiply<00:01:23.480> three<00:01:23.870> core<00:01:24.050> by

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
bullet then we'll multiply three core by

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.870 
bullet then we'll multiply three core by
two<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.190> it's<00:01:25.280> got<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.430> pretty<00:01:25.610> manageable

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
two so it's got a pretty manageable

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.460 
two so it's got a pretty manageable
recoil<00:01:26.420> for<00:01:26.570> an<00:01:26.659> assault<00:01:26.840> rifle<00:01:26.930> like<00:01:27.229> this

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
recoil for an assault rifle like this

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.469 
recoil for an assault rifle like this
and<00:01:28.130> as<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.340> can<00:01:28.490> see<00:01:28.520> i'm<00:01:28.729> easily<00:01:29.030> able<00:01:29.300> to

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
and as you can see i'm easily able to

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.450 
and as you can see i'm easily able to
pick<00:01:29.630> off<00:01:29.780> enemies<00:01:30.050> at<00:01:30.530> ranges<00:01:31.040> during<00:01:31.370> this

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
pick off enemies at ranges during this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.330 
pick off enemies at ranges during this
game<00:01:32.110> now<00:01:33.110> as<00:01:33.200> far<00:01:33.350> as<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> damage<00:01:33.860> starts<00:01:34.159> go

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
game now as far as the damage starts go

attachments<00:01:56.990> i<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.260> to<00:01:57.380> use<00:01:57.409> are<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.369> coyote

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.850 
attachments i like to use are the coyote
site<00:01:59.090> that's<00:01:59.960> really<00:02:00.229> good<00:02:00.380> on<00:02:00.530> this<00:02:00.619> gun

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
site that's really good on this gun

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.800 
site that's really good on this gun
because<00:02:01.159> it's<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.549> Chinese<00:02:01.880> weapon<00:02:02.210> therefore

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
because it's a Chinese weapon therefore

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.109 
because it's a Chinese weapon therefore
meaning<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.440> unlock<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.460> core<00:02:04.670> 80<00:02:04.790> site

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
meaning that you unlock the core 80 site

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.510 
meaning that you unlock the core 80 site
instead<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.260> red<00:02:06.440> dot<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.830> start<00:02:07.100> with<00:02:07.220> or

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
instead of the red dot to start with or

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.680 
instead of the red dot to start with or
the<00:02:07.610> Cobra

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
the Cobra

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.510 
the Cobra
and<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.320> think<00:02:09.740> I'm<00:02:09.890> still<00:02:10.070> playing<00:02:10.250> around

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
and I think I'm still playing around

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.770 
and I think I'm still playing around
with<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.729> but<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.000> think<00:02:11.030> that's<00:02:11.390> my<00:02:11.540> favorite

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
with it but I think that's my favorite

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.140 
with it but I think that's my favorite
site<00:02:12.740> of<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:14.260> then<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.500> have<00:02:15.680> as<00:02:16.150> my

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
site of the and then we have as my

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.200 
site of the and then we have as my
choice<00:02:17.570> for<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.990> gadget<00:02:18.920> on<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.430> choose<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
choice for the gadget on it I choose the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.450 
choice for the gadget on it I choose the
laser<00:02:20.480> sight<00:02:20.750> basically<00:02:21.620> because<00:02:21.920> it<00:02:22.220> allows

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
laser sight basically because it allows

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.540 
laser sight basically because it allows
people<00:02:22.490> in<00:02:23.000> my<00:02:23.120> hip<00:02:23.360> fire<00:02:23.600> accuracy<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:25.070> I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
people in my hip fire accuracy and I

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.650 
people in my hip fire accuracy and I
just<00:02:25.700> think<00:02:25.880> that's<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.090> good<00:02:26.240> thing<00:02:26.300> with<00:02:26.600> this

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
just think that's a good thing with this

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.120 
just think that's a good thing with this
weapon<00:02:26.870> because<00:02:27.410> in<00:02:27.560> close<00:02:27.710> range<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:28.100> can

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
weapon because in close range you can

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.590 
weapon because in close range you can
drop<00:02:28.430> enemies<00:02:28.880> pretty<00:02:29.210> quick<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.540> that

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
drop enemies pretty quick with that

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.830 
drop enemies pretty quick with that
highway<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.080> fire<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:31.730> for<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.450> underbarrel

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
highway to fire now for the underbarrel

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.170 
highway to fire now for the underbarrel
not<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> for<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.100> underbarrel<00:02:34.400> i<00:02:34.610> choose<00:02:34.910> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
not the for the underbarrel i choose to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.090 
not the for the underbarrel i choose to
use<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.330> stubby<00:02:35.630> grip<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.710> reason<00:02:36.950> for

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
use a stubby grip and the reason for

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.590 
use a stubby grip and the reason for
this<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.430> because<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.660> decreases<00:02:38.900> your<00:02:39.410> M

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
this is because it it decreases your M

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.740 
this is because it it decreases your M
the<00:02:41.600> increases<00:02:42.080> your<00:02:42.170> accuracy<00:02:42.560> therefore<00:02:43.400> we

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
the increases your accuracy therefore we

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.870 
the increases your accuracy therefore we
reduce<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.780> penalty<00:02:45.290> for<00:02:45.440> automatic<00:02:46.280> fire<00:02:46.490> so

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
reduce the penalty for automatic fire so

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.150 
reduce the penalty for automatic fire so
you<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.540> spray<00:02:47.930> enemies<00:02:48.290> down<00:02:48.470> much<00:02:48.800> easier

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
you can spray enemies down much easier

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.080 
you can spray enemies down much easier
along<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.430> distances<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:51.890> finally<00:02:52.580> the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
along the distances and then finally the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.570 
along the distances and then finally the
barrel<00:02:53.570> attachment<00:02:53.800> there's<00:02:54.800> two<00:02:55.250> things<00:02:55.430> I

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
barrel attachment there's two things I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.910 
barrel attachment there's two things I
like<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.760> use<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.270> it's<00:02:56.540> either<00:02:56.920> no

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
like to use this it's either no

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.350 
like to use this it's either no
attachment<00:02:58.460> because<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.000> don't<00:02:59.180> want<00:02:59.210> the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
attachment because I don't want the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.160 
attachment because I don't want the
penalty<00:02:59.720> or<00:02:59.900> suppressor<00:03:01.330> because<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.510> think<00:03:02.660> I

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
penalty or suppressor because I think I

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.230 
penalty or suppressor because I think I
use<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.770> rush<00:03:03.980> when<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.760> want<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.030> flank

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
use that in rush when I want to flank

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.610 
use that in rush when I want to flank
enemies<00:03:05.630> because<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.020> think<00:03:06.200> that's<00:03:06.320> a<00:03:06.410> great

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
enemies because I think that's a great

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.010 
enemies because I think that's a great
choice<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.220> weapon<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.610> use<00:03:07.640> for<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.090> so

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
choice of weapon to use for that so

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.060 
choice of weapon to use for that so
that's<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.350> conclude<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.770> weapon

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
that's going to conclude this weapon

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.340 
that's going to conclude this weapon
