introducing<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.049> 2013<00:00:16.049> voodoo<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.910> Voodoo

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
introducing the 2013 voodoo the Voodoo

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
introducing the 2013 voodoo the Voodoo
construction<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.560> made<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.160> composite

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
construction is made of a composite

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.970 
construction is made of a composite
handle<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.689> an<00:00:21.779> aluminum<00:00:21.960> barrel<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
handle to an aluminum barrel so a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.490 
handle to an aluminum barrel so a
two-piece<00:00:23.400> construction<00:00:23.840> it<00:00:24.840> does<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.260> our

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
two-piece construction it does have our

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
two-piece construction it does have our
new<00:00:25.680> handle<00:00:26.070> which<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.640> tr3<00:00:27.180> flow

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
new handle which is the tr3 flow

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.939 
new handle which is the tr3 flow
composite<00:00:28.019> meaning<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.820> new<00:00:29.939> composite<00:00:30.949> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
composite meaning the new composite the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.130 
composite meaning the new composite the
way<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.279> designed<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.850> year<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
way it was designed this year is that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
way it was designed this year is that
it's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.590> fused<00:00:34.980> layer<00:00:35.250> composite<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it's a fused layer composite so the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's a fused layer composite so the
composite<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.469> way<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.250> laid<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.670> thinner

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
composite the way we laid it's thinner

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.420 
composite the way we laid it's thinner
and<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.450> lighter<00:00:39.860> at<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.920> same<00:00:41.190> time

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and it's lighter at the same time

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
and it's lighter at the same time

the Voodoo or on the D Marini line the
end<00:01:11.280> caps<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.760> different<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.900> designed

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
end caps are different they are designed

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.640 
end caps are different they are designed
based<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> handle<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.570> barrel<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.560> we

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
based on the handle and the barrel so we

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
based on the handle and the barrel so we
try<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> tune<00:01:17.130> everything<00:01:17.630> for<00:01:18.630> that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
try to tune everything for that

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.580 
try to tune everything for that
particular<00:01:19.229> model<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.840> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> Voodoo<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
particular model this on the Voodoo it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.249 
particular model this on the Voodoo it
is<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> eye<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.340> end<00:01:23.700> cap<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> eye<00:01:25.140> on

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
is a eye on end cap and what this eye on

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
is a eye on end cap and what this eye on
end<00:01:25.409> cap<00:01:25.560> does<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> helps<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:27.330> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
end cap does is that it helps when that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.999 
end cap does is that it helps when that
energy<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.960> transferred<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:28.590> towards<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
energy is transferred down towards the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
energy is transferred down towards the

end of the barrel through the swing and
when<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> makes<00:01:31.650> impact<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> ball

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
when it makes impact and the ball

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.380 
when it makes impact and the ball
trampolines<00:01:33.600> off<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.049> keeps<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:35.299> keeps<00:01:36.299> all

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
trampolines off it keeps this keeps all

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.380 
trampolines off it keeps this keeps all
the<00:01:36.540> energy<00:01:37.400> down<00:01:38.400> back<00:01:38.670> through<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> barrel

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the energy down back through the barrel

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.929 
the energy down back through the barrel
so<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.810> doesn't<00:01:40.140> escape<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.130> trying<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> create

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
so it doesn't escape so trying to create

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.990 
so it doesn't escape so trying to create
all<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> energy<00:01:43.280> down<00:01:44.280> back<00:01:44.640> through<00:01:44.909> the
