but shows you every card from I think
the<00:01:21.060> flash<00:01:21.420> fire<00:01:22.220> equivalent<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.509> see

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the flash fire equivalent you can see

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.350 
the flash fire equivalent you can see
all<00:01:24.840> full<00:01:25.710> arts<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.250> stuff<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> set<00:01:27.150> there

all full arts and stuff in the set there

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
all full arts and stuff in the set there
so<00:01:27.600> those<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> cards<00:01:28.470> appear<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.950> flash

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
so those are the cards appear in flash

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.580 
so those are the cards appear in flash
fire<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.970> used<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> good<00:01:30.990> majority<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> em<00:01:31.470> I

now<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:14.310> problem<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.819> in<00:02:14.969> this<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
now the problem we get in this one is a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.910 
now the problem we get in this one is a
chest<00:02:15.900> but<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.079> can<00:02:16.200> zoom<00:02:16.379> in<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.799> we're

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
chest but I can zoom in now that we're

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.699 
chest but I can zoom in now that we're
down<00:02:17.219> to<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.370> pack<00:02:17.700> portion<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:19.170> yet<00:02:19.349> month

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
down to the pack portion so yet month

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.990 
down to the pack portion so yet month
one<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.489> three

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
one of three

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.750 
one of three
I<00:02:21.109> love<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.230> starters<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.769> foil<00:02:23.189> Pro<00:02:23.430> this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I love the starters as a foil Pro this

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.640 
I love the starters as a foil Pro this
is<00:02:23.969> from<00:02:24.329> old<00:02:24.480> 0:34<00:02:25.079> /xy<00:02:25.859> -<00:02:26.640> P<00:02:27.409> it's<00:02:28.409> a<00:02:28.470> very

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
is from old 0:34 /xy - P it's a very

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.440 
is from old 0:34 /xy - P it's a very
cool<00:02:28.950> foil<00:02:29.370> arbor<00:02:29.760> yep<00:02:29.909> that's<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:31.260> pretty

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
cool foil arbor yep that's it's pretty

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.300 
cool foil arbor yep that's it's pretty
looks<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.689> fancy<00:02:34.170> than<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.530> American<00:02:35.099> ones

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
looks more fancy than the American ones

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.629 
looks more fancy than the American ones
so<00:02:35.700> let's<00:02:35.879> see<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.540> got<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.870> flash<00:02:37.109> fires

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
so let's see here we got the flash fires

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.750 
so let's see here we got the flash fires
oops

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
oops

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.470 
oops
flash<00:02:39.209> fire<00:02:39.450> X<00:02:39.989> Y<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:41.069> think<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.150> usually<00:02:42.269> have

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
flash fire X Y I think they usually have

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.149 
flash fire X Y I think they usually have
like<00:02:42.629> half<00:02:42.959> sets<00:02:43.260> compared<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> ours<00:02:43.739> again

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
like half sets compared to ours again

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.500 
like half sets compared to ours again
I'm<00:02:44.250> not<00:02:44.400> super<00:02:44.790> familiar<00:02:44.879> with<00:02:45.150> Japanese

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
I'm not super familiar with Japanese

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.149 
I'm not super familiar with Japanese
stuff<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.930> again<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.409> my<00:02:46.530> first<00:02:46.769> video<00:02:47.099> for

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
stuff this again is my first video for

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.339 
stuff this again is my first video for
it<00:02:47.489> so<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:48.269> knowledge<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:48.720> limit<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.260> yeah

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
it so my knowledge we limit so yeah

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.710 
it so my knowledge we limit so yeah
these<00:02:49.470> are<00:02:49.620> both<00:02:49.739> XY<00:02:50.159> one<00:02:50.459> I'm<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.389> sure<00:02:51.659> if

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
these are both XY one I'm not sure if

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.479 
these are both XY one I'm not sure if
you<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:51.870> toy<00:02:52.049> tipping<00:02:52.319> cards<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.650> each<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:53.280> I

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
you get toy tipping cards in each but I

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.849 
you get toy tipping cards in each but I
guess<00:02:53.849> we'll<00:02:54.060> small<00:02:54.689> probably<00:02:55.470> really<00:02:55.650> tell

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
guess we'll small probably really tell

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.589 
guess we'll small probably really tell
from<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.129> limited<00:02:56.340> packs<00:02:56.549> but<00:02:56.849> that's<00:02:57.269> XY<00:02:57.540> -

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
from the limited packs but that's XY -

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.559 
from the limited packs but that's XY -
so<00:02:57.959> flash<00:02:58.260> fire<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:59.370> we'll<00:02:59.639> go<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.760> order<00:02:59.970> X<00:03:00.180> Y

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
so flash fire so we'll go to order X Y

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.580 
so flash fire so we'll go to order X Y
flash<00:03:01.290> fire<00:03:01.819> let's<00:03:02.819> see<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.419> there's<00:03:03.900> no<00:03:04.079> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
flash fire let's see so there's no I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.140 
flash fire let's see so there's no I
guess<00:03:05.099> there<00:03:05.189> is<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.459> little<00:03:05.760> preparation

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
guess there is a little preparation

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.470 
guess there is a little preparation
there<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.810> enough<00:03:07.519> said<00:03:08.519> get<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.849> there<00:03:09.060> not

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
there just enough said get in there not

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.610 
there just enough said get in there not
sure<00:03:09.569> that's<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.840> best<00:03:09.870> way<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.260> open<00:03:10.530> them

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
sure that's the best way to open them

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.349 
sure that's the best way to open them
but<00:03:10.799> we'll<00:03:11.040> kind<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.430> figure<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.879> as<00:03:12.030> we<00:03:12.090> go

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
but we'll kind of figure it out as we go

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.360 
but we'll kind of figure it out as we go
here<00:03:12.569> I<00:03:12.629> suppose<00:03:13.049> day<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.530> don't<00:03:14.040> know<00:03:14.189> many

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
here I suppose day I don't know many

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.339 
here I suppose day I don't know many
