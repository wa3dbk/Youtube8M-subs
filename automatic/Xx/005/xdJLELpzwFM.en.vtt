00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.959 

so<00:00:10.059> we've<00:00:10.299> spent<00:00:10.629> some<00:00:10.809> time<00:00:11.820> adjusting<00:00:12.820> the

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
so we've spent some time adjusting the

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.580 
so we've spent some time adjusting the
hinges<00:00:13.450> so<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.940> top<00:00:15.940> and<00:00:16.180> bottom<00:00:16.360> rest<00:00:17.290> nicely

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
hinges so the top and bottom rest nicely

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.130 
hinges so the top and bottom rest nicely
against<00:00:18.160> itself<00:00:18.460> so<00:00:19.119> we've<00:00:19.240> had<00:00:19.330> to<00:00:19.509> play<00:00:19.869> with

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
against itself so we've had to play with

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.650 
against itself so we've had to play with
the<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.650> distance<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.669> gap<00:00:21.849> glasses<00:00:22.450> from

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
the the distance the gap glasses from

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.200 
the the distance the gap glasses from
the<00:00:22.779> wall<00:00:22.990> by<00:00:23.770> moving<00:00:24.099> the<00:00:24.310> hinges<00:00:24.730> this<00:00:25.000> way

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
the wall by moving the hinges this way

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.999 
the wall by moving the hinges this way
that<00:00:25.509> was<00:00:25.660> important<00:00:26.140> then<00:00:26.259> re<00:00:26.470> tightening

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
that was important then re tightening

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.370 
that was important then re tightening
the<00:00:27.130> screws<00:00:27.460> and<00:00:27.790> then<00:00:28.599> we've<00:00:28.809> adjusted<00:00:28.960> the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
the screws and then we've adjusted the

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.410 
the screws and then we've adjusted the
shims<00:00:30.090> such<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:32.590> have<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:33.309> gap<00:00:33.969> in<00:00:34.239> this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
shims such that we have a gap in this

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.150 
shims such that we have a gap in this
end<00:00:34.719> which<00:00:35.079> will<00:00:35.290> accommodate<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.890> seal

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
end which will accommodate the seal

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.060 
end which will accommodate the seal
which<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.850> bit<00:00:37.480> under<00:00:37.750> 3/8<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:38.620> can't<00:00:38.890> get

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
which is a bit under 3/8 you can't get

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.549 
which is a bit under 3/8 you can't get
go<00:00:39.340> much<00:00:39.550> less<00:00:39.879> than<00:00:40.090> that<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.570> then<00:00:41.199> we've

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
go much less than that and then we've

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.150 
go much less than that and then we've
had<00:00:41.589> to<00:00:42.120> put<00:00:43.120> more<00:00:43.329> shims<00:00:43.660> on<00:00:43.899> at<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:44.230> end<00:00:44.499> in

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
had to put more shims on at this end in

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.840 
had to put more shims on at this end in
order<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.579> accommodate<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:47.010> odd<00:00:48.010> lie<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.820> the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
order to accommodate the odd lie of the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.970 
order to accommodate the odd lie of the
tub<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.539> wall<00:00:49.719> this<00:00:49.989> this<00:00:50.320> setup<00:00:50.649> is

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
tub and the wall this this setup is

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.049 
tub and the wall this this setup is
actually<00:00:51.570> probably<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.749> worst-case<00:00:53.109> scenario

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
actually probably a worst-case scenario

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.880 
actually probably a worst-case scenario
but<00:00:55.059> now<00:00:55.749> we're<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.079> position<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.589> be<00:00:56.710> able<00:00:56.800> to

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
but now we're in position to be able to

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.610 
but now we're in position to be able to
mark<00:00:57.069> the<00:00:57.219> holes<00:00:57.460> up<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:59.019> last<00:00:59.199> thing<00:00:59.409> we

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
mark the holes up and the last thing we

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.910 
mark the holes up and the last thing we
need<00:00:59.769> to<00:00:59.800> make<00:01:00.100> sure<00:01:00.159> is<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.120> glass<00:01:01.390> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
need to make sure is that the glass is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.580 
need to make sure is that the glass is
level<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.579> way<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.989> I'm<00:01:05.050> just<00:01:05.229> going<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.440> hold

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
level this way so I'm just going to hold

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.550 
level this way so I'm just going to hold
the<00:01:05.650> spirit<00:01:06.010> level<00:01:06.370> up<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.930> then<00:01:11.229> we'll<00:01:11.380> move

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
the spirit level up and then we'll move

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.190 
the spirit level up and then we'll move
it<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.800> tweak<00:01:12.220> if<00:01:12.579> needs<00:01:13.090> be<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.840> we're<00:01:14.020> ready

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
it a tweak if needs be and we're ready

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.389 
it a tweak if needs be and we're ready
to<00:01:14.409> do<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> drilling<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.810> way<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.409> stop<00:01:18.130> the

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
to do the drilling one way to stop the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.389 
to do the drilling one way to stop the
dust<00:01:19.119> going<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.659> do<00:01:19.810> this<00:01:19.960> thicker<00:01:20.399> polythene

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
dust going to do this thicker polythene

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.840 
dust going to do this thicker polythene
bag<00:01:21.790> underneath<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.570> drill<00:01:22.810> slots<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:24.219> catch

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
bag underneath the drill slots to catch

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.870 
bag underneath the drill slots to catch
it<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.320> then<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.740> couple<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.039> safety<00:01:27.280> warnings

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
it and then a couple of safety warnings

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.170 
it and then a couple of safety warnings
number<00:01:28.750> one<00:01:29.640> make<00:01:30.640> sure<00:01:30.850> there's<00:01:31.060> no

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
number one make sure there's no

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
number one make sure there's no
electrical<00:01:31.810> or<00:01:32.469> plumbing<00:01:33.030> behind<00:01:34.030> this

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
electrical or plumbing behind this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.200 
electrical or plumbing behind this
hopefully<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.860> toilet<00:01:36.340> will<00:01:36.490> have<00:01:36.700> said<00:01:37.000> that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
hopefully the toilet will have said that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.149 
hopefully the toilet will have said that
they're<00:01:37.689> backing<00:01:38.049> in<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.200> set<00:01:38.590> up<00:01:38.799> such<00:01:39.130> that

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
they're backing in the set up such that

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.830 
they're backing in the set up such that
that's<00:01:39.820> what<00:01:40.090> you're<00:01:40.240> going<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.479> drill<00:01:40.659> into

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
that's what you're going to drill into

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.510 
that's what you're going to drill into
but<00:01:41.229> make<00:01:41.439> sure<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:41.829> have<00:01:41.979> nothing<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.430> the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
but make sure you have nothing in the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.429 
but make sure you have nothing in the
way<00:01:42.670> otherwise<00:01:42.939> you'll<00:01:43.270> have<00:01:43.299> a<00:01:43.479> disaster<00:01:44.380> on

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
way otherwise you'll have a disaster on

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.529 
way otherwise you'll have a disaster on
your<00:01:44.590> hands<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.070> then<00:01:45.670> number<00:01:45.909> two<00:01:46.240> make<00:01:46.509> sure

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
your hands and then number two make sure

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.420 
your hands and then number two make sure
you<00:01:46.990> wear<00:01:47.229> safety<00:01:47.530> glasses<00:01:47.859> when<00:01:48.159> you're

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
you wear safety glasses when you're

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.170 
you wear safety glasses when you're
drilling<00:01:48.609> the<00:01:48.789> holes

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
drilling the holes

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.419 
drilling the holes
okay<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:49.600> we're<00:01:49.960> drilling<00:01:50.439> into<00:01:50.859> porcelain

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
okay so we're drilling into porcelain

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.069 
okay so we're drilling into porcelain
tiles<00:01:51.850> it's<00:01:51.969> very<00:01:52.390> hard<00:01:52.750> very<00:01:53.619> easy<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.130> crack

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
tiles it's very hard very easy to crack

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.800 
tiles it's very hard very easy to crack
so<00:01:56.079> what<00:01:56.619> we're<00:01:56.829> using<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.609> an<00:01:58.030> electric<00:01:58.570> drill

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
so what we're using is an electric drill

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.349 
so what we're using is an electric drill
battery<00:01:59.530> power<00:01:59.740> drills<00:02:00.130> don't<00:02:00.429> turn<00:02:00.880> fast

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
battery power drills don't turn fast

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.289 
battery power drills don't turn fast
enough<00:02:01.719> I<00:02:02.109> don't<00:02:02.409> think<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.759> recommend

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
enough I don't think so I recommend

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.020 
enough I don't think so I recommend
electric<00:02:04.749> drill<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.469> then<00:02:06.219> starting<00:02:06.820> with<00:02:06.999> a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
electric drill and then starting with a

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.969 
electric drill and then starting with a
small<00:02:07.270> bit<00:02:07.929> to<00:02:08.170> just<00:02:08.410> get<00:02:08.619> through<00:02:08.830> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
small bit to just get through the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.460 
small bit to just get through the
surface<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.610> tile<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.270> then<00:02:10.899> using

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
surface of the tile and then using

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.190 
surface of the tile and then using
actually<00:02:12.340> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
actually a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.360 
actually a
masonry<00:02:14.160> bit<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:15.120> get<00:02:15.300> into<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:16.500> natural

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
masonry bit to get into this for natural

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.990 
masonry bit to get into this for natural
stone<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.390> probably<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.680> use<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.310> carbide<00:02:20.700> set

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
stone you probably can use a carbide set

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.920 
stone you probably can use a carbide set
drill<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.500> one<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:23.220> have<00:02:23.760> found<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.390> hammer

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
drill this one we have found that hammer

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.260 
drill this one we have found that hammer
action<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:26.160> necessary<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
action is is necessary to get to the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.570 
action is is necessary to get to the
town<00:02:27.630> button<00:02:27.960> dangerous<00:02:28.680> our<00:02:28.890> action<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.430> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
town button dangerous our action is that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.510 
town button dangerous our action is that
you<00:02:29.700> break<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.000> tiles<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.620> any<00:02:31.770> case<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
you break the tiles so in any case you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.000 
you break the tiles so in any case you
have<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.000> drill<00:02:33.300> really<00:02:33.750> carefully<00:02:34.440> when

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
have to drill really carefully when

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.710 
have to drill really carefully when
you're<00:02:35.130> doing<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:35.760> very<00:02:36.030> very<00:02:36.330> easy<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
you're doing this it's very very easy to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:59.360 
you're doing this it's very very easy to
create<00:02:36.930> ours

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.370 

so<00:03:00.370> after<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.880> holes<00:03:01.480> are<00:03:01.690> drilled<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:02.110> put

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
so after the holes are drilled we put

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.620 
so after the holes are drilled we put
the<00:03:02.560> shower<00:03:03.250> screen<00:03:03.640> back<00:03:03.880> into<00:03:04.150> position

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the shower screen back into position

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.380 
the shower screen back into position
shinb<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.830> up<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.400> right<00:03:06.610> height<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.060> that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
shinb it up to the right height so that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.030 
shinb it up to the right height so that
all<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.600> holes<00:03:07.840> lined<00:03:08.140> up<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.650> now<00:03:08.800> we're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
all the holes lined up and now we're

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.130 
all the holes lined up and now we're
just<00:03:09.190> starting<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.660> screws<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.250> holes

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
just starting the screws into the holes

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.199 
just starting the screws into the holes
if<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.440> screws<00:03:14.830> are<00:03:15.280> too<00:03:15.550> close<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
if the screws are too close to the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.620 
if the screws are too close to the
hinges<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:17.440> can<00:03:17.650> put<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.130> edge<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.330> shim

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
hinges you can put the edge of a shim

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.610 
hinges you can put the edge of a shim
into<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.980> gap<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.320> stop

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
into the the gap just to just to stop

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.750 
into the the gap just to just to stop
the<00:03:23.650> screw

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
the screw

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.750 
the screw
scratching<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.420> hinge<00:03:25.630> as<00:03:25.959> it's<00:03:26.230> rotating<00:03:26.980> so

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
scratching the hinge as it's rotating so

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.449 
scratching the hinge as it's rotating so
here<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.660> door<00:03:29.410> screwed<00:03:30.040> up<00:03:30.220> but

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
here we have the door screwed up but

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:38.490 
here we have the door screwed up but
just<00:03:30.700> show<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.120> hinges<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.959> naturally

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
just show you the hinges it naturally

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.560 
just show you the hinges it naturally
returns<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.340> center<00:03:39.760> position<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.360> well

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
returns to the center position as well

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.229 
returns to the center position as well
so<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.800> last<00:03:41.980> thing<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.489> do<00:03:42.640> is<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:42.940> put<00:03:43.120> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
so the last thing to do is to put the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.710 
so the last thing to do is to put the
seals<00:03:43.510> on<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.500> bottom<00:03:44.890> sweep<00:03:45.190> has<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> profile

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
seals on the bottom sweep has a profile

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.259 
seals on the bottom sweep has a profile
like<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:48.220> should<00:03:48.459> go<00:03:48.610> in<00:03:48.880> towards

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
like this and this should go in towards

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.540 
like this and this should go in towards
the<00:03:49.330> tub<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:50.560> bit<00:03:50.830> hangs<00:03:51.070> down<00:03:51.340> and

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
the tub this bit hangs down and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.780 
the tub this bit hangs down and
interrupts<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.180> water<00:03:52.390> right<00:03:53.320> now<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.790> then

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
interrupts the water right now and then

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.170 
interrupts the water right now and then
we<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:55.680> three<00:03:56.680> pieces<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.190> wall<00:03:57.430> sweep<00:03:57.760> one

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
we have three pieces of wall sweep one

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.840 
we have three pieces of wall sweep one
long<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.720> two<00:03:59.170> short

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
long and two short

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.039 
long and two short
I'm<00:04:00.850> going<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.060> put<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.269> bottom<00:04:01.570> sweep<00:04:01.840> on

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
I'm going to put the bottom sweep on

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.410 
I'm going to put the bottom sweep on
first<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:03.280> then<00:04:03.670> I'm<00:04:03.790> going<00:04:03.970> to<00:04:04.000> put<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.239> wall

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
first and then I'm going to put the wall

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.380 
first and then I'm going to put the wall
sweep<00:04:04.660> on<00:04:04.870> after<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:09.100> then<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.579> push<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.209> in

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
sweep on after and then just push it in

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:23.010 
sweep on after and then just push it in
towards<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.079> wall<00:04:11.260> no<00:04:12.250> yeah<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:22.479> seal<00:04:22.750> needs

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
towards the wall no yeah the seal needs

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.190 
towards the wall no yeah the seal needs
to<00:04:23.200> be<00:04:23.320> trimmed<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.890> length<00:04:24.280> usually<00:04:25.200> this

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
to be trimmed to length usually this

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.930 
to be trimmed to length usually this
one's<00:04:26.470> at<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.680> top<00:04:26.979> this<00:04:27.160> one<00:04:27.340> doesn't<00:04:27.580> matter

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
one's at the top this one doesn't matter

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.360 
one's at the top this one doesn't matter
as<00:04:28.360> much<00:04:30.750> but<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.080> two<00:04:32.470> below<00:04:32.800> need<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.220> be

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
as much but the two below need to be

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.600 
as much but the two below need to be
pretty<00:04:34.210> pretty<00:04:34.780> exact<00:04:35.350> on<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.950> length<00:04:36.160> just

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
pretty pretty exact on the length just

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.040 
pretty pretty exact on the length just
because<00:04:37.000> there's<00:04:37.210> going<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.479> be<00:04:37.539> more<00:04:37.750> water

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
because there's going to be more water

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.469 
because there's going to be more water
up<00:04:38.350> end<00:04:38.890> up<00:04:39.160> them<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:40.630> that's<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.020> top<00:04:41.260> one

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
up end up them so that's the top one

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.890 
up end up them so that's the top one
squeezed<00:04:43.479> on<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:45.280> you'll<00:04:46.180> see<00:04:46.390> that<00:04:46.539> seals

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
squeezed on and you'll see that seals

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.760 
squeezed on and you'll see that seals
off<00:04:47.110> against<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.650> wall<00:04:49.140> push<00:04:50.140> it<00:04:50.320> right<00:04:50.500> up<00:04:50.560> to

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
off against the wall push it right up to

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.320 
off against the wall push it right up to
the<00:04:51.070> hinge

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.460 

the<00:04:57.330> bottom<00:04:57.660> one<00:04:57.810> this<00:04:57.990> is<00:04:58.170> the<00:04:58.290> most

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
the bottom one this is the most

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.620 
the bottom one this is the most
important<00:04:59.040> that<00:04:59.160> you'll<00:04:59.340> see<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.700> we've<00:04:59.880> run

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
important that you'll see that we've run

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.320 
important that you'll see that we've run
it<00:05:00.810> straight<00:05:01.170> down<00:05:01.380> onto<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.910> bottom

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
it straight down onto the the bottom

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.410 
it straight down onto the the bottom
sweep<00:05:04.160> left<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.340> box<00:05:05.520> was<00:05:05.940> sticking<00:05:06.150> inside

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
sweep left the box was sticking inside

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.140 
sweep left the box was sticking inside
the<00:05:06.840> ground<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.470> is<00:05:07.560> close<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.160> wall

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.120 

you<00:05:12.150> can<00:05:12.420> light<00:05:12.750> up<00:05:12.780> both<00:05:13.470> of<00:05:13.680> them<00:05:13.830> at<00:05:14.100> the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
you can light up both of them at the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.290 
you can light up both of them at the
bottom<00:05:14.340> but<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.640> think<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:15.000> actually<00:05:15.090> is

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
bottom but I think it actually is

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.980 
bottom but I think it actually is
slightly<00:05:15.720> better<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:17.010> run<00:05:17.580> them<00:05:17.990> straight

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
slightly better to run them straight

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:29.330 
slightly better to run them straight
across<00:05:19.290> like<00:05:19.740> this<00:05:20.180> now<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:29.130> that

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
across like this now it is and that

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.690 
across like this now it is and that
completes<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.360> installation
