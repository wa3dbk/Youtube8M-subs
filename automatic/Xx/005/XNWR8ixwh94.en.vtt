something like this because this can

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.420 
something like this because this can

I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going
to<00:03:43.690> turn<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.260> ring<00:03:44.470> light<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.859> you<00:03:44.980> guys

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
to turn on the ring light so you guys

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.640 
to turn on the ring light so you guys
can<00:03:45.340> see<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:46.120> difference<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.900> makes<00:03:46.930> and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
can see the difference that it makes and

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.710 
can see the difference that it makes and
I<00:03:47.739> know<00:03:47.799> I'm<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:47.980> little<00:03:48.100> blurry<00:03:48.549> right<00:03:48.609> now<00:03:48.790> so

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
I know I'm a little blurry right now so

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.250 
I know I'm a little blurry right now so
that<00:03:50.109> is<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.530> at<00:03:50.769> its<00:03:50.950> lowest<00:03:51.310> setting<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:53.079> I'm

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
that is it at its lowest setting and I'm

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.680 
that is it at its lowest setting and I'm
just<00:03:53.410> going<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.680> turn<00:03:53.859> it<00:03:54.040> up<00:03:54.280> all<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.640> way<00:03:54.850> so

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
just going to turn it up all the way so

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.410 
just going to turn it up all the way so
there<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.109> is<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:59.320> how<00:03:59.650> it<00:04:00.640> looks<00:04:00.700> and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
there it is so that is how it looks and

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.690 
there it is so that is how it looks and
I'm<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> little<00:04:02.200> far<00:04:02.650> away<00:04:02.859> from<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:03.579> the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
I'm a little far away from it so the

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.300 
I'm a little far away from it so the
closer<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:04.120> get<00:04:04.239> up<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.620> looks<00:04:05.890> even<00:04:06.100> a

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
closer you get up to it it looks even a

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.479 
closer you get up to it it looks even a
little<00:04:06.459> bit<00:04:06.579> more<00:04:06.880> brighter<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.769> the

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
little bit more brighter so this is the
