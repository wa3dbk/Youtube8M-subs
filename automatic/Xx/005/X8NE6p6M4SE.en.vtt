really interesting it's um how to get
the<00:00:06.089> GPU<00:00:06.930> acceleration<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:08.780> in<00:00:10.340> Photoshop<00:00:11.340> and

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
the GPU acceleration in in Photoshop and

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.900 
the GPU acceleration in in Photoshop and
After<00:00:11.790> Effects<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.929> possibly<00:00:13.830> some<00:00:14.250> more

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
After Effects and possibly some more

programs<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.660> future<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.710> Windows<00:00:17.609> XP

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
programs in the future but on Windows XP

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.810 
programs in the future but on Windows XP
64-bit<00:00:18.740> now<00:00:19.740> normally<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.369> wouldn't<00:00:20.760> work

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
64-bit now normally this wouldn't work

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.689 
64-bit now normally this wouldn't work
so<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> typical<00:00:21.630> situation<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.130> just

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
so in a typical situation here I'm just

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.540 
so in a typical situation here I'm just
going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> open<00:00:24.000> up<00:00:24.390> Photoshop<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.369> as<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
going to open up Photoshop and as you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.130 
going to open up Photoshop and as you
can<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.760> I'm<00:00:27.060> approached<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.869> message

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
can see I'm approached with this message

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.350 
can see I'm approached with this message
here<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:31.070> preferences

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
here and if I go to preferences

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.880 
here and if I go to preferences
performance<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.610> enable<00:00:35.610> OpenGL<00:00:36.239> drawing

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
performance and enable OpenGL drawing

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.880 
performance and enable OpenGL drawing
it's<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:39.149> grayed<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.500> might<00:00:40.680> be

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it's it's grayed out I know it might be

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.709 
it's it's grayed out I know it might be
a<00:00:41.070> little<00:00:41.340> confusing<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.210> theme<00:00:42.450> here

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a little confusing with my theme here

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
a little confusing with my theme here
but<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.350> confirm<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.340> try

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
but I can just confirm with you if I try

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.610 
but I can just confirm with you if I try
clicking<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.329> doesn't<00:00:45.629> work<00:00:45.780> now

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
clicking this it doesn't work now

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340 
clicking this it doesn't work now
another<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> UM<00:00:48.270> confirm<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
another little way to UM confirm this is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.189 
another little way to UM confirm this is
let's<00:00:50.100> say<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> new<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> quick

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.710 
performance tab now it detects my card I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.559 
can tick enable OpenGL drawing Advanced
Settings<00:02:38.080> okay<00:02:38.890> now<00:02:39.129> it's<00:02:39.640> basically<00:02:39.879> just<00:02:40.209> it

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
automatically enabled that so the next

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.520 
automatically enabled that so the next
time<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.000> open<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:43.780> I'm<00:02:43.989> not<00:02:44.170> going<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.379> get

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
time I open it it's I'm not going to get

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.860 
time I open it it's I'm not going to get
that<00:02:44.650> message<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.430> now<00:02:46.150> let's<00:02:46.390> say<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.569> make<00:02:46.840> a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that message and now let's say I make a

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.050 
that message and now let's say I make a
new<00:02:47.079> document<00:02:47.349> here<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.160> scribble<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:48.880> it

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
new document here and I scribble on it

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.750 
new document here and I scribble on it
now<00:02:49.540> when<00:02:49.720> i<00:02:49.750> zoom<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.440> out<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:51.400> really

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
now when i zoom in and out it's really

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.210 
now when i zoom in and out it's really
smooth<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:53.709> just<00:02:54.040> confirms<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
smooth and this just confirms that the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.550 
smooth and this just confirms that the
OpenGL<00:02:57.220> drawing<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:58.290> completely<00:02:59.290> functional

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
OpenGL drawing is completely functional

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.850 
OpenGL drawing is completely functional
and<00:03:00.390> it's<00:03:01.390> working<00:03:01.599> properly<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.560> I'll<00:03:02.680> show

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.140 
having your OpenGL acceleration in XP
64-bit<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.650> should<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.430> same<00:04:09.730> idea

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
64-bit and it should the same idea

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.150 
64-bit and it should the same idea
should<00:04:10.480> work<00:04:10.690> with<00:04:10.930> after-effects<00:04:11.680> also<00:04:12.130> I

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
should work with after-effects also I

should work with after-effects also I
haven't<00:04:12.760> tested<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.329> out<00:04:13.480> yet<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:13.720> same

haven't tested it out yet but same
principles<00:04:15.040> should<00:04:15.220> apply<00:04:15.299> anyways<00:04:16.299> enjoy

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
principles should apply anyways enjoy
