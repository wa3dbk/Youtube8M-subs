hey it's Jim again from delano Mountain
custom<00:00:02.669> models<00:00:03.030> so<00:00:03.959> I<00:00:04.500> left<00:00:05.370> off<00:00:05.580> last<00:00:05.850> time

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
custom models so I left off last time

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.770 
custom models so I left off last time
basically<00:00:08.160> by<00:00:08.400> filling<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.910> all<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.059> gaps<00:00:09.389> and

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
basically by filling in all the gaps and

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.009 
basically by filling in all the gaps and
you<00:00:10.440> can<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.800> here<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.250> already<00:00:12.019> sprayed

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
you can see here that I already sprayed

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.770 
you can see here that I already sprayed
a<00:00:13.080> whole<00:00:13.349> section<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:14.040> track<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.299> didn't<00:00:15.630> do

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
a whole section of track but I didn't do

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.000 
a whole section of track but I didn't do
the<00:00:16.080> switches<00:00:16.800> yet<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.180> want<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:19.010> set

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the switches yet so I just want to set

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.540 
the switches yet so I just want to set
the<00:00:20.039> camera<00:00:20.490> down<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> did

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the camera down here and so what I did

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.170 
the camera down here and so what I did
is<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.850> these<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.990> two<00:00:25.699> sets<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.849> triple

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
is I these are two sets of triple

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.740 
is I these are two sets of triple
switches<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.810> there<00:00:28.710> shouldn't<00:00:28.920> Harris<00:00:29.400> so

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
switches and there shouldn't Harris so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.330 
switches and there shouldn't Harris so
basically<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> need<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:32.070> make

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
basically what you need to do is make

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.250 
basically what you need to do is make
sure<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.880> points<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.630> taped<00:00:34.760> because

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
sure that the points are taped because

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.299 
sure that the points are taped because
it's<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.530> between<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:39.120> track<00:00:39.809> its<00:00:40.050> power<00:00:40.350> by

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it's in between the track its power by

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
it's in between the track its power by
the<00:00:41.370> points<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> taped<00:00:42.870> those<00:00:43.020> points<00:00:43.500> off

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the points so I taped those points off

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.729 
the points so I taped those points off
and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.820> what<00:00:45.660> we're<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:48.739> have

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and then what we're going to do is have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.600 
and then what we're going to do is have
a<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> Bajor<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:52.250> we're<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
a can of Bajor and we're just going to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.650 
a can of Bajor and we're just going to
use<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.320> cans<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> grimy

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
use I was just using cans of the grimy

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
use I was just using cans of the grimy
black<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.440> they're<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.739> easier<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> use

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
black because they're just easier to use

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.389 
black because they're just easier to use
on<00:00:59.640> big<00:00:59.820> sections<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.070> little<00:01:02.309> more

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
on big sections but to get a little more

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.690 
on big sections but to get a little more
control<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.840> smaller<00:01:04.110> sections<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.860> I'm

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
control in the smaller sections here I'm

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.640 
control in the smaller sections here I'm
going<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.010 

propel<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.400> on<00:01:10.550> there<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.210> just<00:01:11.300> going<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.780> use

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
propel it on there and just going to use

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.360 
propel it on there and just going to use
my<00:01:12.520> airbrush<00:01:15.400> my<00:01:16.400> old<00:01:16.640> badger<00:01:16.910> airbrush

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.880 

let's<00:01:20.820> see

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
let's see

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
let's see
there<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.100> go

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.640 

this<00:01:32.970> way

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.649 

the<00:01:38.130> can

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the can

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.980 
the can
the<00:01:40.229> canned<00:01:40.530> stuff<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.999> too<00:01:42.270> overkill

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the canned stuff is just too overkill

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
the canned stuff is just too overkill
and<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.469> wind<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:46.009> getting<00:01:47.009> too<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.420> paint

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and you wind up getting too much paint

00:01:48.420 --> 00:02:58.410 
and you wind up getting too much paint
in<00:01:48.810> between

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.600 

all<00:02:58.990> right<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.709> you<00:03:00.040> kind<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.310> get<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.459> idea

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
all right so you kind of get the idea

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.320 
all right so you kind of get the idea
but

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
but

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.420 
but
what<00:03:03.930> you're<00:03:04.080> left<00:03:04.260> with<00:03:04.380> here<00:03:04.770> then<00:03:05.120> is

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.470 

that's<00:03:12.060> gotta<00:03:12.359> dry<00:03:12.719> but<00:03:13.400> that'll<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.579> be<00:03:14.640> nice

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
that's gotta dry but that'll all be nice

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.280 
that's gotta dry but that'll all be nice
and<00:03:15.840> continuous<00:03:16.700> grimy<00:03:17.700> black<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:22.049> want

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
and continuous grimy black and you want

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.229 
and continuous grimy black and you want
to<00:03:22.379> get<00:03:22.530> most<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.099> core<00:03:23.370> covered<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.060> when

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
to get most of the core covered so when

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.399 
to get most of the core covered so when
you<00:03:24.359> do<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:26.120> ballasting<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.230> don't

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
you do the ballasting that you don't

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.420 
you do the ballasting that you don't
have<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.829> over<00:03:29.159> ballast<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:31.019> cover<00:03:31.260> up<00:03:31.560> any<00:03:31.799> of

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
have to over ballast to cover up any of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.390 
have to over ballast to cover up any of
the<00:03:32.700> core<00:03:32.909> color<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.620> now<00:03:34.620> all<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.159> ties

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the core color and now all the ties

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.420 
the core color and now all the ties
instead<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.150> being<00:03:36.900> brown<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.889> black<00:03:38.069> they're

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
instead of being brown and black they're

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.280 
instead of being brown and black they're
just<00:03:38.609> all<00:03:38.760> black<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.780> don't<00:03:39.959> have<00:03:40.079> any

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
just all black so you don't have any

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.210 
just all black so you don't have any
problem<00:03:40.739> there<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:42.200> when<00:03:43.200> you're<00:03:43.319> done<00:03:43.590> then

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
problem there so when you're done then

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.670 
problem there so when you're done then
just<00:03:44.549> remove<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.909> tape<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.599> then<00:03:45.930> clean<00:03:46.500> off

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
just remove the tape and then clean off

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.619 
just remove the tape and then clean off
the<00:03:46.859> track<00:03:47.129> and<00:03:47.159> then<00:03:47.579> in<00:03:47.760> between<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.299> points

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
the track and then in between the points

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.789 
the track and then in between the points
you're<00:03:48.720> probably<00:03:48.900> going<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.439> probably<00:03:49.620> have

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
you're probably going to probably have

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.470 
you're probably going to probably have
to<00:03:49.950> come<00:03:50.099> back<00:03:50.129> with<00:03:50.459> some<00:03:50.730> mineral<00:03:51.919> with<00:03:52.919> some

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
to come back with some mineral with some

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.740 
to come back with some mineral with some
mineral<00:03:54.480> spirits<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.169> clean<00:03:55.709> up<00:03:55.859> any<00:03:56.010> excess

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
mineral spirits to clean up any excess

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.679 
mineral spirits to clean up any excess
paint<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.959> guy<00:03:58.079> in<00:03:58.260> there<00:03:58.469> and<00:03:58.680> hopefully

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
paint that guy in there and hopefully
