00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.120 

it's<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.810> tendrils<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.590> worse<00:02:37.800> than

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
it's the tendrils that are worse than

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.970 
it's the tendrils that are worse than
most<00:02:38.280> painful<00:02:38.910> these<00:02:39.660> sharp<00:02:40.140> spine<00:02:40.590> lines

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
most painful these sharp spine lines

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.590 
most painful these sharp spine lines
reach<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.760> hook<00:02:41.970> onto<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.329> surrounding

walking<00:02:48.540> along<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.290> forest<00:02:49.560> trails<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.700> if

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
walking along the forest trails so if

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.120 
walking along the forest trails so if
you<00:02:51.060> get<00:02:51.209> caught<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.480> wait<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> while<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.920> best

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
you get caught in wait a while the best

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.370 
you get caught in wait a while the best
thing<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.549> is<00:02:53.700> not<00:02:53.850> keep<00:02:54.060> going<00:02:54.380> because

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
thing to do is not keep going because

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.080 
thing to do is not keep going because
that<00:02:55.799> will<00:02:55.920> catch<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.700> you'll<00:02:56.820> have<00:02:56.970> to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
that will catch you and you'll have to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.000 
that will catch you and you'll have to
wait<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.299> while<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.320> trick<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.769> because

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
wait a while the trick is because

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.610 
wait a while the trick is because
they're<00:02:59.400> backward<00:02:59.790> pointing<00:03:00.120> Barb's<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:01.290> to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
they're backward pointing Barb's is to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.130 
they're backward pointing Barb's is to
grab<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.980> tendril<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.579> then<00:03:03.570> pull<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.049> out

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
grab the tendril and then pull it out

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.530 
grab the tendril and then pull it out
backwards<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.790> should<00:03:05.970> come<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.180> quite

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
backwards and it should come out quite

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.380 
backwards and it should come out quite
easily<00:03:07.040> but<00:03:08.040> these<00:03:08.220> annoying<00:03:08.640> tendrils<00:03:09.239> are

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
easily but these annoying tendrils are

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.569 
easily but these annoying tendrils are
very<00:03:09.690> thin<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.260> very<00:03:10.829> difficult<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.430> see

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
very thin and very difficult to see

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.250 
very thin and very difficult to see
against<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.030> rainforest<00:03:12.630> background

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.869 

and<00:03:15.349> you<00:03:15.739> can<00:03:15.890> end<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.099> getting<00:03:16.280> tangled<00:03:16.670> up

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
and you can end up getting tangled up

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.210 
and you can end up getting tangled up
and<00:03:16.940> easily<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:19.340> one<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:20.860> pretty<00:03:21.860> hard<00:03:22.099> to

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
and easily this one is pretty hard to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.170 
and easily this one is pretty hard to
see<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.519> middle<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.849> track<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.560> again

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
see in the middle of the track so again

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.680 
see in the middle of the track so again
you<00:03:26.180> want<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.569> try<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.430> grab<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.700> tendril<00:03:29.180> as

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
you want to try and grab the tendril as

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.559 
you want to try and grab the tendril as
gently<00:03:30.260> as<00:03:30.349> you<00:03:30.560> can<00:03:30.830> out<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:32.000> then<00:03:34.569> pull

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
gently as you can out and then pull

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.830 
gently as you can out and then pull
backwards<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.940> should<00:03:38.180> come<00:03:38.420> free

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
backwards it should come free

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.860 
backwards it should come free
she<00:03:40.410> public<00:03:40.800> stranger<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.400> one<00:03:42.060> more<00:03:42.270> thing<00:03:42.300> to

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
she public stranger so one more thing to

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.550 
she public stranger so one more thing to
do<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.140> quite<00:03:43.380> nice<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:45.200> pop<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.350> around

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
do is quite nice as to pop it around

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.040 
do is quite nice as to pop it around
another<00:03:46.770> tree<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.520> it'll<00:03:48.510> cling<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.020> to

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
another tree and it'll cling on to

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.730 
another tree and it'll cling on to
something<00:03:49.500> quite<00:03:49.770> easily<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:51.530> keep<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.650> out

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
something quite easily and keep it out

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.600 
something quite easily and keep it out
of<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.890> way<00:03:52.980> for<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.190> next<00:03:53.280> person<00:03:55.610> there's

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
of the way for the next person there's

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.220 
of the way for the next person there's
one<00:03:56.819> plan<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.390> that<00:03:57.630> combines<00:03:58.020> both

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
one plan here that combines both

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.820 
one plan here that combines both
physical<00:03:58.739> defense<00:03:59.069> with<00:03:59.670> poison<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:01.020> is

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
physical defense with poison so this is

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.940 
physical defense with poison so this is
a<00:04:02.840> nastiest<00:04:03.840> thing<00:04:04.020> on<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.200> rain<00:04:04.350> forest<00:04:04.890> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
a nastiest thing on the rain forest the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.130 
a nastiest thing on the rain forest the
stinging<00:04:05.220> bush<00:04:05.600> then<00:04:06.600> drop<00:04:06.840> 90<00:04:07.200> and<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.900> guy

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
stinging bush then drop 90 and this guy

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.220 
stinging bush then drop 90 and this guy
is<00:04:10.200> covered<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.220> hairs<00:04:11.880> which<00:04:12.840> are<00:04:12.989> made<00:04:13.110> of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
is covered in hairs which are made of

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.949 
is covered in hairs which are made of
silica<00:04:13.650> like<00:04:14.040> glass<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.780> inside<00:04:15.780> those

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
silica like glass and inside those

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.259 
silica like glass and inside those
silica<00:04:16.380> hairs<00:04:16.680> which<00:04:17.459> are<00:04:17.609> all<00:04:17.669> over<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.030> stem

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
silica hairs which are all over the stem

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:18.949 
silica hairs which are all over the stem
on<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.450> leaves

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
on the leaves

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.310 
on the leaves
there's<00:04:19.799> poison<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.480> glass<00:04:21.660> gets<00:04:21.989> into

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
there's poison so the glass gets into

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.800 
there's poison so the glass gets into
your<00:04:22.470> skin<00:04:22.830> which<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.520> bad<00:04:23.790> enough<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.240> then

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
your skin which is bad enough and then

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.290 
your skin which is bad enough and then
it<00:04:24.900> releases<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.620> poison<00:04:26.070> as<00:04:26.190> well<00:04:26.430> if<00:04:27.150> you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
it releases the poison as well if you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.060 
it releases the poison as well if you
try<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.630> scratch<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.200> makes<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.680> even<00:04:28.770> worse

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
try and scratch it makes it even worse

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.460 
try and scratch it makes it even worse
if<00:04:30.060> there's<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.360> temperature<00:04:30.630> change<00:04:30.990> when<00:04:31.380> you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
if there's a temperature change when you

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.960 
if there's a temperature change when you
put<00:04:31.620> your<00:04:31.710> hand<00:04:31.919> size<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.100> fridge<00:04:32.460> or<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.850> have

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
put your hand size a fridge or you have

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.300 
put your hand size a fridge or you have

a shower your skin contracts and expands

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.120 
a shower your skin contracts and expands
and<00:04:35.640> produce<00:04:36.210> even<00:04:36.630> more<00:04:36.780> pain<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.919> pain

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
and produce even more pain so the pain
