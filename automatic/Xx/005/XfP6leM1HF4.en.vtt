00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.699 
I've been doing it and I'm gonna
continue<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.940> do<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.420> way<00:03:59.659> and<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.260> hope

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
continue to do it that way and I hope

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.500 
continue to do it that way and I hope
that<00:04:00.889> in<00:04:01.069> you<00:04:01.609> know<00:04:01.730> when<00:04:01.940> it's<00:04:02.030> all<00:04:02.180> said<00:04:02.480> and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
that in you know when it's all said and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.500 
that in you know when it's all said and
done<00:04:02.919> that<00:04:03.919> people<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.310> say<00:04:04.489> well<00:04:04.700> I<00:04:04.970> think

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
done that people can say well I think

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.270 
done that people can say well I think
they<00:04:05.780> should<00:04:05.810> ran<00:04:06.230> an<00:04:06.349> honest<00:04:06.650> table<00:04:07.099> and<00:04:07.220> he

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
they should ran an honest table and he

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.190 
they should ran an honest table and he
was<00:04:07.340> honest<00:04:07.730> with<00:04:07.760> his<00:04:08.000> people<00:04:08.419> and<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:09.109> know

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
was honest with his people and you know

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.119 
was honest with his people and you know
maybe<00:04:09.609> maybe<00:04:10.900> their<00:04:11.900> overall<00:04:12.349> success<00:04:12.620> could

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:13.129 
maybe maybe their overall success could

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.400 
maybe maybe their overall success could
have<00:04:13.220> been<00:04:13.370> bigger<00:04:13.639> if<00:04:13.879> they<00:04:14.090> had<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.299> page<00:04:15.049> tear

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
have been bigger if they had a page tear

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:30.129 
have been bigger if they had a page tear
there<00:04:15.680> but<00:04:16.010> that's<00:04:16.160> not<00:04:16.489> what<00:04:16.669> I'm

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.169 

Oh
