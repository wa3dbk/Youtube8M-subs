00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.910
 animal trafficking is an act 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.200
 Illegal illegal grave and in villa 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.230
 domÃ­nico there is a fair where 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.480
 supposedly animals are exhibited but 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.190
 what happens many people buy 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.230
 species that are in danger of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.750
 extinction luis pavesio toured this 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.780
 place and this is a way one side we have 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.210
 the fair that is 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.880
 let's say near the tracks that is the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.980
 famous fair of the little birds that makes 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.140
 years that it works and it's a series that 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.029
 is supervised and controlled by fauna 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.650
 from the province of buenos aires- all the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:40.340
 species if they are exchanged they have good 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.820
 obviously a view of legality starting 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.350
 that they are species that are not 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.600
 danger of extinction and has the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.750
 effective controls obviously us 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.970
 we are not in favor of any kind of 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.790
 illegal traffic of animals 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.129
 these people are supervised even by 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.379
 apax people that accompanies us all 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.390
 Sundays in infections that 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.100
 we are trying to avoid is 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.440
 the abandonment of animals and the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.960
 proliferation of loose animals 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.659
 people know that there is an exhibition and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.930
 comes with your pets and 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.159
 try to sell them in that area that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.350
 obviously not the one that corresponds 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.720
 because the people at the fair the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.510
 instruction that you have is to deliver the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.450
 card 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.760
 with the breeder's address and fattal 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.850
 remove the pets out there we fight 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.320
 every Sunday to avoid the sale 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.670
 of animals that have recognized 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.350
 even from the danger that means 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.660
 for the community the fact that 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 then they are abandoned but sometimes 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.730
 we do not have the police power over 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.830
 exactly 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.560
 and is the one that corresponds or does not correspond 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.510
 for that we usually require the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.960
 aid of fauna of the province good 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:05.010
 Aires who helps us in this matter and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.330
 make seizures of animals that are in 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.850
 danger of function or that maybe 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.860
 they do not have certificates that 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.460
 correspond to their marketing the 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.460
 exposition
