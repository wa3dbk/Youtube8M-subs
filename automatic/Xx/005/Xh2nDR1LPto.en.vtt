00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.519
 care and security 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 I'll tell you a little so you can 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.330
 read it all back on the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.470
 site but it's funny to some 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.170
 and this year the 21 km is totally different 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.079

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.519
