00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.800 
cool head I think it's the Jota the
Yoder's<00:02:07.340> SATA<00:02:08.090> torso<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.140> got<00:02:09.380> in<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
Yoder's SATA torso that you got in the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.440 
Yoder's SATA torso that you got in the
advent<00:02:11.810> calendar<00:02:12.610> 2011<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.530> he<00:02:16.459> doesn't<00:02:17.060> back
