I'm completely nervous about it from the

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.060 
I'm completely nervous about it from the
simple<00:00:14.150> fact<00:00:14.929> that<00:00:15.049> Lehman<00:00:15.440> Brothers<00:00:15.589> is<00:00:15.889> one

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
simple fact that Lehman Brothers is one

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.490 
simple fact that Lehman Brothers is one
of<00:00:16.189> the<00:00:16.309> pinnacles<00:00:16.820> of<00:00:17.119> our<00:00:17.390> economic<00:00:17.990> system

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
and for it to be on the brink that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.960 
and for it to be on the brink that
doesn't<00:00:21.500> bode<00:00:21.650> well<00:00:21.680> for<00:00:22.279> a<00:00:22.310> lot<00:00:22.669> of<00:00:22.730> other

worried about what's going on with the
economy<00:00:27.500> right<00:00:27.860> now<00:00:27.919> I<00:00:28.399> just<00:00:28.460> bought<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.849> house

a few months ago and I work for an
organization<00:00:32.360> that's<00:00:32.390> dependent<00:00:33.020> on

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
organization that's dependent on

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
not my money is safe and I think the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
not my money is safe and I think the
government<00:00:43.820> could<00:00:43.910> be<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.060> little<00:00:44.239> more

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
government could be a little more

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.640 
government could be a little more
realistic<00:00:44.810> about<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.440> overall<00:00:45.770> situation

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.890 

not<00:00:50.520> yet<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.150> think<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.630> could<00:00:51.780> be

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
not yet but I think that we could be

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.280 
not yet but I think that we could be
headed<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.200> direction<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.870> with<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> fuel

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
headed that direction and with the fuel

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.900 
headed that direction and with the fuel
prices<00:00:55.680> especially<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.220> with<00:00:56.400> the<00:00:56.520> hurricane

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
prices especially now with the hurricane

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.840 
prices especially now with the hurricane
that's<00:00:57.540> putting<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> burden<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.490> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.760> of

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that's putting a burden on a lot of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.640 
that's putting a burden on a lot of
people<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.200> living<00:01:01.530> paycheck

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
people that you know are living paycheck

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.560 
people that you know are living paycheck
to<00:01:01.920> paycheck<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.910> understanding<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
to paycheck my understanding is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.500 
to paycheck my understanding is
technically<00:01:04.050> we're<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> recession<00:01:05.510> but

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
technically we're not in a recession but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.600 
technically we're not in a recession but
the<00:01:06.630> economy<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.410> hurting<00:01:07.740> particularly<00:01:08.430> in

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the economy is hurting particularly in

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.830 
the economy is hurting particularly in
states<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.300> Michigan<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:11.540> maybe<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
states like Michigan so maybe not a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.470 
states like Michigan so maybe not a
recession<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.480> economic

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
recession but we have economic

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.680 
recession but we have economic
difficulties<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.620> whole<00:01:16.770> world<00:01:17.040> has<00:01:17.340> changed

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
difficulties the whole world has changed

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.969 
difficulties the whole world has changed
it's<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.960> global<00:01:19.350> market<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:22.530> may<00:01:22.710> find

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it's a global market and so we may find

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.980 
it's a global market and so we may find
ourselves<00:01:23.160> not<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.940> big<00:01:24.090> bear<00:01:24.330> where<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.780> once

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
ourselves not the big bear where we once

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.960 
ourselves not the big bear where we once
were

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 

I<00:01:30.170> think<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.290> hard<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> predict<00:01:31.920> things<00:01:32.370> now

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I think it's hard to predict things now

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
I think it's hard to predict things now
by<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.240> past<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.050> we're<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.410> new

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
by the past I think we're in new

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
by the past I think we're in new
territory<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.570> think<00:01:36.840> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
territory so I don't think it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.430 
territory so I don't think it's
necessarily<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.860> cyclical<00:01:39.080> it's<00:01:40.080> part<00:01:40.410> of

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
necessarily just cyclical it's part of

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.250 
necessarily just cyclical it's part of
the<00:01:40.560> normal<00:01:40.970> business<00:01:41.970> cycle<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.780> this

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
the normal business cycle in this

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.650 
the normal business cycle in this
industry<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.890> world<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.400> hopefully<00:01:45.000> maybe

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
industry in the world so hopefully maybe

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.960 
industry in the world so hopefully maybe
next<00:01:45.960> two<00:01:46.140> years<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.850> our

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
next two years we are be back on our

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.190 
next two years we are be back on our
feet<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.390> don't<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.810> gonna<00:01:49.050> be

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
feet but I don't think this is gonna be

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.770 
feet but I don't think this is gonna be
an<00:01:49.320> everlasting<00:01:50.720> blow<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.020> US<00:01:52.410> economy<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
an everlasting blow to the US economy I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.670 
an everlasting blow to the US economy I
think<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.870> just<00:01:55.050> part<00:01:55.230> of<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.380> cycle

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
think it's just part of the cycle

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.900 
think it's just part of the cycle
because<00:01:56.300> we've<00:01:57.300> had<00:01:57.510> shakeups<00:01:57.990> before<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.910> we

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
because we've had shakeups before and we

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.450 
because we've had shakeups before and we
have<00:02:00.030> bounced<00:02:00.270> back
