as I can it's gonna start right about
here<00:01:41.680> at<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.729> bottom<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.180> frame<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.570> wave

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
here at the bottom of the frame the wave

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.289 
here at the bottom of the frame the wave
comes<00:01:44.049> in<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.530> camera<00:01:44.920> pans<00:01:45.220> above<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.060> wave

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
comes in the camera pans above the wave

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.210 
comes in the camera pans above the wave
at<00:01:46.720> which<00:01:46.960> point<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.439> wave<00:01:47.590> catches<00:01:48.040> up<00:01:48.189> to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
at which point the wave catches up to

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.550 
at which point the wave catches up to
the<00:01:48.430> camera<00:01:48.670> which<00:01:49.270> proves<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.170> camera

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
the camera which proves that the camera

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.410 
the camera which proves that the camera
or<00:01:50.740> equipment<00:01:51.310> has<00:01:51.430> nothing<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.850> do<00:01:52.090> with<00:01:52.119> it

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
or equipment has nothing to do with it

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.960 
or equipment has nothing to do with it
now<00:01:52.630> I'm<00:01:53.200> going<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.470> run<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:53.770> again<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.159> I'm

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
now I'm going to run this again and I'm

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.060 
now I'm going to run this again and I'm
going<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.240> slow<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.479> down<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.930> 50%<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:56.979> you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
going to slow it down to 50% so that you

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.319 
going to slow it down to 50% so that you
can<00:01:57.189> get<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.369> very<00:01:57.610> good<00:01:57.670> look<00:01:57.850> at<00:01:58.210> this

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
can get a very good look at this

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.929 
can get a very good look at this
evidence<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.649> there<00:01:59.829> is<00:01:59.950> no<00:02:00.159> reason<00:02:00.729> for

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
evidence so that there is no reason for

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.700 
evidence so that there is no reason for
this<00:02:01.119> evidence<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.630> be<00:02:01.720> overlooked<00:02:02.110> here<00:02:02.590> it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
this evidence to be overlooked here it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.859 
this evidence to be overlooked here it
comes<00:02:02.920> again<00:02:03.040> bottom<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.790> frame<00:02:04.000> wave

comes again bottom of the frame wave

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.770 
comes again bottom of the frame wave
starts<00:02:05.350> goes<00:02:05.680> out<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:05.890> frame<00:02:06.600> second<00:02:07.600> later

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
catches up to the camera here it is at

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.910 
catches up to the camera here it is at
50%<00:02:10.000> speed<00:02:10.539> very<00:02:10.929> slow<00:02:11.939> the<00:02:12.939> wave<00:02:13.150> comes<00:02:13.510> in

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
50% speed very slow the wave comes in

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.090 
50% speed very slow the wave comes in
the<00:02:15.220> camera<00:02:15.610> pans<00:02:15.880> above<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.450> wave<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:18.070> wave

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
the camera pans above the wave the wave

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.730 
the camera pans above the wave the wave
catches<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.420> camera<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:20.500> is

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
catches up to the camera this is

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.000 
catches up to the camera this is
bulletproof<00:02:21.580> evidence<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.840> equipment<00:02:23.710> is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
bulletproof evidence that equipment is

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.480 
bulletproof evidence that equipment is
not<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.400> issue<00:02:24.520> here<00:02:25.590> okay<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.160> clip

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
not the issue here okay so in this clip

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.150 
not the issue here okay so in this clip
I've<00:02:27.730> added<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.180> ton<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.450> noise<00:02:29.160> I've

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
I've added a ton of noise I've

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
I've added a ton of noise I've
manipulated<00:02:30.700> channels<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.690> I've<00:02:31.780> done<00:02:31.990> some

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
manipulated channels and I've done some

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.380 
manipulated channels and I've done some
blending<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:33.190> comes<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.520> first<00:02:33.760> wave<00:02:34.000> i've

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
blending here comes the first wave i've

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.200 
blending here comes the first wave i've
speeded<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.930> up<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.380> 200%<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.310> exaggerate<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
speeded it up to 200% to exaggerate the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.420 
speeded it up to 200% to exaggerate the
effect<00:02:37.410> now<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.470> reason<00:02:38.800> I'm<00:02:38.920> doing<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.220> is

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
effect now the reason I'm doing this is

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.010 
effect now the reason I'm doing this is
because<00:02:39.610> in<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.910> second<00:02:40.270> here<00:02:40.360> I'm<00:02:40.480> gonna<00:02:40.630> mask

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
because in a second here I'm gonna mask

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.590 
because in a second here I'm gonna mask
the<00:02:41.380> moon<00:02:41.590> out<00:02:41.890> now<00:02:42.820> you're<00:02:43.060> gonna<00:02:43.150> need<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.510> be

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
the moon out now you're gonna need to be

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.790 
the moon out now you're gonna need to be
able<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.780> see<00:02:43.959> all<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.230> way<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.500> edge<00:02:44.620> your

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
able to see all the way to the edge your

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.460 
able to see all the way to the edge your
frame<00:02:45.040> here<00:02:45.280> comes<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.970> look<00:02:46.930> at<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.230> area

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
frame here comes and look at that area

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.740 
frame here comes and look at that area
you<00:02:47.770> will<00:02:47.920> see<00:02:47.950> no<00:02:48.400> wave<00:02:48.730> travel<00:02:49.360> through<00:02:49.570> that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
you will see no wave travel through that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.620 
you will see no wave travel through that
noise<00:02:50.490> there's<00:02:51.490> better<00:02:51.790> ways<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.240> do<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.570> but

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
noise there's better ways to do this but

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.479 
noise there's better ways to do this but
the<00:02:52.900> problem<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> doesn't<00:02:53.800> encode<00:02:54.190> very

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the problem is is it doesn't encode very

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.699 
the problem is is it doesn't encode very
well<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.450> black<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.050> white<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.560> it's

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
well so this is black and white and it's

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.620 
well so this is black and white and it's
gonna<00:02:56.860> encode<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.340> best<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.640> can<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.120> but

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
gonna encode the best I can do it but

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.610 
gonna encode the best I can do it but
basically<00:02:58.810> there<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.530> no<00:02:59.650> wave<00:03:00.130> past<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.730> moon

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
basically there is no wave past the moon

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.050 
basically there is no wave past the moon
okay<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:02.680> I'm<00:03:02.920> gonna<00:03:03.070> pile<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> little<00:03:03.850> bit

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
okay so I'm gonna pile on a little bit

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.699 
okay so I'm gonna pile on a little bit
more<00:03:04.270> evidence<00:03:04.450> here<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:04.900> demonstrates

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
more evidence here that demonstrates

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.560 
more evidence here that demonstrates
that<00:03:05.860> equipment<00:03:06.310> cannot<00:03:06.820> play<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.090> role<00:03:07.360> even

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
that equipment cannot play a role even

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.060 
that equipment cannot play a role even
though<00:03:07.720> we've<00:03:07.930> already<00:03:08.110> proved<00:03:08.500> definitively

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
though we've already proved definitively

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.460 
though we've already proved definitively
that<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.459> not<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.730> case<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:11.080> blue<00:03:11.260> line

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
that it's not the case the blue line

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.920 
that it's not the case the blue line
here<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.860> perfectly<00:03:12.310> level<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.330> frame<00:03:13.600> and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
here is perfectly level to the frame and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.290 
here is perfectly level to the frame and
that<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.560> level<00:03:14.920> 2<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> camera<00:03:15.610> as<00:03:15.760> well<00:03:16.000> the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
that is level 2 the camera as well the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.740 
that is level 2 the camera as well the
red<00:03:16.510> line<00:03:16.780> shows<00:03:17.590> you<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:18.060> tilt<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.570> wave

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
red line shows you the tilt of the wave

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.380 
red line shows you the tilt of the wave
which<00:03:20.620> again<00:03:20.920> shows<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.700> sensor<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.209> not

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
which again shows that the sensor is not

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.509 
which again shows that the sensor is not
level<00:03:22.630> 2<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.989> wave<00:03:23.260> here<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.190> can<00:03:24.340> see<00:03:24.489> a

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
level 2 that wave here you can see a

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.600 
level 2 that wave here you can see a
bulge<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.150> wave<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:27.160> truly

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
bulge in the wave and if this is truly

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.610 
bulge in the wave and if this is truly
at<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.730> moon<00:03:28.060> each<00:03:28.450> pixel<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.110> about<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.350> mile

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
at the moon each pixel is about a mile

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.380 
at the moon each pixel is about a mile
and<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:29.860> half<00:03:30.040> with<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.519> old<00:03:30.760> system<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.360> I

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
and a half with the old system that I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.170 
and a half with the old system that I
was<00:03:31.600> using<00:03:31.810> at<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.230> point<00:03:32.709> here<00:03:33.580> you're<00:03:34.150> just

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
was using at that point here you're just

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.820 
was using at that point here you're just
gonna<00:03:34.510> definitively<00:03:35.049> see<00:03:35.410> with<00:03:35.650> your<00:03:35.769> own

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
gonna definitively see with your own

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.330 
gonna definitively see with your own
eyes<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:37.239> there<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.110> an<00:03:38.260> energy<00:03:38.470> pulse<00:03:39.010> in

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
eyes that there is an energy pulse in

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.340 
eyes that there is an energy pulse in
that<00:03:39.820> red<00:03:40.030> circle<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.690> it's<00:03:40.810> tough<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.200> see

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
that red circle and it's tough to see

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.900 
that red circle and it's tough to see
before<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.709> put<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.040> filters<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.519> but<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:42.790> you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
before I put the filters on but if you

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.850 
before I put the filters on but if you
have<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> good<00:03:43.269> HD<00:03:43.720> big-screen<00:03:44.320> you'll<00:03:44.560> see<00:03:44.769> it

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
have a good HD big-screen you'll see it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.280 
have a good HD big-screen you'll see it
there<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> lateral<00:03:46.000> energy<00:03:46.660> pulse<00:03:46.930> going

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
there is a lateral energy pulse going

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.380 
there is a lateral energy pulse going
around<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.190> sphere<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.760> moon<00:03:48.940> within

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
around the sphere of the moon within

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.539 
around the sphere of the moon within
that<00:03:49.540> circle<00:03:49.840> as<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.200> wave<00:03:50.860> starts<00:03:51.340> at<00:03:51.459> the

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
that circle as the wave starts at the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.520 
that circle as the wave starts at the
bottom<00:03:51.670> now<00:03:52.600> here<00:03:52.930> I'm<00:03:53.019> going<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.200> break<00:03:53.350> it

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
bottom now here I'm going to break it

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.110 
bottom now here I'm going to break it
down<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.739> little<00:03:53.860> bit<00:03:54.100> better<00:03:54.340> at<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.940> lower

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
down a little bit better at the lower

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.650 
down a little bit better at the lower
left

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
left

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.699 
left
there's<00:03:56.049> forward<00:03:56.830> there's<00:03:57.610> backwards

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
there's forward there's backwards

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.789 
there's forward there's backwards
forward<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.860> can<00:04:00.010> see<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.430> rapping<00:04:01.799> backwards

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
forward you can see it rapping backwards

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.280 
forward you can see it rapping backwards
and<00:04:03.070> forwards<00:04:04.000> again<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.600> can<00:04:04.750> see<00:04:04.810> the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
and forwards again and you can see the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.170 
and forwards again and you can see the
curve<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:05.950> wave<00:04:06.160> wrapping<00:04:06.760> around<00:04:06.880> the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
curve of that wave wrapping around the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.560 
curve of that wave wrapping around the
sphere<00:04:07.420> of<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.600> moon<00:04:11.220> okay<00:04:12.220> here<00:04:12.880> it<00:04:13.060> slowed

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
sphere of the moon okay here it slowed

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.530 
sphere of the moon okay here it slowed
down<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.230> zoomed<00:04:14.950> in<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.519> again<00:04:16.150> I'm<00:04:16.390> gonna

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
down and zoomed in and again I'm gonna

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.020 
down and zoomed in and again I'm gonna
run<00:04:16.810> different<00:04:17.260> filters<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.430> final<00:04:18.820> view

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
run different filters and the final view

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.440 
run different filters and the final view
you<00:04:19.180> get<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:20.100> unmistakable<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.549> can<00:04:21.820> see<00:04:22.150> the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
you get is unmistakable you can see the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.260 
you get is unmistakable you can see the
pulses<00:04:22.930> wrapping<00:04:23.860> around<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.370> moon<00:04:24.580> as<00:04:24.880> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
pulses wrapping around the moon as the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.570 
pulses wrapping around the moon as the
wave<00:04:25.419> begins<00:04:25.840> there<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.830> right<00:04:27.070> there<00:04:27.130> you

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
wave begins there it is right there you

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.840 
wave begins there it is right there you
can

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
can

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.380 
can
see<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.360> definitive<00:04:28.720> curve<00:04:29.380> of<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.860> sphere

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
see the definitive curve of the sphere

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.660 
see the definitive curve of the sphere
being<00:04:31.390> traveled<00:04:31.900> by<00:04:32.050> this<00:04:32.110> wave<00:04:32.440> it's<00:04:33.010> that

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
being traveled by this wave it's that

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.610 
being traveled by this wave it's that
simple<00:04:34.000> that's<00:04:34.480> what<00:04:34.810> your<00:04:34.960> eyes<00:04:35.080> can<00:04:35.110> see

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
simple that's what your eyes can see

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.540 
simple that's what your eyes can see
what<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:36.820> that's<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.600> whole<00:04:37.750> other<00:04:37.780> question

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
what it is that's a whole other question

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.460 
what it is that's a whole other question
so<00:04:39.550> here<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.120> is<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.570> give<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.020> something<00:04:41.440> that

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
so here it is I give you something that

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.470 
so here it is I give you something that
should<00:04:41.740> not<00:04:41.920> exist<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.610> lunar<00:04:42.820> wave<00:04:43.120> in<00:04:43.330> its

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
should not exist the lunar wave in its

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.460 
should not exist the lunar wave in its
entirety<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:45.450> again<00:04:46.450> contrast<00:04:47.140> and

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
entirety and again contrast and

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.020 
entirety and again contrast and
brightness<00:04:47.530> have<00:04:48.130> been<00:04:48.280> used<00:04:48.490> on<00:04:48.640> this<00:04:48.670> clip

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
brightness have been used on this clip

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.940 
brightness have been used on this clip
to<00:04:49.270> bring<00:04:49.510> up<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.230> visibility<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.860> the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
to bring up the the visibility of the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.680 
to bring up the the visibility of the
wave<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.160> bit<00:04:51.460> which<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:51.940> why<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.270> outside

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
wave a bit which is why the outside

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:03.600 
wave a bit which is why the outside
looks<00:04:52.930> so<00:04:53.110> black<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:02.050> in<00:05:02.590> closing<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:03.250> want<00:05:03.490> to
