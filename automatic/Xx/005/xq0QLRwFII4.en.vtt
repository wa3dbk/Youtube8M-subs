00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
breaks for the defense and then actually

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.139 
breaks for the defense and then actually
starts<00:01:53.460> at<00:01:53.520> home<00:01:53.549> into<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> bottom<00:01:54.060> line

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.969 
starts at home into the bottom line
corner<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> 64th<00:01:55.110> minute<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:55.890> we

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
corner in the 64th minute and then we

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.280 
corner in the 64th minute and then we
score<00:01:56.189> again<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.969> sent<00:01:57.659> me<00:01:57.719> first<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
score again here and sent me first and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.590 
score again here and sent me first and
then<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.829> think<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.399> soon<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.119> score<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.170 
then I think very soon we do score and
gain<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.469> Dale<00:02:01.759> pretty<00:02:02.759> much<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
gain with Dale pretty much like the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.639 
gain with Dale pretty much like the
first<00:02:03.390> goal<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.719> Dale's<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.469> pretty

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649

good<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:04.979> well<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.240> thinking<00:02:06.540> no

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
good as well and then I was thinking no

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.779 
good as well and then I was thinking no
I've<00:02:06.899> got<00:02:07.229> six<00:02:07.740> minutes<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.099> score<00:02:08.340> goal<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I've got six minutes to score goal and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.690 
I've got six minutes to score goal and
then<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.420> minute<00:02:09.750> layer<00:02:09.869> bang<00:02:10.370> 53<00:02:11.370> out

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
then you know a minute layer bang 53 out

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
then you know a minute layer bang 53 out
the<00:02:11.970> game<00:02:12.120> completely

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the game completely

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.040 
the game completely
pletely<00:02:13.740> wiped<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> ass<00:02:14.490> off<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.940> floor<00:02:15.180> and
