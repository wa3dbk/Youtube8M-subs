00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
purchased this on eBay alright when I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.830 
purchased this on eBay alright when I
first<00:01:28.730> started<00:01:28.940> collecting<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.540> think<00:01:29.750> it

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
first started collecting I think it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.780 
first started collecting I think it
holds<00:01:29.960> 109<00:01:30.620> cars<00:01:31.010> or<00:01:31.580> so<00:01:32.200> so<00:01:33.200> I've<00:01:33.290> got<00:01:33.500> that

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
holds 109 cars or so so I've got that

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.830 
holds 109 cars or so so I've got that
above<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.970> desk<00:01:35.560> so<00:01:36.560> here<00:01:37.300> see<00:01:38.300> that's<00:01:38.480> almost

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
above the desk so here see that's almost

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.170 
above the desk so here see that's almost
to<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.110> ceiling<00:01:39.350> they're<00:01:40.030> kind<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.120> the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
to the ceiling they're kind of the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.240 
to the ceiling they're kind of the
center<00:01:41.450> fit<00:01:41.840> perfect<00:01:42.410> so<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.650> decided<00:01:43.040> that's

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
center fit perfect so I decided that's

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.900 
center fit perfect so I decided that's
where<00:01:43.670> it<00:01:43.790> needs<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.090> go<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:46.550> course<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.820> get

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
where it needs to go of course to get

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.990

four hundred cars in there that are just
not<00:05:56.860> not<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.460> be<00:05:57.550> displayed<00:05:57.910> they're<00:05:58.510> strictly

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
not not to be displayed they're strictly

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.980

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.000 
think I got some more in this box here
so<00:06:06.420> that<00:06:07.420> just<00:06:07.630> really<00:06:07.870> hit<00:06:08.110> close<00:06:08.350> this

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.650

the demand up there and again this is
all<00:06:30.340> going<00:06:30.460> to<00:06:30.520> be<00:06:30.610> display<00:06:30.940> case<00:06:31.180> there<00:06:32.520> see

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
all going to be display case there see

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.580 
all going to be display case there see
this<00:06:33.700> wide-angle<00:06:34.570> lens<00:06:34.750> does<00:06:34.930> not<00:06:35.080> focus<00:06:35.290> as<00:06:35.560> a
