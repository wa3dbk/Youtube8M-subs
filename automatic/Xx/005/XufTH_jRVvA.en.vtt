are<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.310> made<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> thing<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.259> are

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
are like made of the thing that are

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.359 
are like made of the thing that are
going<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.740> eaten

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
going to be eaten

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.249 
going to be eaten
I<00:01:59.399> just<00:02:00.270> always<00:02:00.509> found<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> odd

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I just always found that kind of odd

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.620 
I just always found that kind of odd
with<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.860> McNuggets<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.549> stuff<00:02:03.380> anyhow

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
with like McNuggets and stuff anyhow

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.960 
with like McNuggets and stuff anyhow
when<00:02:06.260> you<00:02:06.320> get<00:02:06.470> them<00:02:06.560> out<00:02:06.650> of<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.830> bag<00:02:07.010> this<00:02:07.850> is

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
when you get them out of the bag this is

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.920 
when you get them out of the bag this is
what<00:02:08.119> they<00:02:08.240> look<00:02:08.390> like<00:02:09.520> mmm<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.540> little

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
what they look like mmm so just little

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.430 
what they look like mmm so just little
kind<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:13.120> somewhat<00:02:14.120> peanut-shaped<00:02:17.230> much<00:02:18.230> in

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
kind of somewhat peanut-shaped much in

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.430 
kind of somewhat peanut-shaped much in
line<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.980> skittles<00:02:19.730> or<00:02:20.110> sometimes<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.260> guess

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
line like skittles or sometimes I guess

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.540 
line like skittles or sometimes I guess
we're<00:02:21.650> probably<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.950> first<00:02:22.100> ones<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.520> it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
we're probably the first ones to do it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.830 
we're probably the first ones to do it
they<00:02:23.239> have<00:02:23.270> an<00:02:23.630> M<00:02:24.580> written<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.730> each<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.720> every

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
they have an M written on each and every

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.360 
they have an M written on each and every
one<00:02:27.020> sometimes<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.770> easier<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.040> see<00:02:28.250> than

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
one sometimes it's easier to see than

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.090 
one sometimes it's easier to see than
others<00:02:29.230> there's<00:02:30.230> an<00:02:30.470> M<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.950> can

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
others there's an M that you can

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.070 
others there's an M that you can
probably<00:02:31.310> see<00:02:31.550> pretty<00:02:31.700> easily<00:02:31.790> anyway<00:02:32.750> that's

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
probably see pretty easily anyway that's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.600 
probably see pretty easily anyway that's
just<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.500> know<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:34.489> are<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> guess

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
just so you know what they are I guess

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.850 
just so you know what they are I guess
yeah<00:02:37.930> they<00:02:38.930> come<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.590> couple<00:02:39.709> different

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
yeah they come in a couple different

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.930 
yeah they come in a couple different
colors<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:43.040> color<00:02:43.340> lineup<00:02:43.700> has<00:02:43.850> changed

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
colors that color lineup has changed

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.880 
colors that color lineup has changed
over<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> years<00:02:44.690> but<00:02:45.610> red<00:02:46.610> orange<00:02:47.540> blue<00:02:47.890> brown

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
over the years but red orange blue brown

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.120 
over the years but red orange blue brown
yellow<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.030> green<00:02:50.600> one<00:02:51.560> two<00:02:51.709> three<00:02:51.920> four<00:02:52.100> I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
yellow and green one two three four I

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.900 
yellow and green one two three four I
think<00:02:52.250> there's<00:02:52.459> six<00:02:52.700> different<00:02:52.760> colors<00:02:54.910> one

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
think there's six different colors one

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.650 
think there's six different colors one
two<00:02:56.060> three<00:02:56.390> four<00:02:57.010> five<00:02:58.180> six<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.420> don't<00:02:59.600> know

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
two three four five six I don't know

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.729 
two three four five six I don't know
anyway<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.230> think<00:03:00.319> there's<00:03:00.470> six<00:03:00.680> different

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
anyway I think there's six different

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.590 
anyway I think there's six different
colors<00:03:01.190> they're<00:03:01.700> all<00:03:01.850> Dale<00:03:02.060> taste<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> same

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
colors they're all Dale taste the same

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.229 
colors they're all Dale taste the same
though<00:03:02.630> they're<00:03:02.870> all<00:03:02.959> just<00:03:03.170> M&amp;Ms<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.220> no<00:03:05.090> need

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
though they're all just M&amp;Ms so no need

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.620 
though they're all just M&amp;Ms so no need
to<00:03:05.299> really<00:03:05.720> stress<00:03:05.900> about<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:07.390> they<00:03:08.390> do<00:03:08.480> have

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
to really stress about that they do have

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.000 
to really stress about that they do have
a<00:03:08.690> yellow<00:03:08.870> one<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.140> guess<00:03:09.380> that's<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.829> one<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
a yellow one I guess that's the one I

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.800 
a yellow one I guess that's the one I
should<00:03:10.100> probably<00:03:10.400> eat<00:03:10.670> considering<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:11.690> our

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
should probably eat considering it's our

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.460 
should probably eat considering it's our

good<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.459> hoard<00:03:47.269> of<00:03:47.829> cross-section<00:03:48.829> of<00:03:48.890> what

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
good this hoard of cross-section of what

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.199 
good this hoard of cross-section of what
we're<00:03:49.190> looking<00:03:49.280> at<00:03:49.489> here<00:03:50.079> powder<00:03:51.079> shell<00:03:52.209> thick

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
we're looking at here powder shell thick

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.900 
we're looking at here powder shell thick
layer<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.810> chalk<00:03:54.170> milk<00:03:54.470> chocolate<00:03:54.890> there<00:03:55.070> and

layer of chalk milk chocolate there and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.759 
layer of chalk milk chocolate there and
then<00:03:56.090> really<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:56.810> mean<00:03:56.989> that's<00:03:57.109> a<00:03:57.260> whole<00:03:57.380> peanut

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
then really I mean that's a whole peanut

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.920 
then really I mean that's a whole peanut
is<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.850> hoping<00:03:59.150> on<00:03:59.239> that<00:03:59.359> actually<00:03:59.630> maybe<00:03:59.750> is<00:03:59.900> a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
is it hoping on that actually maybe is a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.720 
is it hoping on that actually maybe is a
half<00:04:00.079> a<00:04:00.170> peanut<00:04:00.320> usually<00:04:01.100> they<00:04:01.220> do<00:04:01.280> have<00:04:01.519> whole

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
half a peanut usually they do have whole

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.520 
half a peanut usually they do have whole
peanuts<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.150> they're<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.390> smaller<00:04:02.600> size<00:04:02.900> but

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
peanuts if they're the smaller size but

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.220 
peanuts if they're the smaller size but
like<00:04:03.739> that's<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.790> good<00:04:05.329> chunk<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.750> like<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:06.140> mean

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
like that's a good chunk of like I mean

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.900 
like that's a good chunk of like I mean
is<00:04:06.440> that's<00:04:06.560> just<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.829> solid<00:04:07.190> real<00:04:07.430> peanut

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910
