it's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.600> simple<00:00:42.960> tool<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.530> easy<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.070> learn

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it's a simple tool it's easy to learn

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.630 
it's a simple tool it's easy to learn
and<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.940> very<00:00:45.239> inexpensive<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.219> cow<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> in

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and it's very inexpensive if a cow is in

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
and it's very inexpensive if a cow is in
proper<00:00:47.820> body<00:00:48.149> condition<00:00:48.660> she<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> be

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
proper body condition she is going to be

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
proper body condition she is going to be
putting<00:00:49.890> enough<00:00:50.370> nutrients<00:00:51.030> into<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> calf

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
putting enough nutrients into the calf

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.600 
putting enough nutrients into the calf
so<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> growing<00:00:52.590> properly<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.309> she'll

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
so that is growing properly and she'll

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
so that is growing properly and she'll
be<00:00:53.760> passing<00:00:54.300> proper<00:00:54.750> levels<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.230> immunity

when the calving season comes around we

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
when the calving season comes around we

to put weight on which could equate to
you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.119> anywhere<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:21.869> 80<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> hundred

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you know anywhere from 80 to hundred

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.850 
dollars more per calf at the end of the
season<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:27.600> measure<00:01:27.840> body<00:01:28.080> condition<00:01:28.590> score

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
season we measure body condition score

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.969 
season we measure body condition score
on<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> scale<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.119> five<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.710> is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
on a scale of one to five so one is

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.179 
on a scale of one to five so one is
extremely<00:01:32.340> thin<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> five<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.290> very<00:01:34.829> fat<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350

from a 2.5 to a 3 when you look at a cow
the<00:01:47.159> fat<00:01:47.340> cover<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.790> very<00:01:48.180> deceiving<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the fat cover can be very deceiving to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020 
the fat cover can be very deceiving to
try<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> assess<00:01:49.619> visually<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.970> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
try and assess visually and so you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
try and assess visually and so you
really<00:01:51.360> need<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.380> your

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
really need to get in there get your

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.859 
really need to get in there get your
hands<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.040> her<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.460> feel<00:01:54.090> her<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.509> some<00:01:54.689> very

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
hands on her and feel her in some very

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990 
hands on her and feel her in some very
specific<00:01:55.170> key<00:01:55.740> areas<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> her<00:01:56.520> body<00:01:56.700> to

specific key areas of her body to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
specific key areas of her body to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
conditioned you know if you can divide

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.250 
conditioned you know if you can divide
them<00:03:07.090> up<00:03:07.239> into<00:03:07.390> at<00:03:07.660> least<00:03:07.690> those<00:03:08.050> three

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
them up into at least those three

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.080 
them up into at least those three
categories<00:03:08.560> you're<00:03:09.190> probably<00:03:09.400> away<00:03:09.880> to<00:03:09.940> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
categories you're probably away to the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.820 
categories you're probably away to the
races<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.600> terms<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.080> knowing<00:03:11.440> what<00:03:11.680> you're

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
races in terms of knowing what you're

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.130 
races in terms of knowing what you're
doing<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.340> determining<00:03:13.270> if<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.840> need<00:03:13.989> to

body condition scoring really just takes

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.180 
body condition scoring really just takes
a<00:03:19.000> few<00:03:19.030> minutes<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.140> think<00:03:20.379> about<00:03:20.620> the

a few minutes if you think about the
