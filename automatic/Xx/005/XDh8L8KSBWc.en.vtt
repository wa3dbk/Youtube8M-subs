00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello friends with you denis semenihin and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.569
 today I promised to tell you about 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.069
 nutrition in order to manage your 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.519
 physical fitness and nutrition need 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 understand a few basic things first 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.690
 energy is contained and carried to human 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.340
 body is only 3 substances 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.590
 carbohydrates and fats proteins this building 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 material of all tissues of the human body 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.070
 but first of all it is natural muscles 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.230
 proteins are contained in animal products 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.770
 origin like eggs curd 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.680
 chicken fish poultry meat but it is important to choose 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 non-fatty foods i.e. with minimal 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.100
 the amount of fat if the cheese is 0 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.770
 if eggs are white then we eat yolk 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.170
 we throw out generally that is neither gram nor 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.610
 pure protein drops 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.770
 carbohydrates are the main source of energy 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.420
 for the human body is of two types 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.550
 simple and complex 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.030
 complex carbohydrates are all kinds of cereals 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.930
 for example rice buckwheat oats are simple 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.760
 carbohydrates are fruits and juices sweets 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.920
 nutrition must be done necessarily emphasis 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.620
 it is on complex carbohydrates and simple 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.570
 reduce carbohydrates as much as possible 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.020
 Regardless of your goals, the rule is always 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 such a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.350
 fats are the most energy - intensive component 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.450
 food but energy is bad slow 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.250
 there are so-called healthy fats 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.710
 for example contained in fish or 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.270
 vegetable fats but even their body 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.900
 a person needs only a minimum 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.360
 quantity 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.730
 the golden rule is half a gram in 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.770
 day at 1 kilogram of body weight that is 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.900
 if you weigh 80 kilograms for example then 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.230
 you only need 40 grams per day 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.120
 fat 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.130
 And now let's talk about standards 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.740
 consumption as soon as you start 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.140
 exercise your protein intake in 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.810
 day must be at least one and a half 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.630
 grams per kilogram of body weight is 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.010
 minimum norm I consider 2 grams of protein per 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.770
 a kilogram of body weight that is for example 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.330
 if you weigh 80 kilograms then your 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.410
 protein intake per day should be 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.480
 160 grams 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.130
 I don't think I need to take more 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.780
 squirrel no matter how active you are 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.280
 but there are people who are not with me 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.929
 agree who believes that you can 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.910
 take and 3 grams and 4 grams on 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.950
 a kilogram of body weight guys do not get carried away 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.200
 squirrels too seriously it can come out 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.480
 you sideways now I weigh 100 3 kilograms 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.980
 and eat 200 grams of protein a day to me 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.290
 quite enough for intense 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.540
 workouts further carbohydrates here 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.970
 friends and contains the key to physical 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.900
 form exactly the amount of carbohydrates you 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.760
 will regulate 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.739
 but the carbohydrate intake rate is strong 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.040
 varies by purpose if 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.250
 your goal is gaining muscle mass 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.400
 carbohydrate can go up to 6 7 grams 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.380
 per day for 1 kilogram of body weight that is 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.540
 For example, in my life there were times when I 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.340
 ate up to 700 grams of carbohydrates per day 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.080
 This then when I tried to ramp up 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.940
 maximum weight and weighed 120 five 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.280
 kilos but remember that even with 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.350
 such a high intake of carbohydrates 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.780
 emphasis you do precisely on complex 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.310
 carbohydrates are not on sugar juices and fruits 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.160
 now take another task 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.530
 fat burning this task too 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.320
 is achieved by using carbohydrates in this 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.840
 If you reduce carbohydrate intake to 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.090
 two grams per day for 1 kilogram of weight 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.590
 bodies do not advise you to go below 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.110
 because it will inevitably lead 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.550
 slow metabolism and lack of 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.760
 energy per se in order to 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.560
 exercise remember that any muscle 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.450
 mass looks only the case of the minimum 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.870
 amount of fat everything else is full 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.470
 nonsense 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.440
 extra fat 8 is a completely extra thing 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.510
 extra legs 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.610
 performs no function beyond that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.160
 that it is just possible to make you more 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.170
 Morozovskoy and so on carbohydrates maximum 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.330
 it is 7 grams per kilogram of body weight in 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.010
 a day at least 2 grams but for 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.900
 most of you will truly lie 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.030
 somewhere around four five grams on 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.760
 kilogram of body weight in this case you have 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.130
 and muscles will grow and fat will not 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.900
 increase but if you suddenly notice 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.750
 that as a result of the food that you 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.190
 chose all the same fat grows right there 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.140
 reduce the amount of carbohydrates and 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.170
 find your middle ground and still have 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.940
 one major rule on carbohydrate 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.160
 maximize their reception on the first 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.290
 half day easier to put it in the evening 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.240
 never gorge on carbohydrates even 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.730
 if your goal is muscle gain and 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.650
 now let's talk about all sorts of 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.239
 food supplements if you come in 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.070
 you will see any sports store 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.500
 a huge amount of all kinds 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.720
 produce a bunch of cans which is naturally 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.820
 given your keen desire to lead 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.320
 yourself in great shape it seems that here 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.650
 all this needs to be drunk and then it will be 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.880
 happiness guys let's go now we 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.220
 We will understand in more detail I will talk about 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.630
 main products and you yourself already 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.700
 decide for yourself what you might be 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.480
 useful and that you are completely useless 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.530
 so let's start one of the oldest species 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.090
 sports nutrition or supplementary 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.830
 nutrition is the so -called protein 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.810
 cocktails are meant for those people 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.610
 who for one reason or another cannot 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.020
 get enough with food 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.660
 squirrel that is can not eat only 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.880
 egg whites or curd or meat or 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.530
 chicken to get those 2 grams 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.180
 per kilogram of body weight for those and 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.550
 targeted protein shakes 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.280
 then there is such a thing as amino acids 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.830
 there are liquid happens in capsules 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.770
 wide amino acids this is pre 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.480
 splitting the protein molecule in this way 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.220
 they are faster absorbed by the body 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.050
 man and faster enters 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.930
 working muscles but essentially their 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.580
 amino acids are the same proteins 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.010
 then there is such a thing as all sorts 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.050
 energy capsules 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.790
 this is a capsule containing large 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.110
 concentrations such components as 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.720
 caffeine and taurine creatine ginseng and a bunch 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.430
 still all sorts of components 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.169
 associated with the release of mental 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.390
 nervous and physical energy in the body 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.880
 man naturally their goal is to make 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.020
 workout more explosive and more 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.150
 energetically 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.610
 and so let's say I personally do not feel the effect 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.379
 these capsules but try maybe you 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.139
 somehow it will invigorate further there is one more 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.150
 the type of food is called functional 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.289
 food or so-called food for life 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.879
 this is food in which in correct or 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.220
 optimal proportions are combined all 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.900
 components proteins fats carbohydrates vitamins 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.729
 minerals remember at the beginning of the video I you 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.379
 talked about what I'm eating now 200 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.310
 grams of carbohydrates per day and 200 grams 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:09.050
 proteins per day 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.669
 very interesting that this proportion is very 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.520
 easy to maintain in the morning 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:15.440
 but in the evening keep this proportion 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.000
 it becomes simply disastrous 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.220
 because the body is trying to fool 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.169
 I'm not any man at all who 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.159
 is on a diet and I want my hands to stretch 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.720
 something wrong 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.240
 in this case, functional nutrition 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.000
 helping to drink a cocktail and know for sure 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.680
 that the proportions are all true and no 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.810
 no bias towards excess 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.180
 carbohydrates under the guys basically all about 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.099
 nutrition, you know, in five minutes, all 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.780
 you will not tell in detail if you remained 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:41.180
 questions then the answers you find in my 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.039
 book fitness life and nutrition guide 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.110
 on training but we will return again and again 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:48.009
 to healthy lifestyle topics in this 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.009
