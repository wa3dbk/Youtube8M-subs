00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
both the subtle difference and a very

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.740 
both the subtle difference and a very
easy<00:02:59.530> difference<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.220> tell<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.640> actually<00:03:01.420> have

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750

easy difference to tell I actually have
a<00:03:01.780> little<00:03:01.959> method<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.190> thought<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.580> for

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
a little method that I thought up for

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.880 
a little method that I thought up for
myself<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.390> sort<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.660> works<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.410> that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
myself that sort of works and and that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.699 
myself that sort of works and and that

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
eyeball BG 105 second printing let's see

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.789 
eyeball BG 105 second printing let's see
if<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.420> says<00:04:10.600> ten<00:04:10.870> tickets<00:04:11.079> down<00:04:11.350> there<00:04:11.590> like

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
if it says ten tickets down there like

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.220 
if it says ten tickets down there like
it's<00:04:11.950> supposed<00:04:12.190> to

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
it's supposed to

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.099 
it's supposed to
yep<00:04:14.230> there's<00:04:14.560> ten<00:04:14.890> tickets<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.750> says<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.049> on

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
yep there's ten tickets it says it on

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.039 
yep there's ten tickets it says it on
both<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.500> them<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.789> uh<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.840> black

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
both of them and it's uh it's the black

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.130 
both of them and it's uh it's the black
and<00:04:20.260> white<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.519> from<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:22.240> late<00:04:22.390> 60s<00:04:22.870> a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
and white so this is from the late 60s a

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.640 
and white so this is from the late 60s a
black-and-white<00:04:23.770> proof

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
black-and-white proof

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.680 
black-and-white proof
