00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.240
 human evolution 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.700
 hominization corresponds to all 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.580
 processes that led to the development 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.650
 from the first ancestors to the 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 species which corresponds to being 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.070
 human 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.340
 to understand correctly these 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 processes it is necessary to integrate 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.439
 knowledge that deliver different 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.930
 disciplines such as biology the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.650
 archeology the story or the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.650
 anthropology 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.699
 the organization usually includes 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.519
 the study of the genre to which 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.670
 corresponds the human species without 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:52.000
 However it is possible to extend this study 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 towards the minimums of which 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.170
 originates the genre 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 having this account is possible 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.850
 consider as first in it 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.850
 study to australopithecus 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.220
 that appeared about 4 million ago 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.310
 years on earth 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.690
 and corresponds to the first hominid 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.690
 known through the fossil record 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.110
 these fossils have been found in 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.230
 Africa which gives the theory of origin 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 of man in africa 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.650
 it differs from the primates and already 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.470
 they found around the world because of their 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.140
 upright posture what corresponds to a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 important change in the anatomy of the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.050
 column 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.300
 in general terms the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.390
 Australopithecus has hips and legs 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.600
 very similar to normal but without 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.120
 However, it has a head including 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.540
 cranial capacity very similar to that of 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.540
 a primate 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.830
 it is known that the customs of the area 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.250
 pitecus corresponded to that of a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.250
 collector 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.500
 the next agency from which they have 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.760
 found records is the homo al 2 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.430
 followed closely because he dies 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.310
 These originated makes about two 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.590
 million and a half years ago 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.410
 and correspond to the first organisms 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.280
 Gender therefore the same gender 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.280
 that place 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.950
 to the australopithecus the homo habilis and 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 erectus have a greater capacity 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.910
 cranial that corresponds an approach 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.910
 to what is human expression 4 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.800
 they have a higher height reaching 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.800
 reach about one meter 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.380
 it is known that these organisms use and 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.120
 subsequently they made tools 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.980
 what already differentiates them 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.980
 fundamentally of the pillars 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.800
 to this appear records of the call 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.510
 homo sapiens give details what also 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.510
 known as the Neanderthal man 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.370
 this appears towards about 250,000 years 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.580
 and it is already scattered in Africa 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.600
 much of Asia and even some 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.600
 sectors of europe 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.060
 as the main difference has a 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.300
 thick skull and greater capacity 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.300
 cranial what corresponds to a 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.230
 development of the central nervous system 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.230
 much greater than a private 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.950
 it is known that the Neandertal man already 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.290
 build homes in which 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.049
 took refuge especially from the changes 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.799
 climatic conditions that corresponded to the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.799
 that he lived 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.310
 they were also hunters being known 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.010
 a few years as a hunter of the two 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.230
 major mammals of that era that 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.230
 they were the mango and the rhinoceros of the year 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.370
 there is evidence that the man of 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.070
 Neanderthal carried out rites 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.610
 funerary which shows in the first 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.850
 place a first evidence of beliefs 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:30.190
 religious and secondly the 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.190
 belief of life then of death 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:39.960
 finally appears homo sapiens apis 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.960
 what we know today as a human species 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.330
 this corresponds to about 50 thousand years 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.330
 behind 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.810
 is the species that colonizes all 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.880
 continents of breath 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.460
 the birth of homo sapiens sapiens 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.460
 the first signs also appear 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.849
 paradoxically this body has a 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.610
 lower cranial capacity 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:09.630
 however, accompanied by a development 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.690
 of the nervous system 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.490
 which shows greater efficiency in 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.490
 the occupation of space 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.470
 we can make a summary 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.060
 of the evolution of the human being 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.729
 corresponding with the different stages 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.620
 of which I am 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.960
 the australopithecus as we know 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.849
 ago appeared about 4 million 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.849
 years during the Paleolithic stage 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.570
 about 25 million years ago still 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:46.750
 love appears during the Paleolithic 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.750
 as at the beginning followed today he does not die 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.000
 and just close to 100,000 encouragement back 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.820
 the first evidences of the 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.940
 homo sapiens first man 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.940
 Neanderthal and then homo sapiens before 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.270
 means that the stages of 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:11.010
 Neolithic and subsequent ones only arrived 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.010
 the homo sapiens birds 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.020
 this represents practically all the 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.020
 history if we know
