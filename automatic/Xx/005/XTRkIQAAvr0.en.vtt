of these windows are tinted windows so

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.600 
of these windows are tinted windows so
this<00:02:33.030> R<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.300> T<00:02:33.570> two<00:02:34.110> key<00:02:34.380> functions<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.490> of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
this R of T two key functions one of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.240 
this R of T two key functions one of
which<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.090> reflect<00:02:36.330> some<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> sunshine

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
which is to reflect some of the sunshine

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.620 
which is to reflect some of the sunshine
away<00:02:38.250> from<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> N<00:02:38.670> side<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> tent<00:02:39.270> keeping

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
a little bit cooler and the other is

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.190 
a little bit cooler and the other is
obviously<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:42.240> them<00:02:42.390> being<00:02:42.540> tented<00:02:42.959> you're

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
obviously with them being tented you're

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.780 
obviously with them being tented you're
going<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.530> far<00:02:43.830> better<00:02:43.860> privacy<00:02:44.310> within
