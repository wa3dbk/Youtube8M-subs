00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.180
 the girls find themselves for a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.460
 new video I told you about 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.279
 the new mac collection so that's the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.290
 collection after chic 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.070
 so I cracked for three products of 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.150
 the new collection 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.160
 no yes I think that's all but 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.910
 four in the iv I believe that to too much 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.010
 the new collection 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.150
 so we will start with a lot of 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.440
 mini round projects in this 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.890
 collection there are several lighthouses that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.660
 are very very beautiful many bluff it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.760
 are two mineralize king finish 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.900
 I have but I have zero gillan 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.059
 assured but there are no 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.340
 dialyses and so that's where I cracked 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.899
 for one there are several lipstick 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.140
 were all very very handsome as good 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.000
 heart these are these kinds of choose so 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.210
 for starters I cracked for this 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.820
 lighthouse so that's an end actually that has 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 green reflections a bit like 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:12.300
 club and that has reflections a little bit 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.550
 plum a little how to say 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.040
 plum that pulls a little on the burgundy 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:23.400
 by a little bit like sketches and so 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.659
 they are called fall size and it is 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.659
 just wonderful 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.680
 so I think there you see well 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.409
 the extent of the beauty of the beaches and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.320
 you swatch it and but here it is worth 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:48.150
 better do it with fixed more believe 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:51.720
 to a more intense result that's what 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.939
 that he gives are intensified so there is 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.460
 plum reflections green reflections there 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.079
 is really a wonderful game sorry 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.040
 still to artificial lighting but 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.310
 I hope you realize 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.420
 probable of the thing so the design 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.280
 product it's a lipstick it's 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.519
 the one where I wear there so it's a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.910
 Mormon it's satin and it's hot 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.910
 chocolate 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.870
 and hop it's like this so I did not 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.450
 no lipstick in this color 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.450
 this is really a Mormon 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.650
 frankly I thought it was super beautiful 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.910
 that's what makes me who I am in a 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.320
 was very very beautiful I think they 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.670
 call after chic as the collection 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.459
 in fact it looks a lot like 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.870
 auteuil who revolt tahiti he is 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.940
 in the same way as the taikonauts 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.730
 Tahiti but a little more pigmented and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.140
 frankly it is super nice then 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.110
 I'm serious is that a piece that is the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:58.410
 new collection is the 287 which is 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.580
 like this so that sees me 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.050
 apparently that is done to apply 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.370
 the lighthouses mineralize neither bernheim and 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.870
 on the eyelid 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.560
 but I actually pray to them because 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.150
 it's a synthetic brush with joe 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.590
 fiber in fact and I think you 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.910
 apply the concealer it's going to be fair 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.560
 super good so here is the last project 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.299
 from the collection I actually looked 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.910
 the blushes he was very very handsome and 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.470
 I watched the merali skin finish and 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.730
 frankly it is to the ag troquera that they 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.160
 great were the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:39.000
 so this is the sterile stereau hero st 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:41.549
 real stereoheroes so for cons 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.280
 I do not find it very pink 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.959
 finds rather coral limit a little 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.640
 fishing for her discovered a little bit 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.140
 a little bit weigh the colors a 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.400
 little pot with roses and east of the walleye 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.510
 and she is super rebel 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.330
 frankly to use it as a 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.700
 blutch there for them for spring and 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.830
 for the tests frankly she is 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.310
 beautiful i will show you what 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.510
 it gives 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.499
 you will see it's not so pink 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.730
 may 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:17.269
 great it was really like doing a 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.949
 peach chorale with golden highlights and 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.729
 frankly like blush think it's okay 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.590
 to be deadly here I am it's going to be great 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.729
 beautiful we have it's true we are a little 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.639
 white in a winter but a little bit my 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.190
 all types of tan frankly that 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.150
 will be great 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.280
 then it's a new mascara that's 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.740
 released I would be the moment below 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.349
 because it is parked above so it's 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.120
 this mail so the packaging is rather 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.750
 nice the high level of the bark 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.509
 frankly she was so I tried 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.919
 no mascara mac but this one me 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.210
 said much more to have others told me 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.030
 advised mad he is really great 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.500
 it's the best so the brush and 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.889
 like those must and the little dots 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.000
 really will have so I think for 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.960
 those who like the cover girl 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.360
 you will be happy 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.940
 and at the end of the pin to pimples 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.610
 also in every way so separate 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.080
 catch all the hairs so that's all for 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.400
 the rejection mascara not tried yet I 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.340
 you will say more beautiful when I have 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.960
 do try so that's it for the 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.789
 products the new iris collection 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.130
 otherwise she made me small 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.229
 samples actually from the abbot's street 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.030
 cream of two games because I was 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:30.830
 quite tempted to actually see what it gives 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.849
 and allow do nothing to show you 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.370
 a little fear of treating them 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.340
 colors so I have light and light 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.750
 more and frankly the color leads to 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.560
 see so that can help you choose 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.560
 I will show you what it gives 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.560
 so 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.050
 that's okay so the lite is there 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.730
 and she is a lot pinker and the 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.680
 lake plus that's where there are the many 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.680
 more beautiful but a little darker what 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:10.550
 watts to banished roof went you see 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.250
 so I have the impression that limit I 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.780
 will not be there any more 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.420
 a little darker she is 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.190
 really less happy I'm not 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.750
 so pink maybe a mixture of 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.460
 two so it's hard to find his 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.750
 aunt 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.490
 so that's it so I hope that you 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.380
 will help if you are interested in there by 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.150
 the ffm i hope the be non days 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.290
 more do not hesitate to tell me if you 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.740
 also very graphic for the new 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.390
 collection and sees there I never 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.920
 to abstain from going to see them 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.980
 because I think I'm going there 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.450
 crack for something 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.830
 so here I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.010
 I make you ecobiz where I mean 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.010
 very soon
