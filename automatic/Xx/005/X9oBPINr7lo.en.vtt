00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.519
 pretty to look at 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 Good evening the summer has come back 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 I am impressed by the green board 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.029
 white text mr stagger them 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.920
 who is then what do you say to that today 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.539
 I want to have a good theme again 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.800
 Answer rather grow the 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.929
 single weather today comes the answer 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.040
 Part 2 is still correct 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.730
 It does not intervene the quietest 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.750
 doubt 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 After all , ours is right 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.380
 weather forecasts mostly pretty good and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.550
 i can even believe that wine 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.989
 still true and that is what I have 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.309
 discovered on satellite images from the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 south germany they wanted to hear 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.629
 a view bavaria baden wÃ¼rttemberg and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 Four came cloudy this morning 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.500
 staged veil clouds and the same 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 something very exciting and crazy happens 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.340
 then formed in front of this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.610
 Veil clouds four lines of these clouds 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.610
 lie 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.050
 send if in the atmosphere 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.730
 then usually formed 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.620
 usually when I get one 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.260
 throw stone into the water or when it's windy 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.660
 lack of water then form 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.240
 choose but this physics works 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.160
 as well as in the atmosphere if 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 we are not water but cold air 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.300
 warmer air on the ground and higher up 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.370
 then come on then for us 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.530
 not visible what forms in the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.940
 choose atmosphere in the air and then 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.830
 At some point, you will also start here 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.360
 this wave mountains these little words 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.660
 which we saw on the satellite picture 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660
 to have 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.769
 and the temperatures are in the height where 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.569
 These clouds are forming today 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.099
 properly increased in 3000 meters 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.959
 Altitude was in the south of Germany today 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.319
 a temperature rise of more than ten 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.299
 grad that is the air from africa the am 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.510
 weekend also north rhine westphalia 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.510
 reached 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.560
 Now we have the bow that goes around 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.330
 Today after, however, is from this 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.250
 beautiful African air is still nothing 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.780
 feel there are many clouds and it 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.750
 pour partly rain now too 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.850
 strong temperatures go to values 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.950
 around 10 degrees back tomorrow morning 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.050
 still cloudy and wet and over again 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.790
 also have heavy rain in the direction of 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.530
 Lower Rhine there it can be dry 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.880
 there can also show the cloud gaps 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.560
 the sun has come out 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.540
 but it is said more overall 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.860
 the friendlier the sun comes more often 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.570
 there are only a few showers left 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.090
 and the temperatures already climb a 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.030
 grad higher than today so on 15 to 17 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.800
 Grad it is windy the wind he has the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.590
 bring warm air from the south to us 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.870
 he invites strength four to five tomorrow 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.600
 a slang in everyday life of this Friday 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.490
 less rain and temperatures until almost 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.980
 20 degrees and now take a look 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.150
 Saturday and there we will see on Saturday 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.680
 25 to 26 degrees that are 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.970
 summer temperatures of tomorrow again 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.480
 summarized we are waiting for the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.830
 summer back to you to see you soon 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.490
 and we are celebrating a round now 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.490
 birthday
