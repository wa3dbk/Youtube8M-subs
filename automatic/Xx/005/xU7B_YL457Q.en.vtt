it's a nickel-plated copper for extra
conductive<00:01:06.060> properties<00:01:06.210> real<00:01:06.960> cool<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> see

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
conductive properties real cool to see

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.140 
conductive properties real cool to see
that<00:01:07.500> into<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> battery<00:01:08.159> obviously<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> very

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
that into a battery obviously a very

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
that into a battery obviously a very
convenient<00:01:09.570> handle<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.860> take<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.140 
loving and I do a lot of testing on
battery<00:01:37.619> power<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.579> completely

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
battery power as well it's completely

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.330 
battery power as well it's completely
sealed<00:01:39.450> leap<00:01:39.900> free<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
sealed leap free so you can have it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
sealed leap free so you can have it
sideways<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> mount

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
sideways or like this like how I mount

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800 
sideways or like this like how I mount
it<00:01:43.740> or<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it or even like this if you want you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.289 
it or even like this if you want you
know<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.200> people<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> oh

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
know some people do it oh

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.179 
know some people do it oh
do<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.659> hole<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.990> my<00:01:49.110> floor<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.860> far<00:01:50.040> as

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
do it a hole in my floor and as far as

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
do it a hole in my floor and as far as
being<00:01:50.369> an<00:01:50.579> environment<00:01:51.090> with<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.390> flex

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
being an environment with a lot of flex

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
being an environment with a lot of flex
going<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.229> from<00:01:52.439> us<00:01:52.619> baseheads<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:54.030> cool

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
going on from us baseheads a really cool

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
going on from us baseheads a really cool
feature<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.780> they<00:01:54.810> added<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
feature that they added to this was a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.280 
feature that they added to this was a
sandwich<00:01:56.460> case<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.299> reinforced<00:01:58.079> fiberglass

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
sandwich case with reinforced fiberglass

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.740 
sandwich case with reinforced fiberglass
so<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.520> go<00:01:59.640> ahead<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.909> go<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> town

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so you can go ahead and go to town

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.990 
so you can go ahead and go to town
flexing<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> thing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
flexing this thing

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.390 
flexing this thing
and<00:02:02.300> you<00:02:02.660> won't<00:02:02.780> have<00:02:02.990> any<00:02:03.200> damage<00:02:03.710> occur<00:02:04.010> to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
and you won't have any damage occur to

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.860 
and you won't have any damage occur to
the<00:02:04.520> inside<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:04.880> your<00:02:05.090> battery<00:02:05.450> which<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.840> a

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
the inside of your battery which is a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.139 
the inside of your battery which is a
good<00:02:06.170> good<00:02:06.530> plus<00:02:06.890> one<00:02:07.310> thing<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.610> really<00:02:07.820> liked

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
good good plus one thing I really liked

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.600 
good good plus one thing I really liked
about<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.539> f31<00:02:09.050> specs<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.160> says<00:02:10.399> it

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
about the f31 specs is that it says it

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.460 
about the f31 specs is that it says it
can<00:02:10.729> be<00:02:10.820> used<00:02:11.000> both<00:02:11.120> for<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.540> supplemental<00:02:12.230> rear

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
can be used both for a supplemental rear

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.290 
can be used both for a supplemental rear
battery<00:02:12.860> or<00:02:13.100> go<00:02:13.730> ahead<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.090> chuck<00:02:14.270> it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
battery or go ahead and chuck it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.700 
battery or go ahead and chuck it
underneath<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.720> hood<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:15.560> work

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
underneath the hood because it can work

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.710 
underneath the hood because it can work
for<00:02:15.770> a<00:02:16.040> good<00:02:16.220> starter<00:02:16.640> battery<00:02:16.790> as<00:02:17.090> well<00:02:17.300> let's

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
for a good starter battery as well let's

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.010 
for a good starter battery as well let's
go<00:02:17.870> ahead<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.110> check<00:02:18.350> your<00:02:18.890> resting<00:02:19.550> voltage

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
go ahead and check your resting voltage

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.420 
go ahead and check your resting voltage
right<00:02:21.020> out<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> box<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:22.070> will<00:02:22.250> give<00:02:22.280> a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
right out of the box this will give a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.180 
right out of the box this will give a
good<00:02:22.610> indication<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:23.680> quality<00:02:24.680> since<00:02:24.980> they've

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
good indication of quality since they've

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.760 
good indication of quality since they've
been<00:02:25.220> sitting<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:25.910> my<00:02:26.090> room<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.600> about<00:02:26.870> I'd

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
been sitting in my room for about I'd

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.300 
been sitting in my room for about I'd
say<00:02:27.800> three<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:29.080> four<00:02:30.080> months<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.770> let's<00:02:31.010> see

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
say three to four months so let's see

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.729 
say three to four months so let's see
what's<00:02:31.910> going<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:33.220> with<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.520> voltage<00:02:35.739> we're

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
what's going on with the voltage we're

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.370 
what's going on with the voltage we're
working<00:02:36.860> with<00:02:37.130> 12.9<00:02:37.970> too<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:39.140> funny

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
working with 12.9 too and the funny

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.790 
working with 12.9 too and the funny
thing<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.790> 1<00:02:41.239> 100<00:02:41.930> higher<00:02:42.170> than<00:02:42.709> it

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
thing is that is 1 100 higher than it

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.030 
thing is that is 1 100 higher than it
