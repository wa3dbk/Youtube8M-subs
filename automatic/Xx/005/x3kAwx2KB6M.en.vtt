they getting all the looks wasn't really

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.130 
they getting all the looks wasn't really
a<00:03:05.260> malicious<00:03:05.739> hit

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
a malicious hit

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.500 
a malicious hit
and<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:07.010> think<00:03:07.280> those<00:03:07.430> are<00:03:07.490> things<00:03:07.760> we've<00:03:08.030> put<00:03:08.270> I

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
and I think those are things we've put I

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.180 
and I think those are things we've put I
think<00:03:08.960> we've<00:03:09.110> made<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.319> poor<00:03:09.590> decision<00:03:09.620> in<00:03:10.160> that

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
think we've made a poor decision in that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.970 
think we've made a poor decision in that
department<00:03:10.819> I<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.150> do<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.510> don't<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:12.650> a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
department I really do I don't I think a

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.290 
department I really do I don't I think a
player<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.400> punished<00:03:13.790> if<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.000> sit<00:03:14.209> in<00:03:14.240> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
next game no matter what and certainly

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.900 
next game no matter what and certainly
you<00:03:18.020> need<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.500> target<00:03:18.740> lower<00:03:19.100> as<00:03:19.550> far<00:03:19.819> as

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
you need to target lower as far as

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.190 
you need to target lower as far as
staying<00:03:20.120> away<00:03:20.390> from<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.690> head<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:20.990> some<00:03:21.110> of

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.800 
the head injuries and things would go
through<00:03:22.490> but<00:03:22.640> again<00:03:22.910> let<00:03:23.030> me<00:03:23.090> go<00:03:23.270> back<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.630> say

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
through but again let me go back and say

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.660 
through but again let me go back and say
I'm<00:03:24.080> involved<00:03:24.500> for<00:03:24.740> player<00:03:24.980> safety<00:03:25.250> I'm<00:03:25.490> not

against<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.480> don't<00:03:26.660> think<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.410> rule

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
against that I just don't think the rule

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.720 
against that I just don't think the rule
is<00:03:28.130> kind<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.150> little<00:03:29.990> bit<00:03:30.110> much<00:03:30.320> for<00:03:30.350> me<00:03:33.730> well

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
is kind of a little bit much for me well

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.670 
is kind of a little bit much for me well

lead with the crown of your helmet
that's<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.270> bottom<00:03:38.570> line<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.959> that's<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
that's the bottom line and that's the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.530 
that's the bottom line and that's the
way<00:03:39.590> we<00:03:39.770> coached<00:03:40.010> last<00:03:40.340> year<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.820> we<00:03:41.270> had<00:03:41.390> no

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
way we coached last year and we had no

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.970 
way we coached last year and we had no
issues<00:03:41.930> last<00:03:42.140> year<00:03:42.290> with<00:03:42.470> our<00:03:42.560> football<00:03:42.800> team

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
issues last year with our football team

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.000 
issues last year with our football team
knock<00:03:43.430> on<00:03:43.610> what<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:45.380> know<00:03:45.470> again<00:03:45.950> it's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
knock on what so you know again it's

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.800 
knock on what so you know again it's
it's<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.550> just<00:03:46.850> think<00:03:47.060> we've<00:03:47.209> put<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.420> lot<00:03:47.570> on<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
it's I just think we've put a lot on the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.360 
it's I just think we've put a lot on the
plate<00:03:47.840> of<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.320> officials<00:03:48.800> they<00:03:48.920> already<00:03:49.130> have

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
plate of the officials they already have

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.640 
plate of the officials they already have
a<00:03:49.400> lot<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.700> their<00:03:49.790> plate<00:03:50.120> it's<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.720> fast<00:03:51.110> fast

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
a lot on their plate it's a fast fast

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.009 
a lot on their plate it's a fast fast
physical<00:03:52.070> game<00:03:52.550> things<00:03:53.300> happen<00:03:53.690> very<00:03:53.870> quickly

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
physical game things happen very quickly

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.440 
physical game things happen very quickly
and<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:55.459> I<00:03:55.550> think<00:03:55.760> we've<00:03:55.880> put<00:03:56.060> a<00:03:56.090> lot<00:03:56.239> on<00:03:56.300> their

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
and and I think we've put a lot on their

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.720 
and and I think we've put a lot on their
plate
