 do not

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.759
 Canada 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.009
 in the club there are 35 public universities with a population of almost 300 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.850
 one thousand students throughout the country 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.020
 much is said the low level of education these young people receive 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.510
 What is true about it? What is the current situation of the universities? 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:43.370
 for example 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.200
 on budget issues 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.700
 in the last five years your budget is increased by more than 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.550
 100% but do not take advantage 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.420
 from 2005 to 2009 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.279
 almost two billion nuevos soles have not been executed is not a problem 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.400
 they realize the Peruvian-based problem 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.760
 for him when there is plenty 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 under the name of mining canon 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.050
 the universities that receive it 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.960
 it is not the saint the new headquarters 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.940
 - the cusco is not not Cajamarca have investment problems 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.650
 but it's not that 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.040
 he only has an investment problem 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.450
 in public management there the approved budget that the budget 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.140
 which is delivered at the beginning of the year 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.340
 and the budget executed 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.380
 the difference between the approved of the executed an efficiency level of the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 administration of an institution 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 as the Beninese president points out 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.930
 and former Salamanca rector 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.500
 It is not only a problem of budgetary shortage but of the management of its 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.270
 resources 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.070
 kelly also have responsibility students who can still 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.840
 participate in making decisions about the recent university to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 through student co-government 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.180
 they represent 33 percent of the vote in the council and the assembly 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.530
 university 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.929
 but the students 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.929
 trust your representatives 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.909
 with them 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:12.979
 Lion 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 last year 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.129
 said goodbye 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 given this 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.679
 Province 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:31.499
 It is not like this 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.869
 the German of Afghan origin 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:38.890
 clear villa 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.890
 mendoza - a plane with two more goals 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.299
 and the disappeared 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.339
 from the central government 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.339
 later 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.159
 some of the donors 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.589
 in the brand environmental impact benefits 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 alliance of people but next year 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.329
 sow the purpose 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.059
 and it is already 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.829
 the smn 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.829
 this issue currently public universities there are two positions that if the 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.910
 students in relation to the problems of their university 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.150
 people interested in their professional future no matter what happens 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.890
 this environment 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.030
 and the neighbors claim and demand their rights but neglecting their training 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.030
 academic 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.959
 that 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.379
 being the mong lin shunjie we asked a hundred per hour why he claimed mexico 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.920
 and is that although he protested the rights of all oratorios 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.010
 literary but we need it we need to have better services what 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.830
 it's best for you to study and the university I hope so 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.000
 and Karen Greenberg University and other Mercedes at the end of Second Segovia 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.460
 you fall into corruption abuse abuses decided 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.479
 God gave me to speak a word 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.169
 it was replenishment time the nasa did not contribute community I mean 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.770
 national antitobacco university 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.150
 what it is about 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.230
 is that the students identify with the present and future of their 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.219
 college 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:55.089
 commit and become agents of change of what is happening 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:59.999
 internally their universities for bendodo and bbva that I 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.870
 with that change 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.000
 the first big step that needs to be taken 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.310
 to change the situation of our children it is public to recover the 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.099
 social credibility to show in recent decades 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.459
 and for social scouring cÃºper ares we must implement urgently 

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:25.929
 transparency and accountability policy within their own 

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:27.089
 colleges 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:31.759
 This will allow us to show the citizens the real situation in which 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.449
 they find the public universities and it will allow us to count on the allies 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.680
 needed to reverse this situation 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.169
 oo in this sense and the solution proposal also 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.919
 now the ball is on the court of the students eye racing 19 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:00.469
 not coming
