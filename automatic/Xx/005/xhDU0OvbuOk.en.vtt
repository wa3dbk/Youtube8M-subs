00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
with so I can I'm gonna walk in it that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.299 
with so I can I'm gonna walk in it that
are<00:00:37.530> zooming<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.440> top<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> sort<00:00:41.219> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
are zooming in the top of that sort of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.549 
are zooming in the top of that sort of
can<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:42.770> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> exhaust<00:00:44.460> gasket

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.260 

fits<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:50.280> perfect

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
fits in there perfect

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.580 
fits in there perfect
well<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> shouldn't<00:00:52.469> say<00:00:52.590> perfect<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
well I shouldn't say perfect it's a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.240 
well I shouldn't say perfect it's a
little<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.710> tippy<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.010> top

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
little bit tippy but I think the top

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
little bit tippy but I think the top
will<00:00:59.520> Bend<00:00:59.760> all<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.359> bit<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:01.140> be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
will Bend all a little bit which will be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
will Bend all a little bit which will be
okay<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.250> eventually<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
okay because I can eventually get it to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.310 
okay because I can eventually get it to
go<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.220> did<00:01:06.619> was<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.960> cut<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> top

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
go in so what I did was I cut the top

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.399 
go in so what I did was I cut the top
off<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.799> cam<00:01:12.560> okay<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.580> gonna<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
off of a cam okay what I'm gonna do is

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.760 
off of a cam okay what I'm gonna do is
on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.680> side<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.070> putting<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.939> side

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
on the side I'm putting it on this side

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.910 
on the side I'm putting it on this side
I'm<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> stick<00:01:20.250> some<00:01:20.280> grease<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.030> there

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
I'm going to stick some grease in there

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
I'm going to stick some grease in there
and<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.100> stick<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.060> which

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
I'm gonna do on the opposite side of the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.920 
I'm gonna do on the opposite side of the
gasket<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.509> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> top<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
gasket is back here and on the top of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.830 
gasket is back here and on the top of
this<00:01:37.200> socket<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:39.420> gonna<00:01:39.600> loop

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this socket right here I'm gonna loop

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
this socket right here I'm gonna loop
that<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.470> grease<00:01:41.420> put<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:43.880> dip

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
lightly and hopefully drive it in there

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.499 
lightly and hopefully drive it in there

show<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:37.819> hopefully<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:38.970> works<00:02:39.209> as

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
show that but hopefully that works as

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.250 
show that but hopefully that works as
well<00:02:39.450> as<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.989> seam<00:02:40.260> tool<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.840> said<00:02:46.110> that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
well as this seam tool and I said that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.039 
well as this seam tool and I said that
don't<00:02:46.410> sit<00:02:46.769> quite<00:02:47.040> perfect<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.790> there<00:02:48.049> I'm

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
don't sit quite perfect in there I'm

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.780 
don't sit quite perfect in there I'm
kind<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.620> worried<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.010> little<00:02:50.160> bit<00:02:50.400> about<00:02:50.610> how

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
kind of worried a little bit about how

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.280 
kind of worried a little bit about how
that's<00:02:51.000> gonna<00:02:51.180> work<00:02:51.360> out<00:02:51.630> but<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.580> will<00:02:53.580> see

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.280 

all<00:02:58.290> right<00:02:58.440> well<00:02:59.330> it<00:03:00.330> wasn't<00:03:00.660> perfect<00:03:03.230> but<00:03:04.230> for

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
all right well it wasn't perfect but for

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.840 
all right well it wasn't perfect but for
the<00:03:04.560> most<00:03:04.769> part<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.250> worked

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
the most part it worked

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.940 
the most part it worked
I<00:03:06.590> got<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.769> seated<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.310> there<00:03:09.620> maybe<00:03:10.620> about

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
I got it seated in there maybe about

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.199 
I got it seated in there maybe about
half<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.760> thickness<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.540> seat<00:03:14.120> maybe<00:03:15.120> a

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
half the thickness of the seat maybe a

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.789 
half the thickness of the seat maybe a
little<00:03:15.390> less<00:03:17.959> but<00:03:18.959> then<00:03:19.140> after<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.440> pulled<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
little less but then after I pulled the

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.460 
little less but then after I pulled the
cap<00:03:20.040> off<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.760> was<00:03:21.329> able<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.630> take<00:03:21.840> my<00:03:22.049> fingers

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
cap off I was able to take my fingers

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.259 
cap off I was able to take my fingers
and<00:03:22.500> kind<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.130> wiggle<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:25.109> in<00:03:25.230> there<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.120> it's

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
and kind of wiggle it in there so it's

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.849 
and kind of wiggle it in there so it's
in<00:03:28.010> got<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> couple<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.209> said<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.859> didn't

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
in got a couple like I said it didn't

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.860 
in got a couple like I said it didn't
sit<00:03:32.100> in<00:03:32.130> there<00:03:32.430> perfectly<00:03:34.220> so<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:36.450> kind<00:03:36.780> of

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
sit in there perfectly so it kind of

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.280 
sit in there perfectly so it kind of
made<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.049> little<00:03:37.380> lip<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.829> one<00:03:38.040> spot<00:03:39.139> but<00:03:40.139> it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
made a little lip in one spot but it

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.620 
made a little lip in one spot but it
seems<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.769> all<00:03:40.920> kind<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.340> like<00:03:41.549> fine<00:03:41.970> metal

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
seems to be all kind of like fine metal

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.970 
seems to be all kind of like fine metal
mesh<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.030> kind<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.540> took<00:03:45.750> needlenose<00:03:46.410> pliers

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
mesh so I kind of took needlenose pliers

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.830 
mesh so I kind of took needlenose pliers
and<00:03:47.459> kind<00:03:47.639> of<00:03:47.790> mushed<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.209> up<00:03:48.329> in<00:03:48.510> there<00:03:48.720> to

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
and kind of mushed it up in there to

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.520 
and kind of mushed it up in there to
kind<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.170> smooth<00:03:49.500> out<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.889> spot<00:03:50.989> now<00:03:51.989> my<00:03:52.230> only

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
kind of smooth out that spot now my only

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:02.600 
kind of smooth out that spot now my only
concern<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.609> high<00:03:56.880> temp

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.050 

just<00:04:03.610> break<00:04:03.910> grease<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:06.070> now<00:04:06.250> my<00:04:06.430> concern<00:04:06.850> is

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
just break grease but now my concern is

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.420 
just break grease but now my concern is
is<00:04:07.270> I<00:04:07.660> just<00:04:08.170> hope<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.440> don't<00:04:08.590> start<00:04:08.890> on<00:04:09.100> Flair

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
is I just hope it don't start on Flair

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.570 
is I just hope it don't start on Flair
you<00:04:10.260> know<00:04:11.260> if<00:04:11.380> it<00:04:11.500> gets<00:04:11.680> hot<00:04:11.980> enough<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.310> where

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
you know if it gets hot enough to where

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.650 
you know if it gets hot enough to where
it<00:04:12.700> burns<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:15.190> I'm<00:04:15.580> sure<00:04:15.790> it's<00:04:15.970> gonna<00:04:16.090> be<00:04:16.239> doing

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
it burns so I'm sure it's gonna be doing

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.160 
it burns so I'm sure it's gonna be doing
some<00:04:16.870> smoking<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.010> like<00:04:18.040> that<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:21.220> I

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
some smoking and like that so I

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.630 
some smoking and like that so I
guess<00:04:23.170> after<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.590> get<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.890> running<00:04:24.220> I'll<00:04:24.400> have

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
guess after I get it running I'll have

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.480 
guess after I get it running I'll have
to<00:04:24.850> do<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.060> little<00:04:25.470> update<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:29.490> let
