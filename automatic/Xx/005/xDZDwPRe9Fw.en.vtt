dress doesn't necessarily have to be hot
pink<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.170> am<00:01:40.170> opting<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:40.979> an<00:01:41.640> electric<00:01:42.299> blue

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
pink I am opting for an electric blue

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.139 
pink I am opting for an electric blue
just<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.250> contrast<00:01:44.670> but<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.909> think

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
just kind of a contrast but I think

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.510 
just kind of a contrast but I think
it'll<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.390> fun<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.079> funky<00:01:46.530> look

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it'll be fun it's more of a funky look

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.389 
it'll be fun it's more of a funky look

so we can just go ahead and take the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280 
so we can just go ahead and take the
electric<00:01:50.970> blue<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:51.630> gonna<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:52.049> that
