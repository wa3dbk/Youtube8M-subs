00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.150 

it's<00:00:23.840> just<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.080> little<00:00:24.260> bit<00:00:24.470> of<00:00:24.590> different<00:00:25.010> from

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
it's just a little bit of different from

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.950 
it's just a little bit of different from
the<00:00:25.250> older<00:00:25.460> version<00:00:25.789> what<00:00:26.359> I<00:00:26.390> have<00:00:26.630> one<00:00:26.810> this

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
the older version what I have one this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.409 
the older version what I have one this
is<00:00:27.199> of<00:00:27.919> course<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:28.369> LEDs<00:00:28.699> which<00:00:29.090> you<00:00:29.180> can<00:00:29.300> see

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
is of course the LEDs which you can see

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.909 
is of course the LEDs which you can see
here<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.810> new<00:00:29.930> lighting<00:00:30.169> shapes<00:00:30.500> or<00:00:30.680> whatever

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
here the new lighting shapes or whatever

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.010 
here the new lighting shapes or whatever
the<00:00:31.579> engines<00:00:31.880> been<00:00:32.000> tuned<00:00:32.300> a<00:00:32.390> little<00:00:32.419> bit<00:00:32.689> so

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
the engines been tuned a little bit so

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.299 
the engines been tuned a little bit so
it's<00:00:33.110> a<00:00:33.170> little<00:00:33.379> bit<00:00:33.470> faster<00:00:33.620> compared<00:00:34.129> to<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
it's a little bit faster compared to the

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.010 
it's a little bit faster compared to the
normal<00:00:34.579> older<00:00:34.940> ones<00:00:35.090> however<00:00:35.629> it's<00:00:35.750> not<00:00:35.870> as

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
normal older ones however it's not as

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.130 
normal older ones however it's not as
fast<00:00:36.230> as<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.470> Super<00:00:36.739> Sport<00:00:37.960> suspensions<00:00:38.960> are

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
fast as the Super Sport suspensions are

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.340 
fast as the Super Sport suspensions are
a<00:00:39.170> little<00:00:39.379> bit<00:00:39.559> softer<00:00:39.949> on<00:00:40.129> these<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:41.350> in

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
a little bit softer on these and in

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.750 
a little bit softer on these and in
terms<00:00:42.650> of<00:00:42.830> interior<00:00:43.220> they<00:00:43.400> work<00:00:43.580> done<00:00:43.730> a

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
terms of interior they work done a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.920 
terms of interior they work done a
little<00:00:43.970> bit<00:00:44.089> on<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.210> touchscreen<00:00:44.390> side

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
little bit on the touchscreen side

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.150 
little bit on the touchscreen side
because<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.410> older<00:00:45.620> one<00:00:45.769> didn't<00:00:46.010> have<00:00:46.129> a

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
because the older one didn't have a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.200 
because the older one didn't have a
touchscreen<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.760> new<00:00:46.850> one<00:00:47.030> has<00:00:47.150> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
touchscreen the new one has a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.030 
touchscreen the new one has a
touchscreen<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.440> then<00:00:48.589> there<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:48.829> minor

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
touchscreen and then there are minor

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.349 
touchscreen and then there are minor
details<00:00:49.430> of

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.180

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
light or something and next thing you

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.180 
light or something and next thing you
know<00:01:11.049> is<00:01:11.140> people<00:01:11.290> staring<00:01:11.680> through<00:01:12.100> the
