actually ends up working out really well
because<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.060> vehicle<00:02:54.540> mode<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.900> kind<00:02:55.139> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
because in vehicle mode that kind of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.170 
because in vehicle mode that kind of
does<00:02:55.439> make<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:56.370> look<00:02:56.459> like<00:02:56.639> there's<00:02:56.819> an<00:02:56.939> engine

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180

okay there you can kind of see that

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.309 
okay there you can kind of see that
combination<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.239> those<00:03:00.359> pieces<00:03:00.629> really<00:03:01.019> makes

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
combination of those pieces really makes

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.780 
combination of those pieces really makes
it<00:03:01.409> look<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.680> there's<00:03:01.859> an<00:03:01.980> engine<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.639> there

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
his transformation we'll get to that now

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.500 
his transformation we'll get to that now
so<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.669> do<00:03:53.810> fold<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:54.900> handlebar<00:03:55.290> down

so<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.159> kind<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.669> to<00:04:02.819> bend<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.180> or<00:04:03.299> else<00:04:03.449> the

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
so and kind of to bend it or else the

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.240 
so and kind of to bend it or else the
wheel<00:04:03.780> will<00:04:03.959> catch<00:04:04.169> you<00:04:04.319> know<00:04:04.439> they<00:04:05.099> usually

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
wheel will catch you know they usually

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.300 
wheel will catch you know they usually
bend<00:04:05.669> it<00:04:05.790> right<00:04:06.180> about<00:04:06.449> there<00:04:07.099> it's<00:04:08.099> just

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
bend it right about there it's just

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.759 
bend it right about there it's just
matter<00:04:08.579> bouncing<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.359> and<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.349> get<00:04:10.439> the<00:04:10.560> wheel

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
matter bouncing it and you get the wheel

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.619 
matter bouncing it and you get the wheel
in<00:04:11.069> position<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.699> you<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:11.909> kind<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.120> fold<00:04:12.389> the

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
in position so you just kind of fold the

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.439 
in position so you just kind of fold the
front<00:04:12.840> wheel<00:04:13.019> out<00:04:13.759> and<00:04:14.759> you<00:04:14.849> can<00:04:14.970> already<00:04:15.150> see

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
front wheel out and you can already see

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.080 
front wheel out and you can already see
is<00:04:15.659> going<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.870> kind<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.199> have<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:17.090> transformers

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
is going to kind of have a transformers

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.279 
is going to kind of have a transformers
to<00:04:18.829> revenge<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.009> Fallen<00:04:20.579> Arcee<00:04:21.450> panel

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
to revenge of the Fallen Arcee panel

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.290 
to revenge of the Fallen Arcee panel
look<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.310> seat<00:04:23.789> here

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
this right then you take the back wheel

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.240 
this right then you take the back wheel
yeah<00:04:31.700> yeah<00:04:32.390> we<00:04:32.720> just<00:04:33.500> kind<00:04:33.740> of<00:04:33.770> angle<00:04:33.980> it

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
the back wheel now and it just splits

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.650 
the back wheel now and it just splits
like<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:41.120> comes<00:04:41.420> down<00:04:41.600> on<00:04:41.780> either<00:04:41.900> side<00:04:42.320> you

pushed this out so that his arm can bend

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.120 
pushed this out so that his arm can bend
and<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:03.590> becomes<00:05:03.890> like<00:05:04.040> as<00:05:04.220> little<00:05:05.350> no<00:05:06.350> it's

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
least you know I'm Zoom Zoom but he

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.990 
least you know I'm Zoom Zoom but he
can't<00:05:21.440> stand<00:05:21.740> so<00:05:22.190> that's<00:05:22.370> where<00:05:22.550> these<00:05:22.670> little

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
can't stand so that's where these little

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.020 
can't stand so that's where these little
things<00:05:23.240> come<00:05:23.540> in<00:05:23.720> they<00:05:23.900> just<00:05:23.990> kind<00:05:24.260> of<00:05:25.030> bring

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
things come in they just kind of bring

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.760 
things come in they just kind of bring
them<00:05:26.150> down<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.900> back<00:05:27.080> they're<00:05:27.410> like<00:05:27.440> dual

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
them down to the back they're like dual

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.250 
them down to the back they're like dual
kick<00:05:28.130> stands<00:05:28.460> for<00:05:28.910> them<00:05:30.610> they're<00:05:31.610> not<00:05:32.260> super

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
kick stands for them they're not super

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.490 
kick stands for them they're not super
tight<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.310> sometimes<00:05:34.700> he's<00:05:34.850> gonna<00:05:35.290> make<00:05:36.290> sure

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
tight so sometimes he's gonna make sure

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.220 
tight so sometimes he's gonna make sure
they<00:05:36.620> stay<00:05:37.100> in<00:05:37.400> there<00:05:37.640> but<00:05:38.630> once<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.020> get<00:05:39.140> them

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
they stay in there but once you get them

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.560 
they stay in there but once you get them
standing<00:05:39.890> which<00:05:40.100> isn't<00:05:40.340> hard<00:05:41.060> it's<00:05:41.330> just<00:05:41.510> a

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
standing which isn't hard it's just a

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.590 
standing which isn't hard it's just a
matter<00:05:41.690> of<00:05:41.840> balancing<00:05:42.169> them<00:05:42.350> various<00:05:43.600> there

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
matter of balancing them various there

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.480 
matter of balancing them various there
is<00:05:44.930> what<00:05:45.410> we<00:05:45.440> call<00:05:45.530> him<00:05:45.770> big<00:05:45.980> wheel<00:05:46.190> there's

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
is what we call him big wheel there's

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.040 
is what we call him big wheel there's
big<00:05:46.760> wheel<00:05:47.060> in<00:05:47.360> his<00:05:47.810> robot<00:05:48.320> mode<00:05:48.350> and<00:05:49.810> is<00:05:50.810> he

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
big wheel in his robot mode and is he

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.760 
big wheel in his robot mode and is he
the<00:05:51.169> most<00:05:51.550> articulated<00:05:52.550> robot<00:05:52.970> no<00:05:53.750> does<00:05:54.740> he

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
the most articulated robot no does he

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.710 
the most articulated robot no does he
have<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.490> most<00:05:55.640> incredible<00:05:56.030> engineering

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
have the most incredible engineering

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.090 
have the most incredible engineering
