filming<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.790> because<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.200> first<00:00:13.410> one<00:00:13.500> we

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
filming this because the first one we

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
filming this because the first one we
did<00:00:13.830> was<00:00:14.070> pretty<00:00:14.670> incoherent<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.389> way<00:00:15.900> too

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
did was pretty incoherent and way too

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.480 
did was pretty incoherent and way too
long<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.770> I'm<00:00:16.859> going<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.039> try<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> make<00:00:17.340> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
long so I'm going to try to make this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.330 
long so I'm going to try to make this
more<00:00:17.850> concise<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.619> more<00:00:19.619> helpful<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.160> those

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
more concise and more helpful to those

great company I've dealt with their
customers<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.860> support<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:43.610> really<00:00:44.610> easy<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
customers for support and really easy to

customers for support and really easy to
work<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.450> nice<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:48.260> their<00:00:49.260> products

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
work with and nice to and their products

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.260 
work with and nice to and their products
have<00:00:49.770> been<00:00:49.920> pretty<00:00:50.190> solid<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.640> me<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.879> far<00:00:50.910> I

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
have been pretty solid for me so far I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.490 
have been pretty solid for me so far I
would<00:00:52.140> recommend<00:00:52.260> them<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:54.079> all<00:00:55.079> right<00:00:55.199> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
would recommend them and all right so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.520 
would recommend them and all right so
let's<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.390> specifications<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:58.230> RAM

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
let's look at specifications for RAM

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
let's look at specifications for RAM
there's<00:00:59.370> basically<00:00:59.579> four<00:00:59.789> main<00:01:00.180> ones<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
there's basically four main ones you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
there's basically four main ones you
want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> look<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:00.989> first<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.219> your

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
want to look at first you have your

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.640 
want to look at first you have your
frequency<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> speed

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
frequency that is going to be the speed

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.330 
frequency that is going to be the speed
that<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> RAM<00:01:05.100> runs<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.519> basically<00:01:07.010> how<00:01:08.010> fast

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
that the RAM runs at basically how fast

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.550 
that the RAM runs at basically how fast
can<00:01:08.580> process<00:01:08.820> commands<00:01:11.270> much<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
can process commands much like the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.520 
can process commands much like the
frequency<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:15.390> cpu<00:01:15.869> runs<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
frequency that a cpu runs at the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
frequency that a cpu runs at the
gigahertz<00:01:16.830> amount<00:01:17.280> um<00:01:18.270> basically<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> same

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
gigahertz amount um basically the same

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.920 
gigahertz amount um basically the same
for<00:01:19.439> rim<00:01:19.650> faster<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> better<00:01:20.659> second<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.780> your

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
for rim faster the better second is your

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710 
for rim faster the better second is your
timings<00:01:22.320> um<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.759> essentially<00:01:24.540> how

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
timings um these are essentially how

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
timings um these are essentially how
fast<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.350> RAM<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.710> access<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.310> block<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
fast the RAM can access a block of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
fast the RAM can access a block of
memory<00:01:27.170> given<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> specific<00:01:28.409> scenario

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
memory given a specific scenario

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580 
memory given a specific scenario
depending<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
depending on like where you want to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
depending on like where you want to
access<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.009> from<00:01:32.040> things<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.970> well

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
access it from things like that a well

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.990 
access it from things like that a well
threaded<00:01:33.990> um<00:01:34.220> are<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.369> well<00:01:35.520> threaded<00:01:35.880> but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
threaded um are not well threaded but

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.780 
threaded um are not well threaded but
well<00:01:36.180> programmed<00:01:36.750> application<00:01:38.990> will<00:01:39.990> not

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
well programmed application will not

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.539 
well programmed application will not
take<00:01:41.790> advantage<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.360> low<00:01:42.509> timing<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.140> much

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
take advantage of low timing so much

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
take advantage of low timing so much
because<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.320> data

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
because it's going to be like the data

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
because it's going to be like the data
will<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> row<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:47.850> memory

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
will be all in a row and then memory

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.260 
will be all in a row and then memory
will<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> jump<00:01:49.740> around<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.189> much<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.790> if

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
will have to jump around so much but if

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
will have to jump around so much but if
you're<00:01:51.540> using<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.049> poorly<00:01:52.409> programmed

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you're using a poorly programmed

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
you're using a poorly programmed
application<00:01:53.399> then<00:01:53.549> low<00:01:53.790> timings<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.360> help

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
application then low timings can help

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.050 
application then low timings can help
you<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.899> generally<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.219> frequency<00:01:56.820> first

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you but generally go for frequency first

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.249 
you but generally go for frequency first
and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.540> timings<00:01:57.990> um<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.780> timings<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.110> want

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and then timings um and timings you want

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.920 
and then timings um and timings you want
to<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.500> lower<00:02:01.890> lower<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> better

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
to look for lower lower the better

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
to look for lower lower the better
voltage<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.229> important<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> note<00:02:04.920> when

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
voltage it's important to note when

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920 
voltage it's important to note when
you're<00:02:05.820> setting<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.180> RAM<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.630> default

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you're setting the RAM to default

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.380 
you're setting the RAM to default
settings<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:08.009> pious<00:02:08.520> which<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.239> cover

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
settings in your pious which will cover

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.680 
settings in your pious which will cover
later<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> 1.65<00:02:11.129> volt<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.180> just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
later but this is a 1.65 volt so just

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.580 
later but this is a 1.65 volt so just
make<00:02:12.840> sure<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:12.989> set<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.379> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
make sure to set it to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.979 
make sure to set it to
whatever<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.920> manufacturer<00:02:14.459> says<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.000> that

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
whatever the manufacturer says and that

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.600 
whatever the manufacturer says and that
will<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> run<00:02:16.709> at<00:02:17.010> stock<00:02:17.370> settings

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
will get it to run at stock settings

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.420 
will get it to run at stock settings
hopefully<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.200> stick<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.190> is

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
hopefully if you have a stick that is

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.990 
hopefully if you have a stick that is
working<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.840> lastly<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.620> your<00:02:22.830> size<00:02:23.220> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
working and lastly you have your size in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.080 
working and lastly you have your size in
this<00:02:24.180> case<00:02:24.390> six<00:02:24.660> gigabytes<00:02:25.730> kind<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.910> lot

little bit about how to select ram for
your<00:03:14.940> own<00:03:15.090> pc<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:17.389> what<00:03:18.389> is<00:03:18.510> channel<00:03:19.019> their

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
your own pc so what is channel their

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.069 
your own pc so what is channel their
dual<00:03:20.040> channel<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.639> triple<00:03:21.299> channel<00:03:21.450> sets<00:03:21.810> out

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
dual channel and triple channel sets out

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.379 
dual channel and triple channel sets out
there<00:03:22.290> sure<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.250> heard<00:03:23.430> you've<00:03:23.940> heard<00:03:24.209> these

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
there sure you heard you've heard these

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.360 
there sure you heard you've heard these

actually faster than dual channel or not
it's<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.919> surely<00:03:44.310> isn't<00:03:44.519> like<00:03:45.359> one<00:03:45.510> hundred

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
it's it surely isn't like one hundred

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.110 
it's it surely isn't like one hundred
fifty<00:03:46.049> percent<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.769> performance<00:03:47.700> increase<00:03:50.120> so

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
fifty percent of performance increase so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.759 
fifty percent of performance increase so

to<00:04:37.480> work<00:04:37.600> with<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:39.100> that's<00:04:39.400> good<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.700> check

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
to work with it so that's good to check

alright<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.410> when<00:04:47.410> you're<00:04:47.530> buying<00:04:47.710> Ram<00:04:48.660> there

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
alright so when you're buying Ram there

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.630 
alright so when you're buying Ram there
are<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:49.780> few<00:04:49.900> things<00:04:50.080> taking<00:04:50.500> consideration<00:04:51.100> of

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
are a few things taking consideration of

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.350 
are a few things taking consideration of
first<00:04:52.540> of<00:04:52.720> all<00:04:53.670> compatibility<00:04:54.670> that's<00:04:54.940> given

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
first of all compatibility that's given

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.720 
first of all compatibility that's given
second<00:04:56.230> of<00:04:56.290> all<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:57.130> need<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.370> make<00:04:57.430> sure

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
second of all you need to make sure

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.540 
second of all you need to make sure
you're<00:04:58.450> getting<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.930> highest<00:04:59.740> frequency<00:05:00.430> you

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
you're getting the highest frequency you

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.300 
you're getting the highest frequency you
can<00:05:00.580> for<00:05:01.000> your<00:05:01.090> money<00:05:01.270> because<00:05:02.310> that

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
can for your money because that

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.830 
can for your money because that
determines<00:05:03.430> how<00:05:03.790> fast<00:05:03.820> your<00:05:04.240> RAM<00:05:04.390> is<00:05:04.600> but

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
determines how fast your RAM is but

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.370 
determines how fast your RAM is but
again<00:05:05.650> don't<00:05:05.920> buy<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:07.090> really<00:05:07.480> fast<00:05:07.720> Ram<00:05:08.200> that

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
again don't buy the really fast Ram that

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.140 
again don't buy the really fast Ram that
everyone<00:05:08.710> says<00:05:08.920> oh<00:05:09.130> it's<00:05:09.340> trash<00:05:09.640> it<00:05:09.880> doesn't

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
everyone says oh it's trash it doesn't

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.060 
everyone says oh it's trash it doesn't

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
reviews things like that timings are

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.680 
reviews things like that timings are
nice<00:05:18.370> if<00:05:18.640> you're<00:05:18.790> if<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.390> need<00:05:19.570> another

but you don't know which one to get get

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.360 
but you don't know which one to get get
the<00:05:28.600> one<00:05:28.750> with<00:05:28.780> lower<00:05:29.110> timings<00:05:29.620> if<00:05:29.800> they<00:05:30.190> both

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
the one with lower timings if they both

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.950 
the one with lower timings if they both
have<00:05:30.550> great<00:05:30.730> reviews<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.540> high<00:05:32.140> frequencies

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
have great reviews and high frequencies

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.360 
have great reviews and high frequencies
that'll<00:05:34.960> make<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.260> slightly<00:05:36.160> faster<00:05:37.920> and<00:05:38.920> then

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
that'll make it slightly faster and then

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.090 
that'll make it slightly faster and then
another<00:05:39.730> thing<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.180> UM<00:05:40.480> figure<00:05:41.260> it's<00:05:41.770> not<00:05:41.950> that

hyperx<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:07.030> new<00:06:07.180> ones<00:06:07.390> can<00:06:07.810> be<00:06:07.930> pretty<00:06:08.110> high

hyperx the new ones can be pretty high
and<00:06:08.550> that<00:06:09.550> might<00:06:09.820> interfere<00:06:10.180> with<00:06:10.510> your<00:06:11.080> heat

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
sink if your heat sink is too large so

sink if your heat sink is too large so
this<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.230> just<00:06:14.470> another<00:06:14.860> thing<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.280> keep<00:06:15.400> in

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.120 
this is just another thing to keep in

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
full bandwidth otherwise you're just

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.580 
full bandwidth otherwise you're just
have<00:06:45.260> a<00:06:45.380> bunch<00:06:45.920> of<00:06:46.450> random<00:06:47.450> memory<00:06:47.780> modules

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
have a bunch of random memory modules

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.830 
have a bunch of random memory modules
and<00:06:48.860> they<00:06:48.950> won't<00:06:49.160> be<00:06:49.250> running<00:06:49.460> at<00:06:49.850> nearly

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
and they won't be running at nearly

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.540 
and they won't be running at nearly
their<00:06:51.800> potential<00:06:52.370> speed<00:06:53.860> alright<00:06:54.860> guys<00:06:55.040> so<00:06:55.310> I

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550
