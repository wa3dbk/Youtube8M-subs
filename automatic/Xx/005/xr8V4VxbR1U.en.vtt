00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
okay so it's just sitting there and you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
okay so it's just sitting there and you
can<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.040> look<00:01:32.100> from<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.520> back<00:01:32.729> it

answer is well yes probably so let's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.820 
answer is well yes probably so let's
find<00:01:48.380> out

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
find out

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.740 
find out
I<00:01:48.860> definitely<00:01:49.189> fit<00:01:50.049> any<00:01:51.049> 4/3<00:01:51.740> or<00:01:52.630> whatever<00:01:53.630> you

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
I definitely fit any 4/3 or whatever you

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.109 
I definitely fit any 4/3 or whatever you
want<00:01:53.960> in<00:01:54.380> there<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.189> what<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.490> could<00:01:55.610> do<00:01:55.820> is

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
want in there and what you could do is

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:04.179 
want in there and what you could do is
take<00:01:56.539> a<00:01:57.549> divider<00:01:59.229> from<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.860> had<00:02:04.039> in

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
take a divider from that you had in

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.609 
take a divider from that you had in
there<00:02:04.310> originally<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.539> could<00:02:05.750> section

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
there originally and you could section

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.729 
there originally and you could section
it<00:02:06.710> off<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.250> wouldn't<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:09.440> wouldn't<00:02:09.619> be

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
it off it wouldn't be it wouldn't be

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.009 
it off it wouldn't be it wouldn't be
ideal<00:02:10.069> but<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:11.330> those<00:02:11.569> people<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.930> are

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
ideal but for those people that are

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.740 
ideal but for those people that are
asking<00:02:12.440> can<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.739> fit<00:02:13.010> an<00:02:13.250> iPad<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
asking can you fit an iPad this is the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.390 
asking can you fit an iPad this is the
only<00:02:14.870> way<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.080> could<00:02:15.230> think<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.680> do<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.370> I

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
only way I could think to do it so I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.979 
only way I could think to do it so I
take<00:02:16.850> my<00:02:17.980> 7200<00:02:18.980> off<00:02:19.069> my<00:02:19.280> 5d<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:23.150> take<00:02:23.600> my

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.250 

fast<00:02:26.989> rap<00:02:27.319> off<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.150> put<00:02:29.330> my<00:02:29.360> 5d<00:02:29.959> in<00:02:30.080> that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
fast rap off and I can put my 5d in that
