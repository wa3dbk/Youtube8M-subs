work of scientists from Aberdeen

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.140 
work of scientists from Aberdeen
University<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:39.370> studied<00:03:39.640> three

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
University they studied three

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.210 
University they studied three
generations<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.990> first<00:03:41.260> dolphins<00:03:41.830> over

the<00:03:42.310> last<00:03:42.400> 20<00:03:42.880> years<00:03:43.800> each<00:03:44.800> Finn<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.640> unique<00:03:46.180> so

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
the last 20 years each Finn is unique so

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.440 
the last 20 years each Finn is unique so
they<00:03:47.200> know<00:03:47.290> each<00:03:47.470> one<00:03:47.650> by<00:03:47.890> name<00:03:48.180> we<00:03:49.180> try<00:03:49.390> and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
they know each one by name we try and

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.570 
they know each one by name we try and
name<00:03:49.660> them<00:03:49.810> often<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.470> make<00:03:51.220> sure<00:03:51.400> they

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
name them often to make sure they

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.030 
name them often to make sure they
resemble<00:03:52.090> their<00:03:52.300> names<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.470> have<00:03:53.620> Navis

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
resemble their names so we have Navis

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.070 
resemble their names so we have Navis
who<00:03:54.370> has<00:03:54.550> lots<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.910> white<00:03:55.120> on<00:03:55.150> top<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.930> he's

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
who has lots of white on top and he's

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.020 
who has lots of white on top and he's
named<00:03:56.290> after<00:03:56.410> been<00:03:56.800> nervous<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:57.910> we

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
named after been nervous and then we

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.820 
named after been nervous and then we
also<00:03:58.180> named<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.540> moms<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.080> calves<00:03:59.320> together

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
also named the moms and calves together

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.980 
also named the moms and calves together
to<00:04:00.070> keep<00:04:00.220> them<00:04:00.430> linked<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.510> we<00:04:01.630> have<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
to keep them linked and so we have a

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.650 
to keep them linked and so we have a
Dolphins<00:04:02.500> like<00:04:02.650> rhubarb<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.220> custard<00:04:03.660> and

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
Dolphins like rhubarb and custard and

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.710 
Dolphins like rhubarb and custard and
