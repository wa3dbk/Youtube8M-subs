 hello there mr of mike 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 today I will tell you how to write 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.170
 skype conversation or in good quality 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.100
 youtube videos if you shoot a video and 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.869
 want to talk to a friend with speakers 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:27.720
 the microphone is somehow poorly written ugly 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:31.260
 open bandicam and watch settings 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 video basic settings and here it is 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.730
 basically devices we remove our 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.550
 microphone in which we will talk about in 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.190
 Additional choose such a thing as 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.450
 Vincent 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:51.660
 this is the place where your speaker sound 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.989
 as if not from the speaker from the source itself 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.600
 the sound is output to the speaker there are worried 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.910
 recorded on your video and this 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.850
 happens very well I can even give you 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:10.229
 show me how it works now 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:19.580
 open one of my videos and it will 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.580
 Itâ€™s not the driver that is written 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.479
 so but the internet today is not very 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:40.640
 quick so we will do it differently we 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:40.640
 turn off the sound so we turn it off and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.729
 go to one of my videos you see 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.799
 sound off 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.799
 now just turn on the video so 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:10.649
 probably hello bend it 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.319
 turned off the faces la la la la to 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.450
 this is a good video about playing and I 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.760
 specifically spoke and immediately along with 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.060
 ru video so that you do not have 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.130
 feeling that i'm saying i'm not 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.360
 kidding thanks with you was mr 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:35.580
 Mike today I will tell you how 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:38.090
 record sound simultaneously with the driver 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.100
 dynamics 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.930
 do not forget that the main device 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.550
 we became our microphone 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.360
