00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the start to it i think that when the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
the start to it i think that when the
ship<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.660> taking<00:00:55.020> down<00:00:55.410> i'm<00:00:55.649> sure<00:00:55.860> i<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.100> an

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
ship is taking down i'm sure i have an

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040

up<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.640> something<00:01:39.229> together<00:01:40.229> now<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.920> not

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
up or something together now I'm not

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.530 
up or something together now I'm not
sure<00:01:41.340> maybe<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.150> master

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
sure maybe it's just because master

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.560 
sure maybe it's just because master
chief<00:01:42.750> hasn't<00:01:43.409> been<00:01:44.030> because<00:01:45.030> he's<00:01:45.299> been<00:01:45.479> in

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
chief hasn't been because he's been in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.260 
chief hasn't been because he's been in
that<00:01:45.630> pot<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.259> whatever<00:01:46.490> for<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that pot or whatever for I think a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.730 
that pot or whatever for I think a
couple<00:01:48.299> years<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.200> doesn't<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.530> what's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
couple years now and doesn't know what's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.830 
couple years now and doesn't know what's
going<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.100> exactly<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.149> guess<00:01:51.600> their

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
going on exactly that I guess their

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.899 
going on exactly that I guess their
allies<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.590> they're<00:01:52.860> no<00:01:52.979> longer<00:01:53.100> more<00:01:53.579> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
allies now they're no longer more I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.539 
allies now they're no longer more I
don't<00:01:54.390> know<00:01:54.479> maybe<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.009> time<00:01:56.250> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
don't know maybe it's just the time I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.480 
don't know maybe it's just the time I
don't<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.899> looks<00:01:58.079> real<00:01:58.469> interesting<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
don't but it looks real interesting and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.370 
don't but it looks real interesting and
I<00:01:59.729> think<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> start<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.170> whole

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I think this is going to start the whole

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.690 
I think this is going to start the whole
campaign<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.460> that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
campaign it's just going to be on that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330 
campaign it's just going to be on that
aim<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.570> will<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.290> Wilma<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
aim it will just be on Wilma not the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.300 
aim it will just be on Wilma not the
king<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> planet<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:08.099> whole

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
king will be on that planet the whole

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.650 
king will be on that planet the whole
game<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.879> centered<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
game is going to be centered on that

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.260 
game is going to be centered on that
planet<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.349> at<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> end<00:02:11.370> they're<00:02:12.090> going<00:02:12.209> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
planet and at the end they're going to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.510 
planet and at the end they're going to
be<00:02:12.450> them<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:12.900> them<00:02:13.080> off<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
be them get them off that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.090 
be them get them off that
on<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.120> they're<00:02:14.360> gonna<00:02:14.450> say<00:02:14.780> maybe<00:02:15.680> this

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
on it and they're gonna say maybe this

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.550 
on it and they're gonna say maybe this
is<00:02:16.220> not<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.460> end<00:02:16.700> no<00:02:17.450> maybe<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.050> he'll<00:02:18.320> say

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
is not the end no maybe it he'll say

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.740 
is not the end no maybe it he'll say
this<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.220> not<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.580> end<00:02:19.610> or<00:02:20.000> whatever<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.720> know

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
this is not the end or whatever you know

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.570 
this is not the end or whatever you know
something<00:02:21.170> cool<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.650> Master<00:02:22.250> Chief<00:02:22.430> would

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
something cool and Master Chief would

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.650 
something cool and Master Chief would
say<00:02:22.960> because<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.080> know<00:02:24.200> masculine<00:02:25.270> so<00:02:26.270> it

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
say because you know masculine so it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.270 
say because you know masculine so it
looks<00:02:26.690> really<00:02:27.230> different<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.860> know<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.010> don't

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
looks really different you know I don't

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.530 
looks really different you know I don't
think<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:28.640> game<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.850> going<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> be<00:02:29.150> centered

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
think this game is going to be centered

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.690 
think this game is going to be centered
around<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:30.140> any<00:02:30.350> cities<00:02:30.890> maybe<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.340> cable

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
around like any cities maybe like cable

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.790 
around like any cities maybe like cable
three<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.270> halo<00:02:32.390> ODST<00:02:32.570> not<00:02:33.290> all<00:02:33.410> those<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.710> the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
three and halo ODST not all those of the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.040 
three and halo ODST not all those of the
games<00:02:34.010> were<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.550> think<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.330> be<00:02:35.360> more<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:35.930> that

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
games were I think it to be more on that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.990 
games were I think it to be more on that
planet<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.830> weird<00:02:37.130> planet<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.610> nobody

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
planet that weird planet that nobody

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.270 
planet that weird planet that nobody
knows<00:02:38.180> what's<00:02:38.630> going<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.200> stuff<00:02:39.320> it'll<00:02:40.130> be

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
knows what's going on and stuff it'll be

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.160 
knows what's going on and stuff it'll be
different<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:40.670> know<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:41.030> looks<00:02:41.720> really

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
different you know it's looks really

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.560 
different you know it's looks really
epic<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.130> gotta<00:02:43.790> make<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.030> looked<00:02:44.300> really

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
epic and I gotta make it looked really

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.170 
epic and I gotta make it looked really
good<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.020> I<00:02:45.860> think<00:02:46.250> he<00:02:46.550> may<00:02:46.670> do<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:46.850> lot<00:02:47.060> better

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
good and I think he may do a lot better

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.120 
good and I think he may do a lot better
than<00:02:47.420> black<00:02:47.630> ops<00:02:47.870> 2<00:02:48.080> may<00:02:48.230> do<00:02:48.290> some<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.040> these

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
than black ops 2 may do some of these

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.180 
than black ops 2 may do some of these
other<00:02:49.340> games<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.990> i<00:02:51.770> am<00:02:51.920> going<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.100> be

other games so and i am going to be

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.830 
other games so and i am going to be
pre-ordering<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.940> obviously<00:02:53.420> i'm<00:02:53.570> going<00:02:53.780> to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
pre-ordering it obviously i'm going to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.810 
pre-ordering it obviously i'm going to
be<00:02:53.900> making<00:02:53.930> some<00:02:54.320> great<00:02:54.500> games<00:02:54.920> few<00:02:55.430> years

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
be making some great games few years

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.660 
be making some great games few years
maybe<00:02:56.030> even<00:02:56.210> campaign<00:02:56.930> playthrough<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:58.520> know

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
maybe even campaign playthrough you know

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.000 
maybe even campaign playthrough you know
anything<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.720> really<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.200> depends<00:03:00.650> on<00:03:00.830> what

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
anything it really just depends on what

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.320 
anything it really just depends on what
you<00:03:01.160> guys<00:03:01.310> think<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.860> mmm<00:03:03.860> halo<00:03:04.250> 5<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.760> halo<00:03:05.000> 6

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
you guys think and mmm halo 5 and halo 6

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.390 
you guys think and mmm halo 5 and halo 6
it's<00:03:05.930> probably<00:03:06.230> gonna<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.440> about<00:03:06.530> them<00:03:07.040> trying

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
it's probably gonna be about them trying

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.560 
it's probably gonna be about them trying
to<00:03:07.580> figure<00:03:07.820> out<00:03:07.880> how<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.060> defeat<00:03:08.390> these

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
to figure out how to defeat these

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.290 
to figure out how to defeat these
enemies<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.560> halo<00:03:09.890> 6<00:03:10.130> obviously<00:03:10.760> they're

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
enemies and halo 6 obviously they're

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.940 
enemies and halo 6 obviously they're
gonna<00:03:11.420> figure<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.780> way<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.020> feed<00:03:12.470> them<00:03:12.710> or

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
gonna figure a way to feed them or

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.830 
gonna figure a way to feed them or
something<00:03:13.370> it's<00:03:13.670> going<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:13.850> happen<00:03:14.000> maybe

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
something it's going to happen maybe
