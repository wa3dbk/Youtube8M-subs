1080p but if you're playing games are
like<00:00:23.670> 720p<00:00:24.600> you'll<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:24.960> no<00:00:25.109> problem<00:00:25.500> running

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619

like 720p you'll have no problem running
games<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.130> battlefield<00:00:26.609> 3<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.880> medium

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
games like battlefield 3 of medium

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
settings and getting 30 frames a second

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.550 
settings and getting 30 frames a second
um<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.420> intended<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.929> high-end<00:00:31.380> gaming

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
um it's not intended for high-end gaming

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.310 
um it's not intended for high-end gaming
but<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.070> still<00:00:32.279> play<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.780> latest<00:00:34.110> games

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
but you can still play the latest games

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200 
but you can still play the latest games
at<00:00:34.530> decent<00:00:34.980> settings<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> decent<00:00:35.940> resolution

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
at decent settings and decent resolution

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.729 
at decent settings and decent resolution
so<00:00:36.630> let's<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.079> into<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
so let's get right into this with the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.580 
so let's get right into this with the
CPU<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.760> an<00:00:38.850> intel<00:00:39.120> pentium<00:00:39.149> g620<00:00:40.110> Sandy

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
CPU we have an intel pentium g620 Sandy

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
CPU we have an intel pentium g620 Sandy
Bridge<00:00:40.710> 2.6<00:00:41.399> gigahertz<00:00:41.700> processor<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
Bridge 2.6 gigahertz processor it's a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
Bridge 2.6 gigahertz processor it's a
dual-core<00:00:42.989> processor<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:44.219> sandy

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
dual-core processor and it's sandy

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
dual-core processor and it's sandy
bridge<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.030> um<00:00:45.329> say<00:00:46.200> you're<00:00:46.350> liking<00:00:46.710> pc<00:00:47.100> gaming

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
bridge so um say you're liking pc gaming

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.150 
bridge so um say you're liking pc gaming
you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.850> upgrade<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.809> an<00:00:49.110> i3<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:49.559> say<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:49.980> get

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you can upgrade to an i3 or say you get

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.500 
you can upgrade to an i3 or say you get
some<00:00:50.309> more<00:00:50.460> money<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.000> upgrade<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
some more money you can just upgrade to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.660 
some more money you can just upgrade to
an<00:00:51.600> i3<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> more<00:00:52.379> upgradable<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.280> would

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
an i3 this is more upgradable I would

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.450 
an i3 this is more upgradable I would
have<00:00:53.760> gone<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.270> AMD<00:00:54.710> dual-core<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.190> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
have gone with an AMD dual-core but I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
have gone with an AMD dual-core but I
figured<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.570> only<00:00:57.809> sixty<00:00:58.199> dollars<00:00:58.469> in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
figured this is only sixty dollars in

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.639 
figured this is only sixty dollars in
you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.890> upgrade<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.510> one<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
you can upgrade to one of the one of the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
you can upgrade to one of the one of the
better<00:01:01.829> chips<00:01:02.160> later<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
better chips later on so this is a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.050 
better chips later on so this is a
pretty<00:01:04.110> good<00:01:04.409> cpu<00:01:04.979> my<00:01:05.220> friend<00:01:05.519> actually<00:01:05.700> has

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
pretty good cpu my friend actually has

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.700 
pretty good cpu my friend actually has
this<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.540> his<00:01:06.570> build<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.110> he<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> run<00:01:07.530> like

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this in his build and he can run like

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.940 
this in his build and he can run like
every<00:01:08.130> game<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.369> ultra<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.450> 720p<00:01:09.990> no<00:01:10.470> problem

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
every game that ultra on 720p no problem

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
every game that ultra on 720p no problem
he<00:01:11.610> has<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> different<00:01:12.119> graphics<00:01:12.479> card<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
he has a different graphics card so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
he has a different graphics card so
obviously<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> plays<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> factor<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.460> still

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
obviously that plays a factor but still

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
obviously that plays a factor but still
this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.330> good<00:01:15.420> cpu<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> price

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this is a really good cpu for the price

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.740 
this is a really good cpu for the price
can't<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.460> say<00:01:17.580> too<00:01:18.000> much<00:01:18.150> bad<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
can't really say too much bad about it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
can't really say too much bad about it
so<00:01:18.780> moving<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.310> motherboard<00:01:20.880> we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
so moving on we have the motherboard we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.410 
so moving on we have the motherboard we
have<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.540> ass<00:01:21.689> rock<00:01:21.960> age<00:01:22.170> 61<00:01:22.850> 1155<00:01:23.850> motherboard

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
stick of four gigs of Kingston it's 1333

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.010 
stick of four gigs of Kingston it's 1333
its<00:01:55.320> twenty<00:01:55.710> bucks<00:01:56.009> pretty<00:01:56.520> cheap<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:57.420> gigs

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
its twenty bucks pretty cheap for gigs

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.310 
its twenty bucks pretty cheap for gigs
is<00:01:58.229> still<00:01:58.710> enough<00:01:59.040> no<00:01:59.969> games<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.540> lot<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.170> games

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is still enough no games a lot of games

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840 
is still enough no games a lot of games
don't<00:02:01.560> even<00:02:01.770> take<00:02:01.920> advantage<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.430> eight<00:02:02.610> gig

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
don't even take advantage of eight gig

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
don't even take advantage of eight gig
so<00:02:03.119> four<00:02:03.960> gigs<00:02:04.229> that'll<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.590> more<00:02:04.770> than<00:02:04.950> enough

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
so four gigs that'll be more than enough

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.999 
so four gigs that'll be more than enough
ah<00:02:05.630> then<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> hard<00:02:07.259> job<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> wet

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
recommended next let's go to the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.090 
recommended next let's go to the
graphics<00:03:48.930> card<00:03:49.110> we<00:03:49.380> have<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.560> sapphire<00:03:49.920> radeon

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
graphics card we have a sapphire radeon

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.150 
graphics card we have a sapphire radeon
HD<00:03:50.390> 6670<00:03:51.390> make<00:03:52.260> sure<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.500> get<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.710> ddr3

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
HD 6670 make sure you get the ddr3

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.660 
HD 6670 make sure you get the ddr3
version<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.480> ddr5<00:03:55.050> version<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.590> faster<00:03:56.550> but

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
version the ddr5 version is faster but

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.010 
version the ddr5 version is faster but
it's<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.910> lot<00:03:57.030> more<00:03:57.090> expensive<00:03:57.480> i<00:03:57.720> think<00:03:57.930> it's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
it's a lot more expensive i think it's

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.530 
it's a lot more expensive i think it's
about<00:03:58.110> 52<00:03:59.070> six<00:03:59.550> dollars<00:03:59.910> more<00:04:00.030> expensive

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
about 52 six dollars more expensive

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.950 
about 52 six dollars more expensive
somewhere<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:00.960> ballpark<00:04:01.080> uh<00:04:02.690> i<00:04:03.690> mean

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
somewhere in that ballpark uh i mean

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.900 
somewhere in that ballpark uh i mean
it's<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.380> pretty<00:04:04.530> good<00:04:04.680> graphics<00:04:05.130> card<00:04:05.400> it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
it's a pretty good graphics card it

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.630 
it's a pretty good graphics card it
doesn't<00:04:06.360> require<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.750> pci<00:04:07.590> connector<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:08.430> it

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
doesn't require a pci connector so it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.450 
doesn't require a pci connector so it
uses<00:04:08.880> very<00:04:09.420> little<00:04:09.570> power<00:04:10.010> if<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.160> want<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
uses very little power if you want to

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.690 
uses very little power if you want to
get<00:04:11.760> some<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:11.970> little<00:04:12.270> bit<00:04:12.480> better<00:04:12.630> i<00:04:12.780> recommend
