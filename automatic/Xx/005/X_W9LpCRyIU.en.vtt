00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
best but we've definitely gained so much

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
best but we've definitely gained so much
depth<00:00:53.969> over<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> years<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.050> it's

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
depth over the years that it's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.010 
depth over the years that it's
incredible<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.370> look<00:00:57.059> back<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.449> where<00:00:57.629> we

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
incredible to just look back to where we

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.079 
incredible to just look back to where we
started<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> where<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.949> are

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
started and where we are

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:10.230 
started and where we are
thus<00:01:01.089> far<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.810> two<00:01:08.320> relays<00:01:08.950> got<00:01:09.490> second

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
thus far I think two relays got second

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.149 
thus far I think two relays got second
and<00:01:10.360> third<00:01:10.540> place<00:01:10.810> there<00:01:11.320> was<00:01:11.439> not<00:01:11.590> one<00:01:11.619> first

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
and third place there was not one first

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.039 
and third place there was not one first
place<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.729> there<00:01:12.880> was<00:01:13.030> an<00:01:13.180> individual<00:01:13.810> girl

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
place and there was an individual girl

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.139 
place and there was an individual girl
that<00:01:14.229> even<00:01:14.500> placed<00:01:14.799> high<00:01:15.070> up<00:01:15.220> there<00:01:15.399> yes

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
that even placed high up there yes

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.580 
that even placed high up there yes

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
same time it's really a personal thing

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.180 
same time it's really a personal thing
but<00:03:52.880> as<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.900> get<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.170> know<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.530> team<00:03:54.769> it's

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.300 
didn't realized like what was going on a
lot<00:05:13.909> because<00:05:14.060> it<00:05:14.210> was<00:05:14.300> my<00:05:14.419> first<00:05:14.449> year<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.229> I

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
lot because it was my first year and I

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.649 
lot because it was my first year and I
knew<00:05:16.310> that<00:05:16.580> we<00:05:16.759> were<00:05:16.909> like<00:05:17.150> we<00:05:17.300> weren't<00:05:17.449> the

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659

knew that we were like we weren't the
best<00:05:17.810> team<00:05:18.139> and<00:05:18.430> then<00:05:19.430> last<00:05:20.150> year<00:05:20.389> we<00:05:20.449> came

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
best team and then last year we came

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.170 
best team and then last year we came
back<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.259> we<00:05:21.349> got<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.560> better<00:05:21.889> record<00:05:22.159> and<00:05:22.550> then

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
back and we got a better record and then

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.820 
back and we got a better record and then
this<00:05:23.360> year<00:05:23.539> we<00:05:23.599> just<00:05:23.840> came<00:05:23.990> back<00:05:24.199> and<00:05:24.470> we<00:05:24.560> did

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
this year we just came back and we did

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.559 
this year we just came back and we did
so<00:05:25.099> much<00:05:25.310> better<00:05:25.370> than<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:25.940> last<00:05:26.060> two<00:05:26.300> years

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
so much better than the last two years

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.330 
so much better than the last two years
and<00:05:26.720> it<00:05:26.780> was<00:05:26.810> like<00:05:27.050> such<00:05:27.319> a<00:05:27.349> surprise<00:05:27.830> because

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.279 
and it was like such a surprise because
I<00:05:28.580> don't<00:05:29.030> think<00:05:29.060> anyone<00:05:29.360> expected<00:05:29.870> us<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.050> do

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
I don't think anyone expected us to do

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.830 
I don't think anyone expected us to do
this<00:05:30.440> well<00:05:30.680> and<00:05:30.979> it's<00:05:31.849> just<00:05:31.970> such<00:05:32.419> a<00:05:32.449> great

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
a huge surprise because we were

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.800 
a huge surprise because we were
listening<00:05:37.129> to<00:05:37.159> the<00:05:37.669> end<00:05:37.879> results<00:05:38.449> and<00:05:38.629> they

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.119 
were going like through like eighth
seventh<00:05:41.060> and<00:05:41.270> usually<00:05:41.599> were<00:05:41.750> like<00:05:42.129> usually

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129

then we realized like maybe we had a
chance<00:05:51.139> of<00:05:51.259> winning<00:05:51.379> and<00:05:51.800> then<00:05:52.039> they<00:05:52.190> said

first Cornwall and I had to take a
double<00:05:54.560> take<00:05:54.830> because<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:55.099> was<00:05:55.190> like<00:05:55.310> Cornwall

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.839 
double take because I was like Cornwall
we<00:05:56.569> won<00:05:56.840> and<00:05:57.440> then<00:05:57.830> everyone<00:05:58.280> just<00:05:58.310> screamed

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
we won and then everyone just screamed

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.999 
we won and then everyone just screamed
and<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.330> was<00:05:59.479> so<00:05:59.870> exciting<00:06:00.259> because<00:06:00.560> we<00:06:00.800> had

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
and it was so exciting because we had

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.589 
and it was so exciting because we had
like<00:06:01.280> we<00:06:01.699> didn't<00:06:01.909> even<00:06:01.940> know<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:02.180> we<00:06:02.360> had<00:06:02.389> the

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
like we didn't even know that we had the

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.540 
like we didn't even know that we had the
chance<00:06:02.780> time<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:03.409> to<00:06:03.919> when<00:06:04.069> that<00:06:04.219> was<00:06:04.370> just

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
chance time and to when that was just

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.770 
chance time and to when that was just
great<00:06:04.759> I<00:06:04.819> think<00:06:05.120> it<00:06:05.240> might<00:06:05.479> have<00:06:05.599> been<00:06:05.629> a

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
great I think it might have been a

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.600 
great I think it might have been a
bigger<00:06:06.139> motivation<00:06:06.860> than<00:06:07.009> having<00:06:07.310> our<00:06:07.430> name

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
bigger motivation than having our name

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.129 
bigger motivation than having our name
on<00:06:07.729> the<00:06:07.759> board<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:08.210> see<00:06:08.360> our<00:06:08.479> code<00:06:08.629> to<00:06:08.780> jump<00:06:08.990> in

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
on the board to see our code to jump in

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.309 
on the board to see our code to jump in
the<00:06:09.259> pool<00:06:09.289> because<00:06:10.099> we<00:06:10.520> we<00:06:11.180> had<00:06:11.389> like<00:06:11.599> all<00:06:11.900> the

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.909 
pressure on us to get on the board
especially<00:06:14.150> for<00:06:14.630> me<00:06:14.750> because<00:06:15.020> I<00:06:15.440> have<00:06:15.680> my<00:06:15.860> two
