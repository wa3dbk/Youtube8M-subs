well<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:05.459> didn't<00:04:05.670> Susan<00:04:05.910> went<00:04:06.060> down<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.300> an

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
ankle injury and I think the fact

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.920 
ankle injury and I think the fact
Reynolds<00:04:08.610> was<00:04:08.670> there<00:04:08.849> last<00:04:09.000> year<00:04:09.239> when<00:04:09.840> it

moment so I don't really know and I
don't<00:05:17.520> think<00:05:17.940> Lori's<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.300> only<00:05:18.510> bloke<00:05:18.690> that

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
don't think Lori's the only bloke that

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.719 
don't think Lori's the only bloke that
does<00:05:19.080> know<00:05:19.320> so<00:05:19.650> there's<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.460> lot<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.669> opinions

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
does know so there's a lot of opinions

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.760 
does know so there's a lot of opinions
going<00:05:21.120> around<00:05:21.419> but<00:05:21.600> Lori's<00:05:22.470> is<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.650> one

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
going around but Lori's is the one

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.779 
going around but Lori's is the one
that's<00:05:22.979> going<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.160> count<00:05:25.100> now<00:05:26.100> we<00:05:26.280> we<00:05:26.490> spoke

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
that's going to count now we we spoke

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.940 
that's going to count now we we spoke
about<00:05:26.820> John<00:05:27.150> Sun<00:05:27.389> before<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:28.050> know<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.380> John

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
about John Sun before you know and John

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.230 
about John Sun before you know and John
so<00:05:29.160> no<00:05:29.220> he's<00:05:29.460> carrying<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.820> bit<00:05:29.940> of<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.090> groin

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
so no he's carrying a bit of a groin

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.740 
so no he's carrying a bit of a groin
injury<00:05:30.300> so<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.930> once<00:05:31.110> again<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.650> think<00:05:32.250> sort<00:05:32.460> of

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
injury so it once again I think sort of

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.510 
injury so it once again I think sort of
common<00:05:33.750> sense<00:05:33.780> will<00:05:34.770> prevail<00:05:34.919> we<00:05:35.250> know<00:05:35.370> what

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
common sense will prevail we know what

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.800 
common sense will prevail we know what
he<00:05:35.580> can<00:05:35.729> do<00:05:35.880> he's<00:05:36.030> been<00:05:36.210> doing<00:05:36.419> it<00:05:36.510> for<00:05:36.539> a<00:05:36.630> long

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
he can do he's been doing it for a long

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.260 
he can do he's been doing it for a long
time<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:37.340> if<00:05:38.340> Laurie<00:05:38.610> want<00:05:38.820> to<00:05:38.880> go<00:05:39.000> John

the<00:06:26.070> season<00:06:26.370> wasn't<00:06:26.520> too<00:06:26.730> bad<00:06:26.910> either<00:06:27.090> so<00:06:27.300> he's

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
the season wasn't too bad either so he's

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.490 
the season wasn't too bad either so he's
obviously<00:06:28.350> had<00:06:28.710> a<00:06:28.740> great<00:06:28.860> preseason<00:06:29.460> and<00:06:30.500> just

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
obviously had a great preseason and just

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.020 
obviously had a great preseason and just
running<00:06:31.740> over<00:06:31.800> people<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.310> know<00:06:32.670> everything

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
running over people you know everything

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.550 
running over people you know everything
that<00:06:33.060> we<00:06:33.210> want<00:06:33.420> to<00:06:33.480> see<00:06:33.630> from<00:06:33.780> Tony<00:06:34.050> he's<00:06:34.290> doing
