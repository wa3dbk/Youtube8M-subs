 hello everyone here once more with 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.149
 today I will teach you how to do 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.219
 a Christmas wreath we are simple and 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.440
 super nice hope you like it and go 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.360
 to start ok ok the first thing that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.120
 they have to get their course 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.890
 crown without no frills with that by 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.160
 of course we are going to decorate it 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.349
 mesh like this one I'm going to use the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.080
 red and gold color campaigns a bow 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.489
 this is optional they just want to do it 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.850
 you can only buy or is 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.920
 Christmas spheres and accessories 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.140
 this is all we need good 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.690
 as you look here, you already have an advantage 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.730
 little bit is nothing more than tying up your 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.030
 mesh and is working the for the two 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.219
 sides and doing honditas ok 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.640
 that's all they have to do and the 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.860
 they have to tie the same leaves 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.710
 from our crown that that 's very 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.760
 simple and that's all they have to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.590
 do 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.570
 and you have to make sure that these skies 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.700
 pretty are at the same level because 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.280
 let's put down our bun and 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.740
 our bells up that do not have 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 make sure that this is the same 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.690
 level 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.020
 and this is all we have to do 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.250
 nothing more if he is giving our our 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.680
 mesh where are you ok 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.870
 and this is all here and nothing is going to 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.010
 contribute 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.010
 the remainder 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.310
 and this is how we have to stay 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.219
 what the orchards have to be 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.080
 lifted up and then everything that 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.380
 start 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.720
 good as you told them 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.020
 they can make their bow they can buy 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.420
 this time I did it and I hope 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.240
 to make them a video is very simple 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.240
 how to make this world and nothing else what 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.730
 they have to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.860
 down your crown you have to have a 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.140
 long wire that 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.360
 to be able to send it to our 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.560
 our ways 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.560
 this is all 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.480
 Must do 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.730
 the accessories are optional i no more 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.360
 that is cutting an idea you 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.590
 You may like what has to be left 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.810
 okay 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.150
 good now 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.730
 what follows is to put our 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.940
 Christmas accessories nothing else we're going 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.880
 go fitting our crown down 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.340
 it has a wire base that there is where 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.069
 we are going to be placing ok me in this 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.280
 occasion I will go putting a golden one and 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.280
 Red 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.420
 and so those who have nothing to do 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.910
 or what 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.690
 they have to make sure that it looks good 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.800
 fastened 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.800
 to our base 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.730
 I am going to use 5 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.730
 5 accessories 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.730
 well that's how it has to be 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.010
 our accessories if you can if 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.599
 they like we can use more is 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.610
 optional and now it's nothing else where 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.400
 we put our areas to cover 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.129
 where are we going to put or place them 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.680
 our spheres here you can 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.410
 use any other accessory 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.070
 your 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.070
 if you are 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.939
 and that 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.849
 and this as I told you is just to go 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.140
 covering our our wires 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:57.680
 where we keep our ways 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.379
 these waits are the stick with silicone 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.450
 nothing else we can put to like you can 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.450
 buy large and nothing else to put or not 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.340
 and my fortune plus chairs and we're going to 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.010
 finish 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.519
 I hope you like them as I said is 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.949
 very simple but obtained very nice 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.099
 and that's how we have to go 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.099
 what 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.890
 and finally nothing else we have to 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.720
 place other traps here can 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.270
 used in terms of centuries that 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.720
 can use wires like these 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.070
 right now all these materials are very 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.070
 easy to get 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.070
 make sure that the mother is good so that 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.290
 they do not know that they fell 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.050
 when it hangs what we do not want 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.300
 that our bows fall out and there are 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.090
 some bells that already come with a 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.729
 but I would put it like that because of that 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.680
 I bought 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.790
 like me 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.380
 separated and nothing else the buoy 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.380
 add to our fields 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.289
 and this no longer they put it place it 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.499
 top of these with them 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.350
 of his little bells and that's all we're going to 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:22.890
 place another one 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.890
 I got here 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.810
 and I think we're finished, I hope that 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.090
 like it 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.690
 I hope to bring you more tutorials from 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.690

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.670
 and spector no longer have to 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:48.130
 make sure it is all 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.130
 well since it will not fall 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.180
