00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
puzzle isn't too hard but it's kind of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.139 
puzzle isn't too hard but it's kind of
the<00:01:23.920> first<00:01:24.130> puzzle<00:01:24.369> in<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.670> game<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.119> I

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
the first puzzle in the game so I

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.820 
the first puzzle in the game so I
thought<00:01:25.450> I'd<00:01:25.600> make<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.810> little<00:01:25.960> quick<00:01:26.200> video<00:01:26.590> of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
thought I'd make a little quick video of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.450 
thought I'd make a little quick video of
it<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.799> you<00:01:29.950> go

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
it there you go

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.570 
it there you go
get<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:30.970> switch<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:33.069> gonna<00:01:33.250> release

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
get the switch and this is gonna release

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.070 
get the switch and this is gonna release
the<00:01:33.850> Beast<00:01:34.770> release<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.950> hounds<00:01:36.929> even<00:01:37.929> though

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
the Beast release the hounds even though

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.580 
the Beast release the hounds even though
it's<00:01:38.259> one<00:01:38.500> hound<00:01:38.799> with<00:01:39.369> three<00:01:40.299> heads<00:01:40.509> I<00:01:40.780> think

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
it's one hound with three heads I think

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
it's one hound with three heads I think
that<00:01:41.740> counts<00:01:41.920> as<00:01:42.159> hounds

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that counts as hounds

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.969 
that counts as hounds
