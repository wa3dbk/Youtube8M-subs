on<00:00:29.949> solving<00:00:30.130> problems<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:31.359> we've<00:00:31.480> spoken

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
on solving problems and we've spoken

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.390 
on solving problems and we've spoken
with<00:00:31.900> many<00:00:32.140> people<00:00:32.470> who<00:00:32.559> are<00:00:32.619> struggling<00:00:33.070> with

the poor quality of low-end 3d printers

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.290 
the poor quality of low-end 3d printers
so<00:00:36.220> we<00:00:36.370> decided<00:00:36.699> to<00:00:36.850> solve<00:00:37.059> those<00:00:37.239> problems

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
so we decided to solve those problems

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.660 
so we decided to solve those problems
