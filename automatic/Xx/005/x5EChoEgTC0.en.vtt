00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.310
 hello guys today we are going to prepare 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:10.950
 chocolate macarons and for that we are going 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.130
 to need 125 grams of almond 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.200
 ground 20 grams of chocolate powder 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.570
 125 grams of whipping cream 100 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.640
 grams of chocolate to melt 20 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 grams of butter and for the meringue 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.860
 We are going to use 4 egg whites a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.289
 quarter of lemon juice and 25 grams of 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.140
 icing sugar 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.540
 and we have everything ready on the one hand 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.430
 we have the icing sugar the almond 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.350
 ground and chocolate powder for another 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.320
 the eggs the icing sugar and the juice 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.230
 lemon let's start mixing the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.860
 sugar icing the ground almonds and the 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.860
 chocolate powder 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.270
 once mixed with the help of a colander 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:08.130
 we are going to sift everything 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:10.110
 and here you can see the difference 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.570
 is sifted and the one not once 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 sieving should look like this 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 now let's get with the meringue 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.540
 The first thing we are going to do is separate 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.540
 the whites of the yolks 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.340
 now we take the clear ones we put them in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.470
 a bowl next to the lemon juice and with 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:09.069
 help of the rod blender we are going to 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:11.440
 Beat it well when it is sparkling 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:24.100
 let's take the icing sugar little by little 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:26.380
 without stopping to beat so that our 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.870
 macarons are perfect the merengue 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.209
 it must be very very dense now we take the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.459
 mix of chocolate and let's add what 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.459
 little by little and let's mix without fear 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.060
 we hope it is a bit integrated 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.840
 let's add another little bit more and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.840
 we are going to remove 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.490
 you 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 and now we throw the last bit that 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.530
 we are left and we will continue to remove 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.099
 this is the texture that is going to go 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.930
 staying while it is like this we will 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:27.540
 with circular movements and doing 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.159
 these movements to remove it when 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.959
 alice we have the surface of the mixture 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.109
 with the spatula and is very smooth 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.400
 we will know that the mass is ready, it should not 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.019
 stay neither very liquid nor very thick 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.389
 do not pass by stirring either, since 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.280
 it can be very liquid for this 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.530
 recipe we are going to use the mancaron kit 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.470
 of the eco in which he carries two mats that 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.710
 I'm going to use one and the copper one 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.090
 Now let's fill the deck open with 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.050
 the dough that we have prepared for 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.720
 macarons 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.060
 As you can see the mat has some 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.120
 brands that will serve as a guide for 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.160
 know the size of our macaroni this 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.600
 will help us make our macarons 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.600
 all are the same size 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.690
 now let's get to fill them out if 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.300
 we want a macaroni 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.740
 little one we will do only the one of the center and 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.139
 if we want a bit more 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.139
 We will give you a little more mass 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.990
 keep in mind that they expand a bit like that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.820
 Do not fill it up to the maximum 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.100
 because if they do not come out 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.470
 once we have them all we are going to 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.210
 put on top of a oven rack and 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.610
 let's tap it for the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.940
 bottom part this is for them to release 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.400
 all the air now we must leave them 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.380
 stand until dry 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.920
 when we touch the surface and be 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.750
 dry will be ready to bake 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.880
 We preheat the oven to 150 degrees and 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.920
 we will give each other for 20 minutes 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.320
 at 135 degrees after this time 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.890
 we're going to take them out of the oven and we're going 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.050
 to let cool completely once the 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.390
 we have ready let's unmold the 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.820
 we have to go squeezing the base and little 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.740
 little by little carefully and pulling in the 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.410
 As you can see, this is the aspect that is going 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.220
 to stay you can also appreciate the skin 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.830
 characteristic of the macaroni 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.260
 now we take chocolate to melt 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.880
 the cream and butter the cream should 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.460
 be hot since we 're going to introduce 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.320
 the chocolate to melt inside and what 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.320
 let's stir until melted 

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:54.110
 once of the melted chocolate we are going to 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.529
 add butter and we 're going to 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.529
 stir 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.550
 now let's take the deck open and what 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:33.610
 let's fill this cream 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:37.980
 chocolate now we take a base from 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.980
 maccarone and let's add the cream 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:54.060
 we have the cream we take another base 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.060
 we cover up we tighten carefully and ready 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.210
 the macarons can be filled with 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.160
 many ways you can use 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:11.390
 jams meringues pastry creams 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:13.850
 what you like the most as you see me 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.590
 I am also filling meringue 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.690
 The only difference is that I have put a 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:53.120
 little bit of coloring to give them a 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:57.430
 little bit of good life guys and here
