00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
enemy fire off you and then you just

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.950 
enemy fire off you and then you just
snipe<00:01:24.640> them<00:01:24.850> then<00:01:25.000> use<00:01:25.180> your<00:01:25.210> powers<00:01:25.689> from<00:01:25.840> a

probably<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:28.930> overload<00:01:29.500> just<00:01:29.799> because<00:01:30.070> it's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
probably be overload just because it's

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.880 
probably be overload just because it's
got<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.640> really<00:01:31.090> nice<00:01:31.500> branching<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.740> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
got that really nice branching in the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.280 
got that really nice branching in the
evolution<00:01:33.700> tree<00:01:33.909> you<00:01:34.030> can<00:01:34.210> either<00:01:34.299> spec<00:01:35.049> it<00:01:35.200> to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
evolution tree you can either spec it to

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.620 
evolution tree you can either spec it to
be<00:01:35.439> like<00:01:35.680> big<00:01:36.189> crowd<00:01:36.460> control<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:37.030> got

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
be like big crowd control it's got

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.200 
be like big crowd control it's got
overloads<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.560> can<00:01:38.710> hit<00:01:38.829> three<00:01:39.130> guys<00:01:39.310> or<00:01:40.000> you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
overloads you can hit three guys or you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.880 
overloads you can hit three guys or you
can<00:01:40.329> spec<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.899> be<00:01:41.049> really<00:01:41.380> powerful

you decide so the way I like to build a
sentinel<00:02:04.299> especially<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.899> turian<00:02:05.319> Sentinel

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
sentinel especially the turian Sentinel

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.649 
sentinel especially the turian Sentinel
which<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.159> one<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.340> my<00:02:06.490> favorite<00:02:06.909> classes<00:02:07.479> and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
which is one of my favorite classes and

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.009 
which is one of my favorite classes and
multiplayer<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.910> overload<00:02:09.910> wolf<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.599> heavy

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
multiplayer is overload wolf and heavy

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.039 
multiplayer is overload wolf and heavy
fitness<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:12.220> can<00:02:12.400> deal<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:12.640> armor<00:02:13.510> barrier

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
fitness you can deal with armor barrier

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.920 
fitness you can deal with armor barrier
and<00:02:14.349> shields<00:02:15.160> which<00:02:15.519> most<00:02:15.849> classes<00:02:16.450> cannot

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and shields which most classes cannot

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.500 
and shields which most classes cannot
deal<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:18.069> I've<00:02:18.160> seen<00:02:18.400> fully<00:02:18.790> level<00:02:19.269> maths

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
deal with so I've seen fully level maths

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960 
deal with so I've seen fully level maths

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
right up close to an enemy there's a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.080 
right up close to an enemy there's a
little<00:02:50.500> trick<00:02:50.709> with<00:02:50.769> cloak<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.519> get<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.700> huge

damage bonus to your melee your guns and
your<00:02:54.579> powers<00:02:55.209> but<00:02:55.540> when<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.019> d<00:02:56.230> clove<00:02:56.560> that

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859

so<00:02:58.959> count<00:02:59.260> into<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.680> guy<00:02:59.799> with<00:03:00.069> anything<00:03:00.819> you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970

so count into the guy with anything you
need

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.080 

so<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.080> Vanguard<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.640> in-your-face

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
so the Vanguard is the in-your-face

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.710 
so the Vanguard is the in-your-face
class<00:03:06.890> most<00:03:07.890> vanguards<00:03:08.700> will<00:03:08.850> be<00:03:09.000> charging<00:03:09.480> in

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
though is that your single target killer

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.010 
though is that your single target killer
that<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.190> can<00:03:20.310> also<00:03:20.460> use<00:03:20.850> Nova<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.750> crowd
