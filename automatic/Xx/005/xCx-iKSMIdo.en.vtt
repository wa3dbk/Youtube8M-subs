considered an art form the next time you
watch<00:04:10.820> your<00:04:10.970> car<00:04:11.150> racer<00:04:11.480> corner<00:04:11.870> watch

watch your car racer corner watch

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.740 
watch your car racer corner watch
carefully<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.310> correlate<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.180> physics<00:04:14.600> of

carefully and correlate the physics of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.170 
carefully and correlate the physics of
what<00:04:14.989> he<00:04:15.230> or<00:04:15.350> she<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.590> doing<00:04:15.709> with<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.790> pedals

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
what he or she is doing with the pedals

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.820 
what he or she is doing with the pedals
and<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.390> steering<00:04:17.450> wheel<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.500> manage

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
and the steering wheel to manage

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.800 
and the steering wheel to manage
traction<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:19.820> they<00:04:20.000> can<00:04:20.180> take<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.510> corner

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
traction so they can take the corner

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.360 
traction so they can take the corner
safely<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.380> effectively

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
safely and effectively

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.000 
safely and effectively
they're<00:04:22.970> applying<00:04:23.419> performance<00:04:24.020> thinking<00:04:24.440> to

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
they're applying performance thinking to

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.969 
they're applying performance thinking to
achieve<00:04:25.310> success<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:26.660> should<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.979> every

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
achieve success and so should you every

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.550 
achieve success and so should you every
time<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.340> drive
