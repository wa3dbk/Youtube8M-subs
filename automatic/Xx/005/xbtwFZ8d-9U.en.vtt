00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
real differences that we look at as

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.640 
real differences that we look at as
creators<00:02:54.880> between<00:02:55.239> anatomical<00:02:56.050> systems<00:02:56.410> I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
creators between anatomical systems I

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.680 
creators between anatomical systems I
like<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.130> way<00:02:57.280> he<00:02:57.550> has<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> question<00:02:58.180> and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
like the way he has a question and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.559

to hold my own against these two guys
and<00:03:12.600> insured<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.989> but<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.650> isn't<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.160> sudden

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
