00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.020 
really being sparked now as we are
learning<00:01:37.350> about<00:01:37.680> space<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.250> technology

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
point of inspiration that's guiding

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.699 
point of inspiration that's guiding
where<00:02:08.929> we're<00:02:09.050> going<00:02:09.259> towards<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.590> future

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
where we're going towards the future

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.570 
where we're going towards the future
exactly<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.959> probably<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:13.070> back<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
exactly and that probably go back to the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.510 
exactly and that probably go back to the
moon<00:02:13.820> on<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.390> Mars<00:02:14.800> other<00:02:15.800> exploration<00:02:16.370> ever

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
moon on to Mars other exploration ever

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.640 
moon on to Mars other exploration ever
such<00:02:16.760> as<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.450> need<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.870> fact<00:02:18.170> we<00:02:18.320> use<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
such as that we need in fact we use the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.560 
such as that we need in fact we use the
Hubble<00:02:19.010> Space<00:02:19.040> Telescope<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:20.120> solve<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
Hubble Space Telescope to solve the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.660 
Hubble Space Telescope to solve the
problem<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.110> we<00:02:21.140> deal<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.650> exactly<00:02:22.430> and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
problem that we deal with exactly and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.100 
problem that we deal with exactly and
there's<00:02:23.209> actually<00:02:23.540> work<00:02:23.720> being<00:02:23.900> done<00:02:23.959> right

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
there's actually work being done right

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.860 
there's actually work being done right
now<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.800> get<00:02:25.280> an<00:02:25.430> outpost<00:02:25.730> on<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> mode<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.630> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
now to get an outpost on a mode and and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.010 
now to get an outpost on a mode and and
to<00:02:27.380> make<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.860> next<00:02:28.100> trip<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.760> Mars<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.750> we're

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
to make that next trip to Mars so we're

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.510 
to make that next trip to Mars so we're
very<00:02:30.050> excited<00:02:30.320> about<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.830> hopefully<00:02:31.220> we'll

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
very excited about that hopefully we'll

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.470 
very excited about that hopefully we'll
have<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.760> be<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.880> part<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.270> do<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.420> think

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
have to be a part of it do you think

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.180 
have to be a part of it do you think
you'll<00:02:32.720> hang<00:02:32.959> around<00:02:33.080> for<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.830> that

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
you'll hang around for that so that that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.270 
you'll hang around for that so that that
would<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.459> highly<00:02:34.730> illogical<00:02:35.570> of<00:02:36.290> course<00:02:36.590> well

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
would be highly illogical of course well

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.710 
would be highly illogical of course well
with<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.520> we<00:02:37.670> know<00:02:37.790> subax<00:02:38.180> got<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:38.600> back

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
with that we know subax got to get back

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.390 
with that we know subax got to get back
to<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.989> 23rd<00:02:39.470> century<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.890> believe<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.250> was

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
to the 23rd century I believe it was

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.000 
to the 23rd century I believe it was
there's<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.150> 24th<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.260> far<00:02:42.500> in<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.830> future

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
there's a 24th it is far in the future

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.890 
there's a 24th it is far in the future
far<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> future<00:02:43.910> Arthur<00:02:44.390> than<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.720> can

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
far in the future Arthur than you can

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.500 
far in the future Arthur than you can
imagine<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> will<00:02:46.459> accept<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.850> I'm<00:02:47.150> not

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
imagine I I will accept that I'm not

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.150 
imagine I I will accept that I'm not
good<00:02:47.660> with<00:02:47.690> math<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.230> with<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.680> guys<00:02:48.920> we're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
good with math and with that guys we're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.110 
good with math and with that guys we're
going<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.340> make<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.640> wrap<00:02:49.820> for<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> day

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
going to make it a wrap for the day
