00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

per<00:01:15.479> second<00:01:15.990> consistently<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:17.670> grassy<00:01:18.270> area

right<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> city

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
right now I'm in you can see the city

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.080 
right now I'm in you can see the city
back<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:22.159> lots<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> particles<00:01:23.580> flying

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
back there lots of particles flying

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.280 
back there lots of particles flying
around<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.770> looks<00:01:25.979> phenomenal

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
around and it looks phenomenal

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.179 
around and it looks phenomenal
so<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.470> move<00:01:28.619> around<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.040> bit<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.890> butter

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so if we move around a bit this butter

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.719 
so if we move around a bit this butter
smooth<00:01:33.229> obviously<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> hacked<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> BIOS<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
smooth obviously I hacked the BIOS so it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.149 
smooth obviously I hacked the BIOS so it
can<00:01:35.909> run<00:01:36.119> smoother<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.560> was<00:01:37.770> completely

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
can run smoother but it was completely

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
can run smoother but it was completely
worth<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.700> considering<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> amount<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
worth it considering the amount of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990 
worth it considering the amount of
performance<00:01:40.710> I'm<00:01:40.829> getting<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.280> near<00:01:41.520> seven

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
performance I'm getting is near seven

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.330 
performance I'm getting is near seven
80s<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.950> yes<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.220> only<00:01:44.460> paid<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.979> only<00:01:46.979> paid

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
80s and yes I only paid I only paid

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.929 
80s and yes I only paid I only paid
about<00:01:48.979> three<00:01:49.979> hundred<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.520> each<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.850> these

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
about three hundred for each of these

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.179 
about three hundred for each of these
cards<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.930> performance<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
cards so for this performance it is

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.510 
cards so for this performance it is
absolutely<00:01:53.790> phenomenal<00:01:55.250> right<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.399> I'm<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
absolutely phenomenal right now I'm a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.860 
soft shadows I'm using AMD cards so
AMD's<00:03:51.840> working<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.320> best<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:52.710> me<00:03:52.830> right<00:03:52.980> now

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
post FX I didn't really see any changes

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.910 
post FX I didn't really see any changes
so<00:03:58.050> that's<00:03:58.260> normal

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
so that's normal

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.740 
so that's normal

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
instruction filtering is x16 ambient

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
is I'm very hot I've changed the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.290 
is I'm very hot I've changed the
settings<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.380> little<00:04:10.500> bit<00:04:10.740> and<00:04:10.950> if<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.120> have

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
settings a little bit and if you have

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.510 
settings a little bit and if you have
everything<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.780> high<00:04:13.050> I<00:04:13.320> mean<00:04:14.010> textures

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
everything on high I mean textures

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.360 
everything on high I mean textures
matter<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.600> textures<00:04:16.049> are<00:04:16.200> on<00:04:16.260> very<00:04:16.500> high<00:04:16.710> but

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
matter so textures are on very high but

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.090 
matter so textures are on very high but
for<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.030> reflections<00:04:18.930> they're<00:04:19.680> not<00:04:19.890> very

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
for like reflections they're not very

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.180 
for like reflections they're not very
eye-catching<00:04:20.580> I<00:04:21.359> use<00:04:21.960> glasses<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.919> really

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
eye-catching I use glasses so I really

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.230 
eye-catching I use glasses so I really
can't<00:04:23.310> tell<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.580> difference<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.180> don't

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
can't tell the difference and I don't

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.340 
can't tell the difference and I don't
wear<00:04:24.479> my<00:04:24.600> glasses

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
wear my glasses

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.180 
wear my glasses
and<00:04:26.960> post-effects<00:04:27.960> since<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.680> particles<00:04:29.100> are

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
and post-effects since the particles are

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.680 
and post-effects since the particles are
so<00:04:29.340> small<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.640> can<00:04:29.910> really<00:04:30.090> tell<00:04:30.270> difference

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
so small I can really tell difference

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.810 
so small I can really tell difference
and<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:30.930> don't<00:04:30.990> use<00:04:31.260> motion<00:04:31.620> blur<00:04:34.310> excuse<00:04:35.310> me<00:04:35.490> so

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
and I don't use motion blur excuse me so

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.850 
and I don't use motion blur excuse me so
it<00:04:36.810> doesn't<00:04:37.080> really<00:04:37.200> matter<00:04:37.410> for<00:04:37.530> me<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.590> yeah

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
it doesn't really matter for me so yeah

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.300 
it doesn't really matter for me so yeah
I<00:04:40.890> will<00:04:41.070> leave<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.370> on<00:04:42.890> this<00:04:43.890> game<00:04:44.100> looks

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
I will leave that on this game looks

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.270 
I will leave that on this game looks
great<00:04:44.610> personally<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.420> love<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.770> far<00:04:47.010> and

but<00:04:52.290> yeah<00:04:52.700> I'm<00:04:53.700> pushing<00:04:54.060> my<00:04:54.180> cards<00:04:55.140> pretty

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
but yeah I'm pushing my cards pretty

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.180 
but yeah I'm pushing my cards pretty
hard<00:04:55.740> right<00:04:55.950> now<00:04:59.570> but<00:05:00.570> uh<00:05:00.770> put<00:05:01.770> your<00:05:01.860> mind<00:05:02.100> to

hard right now but uh put your mind to

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.940 
hard right now but uh put your mind to
it<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.430> can<00:05:02.640> adjust<00:05:02.760> settings<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:04.410> something

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
it you can adjust settings to something

didn't<00:05:18.510> give<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.440> BIOS<00:05:20.430> update<00:05:20.880> for<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.350> but

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
didn't give a BIOS update for that but

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.940 
didn't give a BIOS update for that but
uh<00:05:23.210> yeah<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.540> this<00:05:24.750> game<00:05:24.960> is<00:05:24.990> running<00:05:25.260> smoothly

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
uh yeah so this game is running smoothly

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.970 
uh yeah so this game is running smoothly
above<00:05:26.790> sixty<00:05:27.420> frames<00:05:27.570> per<00:05:27.780> second<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:28.380> those

above sixty frames per second and those
grassy<00:05:29.250> areas<00:05:29.730> though<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.120> dips<00:05:30.330> down<00:05:30.450> to

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
grassy areas though it dips down to

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.130 
grassy areas though it dips down to
sixty<00:05:31.170> I'm<00:05:31.380> trying<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.770> get<00:05:31.890> 70<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.990> adjusted<00:05:33.990> my

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
sixty I'm trying to get 70 I adjusted my

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.500 
sixty I'm trying to get 70 I adjusted my
settings<00:05:34.500> so<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.950> city<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.460> usually<00:05:36.330> would

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
settings so in the city I usually would

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.430 
settings so in the city I usually would
get<00:05:36.660> about<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:38.030> seventy<00:05:39.030> to<00:05:39.150> eighty<00:05:39.360> fps<00:05:40.050> and

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
get about a seventy to eighty fps and

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.920 
get about a seventy to eighty fps and
then<00:05:40.740> Mike<00:05:41.190> houses<00:05:41.730> I<00:05:41.880> usually<00:05:42.180> get<00:05:42.300> ninety<00:05:42.780> to

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
then Mike houses I usually get ninety to

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.720 
then Mike houses I usually get ninety to
a<00:05:42.960> hundred<00:05:46.130> but<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.250> game<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.610> looking

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
a hundred but the game is looking

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.370 
a hundred but the game is looking
phenomenal<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:50.330> lot<00:05:51.330> of<00:05:51.450> this<00:05:51.600> is<00:05:51.840> um<00:05:52.050> very

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
phenomenal a lot of this is um very

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.860 
phenomenal a lot of this is um very
clean<00:05:53.100> looking<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.730> mean<00:05:53.790> even<00:05:54.480> though<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:54.630> have

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
clean looking I mean even though I have

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.840 
clean looking I mean even though I have
the<00:05:55.080> reflection<00:05:55.680> qualities<00:05:56.280> turned<00:05:56.610> down<00:05:56.820> a

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
the reflection qualities turned down a

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.720 
the reflection qualities turned down a
bit<00:05:57.180> they<00:05:57.690> look<00:05:57.930> really<00:05:58.500> smooth

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
bit they look really smooth

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.270 
bit they look really smooth
I<00:05:59.810> cannot<00:06:00.810> tell<00:06:01.170> the<00:06:01.290> difference<00:06:01.320> personally

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
I cannot tell the difference personally

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.900 
I cannot tell the difference personally
and<00:06:02.540> from<00:06:03.540> the<00:06:03.660> side<00:06:03.990> of<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.200> car<00:06:04.440> you<00:06:04.620> can<00:06:04.860> see

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
and from the side of the car you can see

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.180 
and from the side of the car you can see
reflections<00:06:05.910> are<00:06:06.270> perfect<00:06:06.840> at<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:07.830> settings

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
reflections are perfect at the settings

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.440 
reflections are perfect at the settings
I'm<00:06:08.340> using<00:06:08.550> right<00:06:08.850> now<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:10.490> have<00:06:11.490> anti-aliasing

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.550 
I'm using right now I have anti-aliasing
turned<00:06:12.750> off<00:06:12.930> but<00:06:13.350> it's<00:06:13.560> really<00:06:13.770> not<00:06:14.040> needed<00:06:15.560> so

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
turned off but it's really not needed so

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.530 
turned off but it's really not needed so

here I'll drive back down to the city of

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.350 
here I'll drive back down to the city of

excuse my driving skills for they are

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:31.499 
excuse my driving skills for they are
terrible<00:06:25.399> and<00:06:26.059> I<00:06:26.300> am<00:06:26.419> using<00:06:26.930> a<00:06:27.139> single<00:06:27.770> handed

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.899 

as<00:06:32.509> we<00:06:32.719> approach<00:06:33.020> the<00:06:33.229> city<00:06:33.499> the<00:06:34.490> VRAM<00:06:34.879> usage

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
as we approach the city the VRAM usage

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.649 
as we approach the city the VRAM usage
goes<00:06:35.599> down<00:06:36.050> a<00:06:36.080> little<00:06:36.439> bit<00:06:36.939> but<00:06:37.939> the<00:06:38.119> RAM<00:06:38.330> goes

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
goes down a little bit but the RAM goes

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.159 
goes down a little bit but the RAM goes
up<00:06:38.899> because<00:06:39.139> of<00:06:39.529> the<00:06:40.180> more<00:06:41.180> cars<00:06:41.509> and<00:06:41.990> people

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
up because of the more cars and people

up because of the more cars and people
and<00:06:43.300> CP<00:06:44.300> usage<00:06:44.689> goes<00:06:44.960> up<00:06:45.139> in<00:06:45.289> the<00:06:45.439> city<00:06:45.830> because

and CP usage goes up in the city because

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:50.409 
of the cars and vehicles but doesn't
really<00:06:48.740> make<00:06:48.919> a<00:06:48.949> difference<00:06:49.039> if<00:06:49.939> I<00:06:50.360> do

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
really make a difference if I do

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.779 
really make a difference if I do
overclock<00:06:51.229> right<00:06:51.800> now<00:06:51.979> I<00:06:52.009> can't<00:06:52.399> because<00:06:52.669> I'm
