00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 since I discovered that the breads 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.899
 are not so healthy 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.550
 How much does it look like I'm trying to consume breads? 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.380
 more crafts 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.360
 It was a little after that, my video. 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.030
 about the fake whole breads I 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.550
 I bought this bread machine it 's a way 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 very practical to make bread at home I know 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.470
 exactly what are the ingredients that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.180
 they go in the dough and I'm sure 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.949
 does not take any additive 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.580
 I think it's pretty impressive how that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.619
 machine works she mix mafa hitchhiking 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.200
 let the dough rest let the dough 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.390
 to ferment and even to fifa she does everything 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 This alone with a little peace that stays 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.680
 inside this form of this small 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 It seems like there's a zum around the country doing 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.250
 bread but is not a small piece of metal so 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.800
 all I need to do is measure the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.020
 ingredients with this cup and this spoon 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.690
 put everything in here. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.050
 way to put the shape inside the machine 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.969
 and press four buttons in a few hours 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.980
 the house smells wonderful of 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.539
 bread and poop ready 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 The machine comes with this little 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.250
 recipes most of the recipes I never 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 I did and he has few bread choices 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.510
 integral so I find it easier to search 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 recipes on the internet revenue that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.090
 The easiest is the booklet and it takes two 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.130
 measures of white wheat flour and a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 measure of whole wheat flour is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.009
 very simple 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.290
 the most laborious part of the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.549
 process and measure the ingredients 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 We have to do this in any 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.049
 bread recipe whether machine or not 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.380
 So we start filling that 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.890
 bodice with water to the brim with the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.610
 his ball and then I put a spoon and a half 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.250
 of this small farmhouse of two 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 spoons of this large sugar in this 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.729
 recipe goes sugar a spoon of this 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.820
 diabetes in the recipe of the book is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.040
 written margarine but not as 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.620
 margarine and put the olive oil and it works 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.180
 same super bock after I fill 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.430
 that cup to the brim with flour 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.460
 wheat is placed twice in the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.220
 shaft up to the mouth with 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.759
 whole-grain flour placed in the shape of 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.610
 I make a little hole in the middle of this meal 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.620
 using this same glass and I put two 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.530
 spoons and a half of yeast 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.620
 dry spoons of this little one there in the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 half of the flour and then just put the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.610
 inside the machine, tighten the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.580
 buttons she will work there near a 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.140
 button for the options to set which is 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.330
 the cycle that I want is the bread 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.550
 integral that takes three hours and forty 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.220
 the other button to set the color I 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.500
 I want is not light and dark and medium 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.590
 another button to set the amount of 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.630
 which in this case are 600 grams and one 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.430
 button to start and there the machine 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.640
 It works, but we can make new ones. 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.640
 things 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.860
 i 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.310
 exactly three hours and forty 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:50.459
 minutes later the bread is ready 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.590
 the machine is still a bit hot 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:04:03.970
 better grab a glove to get the shape 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:08.440
 machine was not going to get it out of 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.320
 just turn it down and I put a 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.959
 wire type grill here below 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.570
 because if I put the bread straight into the 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.680
 board it will get wet in sweat 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.850
 low 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:27.970
 so it's best to leave a grid 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:34.830
 I had to turn around a little bit 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.830
 this piece that fixing format japan exit 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:45.850
 came out a bit clumsy 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.840
 he's upside down just now 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.120
 sheeran then he stays in that format 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.050
 so a little strange half founded not 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.700
 It's a beautiful bread but I think you can see it. 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.370
 that he has a very hard shell 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.410
 crunchy and then inside it will be 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.740
 but little one has to wait to cool a 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.070
 bit is not time to cut and still 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.320
 stay a half an hour maybe a ball 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.729
 resting without perspiring on the board 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.070
 in a little while I have a little 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.720
 The coldest one we pass the knife will give 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.229
 even to hear the crunching noise 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.229
 his 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.509
 It's already been half an hour before the line is done. 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:52.970
 warm it's so hot now 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:57.840
 we can cut attention to the sound have taken 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:02.580
 my machine bread with a third of 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.630
 integral flour that only has one 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.340
 problem 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.669
 the time of preparation of this bread is so 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.750
 quick that the time of his fermentation is 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.729
 Very short 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.650
 according to some authors including 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.259
 maicon pollÃ¡n that talks about fermentation 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.300
 then in this book the slow fermentation 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.569
 makes a healthier tone because the 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.090
 gluten is easier to digest because it is 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.460
 I want to talk about it again in 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.470
 other company videos 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.449
 you are what you know about what you eat 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.449
 Thank you for coming and until the next 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.150
 is
