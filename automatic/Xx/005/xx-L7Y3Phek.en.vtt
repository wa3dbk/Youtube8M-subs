00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
career with and I think that's really

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.220 
career with and I think that's really
important<00:01:18.790> because<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.750> can<00:01:19.870> do<00:01:19.990> all<00:01:20.110> the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
important because you can do all the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.590 
important because you can do all the
training<00:01:20.410> you<00:01:20.590> want<00:01:20.830> but<00:01:21.610> understanding<00:01:22.390> what

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
training you want but understanding what

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.410 
training you want but understanding what
someone<00:01:22.870> really<00:01:23.680> knows<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.550> how<00:01:24.940> they<00:01:25.120> do<00:01:25.180> it

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
someone really knows and how they do it

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.990 
someone really knows and how they do it
is<00:01:25.750> even<00:01:26.050> better<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.560> like<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.340> fact<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:27.640> I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
is even better I like the fact that I

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.430 
is even better I like the fact that I
can<00:01:28.270> work<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:28.510> lots<00:01:28.750> of<00:01:28.840> different<00:01:28.930> clients

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
can work on lots of different clients

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.490 
can work on lots of different clients
and<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.880> know<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.420> can<00:01:31.600> get<00:01:31.720> experience<00:01:32.410> in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
and you know you can get experience in

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.560 
and you know you can get experience in
one<00:01:32.680> thing<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.280> then<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:33.730> could<00:01:34.240> go<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.420> a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
one thing and then you could go to a

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.940 
one thing and then you could go to a
different<00:01:34.900> client<00:01:35.230> and<00:01:35.410> do<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.590> same<00:01:35.710> role

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
different client and do the same role

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
different client and do the same role
but<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.160> would<00:01:36.250> still<00:01:36.310> be<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.550> completely

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
but it would still be a completely

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.390 
but it would still be a completely
different<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:38.230> know<00:01:38.320> different<00:01:38.890> set<00:01:39.220> of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
different you know different set of

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400 
different you know different set of
requirements<00:01:40.210> for<00:01:40.540> example<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:41.290> it's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
requirements for example and it's

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.810 
requirements for example and it's
completely<00:01:41.890> different<00:01:42.100> working<00:01:42.370> environment

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
completely different working environment

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.520 
completely different working environment
the<00:01:43.240> best<00:01:43.420> bit<00:01:43.600> about<00:01:43.630> working<00:01:43.840> for<00:01:44.080> IBM<00:01:44.230> is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
the best bit about working for IBM is

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.680 
the best bit about working for IBM is
definitely<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.920> culture<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:46.540> is
