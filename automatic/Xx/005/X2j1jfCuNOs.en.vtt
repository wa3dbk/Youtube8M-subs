a long dirt horse and one of the best in

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.980 
a long dirt horse and one of the best in
the<00:04:41.100> world<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.550> they<00:04:42.000> took<00:04:42.150> him<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.600> ride

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
the world and they took him on a ride

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.200 
the world and they took him on a ride
that<00:04:43.290> ended<00:04:43.800> up<00:04:43.890> with<00:04:44.040> us<00:04:44.460> never<00:04:44.820> seeing<00:04:45.090> him

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
that ended up with us never seeing him

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.210 
that ended up with us never seeing him
after<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.900> San<00:04:46.050> Antonio<00:04:46.200> at<00:04:46.590> San<00:04:46.740> Anita<00:04:46.950> well

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
after the San Antonio at San Anita well

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.060 
after the San Antonio at San Anita well
he's<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> Kentucky<00:04:47.940> Derby<00:04:47.970> winning<00:04:49.070> stallion

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
he's a Kentucky Derby winning stallion

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.640 
he's a Kentucky Derby winning stallion
but<00:04:50.700> his<00:04:51.150> pedigree<00:04:51.510> isn't<00:04:52.110> through<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.440> roof

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
but his pedigree isn't through the roof

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.880 
but his pedigree isn't through the roof
so<00:04:53.070> he<00:04:53.730> obviously<00:04:54.030> has<00:04:54.480> value<00:04:54.960> as<00:04:55.140> a<00:04:55.200> stallion

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
so he obviously has value as a stallion

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.980 
so he obviously has value as a stallion
