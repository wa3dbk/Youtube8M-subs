indoor plant grow lighting and has been
for<00:00:20.170> many<00:00:20.230> many<00:00:20.619> years<00:00:21.509> part<00:00:22.509> of<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.720> reason

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
for many many years part of the reason

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.720 
for many many years part of the reason
for<00:00:23.140> this<00:00:23.500> besides<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.220> fact<00:00:24.430> that<00:00:24.520> they<00:00:24.700> just

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
for this besides the fact that they just

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.179 
for this besides the fact that they just
do<00:00:25.029> an<00:00:25.180> excellent<00:00:25.599> job<00:00:25.779> of<00:00:25.960> growing<00:00:26.349> plants<00:00:26.680> is

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
do an excellent job of growing plants is

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.819 
do an excellent job of growing plants is
that<00:00:27.579> you've<00:00:28.059> got<00:00:28.439> flexibility<00:00:29.439> with<00:00:29.680> the

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
that you've got flexibility with the

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.420 
that you've got flexibility with the
type<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.460> bulb<00:00:30.849> ie<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:32.169> type<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.439> spectrum

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
type of bulb ie the type of spectrum

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.190 
type of bulb ie the type of spectrum
that<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:33.910> can<00:00:34.059> be<00:00:34.210> putting<00:00:34.480> down<00:00:34.719> on<00:00:34.989> your

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
that you can be putting down on your

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.280 
that you can be putting down on your
plants<00:00:35.770> so<00:00:35.950> for<00:00:36.520> example<00:00:37.030> if<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.390> mostly<00:00:37.900> have

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
plants so for example if you mostly have

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.290 
plants so for example if you mostly have
plants<00:00:38.890> in<00:00:38.980> what's<00:00:39.220> called<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.640> vegetative

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
plants in what's called the vegetative

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.380 
plants in what's called the vegetative
state<00:00:40.810> or<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:41.740> they're<00:00:42.160> their<00:00:42.520> leafy<00:00:43.000> greens

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
state or you they're their leafy greens

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.810 
state or you they're their leafy greens
or<00:00:43.900> their<00:00:44.650> fruiting<00:00:45.160> plants<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.670> just

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
or their fruiting plants that just

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.820 
or their fruiting plants that just
haven't<00:00:46.120> gotten<00:00:46.330> to<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.630> fruiting<00:00:46.990> point<00:00:47.320> yet

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
haven't gotten to the fruiting point yet

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.560 
haven't gotten to the fruiting point yet
what<00:00:48.520> you're<00:00:48.670> going<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.880> want<00:00:49.060> to<00:00:49.150> use<00:00:49.360> is

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
what you're going to want to use is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.980 
what you're going to want to use is
metal<00:00:49.990> halide<00:00:50.530> bulbs<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.760> give<00:00:52.060> you<00:00:52.329> mostly

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
metal halide bulbs that give you mostly

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
metal halide bulbs that give you mostly
a<00:00:53.020> blue<00:00:53.500> spectrum<00:00:54.340> on<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:55.480> other<00:00:55.630> hand<00:00:56.050> if<00:00:56.440> you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
a blue spectrum on the other hand if you

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.040 
a blue spectrum on the other hand if you
are<00:00:57.160> mostly<00:00:57.520> about<00:00:57.760> fruiting<00:00:58.540> you're<00:00:58.810> going

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
are mostly about fruiting you're going

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.700 
are mostly about fruiting you're going
to<00:00:59.170> want<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.739> high<00:01:00.579> pressure<00:01:01.000> sodium<00:01:01.540> bulb<00:01:02.050> that

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
to want a high pressure sodium bulb that

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.580 
to want a high pressure sodium bulb that
is<00:01:02.770> mostly<00:01:03.280> in<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.610> red<00:01:03.899> spectrum<00:01:04.899> and<00:01:05.110> here's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
is mostly in the red spectrum and here's

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.190 
is mostly in the red spectrum and here's
some<00:01:05.770> examples<00:01:05.799> here<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:07.119> is<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.659> high

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
some examples here so this is a high

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.980 
some examples here so this is a high
pressure<00:01:08.439> sodium<00:01:08.890> bulb<00:01:09.370> this<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.390> metal

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
pressure sodium bulb this is a metal

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.360 
pressure sodium bulb this is a metal
halide<00:01:11.260> bulb<00:01:12.360> now<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:14.350> other<00:01:14.860> thing<00:01:15.250> that's

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
halide bulb now the other thing that's

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.880 
halide bulb now the other thing that's
really<00:01:15.490> nice<00:01:15.880> about<00:01:15.940> these<00:01:16.450> HID<00:01:16.960> fixtures<00:01:17.680> is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
really nice about these HID fixtures is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.350 
really nice about these HID fixtures is
the<00:01:18.070> fact<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.580> can<00:01:18.880> mix<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.300> match

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
the fact that I can mix and match

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.930 
the fact that I can mix and match
components<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.590> choose<00:01:21.220> maybe<00:01:21.580> I<00:01:21.700> want<00:01:21.909> to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
components and choose maybe I want to

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.420 
components and choose maybe I want to
put<00:01:22.000> most<00:01:22.330> of<00:01:22.540> my<00:01:22.600> money<00:01:22.990> in<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.440> reflector<00:01:24.070> or

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
put most of my money in the reflector or

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.969 
put most of my money in the reflector or
in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.760> ballast<00:01:25.270> or<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.630> bulbs<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.350> I've

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
in the ballast or in the bulbs and I've

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.910 
in the ballast or in the bulbs and I've
got<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> lot<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:28.030> flexibility<00:01:28.810> with<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.320> I<00:01:29.380> do

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
got a lot of flexibility with what I do

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.399 
got a lot of flexibility with what I do
so<00:01:30.340> for<00:01:30.700> reflectors<00:01:31.390> let's<00:01:31.630> start<00:01:31.930> up<00:01:32.080> there

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
so for reflectors let's start up there

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.130 
so for reflectors let's start up there
this<00:01:32.950> is<00:01:33.159> an<00:01:33.340> example<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.240> reflector<00:01:34.900> a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
this is an example of a reflector a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.680 
this is an example of a reflector a
reflectors<00:01:36.130> whole<00:01:36.460> purpose<00:01:36.790> as<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.450> might

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
reflectors whole purpose as you might

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.800 
reflectors whole purpose as you might
guess<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.740> reflect<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.580> light<00:01:39.880> down<00:01:40.390> onto

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
guess is to reflect the light down onto

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.789 
guess is to reflect the light down onto
the<00:01:41.140> beds<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:42.040> can<00:01:42.070> get<00:01:42.430> reflectors<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.450> are

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the beds you can get reflectors that are

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.460 
the beds you can get reflectors that are
round<00:01:44.799> you<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:45.700> get<00:01:45.850> them<00:01:45.970> square<00:01:46.510> you<00:01:47.320> can

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
round you can get them square you can

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.469 
round you can get them square you can
get<00:01:47.680> them<00:01:47.860> very<00:01:48.010> inexpensive<00:01:48.970> what's<00:01:49.270> called

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
get them very inexpensive what's called

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.800 
get them very inexpensive what's called
gullwing<00:01:50.110> reflectors<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.880> there's<00:01:52.360> lots<00:01:52.600> of

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
gullwing reflectors so there's lots of

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.170 
gullwing reflectors so there's lots of
choices<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.590> reflectors<00:01:54.220> one<00:01:54.820> thing<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.150> I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
choices in reflectors one thing that I

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.640 
choices in reflectors one thing that I
want<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.570> pay<00:01:55.750> attention<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.260> however

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
want you to pay attention to however

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.920 
want you to pay attention to however
because<00:01:57.159> we<00:01:57.340> learned<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.180> hard<00:01:58.240> way<00:01:58.390> here

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
because we learned it the hard way here

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.320 
because we learned it the hard way here
not<00:01:59.470> all<00:01:59.680> reflectors<00:02:00.400> come<00:02:00.790> with<00:02:01.030> what's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
not all reflectors come with what's

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.950 
not all reflectors come with what's
called<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.840> socket<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.650> cord<00:02:03.009> set<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.270> find<00:02:04.780> out

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
called a socket and cord set so find out

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.219 
called a socket and cord set so find out
if<00:02:05.259> your<00:02:05.470> reflector<00:02:06.130> has<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.850> socket<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.780> cord

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
if your reflector has a socket and cord

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.380 
if your reflector has a socket and cord
in<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.769> if<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.369> doesn't<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.879> just<00:02:10.090> means<00:02:10.269> that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
in it if it doesn't it just means that

underneath the bulb the reason for this

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.100 
underneath the bulb the reason for this
is<00:02:30.250> if<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.490> do<00:02:30.670> any<00:02:30.700> spraying<00:02:31.450> around<00:02:31.870> your

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
is if you do any spraying around your

idea so invest in a lens cover the other
thing<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.390> want<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.780> think<00:02:50.170> about<00:02:50.320> is

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
thing I want you to think about is

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.430 
thing I want you to think about is
something<00:02:51.400> called<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.910> light<00:02:52.180> mover<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.230> may

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
something called the light mover you may

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.690 
something called the light mover you may
have<00:02:53.560> noticed<00:02:53.920> since<00:02:54.040> I've<00:02:54.250> been<00:02:54.430> talking

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
have noticed since I've been talking

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.490 
have noticed since I've been talking
that<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.150> reflector<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.080> moving<00:02:56.470> very

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
that that reflector is moving very

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.910 
that that reflector is moving very
slowly<00:02:57.220> across<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.790> bed<00:02:58.330> why<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.590> nice

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
slowly across the bed why this is nice

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.770 
slowly across the bed why this is nice
is<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:00.670> think<00:03:00.910> about<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.300> way<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.630> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
is if you think about the way that the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.240 
is if you think about the way that the
Sun<00:03:02.170> moves<00:03:03.130> across<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.760> sky<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:05.650> gives<00:03:06.010> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
Sun moves across the sky it gives the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.330 
Sun moves across the sky it gives the
plant<00:03:06.580> really<00:03:07.030> even<00:03:07.720> lighting<00:03:08.020> on<00:03:08.440> all<00:03:08.739> sides

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
plant really even lighting on all sides

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.760 
plant really even lighting on all sides
but<00:03:10.090> if<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.330> just<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:11.020> light<00:03:11.320> fixture

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
but if I just have one light fixture

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.320 
but if I just have one light fixture
putting<00:03:12.130> lights<00:03:12.370> straight<00:03:12.730> down<00:03:12.970> on<00:03:13.180> the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
putting lights straight down on the

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.220 
putting lights straight down on the
plant<00:03:13.650> during<00:03:14.650> its<00:03:14.950> entire<00:03:15.130> 16<00:03:16.090> hour<00:03:16.300> stay<00:03:16.810> I'm

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
plant during its entire 16 hour stay I'm

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.710 
plant during its entire 16 hour stay I'm
going<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.739> get<00:03:17.860> shadowing<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.700> uneven<00:03:19.450> lights

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
going to get shadowing and uneven lights

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.440 
going to get shadowing and uneven lights
so<00:03:20.440> moving<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.010> light<00:03:21.489> back<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.180> forth

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
so moving that light back and forth

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.479 
so moving that light back and forth
across<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.140> bed<00:03:23.350> gives<00:03:23.830> you<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.160> best

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
across the bed gives you the best

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.500 
across the bed gives you the best
possible<00:03:25.120> growth<00:03:25.840> without<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.680> shadowing

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
possible growth without the shadowing

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.940 
possible growth without the shadowing
okay<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.570> we've<00:03:28.840> talked<00:03:29.080> about<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.410> reflector

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
okay so we've talked about the reflector

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.640 
okay so we've talked about the reflector
we've<00:03:30.459> talked<00:03:30.730> about<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.150> bulbs<00:03:31.780> we've<00:03:32.410> got

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
we've talked about the bulbs we've got

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.520 
we've talked about the bulbs we've got
our<00:03:32.890> cord<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.430> socket<00:03:33.880> set<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.840> last<00:03:35.080> thing<00:03:35.410> I

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
our cord and socket set the last thing I

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.199 
our cord and socket set the last thing I
want<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> mention<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.250> what<00:03:36.400> all<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.820> plugs

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
want to mention is what all that plugs

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.259 
want to mention is what all that plugs
into<00:03:37.709> something<00:03:38.709> called<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.040> ballast<00:03:39.580> you<00:03:39.940> have

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269

metal<00:04:18.669> halide<00:04:18.970> bulb<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.500> last<00:04:20.739> thing<00:04:21.100> is

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
metal halide bulb and the last thing is

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.909 
metal halide bulb and the last thing is
we<00:04:21.669> really<00:04:21.820> like<00:04:22.360> digital<00:04:23.110> ballasts<00:04:23.650> there

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
we really like digital ballasts there

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.530 
we really like digital ballasts there
are<00:04:24.070> digital<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.970> there<00:04:25.180> are<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.390> more

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
are digital and there are the more

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.960 
are digital and there are the more
conventional<00:04:25.930> ballast<00:04:26.800> part<00:04:27.460> of<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.669> is<00:04:27.789> the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
conventional ballast part of it is the

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.000 
conventional ballast part of it is the
digital<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.570> just<00:04:28.720> much<00:04:28.990> more<00:04:29.020> compact<00:04:29.770> and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
digital it's just much more compact and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.370 
digital it's just much more compact and
lightweight<00:04:30.419> we<00:04:31.419> think<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.930> does

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
lightweight we think that it does

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.190 
lightweight we think that it does
of<00:04:33.010> powering<00:04:33.520> your<00:04:33.550> system<00:04:34.090> over<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.570> life<00:04:34.750> so

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
of powering your system over the life so

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.740 
of powering your system over the life so
that's<00:04:36.040> all<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.610> components<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.480> sort<00:04:37.660> of

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
that's all the components and sort of

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.370 
that's all the components and sort of
the<00:04:37.840> benefits<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:39.130> hid<00:04:39.940> system<00:04:40.330> now<00:04:41.020> I'd<00:04:41.140> be

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
the benefits of a hid system now I'd be

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.410 
the benefits of a hid system now I'd be
remiss<00:04:41.590> if<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:42.100> didn't<00:04:42.400> mention<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.910> downside

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
remiss if I didn't mention the downside

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.340 
remiss if I didn't mention the downside
and<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.590> that<00:04:45.070> HID<00:04:45.580> systems<00:04:46.240> put<00:04:46.840> off<00:04:47.110> a

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
and that is that HID systems put off a

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.480 
and that is that HID systems put off a
lot<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.890> heat<00:04:48.780> 400<00:04:49.780> watt<00:04:50.020> not<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.740> much<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:51.310> can

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
lot of heat 400 watt not so much you can

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.160 
lot of heat 400 watt not so much you can
put<00:04:51.670> a<00:04:51.700> few<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:52.060> these<00:04:52.090> in<00:04:52.450> an<00:04:52.570> enclosed<00:04:52.960> space

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
put a few of these in an enclosed space

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.410 
put a few of these in an enclosed space
and<00:04:53.620> not<00:04:53.710> have<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:53.920> problem<00:04:54.130> but<00:04:54.880> if<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.120> start

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
and not have a problem but if you start

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.880 
and not have a problem but if you start
getting<00:04:55.720> up<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.290> thousand<00:04:57.130> watt<00:04:57.430> size

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
getting up to the thousand watt size

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
getting up to the thousand watt size
you're<00:04:59.890> going<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.130> be<00:05:00.220> throwing<00:05:00.490> off<00:05:00.700> some

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
you're going to be throwing off some

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.670 
you're going to be throwing off some
serious<00:05:01.150> heat<00:05:01.600> you're<00:05:02.230> going<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.440> want<00:05:02.590> to

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
serious heat you're going to want to

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.220 
serious heat you're going to want to
make<00:05:02.800> sure<00:05:03.040> that<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.490> have<00:05:03.670> venting<00:05:04.390> in<00:05:04.750> your

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
make sure that you have venting in your

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.190 
make sure that you have venting in your
reflector<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.300> actually<00:05:07.540> vent

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
reflector and that you actually vent

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.580 
reflector and that you actually vent
that<00:05:08.500> heat<00:05:08.920> out<00:05:09.190> of<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.790> room<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:10.960> we<00:05:11.350> talked

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
that heat out of the room so we talked

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.800 
that heat out of the room so we talked
before<00:05:11.770> about<00:05:12.040> efficiency<00:05:13.030> there's<00:05:13.570> some

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
before about efficiency there's some

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.530 
before about efficiency there's some
inefficiency<00:05:14.140> in<00:05:14.890> these<00:05:15.160> systems<00:05:15.460> because<00:05:16.210> of

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
inefficiency in these systems because of

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.290 
inefficiency in these systems because of
that<00:05:16.660> heat<00:05:17.140> that's<00:05:17.620> generated<00:05:17.880> other<00:05:18.880> than

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
that heat that's generated other than

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.110 
that heat that's generated other than
that<00:05:19.480> these<00:05:19.990> make<00:05:20.350> terrific<00:05:20.730> plant<00:05:21.730> growing

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
that these make terrific plant growing

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.110 
that these make terrific plant growing
lighting<00:05:22.780> systems<00:05:23.320> and<00:05:23.740> just<00:05:24.640> to<00:05:24.760> make<00:05:24.940> things

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
lighting systems and just to make things

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.790 
lighting systems and just to make things
a<00:05:25.330> little<00:05:25.420> bit<00:05:25.630> easier<00:05:25.690> here<00:05:26.590> at<00:05:26.710> the

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
a little bit easier here at the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.560 
a little bit easier here at the
aquaponic<00:05:27.400> source<00:05:27.640> we've<00:05:27.850> actually<00:05:28.090> pulled

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
aquaponic source we've actually pulled

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.960 
aquaponic source we've actually pulled
together<00:05:28.810> some<00:05:29.260> kits<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:29.800> we<00:05:30.070> call<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.520> Aqua

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
together some kits that we call the Aqua
