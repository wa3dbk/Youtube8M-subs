00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Have you seen here in the sport world that the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.540
 palm trees and saints made 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.300
 beautiful now by the liberators the goiÃ¡s 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.090
 won in case of 2 to 0 bangs 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 already Corinthians got hurt in pacaembu 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.250
 the new tissue that has formed and the trauma 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.439
 who created 1 to 0 Corinthians at 15 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.539
 minutes of the first time stressed the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.599
 patient recovery and roger 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 in October 2005 he fractured the fibula 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:37.170
 right-handed roger put his finger on the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.110
 scar but not in the wound of the team to 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.739
 zion needs care is 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.770
 suffering from bad ties 1 to 7 2 to 2 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.370
 at 17 of the second half 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.370
 the defense proved fragile because a 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 did not go so well in the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.539
 defensive people can not crucify 23 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 players on the defensive defensive part 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.860
 because when everyone wins wins and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 when you lose when the result is not 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.409
 as interesting as how much we 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 I was waiting 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.670
 we can not crucify two or three 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.220
 if we do not lay hands on him and not 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.020
 to follow as a group and not to be 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.380
 supportive to the companion 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.210
 even knowing that he loved us 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.210
 does not get anywhere 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.640
 in the first goal of the Catholic university 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 see how you shot yourself as if you were over 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.369
 a pool and not on the grass in the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.890
 according to the extra and threw himself as if behind 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.409
 them to have a hammock to lie down. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.909
 after the game Antonio Lopes did not want to know 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.399
 pat on the back 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.159
 are the two goals we took and there 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.819
 was the delegate washing dirty clothes at home 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.079
 one of the defects our virtues we leave 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.310
 I have to talk to the player who does not have 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.979
 what to tell you 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.140
 the team had to have killed the game 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.450
 practically the first time after error 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.920
 the good performance we had in the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.099
 first time right 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.530
 the creation of jeans good throws of goals 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:08.379
 but we lost a few goals 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.170
 the exceptional situations I think the 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:14.940
 what was lacking was people killing the game on 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.940
 first time alone, taste 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.470
 had 32 thousand and 600 supporters to 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.910
 help in pacaembu mainly at 15 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.910
 minutes of the second half 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.770
 Wow 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.850
 the strength of the fans has resulted 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.370
 immediate 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.520
 gilmar got rounded the ball and sent 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.520
 for the goal 2 to 1 for the soccer 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.000
 for his 40th game against 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.210
 foreign teams in the history of 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.870
 liberators 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.870
 ae 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.250
 i 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.950
 looks 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.079
 lopes had made this forecast in the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.390
 interval and continue with these with this 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.439
 long throw because they make a 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.379
 line of three 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.799
 let's see if joined May Tevez do 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.349
 good and I think it will have more effect 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.620
 prophet Antony was not wholly 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.170
 valued 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.879
 I tried to fix our left and industry 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.549
 They are coming in with some 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.079
 Great facility on day 19 and the right wing 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.500
 is projecting regulars 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.720
 the 19 fuentes alida designed the goal of the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.730
 final score 2 to 2 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 We hesitate there but now we have 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.650
 I run behind and scored, but I did not leave. 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.659
 happy complete frustration that was not 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.569
 greater than the union of solidarity 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.849
 demonstrated with carlitos tevez because of 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.250
 of the death of the Argentine's grandfather who 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:59.500
 so played to help the comrades 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.500
 This is a real rudder. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.870
 ae 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.360
 When I get caught, we will not make a deal. 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.360
 there
