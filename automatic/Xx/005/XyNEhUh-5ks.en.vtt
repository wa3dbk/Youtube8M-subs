natural wild hay meadows have never been

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.579 
natural wild hay meadows have never been
never<00:00:38.470> been<00:00:38.620> farmed<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.989> time<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.260> it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
never been farmed from the time that it

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.049 
never been farmed from the time that it
was<00:00:41.769> homesteaded<00:00:42.129> that<00:00:42.579> they're<00:00:42.790> still<00:00:43.030> just

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
was homesteaded that they're still just

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.000 
was homesteaded that they're still just
exactly<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.960> same<00:00:44.170> today<00:00:44.409> as<00:00:44.680> they<00:00:44.800> were<00:00:44.829> back

exactly the same today as they were back
there<00:00:45.489> I<00:00:47.370> guess<00:00:48.370> maybe<00:00:48.610> that's<00:00:48.850> what<00:00:49.449> I<00:00:49.480> like<00:00:49.780> a

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
there I guess maybe that's what I like a

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.229 
there I guess maybe that's what I like a
lot<00:00:50.110> of<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.589> we<00:00:50.680> don't<00:00:50.970> just<00:00:51.970> have<00:00:52.089> a

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
lot of it is that we don't just have a

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.960 
lot of it is that we don't just have a
real<00:00:53.050> big<00:00:53.290> population<00:00:54.040> here

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970
