00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello my dear, today I come with 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.340
 a drink because I think that fits 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.260
 pretty good in the season it is very 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.080
 refreshing and I have it very well 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.500
 all ingredients come here 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.170
 is as always with a few ingredients 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 prepare and go totally easy what I am 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.900
 wanted to say before you the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.640
 peppermint stile in the pitcher's 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.619
 the something in the moerser breaks if you 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.679
 one of them has the flavors yet 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.510
 Spread something better in the drink then 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.700
 It's not like hot tea 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.989
 that the flavors come out automatically 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.030
 but because it's a cold drink 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.550
 is it possible that you have to be there a bit? 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 help with either pounding or 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.170
 also with mint raised otherwise I have to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.539
 not much to say just that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.270
 Pour pineapple juice into a pitcher as well 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.969
 like the lemon lemonade plus are 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.300
 then a tablespoon of lemon juice 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.640
 directly lemon juice and there come in 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 then the whole minz stile take 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 ice cubes or crushed ice quite simply 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.409
 what's your favorite drink in your drink 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.930
 want to have and then enjoy ice cold 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.040
 I hope you have my little video 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.049
 fallen for today 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.689
 if you want to have a look 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.159
 facebook or instagram over and over 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 Write me in the comments if it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.659
 you have tasted this juice is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.250
 By the way, very different from what I am 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.020
 but not very bad 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.150
 On the contrary, it tastes totally 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 fruity and now have fun 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.259
 imitate and I'm waiting for yours 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.259
 feedback until then jobs 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.819
 out 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.680
 dÃ¼ren 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.819
 so fast
