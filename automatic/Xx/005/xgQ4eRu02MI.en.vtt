00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
lot of sense to me the idea of the game

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.740 
lot of sense to me the idea of the game
is<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.950> remove<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.730> player's<00:02:57.000> health<00:02:57.299> until

is to remove a player's health until
they<00:02:57.900> die<00:02:58.140> why<00:02:59.010> make<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.310> recharge<00:02:59.910> again<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
they die why make it recharge again the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.100 
they die why make it recharge again the
moment<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:00.780> stop<00:03:01.049> taking<00:03:01.380> damage<00:03:01.819> hmm

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
going to give this game a completely

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.300 
going to give this game a completely
unbiased<00:04:48.030> ten<00:04:48.570> out<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.780> ten<00:04:49.080> merely<00:04:49.800> because

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
unbiased ten out of ten merely because

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.450 
unbiased ten out of ten merely because
it's<00:04:50.580> lasted<00:04:51.240> in<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.540> top<00:04:51.780> ten<00:04:52.080> for<00:04:52.740> so<00:04:53.130> long
