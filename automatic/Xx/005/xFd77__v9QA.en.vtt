00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.720
 hi guys alright video today I 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.020
 step by step of progressive and lumia 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.270
 hydroacoustics illuminates the life 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.330
 your hair of my mother super people 3 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.770
 pine but super thin also then I go 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.510
 show a little step by step 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.390
 For you, I am now showing you the 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.910
 already washed hair is already at this stage 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.810
 washed with clear shampoo for two 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.270
 times 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.640
 This is the one before in photos there that you 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.260
 are you seeing arraes the length 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.820
 It was still a bit flat but the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.460
 it was trash 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.650
 this is the hidropastaza that the beautiful fire 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.080
 This way we have to let her 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.449
 yes it's all lit for five minutes 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.920
 before the application she had us 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.010
 that is what will give a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.159
 quality a differential for hair 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.549
 So I've already started the application 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.339
 hair was 50% dry it was still dry 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.920
 I started the application with 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.170
 a brush and was spreading with a comb 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.360
 teeth so slightly thinner're 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.880
 Good as I said it can be used too. 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.890
 a treatment shampoo but if you have 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.810
 a hair a little harder to use 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.080
 an anti- shampoo shampoo 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.720
 transparent it will be better, it's okay 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.930
 so I applied all over the hair 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.210
 left very wet and then I left 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.400
 to use for half an hour after half 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.070
 Time you can leave until one o'clock 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.410
 after that time and I called only with water 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.230
 And we used to call but did not think 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.020
 much does not rain lightly and then 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.960
 made a brush was not a brush like that 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.480
 looks super brushed does not brush just for 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.250
 dry the same hair but if you have one 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.680
 hard hair makes a good brush 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.920
 after brushing I came with the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.560
 I used the nano titanium of the room 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.230
 sproc is wonderful quality she gives 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.930
 by amazing hair people are a sheet of 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.140
 titanium too that you are seeing there 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 I called ten times at the root and the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.789
 length plus or minus about five to 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.430
 six times is good and this is the result 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.709
 hair plated hair is super 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.109
 brilliant I super enjoy this 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.680
 chapinha she is incredible 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:22.230
 will have her video on the channel? 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.480
 I received my her store cabral 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.409
 I'll leave the link on the screen to 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.230
 You guys stay like this, all hair 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.319
 plated sorry it was dark it was already 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.060
 night but stayed like this gave a lot of 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.060
 People used a flashlight and to show 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.110
 and these people are the result of hair already 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.810
 already washed off the tea already 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.030
 had washed with hydrated shampoo 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.280
 I passed a rebuilder and this is the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.590
 The result I could not come to show 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.870
 you a result of plated hair the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.900
 which is not fair then that is the result 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.550
 In my already washed hair I took pictures that 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.700
 You got to see better how the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.250
 result what was the result of the brush 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.180
 in the hair at the root where I needed it 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.790
 more 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.510
 and now you 're seeing photos I found 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.420
 that this brush smooth or from 80 to 90% looks 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.150
 then the root was not brushed just for us 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.850
 beats dryer and model and tips with 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.580
 without a brush on the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.670
 length and this is the result 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.220
 super approved wonderful progressive 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.770
 it is noteworthy that it has no smell 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.500
 He has not formed them will not bother 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.480
 scalped scalp is much 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.790
 quality the hair became super smooth 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.610
 super silky with incredible quality 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.890
 so people notice a thousand for hydro 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.890
 plastic light of the motive of life
