your fingertips into the receiving
sensors<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.229> happens<00:01:55.590> real<00:01:56.430> quick

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
sensors and all that happens real quick

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.050 
sensors and all that happens real quick
so<00:01:57.030> there's<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.329> no<00:01:57.570> no<00:01:58.409> noticeable<00:01:58.770> delay

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
so there's really no no noticeable delay

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.780 
so there's really no no noticeable delay
and<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.750> been<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.649> as<00:02:01.890> far<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.729> our
