00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
how to hook it up so it shows the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.430 
how to hook it up so it shows the
controller<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:12.240> sort<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.570> how<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:12.990> plug<00:02:13.320> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
controller and sort of how you plug it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.840 
controller and sort of how you plug it
in<00:02:13.560> through<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> Wii<00:02:14.070> modes<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.550> everything

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
in through the Wii modes and everything

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.620 
in through the Wii modes and everything
like<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.680> pretty<00:02:17.360> lot<00:02:20.630> so

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
like that you can see that pretty lot so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.610 
like that you can see that pretty lot so
this<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.170> controller<00:02:22.560> itself<00:02:24.350> pull<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
this is the controller itself pull the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:38.720 
this is the controller itself pull the
packaging<00:02:26.160> out

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.149 

okay<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:39.790> as<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.239> see<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:41.049> table<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.709> blue

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
and this is the controller itself so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.580 
and this is the controller itself so
it's<00:02:52.209> got<00:02:52.359> a<00:02:52.390> really<00:02:52.659> nice<00:02:52.900> kind<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.260> blue

makes<00:04:27.949> it<00:04:28.190> because<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.580> has<00:04:28.729> no<00:04:28.910> kind<00:04:29.090> of

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
makes it because it has no kind of

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.670 
makes it because it has no kind of
branding<00:04:29.720> whatsoever<00:04:30.199> on<00:04:30.410> it
