00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.080

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:16.250
 7 eggs a quarter of a kilo of sugar and 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.380
 just 200 milliliters of water already 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.450
 we are here with friend juan we continue 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.920
 in the hotel tryp la caleta 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.539
 huang let's teach that we have 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.000
 prepared here how many weeks here 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.300
 We have 21 buds 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 seven whole bodies that is and then in 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.360
 that part of there we have put a 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 kilo of sugar and 34 liters of water in 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.190
 syrup and this is to make the candy 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.750
 and then we'll put it in the bottom of the mold 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.940
 in the background the mold that will later be 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.470
 of the lap will be up is tremendous 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.250
 we started to work everything in a bowl 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.720
 true 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.350
 meanwhile here while only 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.610
 making the candy we throw here the 21 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.040
 yolks 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.880
 we have to go twenty buds will 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.710
 let's add 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:07.800
 the 7 eggs whole and now yellow that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.800
 often big horse walk or not walk 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.170
 Latinos a little bit 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.680
 we add the syrup that we have 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.860
 achieved by making the seaweed the water and the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.620
 sugar legend I'm going to sugar watching water 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.010
 and sugar this would be the bacon dough 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.600
 of heaven 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.600
 we give a little more yellow 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.340
 while we are giving the rod that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.720
 this needs a little while I wanted you 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.040
 ask tell us that story about 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.480
 bacon of heaven that you used to say before 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.190
 I'm going to tell you a lot of art for another 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.840
 via short man because the bacon of 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.770
 sky is something typical of here in the area 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.820
 since making a very very rich area in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.080
 wine 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.540
 Well, the winemakers formerly 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.280
 they used not only the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.970
 clear a moment we are going to remove the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.100
 candy that we are giving ourselves a little bit 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.930
 we already have it morenito 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.930
 and we will be in the world 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.820
 that first thing so I later wanted 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.300
 tell me that when we turn around and 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.320
 crystallize 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.090
 I'm going to give a little bit like that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.090
 so that it covers us all the mold 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.500
 all right 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.530
 but they only used the clear 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.659
 came from the egg white to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.400
 clarify the wines their wines 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.680
 then the foremen of the warehouses 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.860
 They met there in the cellar with 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.659
 an amount of clear and huge clear 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.599
 grass inside gravel and they were doing the 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.410
 They took the convents to the convents 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.140
 and then someone to a nun 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.269
 surely to a priest or someone on the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.019
 happened the genius of that curdle 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:53.040
 stacie more is read and already by the year 1300 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.780
 24 in a convent of ceres appeared the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.280
 bacon of heaven as it is now and 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.410
 How do we know what you think of the reader? 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.490
 already pillar is an interesting story 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.710
 curious of course 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.710
 what a wonder here we have and now 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.290
 recipes when we learn curiosities 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.820
 Of course, where does this recipe come from? 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.380
 notice what we have said we have put 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.260
 in that mold the candy in the background 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.310
 above all the yolks and the whites 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.910
 of the eggs that we have said were 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.530
 21 yolks and 7 whole eggs and now what 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.570
 we do now we are going to cover it but 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.370
 a very special way we are going to cover it 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.960
 with the lid of this pot but 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.640
 wrapped in a cloth explain to us before 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.900
 put it because the way feeling of 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.720
 that when it starts to boil like in a 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.370
 water bath, steam will rise and 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.910
 will stay here and not drip in the form of 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:53.240
 rain and does not spoil the bacon 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:53.240
 the trick what in 20 minutes the 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.350
 little dress would have put the cover 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.659
 pillar and the whole team attention the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.129
 surprise that we said let's come with 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.900
 quiet at the end of the plate because 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.909
 I want you to see a little thing we said 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.159

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.930
