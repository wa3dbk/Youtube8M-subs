00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
find the blocks that they would need

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.840 
find the blocks that they would need
here's<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> blue<00:01:34.290> block<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
here's the blue block as you can see the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.960 
here's the blue block as you can see the
blue<00:01:36.030> block<00:01:36.270> has<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:37.070> little<00:01:38.070> triangle<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
blue block has a little triangle on it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.410 
blue block has a little triangle on it
the<00:01:39.329> triangle<00:01:39.720> has<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> upper

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
the triangle has to be on the upper

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.639 
the triangle has to be on the upper
left-hand<00:01:42.420> side<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.200> they<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
left-hand side so they would have to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.960 
left-hand side so they would have to
maneuver<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.310> position<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> block

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
maneuver and position the block

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.280 
maneuver and position the block
correctly<00:01:45.950> next<00:01:46.950> piece<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
correctly next piece here get this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
correctly next piece here get this
orange<00:01:49.560> piece<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.909> see<00:01:51.090> there's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
orange piece and as you can see there's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600 
orange piece and as you can see there's
a<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.600> semicircle<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.340> put

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
a little semicircle that is to be put

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.270 
a little semicircle that is to be put
forward<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> child<00:01:55.079> would<00:01:55.170> turn<00:01:55.470> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
forward so then the child would turn so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.030 
forward so then the child would turn so
they<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.520> find<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.060> semicircle<00:01:58.040> they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
they would find a little semicircle they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.490 
they would find a little semicircle they
would<00:01:59.159> find<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> next<00:01:59.729> piece<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.350> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
would find the next piece here so this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.149 
would find the next piece here so this
yellow<00:02:01.799> piece<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.700> there's<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> them

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
yellow piece here so there's two of them

need<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> Kramer<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.690> solve<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.080> challenge

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
need to Kramer to solve the challenge

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.280 
need to Kramer to solve the challenge
here<00:02:16.880> now<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.240> solved<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> challenge

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
here now they have solved the challenge

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.280 
here now they have solved the challenge
and<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:20.130> looks<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.610> like<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and it looks just like the one in the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
and it looks just like the one in the
picture<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.310> child<00:02:23.550> will<00:02:23.640> go<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.209> on

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
picture the child will go on and on

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.330 
picture the child will go on and on
solving<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.319> different<00:02:25.709> challenges<00:02:26.190> this

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
solving the different challenges this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.770 
solving the different challenges this
was<00:02:26.550> level<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
was level one so this is one of the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.940 
was level one so this is one of the
easiest<00:02:28.170> challenges<00:02:28.890> after<00:02:29.780> challenges

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
easiest challenges after challenges

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.500 
easiest challenges after challenges
progress<00:02:31.950> they<00:02:32.220> get<00:02:32.400> harder<00:02:32.819> they<00:02:33.030> use<00:02:33.180> more

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
progress they get harder they use more

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.150 
progress they get harder they use more
blocks<00:02:33.780> there's<00:02:34.110> more<00:02:34.410> detail<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.069> is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
blocks there's more detail that is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.850 
blocks there's more detail that is
required<00:02:35.690> for<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> child<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.110> pay<00:02:37.319> attention

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
required for the child to pay attention

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.590 
required for the child to pay attention
to<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.840> lot<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.080> these<00:02:41.060> attempt<00:02:42.060> at<00:02:42.180> very<00:02:42.450> very

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
to a lot of these attempt at very very

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.040 
to a lot of these attempt at very very
challenging<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.730> as<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.090> see<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.019> a

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
challenging so as you can see it is a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.199 
challenging so as you can see it is a
game<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.350> grows<00:02:46.769> with<00:02:46.950> your<00:02:47.040> child<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.700> like

game that grows with your child I like
the<00:02:48.330> game<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.900> helps<00:02:49.290> develop<00:02:49.680> logic

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
the game because it helps develop logic

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.500 
the game because it helps develop logic
and<00:02:50.220> problem<00:02:50.459> solving<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.000> those<00:02:51.180> are<00:02:51.330> two

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
and problem solving and those are two

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690 
and problem solving and those are two
skills<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.989> are<00:02:52.680> very<00:02:52.950> very<00:02:53.160> important<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
skills that are very very important to

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.880 
skills that are very very important to
develop<00:02:53.850> because<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.080> needed<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.500> almost

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
develop because it is needed and almost

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
time for her to figure out how these

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.869 
time for her to figure out how these
pieces<00:04:58.689> go<00:04:59.080> together<00:04:59.139> and<00:05:00.009> it's<00:05:00.639> good
