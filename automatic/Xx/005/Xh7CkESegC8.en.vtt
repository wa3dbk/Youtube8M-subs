up are being blocked it just doesn't
tell<00:02:03.090> me<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.409> this<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.649> definitely<00:02:05.130> software

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
tell me that this is definitely software

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
tell me that this is definitely software
that's<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.119> working<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> very<00:02:06.960> intuitive

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that's not working in a very intuitive

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
that's not working in a very intuitive
fashion<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.550> hope<00:02:08.640> Microsoft<00:02:08.910> will<00:02:09.390> take<00:02:09.569> it

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
fashion so I hope Microsoft will take it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390 
fashion so I hope Microsoft will take it
to<00:02:09.780> heart<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.110> figure<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.440> how<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.890> get<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
to heart and figure out how to get a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.430 
to heart and figure out how to get a
better<00:02:11.760> connection<00:02:12.030> between<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.930> error

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
better connection between that error

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.750 
better connection between that error
so<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.770> comes<00:02:13.920> up<00:02:14.070> on<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.250> bottom<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.640> the
