00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
because I had to take the wheel off I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.910 
because I had to take the wheel off I
just<00:01:05.939> did<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> top<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.450> first<00:01:06.799> because<00:01:07.799> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
just did the top one first because it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:19.570 
just did the top one first because it
was<00:01:08.010> easy<00:01:08.220> access<00:01:14.270> there<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.540> go<00:01:17.509> right<00:01:18.509> there

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
was easy access there we go right there

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.450 
was easy access there we go right there
so<00:01:20.580> poked<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> little<00:01:21.810> hole<00:01:22.009> pumped<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> filled

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so poked a little hole pumped it filled

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.020 
so poked a little hole pumped it filled
it<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:25.400> just<00:01:26.400> letting<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> bleed<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it and just letting it bleed out a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.700 
it and just letting it bleed out a
little<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.840> lot<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> came<00:01:28.590> out

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
little bit because a lot of it came out

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.060 
little bit because a lot of it came out
earlier<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.820> slowed<00:01:30.119> down<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.329> lot<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.829> now<00:01:31.920> it's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
earlier it slowed down a lot so now it's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.149
