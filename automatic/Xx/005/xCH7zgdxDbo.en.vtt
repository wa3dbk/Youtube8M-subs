00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.550
 hello how about friends I love you 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.590
 share this good option 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.930
 for those of us who need an extra 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.930
 always battery most of the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.470
 devices that bring to the screen 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.990
 great we have that problem that with 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.230
 the constant use we are left without 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.960
 drums 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.260
 then I present them I know him but 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.190
 I just 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.190
 the power keys 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.130
 that was a 3,200 mega expand 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.510
 this this charger form is going to give us 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:44.149
 an extra charge for our phone 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.260
 small in china and well in white 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.260
 black and it looks like in blue 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.670
 lets go see it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.489
 for me the truth is a very good 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.879
 option because it does not take up much space very 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.879
 light 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.270
 and the truth seems to me of very good 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 materials in the front trade 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 skin here we go to protect the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.950
 device here at the bottom 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.560
 we find the power button and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.560
 the load center these 4 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.280
 points are for charging LEDs 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 in the back 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.250
 just fine the specifications 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.980
 this little tool that we can 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.940
 use to put our device 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.940
 A) Yes 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.220
 how it works we just pull it up 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 while we made the device 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.980
 always sliding from top to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.540
 down 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.540
 we close again up here 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.390
 and ready 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.619
 As you can see, I have 75 now 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.619
 battery percent 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.370
 we go to the power button 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.060
 and start 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.060
 to charge the phone 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.530
 I tried it and the truth if it works 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.610
 works 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.380
 it gives us exactly 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.380
 a full charge for the device 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.469
 and we can reload it 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.160
 here we were telling them 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.960
 we can see our device 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.920
 can use it 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.920
 no need 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.670
 to have it in your hand 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.060
 to remove it just pull another 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.060
 upwards 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.180
 and we have the phone 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.370
 I tell you that for me it is a very good 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.180
 option 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.799
 since always in these devices 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.799
 very large screen we need 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.150
 more battery 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.710
 I can also recommend them for the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.600
 galaxy s3 this magnificent rom or mega rom 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.420
 I have tried enough and it has worked 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.050
 very good in terms of stability and 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.860
 energy saving 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.790
 I was also checking the application 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.790
 I want to share 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.690
 of toilet 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.230
 It is a great option also because 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.770
 most applications do not 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.770
 do they work 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.590
 well - that's been all I hope you 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.190
 liked the video 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:21.139
 and any questions or comments with 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.139
 all taste and until next time
