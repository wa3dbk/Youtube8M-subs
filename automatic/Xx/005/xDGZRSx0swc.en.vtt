00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.770
 Even when jersey swapping after the game the entire team could Torsten 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.299
 Frings barely a smile 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.299
 the mood in the area but despite the 1 0-victory 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.800
 Simon Ende just won a zero that's as good as just expressed as 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.919
 fitter 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.560
 Bernanke underlined that he wanted us 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.999
 maybe not enough 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.800
 already almost written off 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.980
 so are the minstrels 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.710
 I do not know 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.619
 which fairy tale viewers dissatisfied right 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.080
 around the Union 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.810
 if I have not played the second half you can have already admitted 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.960
 can yes with 1 0 through 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.969
 the dangerous thing about white 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.690
 there are 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 for three floors French some they something outside 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 Fans of those from Markt Schwaben and sometimes for blockbuster 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650
 Of course I have 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.460
 I did not have to do it. Congratulations man was obvious 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 satisfied scanner 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.960
 you can be satisfied 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.660
 the last big station 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.500
 it is always about without and things that you can improve and the one percent 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420
 and they have decided us 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.060
 Fact is we have players and need to zero played only so could 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 So very bad Niederburg 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.950
 Weimar play healthy 17 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.490
 Predator they have to come out more times 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.280
 I think ladies will be us 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.810
 a few chances worked out today 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.020
 I have won the game 1 0 that I now quickly the worst 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.120
 initial situation 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.340
 but percent finished of course that is 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.340
 better too 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.580
 could have been for us 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.070
 by simply turning around 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.280
 maybe one or two goal do gymnastics 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.220
 By a percent bad still will surely be a coincidence now we know victory 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.890
 Know who we have to and we want to go further 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.680
 and around 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.140
 yes, but as I said 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.710
 the 1 0 is underlined okay but of course it would have been a little better 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.810
 be able to walk 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170
 yes can not develop this pressure the hl 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.250
 What do you want to develop in such a game? 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.910
 team 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.350
 which you had to hit clearly 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.149
 but we were 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.559
 yes, we were not that sounded like Heinz did 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.149
 I had the impression that the team was in the percent I was physically 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:17.599
 So from the head 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.509
 not at all full »were Zemp 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:21.569
 very similar 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.659
 Tillich Sachsen rules in many actions should 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.659
 there did not want to call a holiday 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.549
 because you can be glad that we have won 1 0 to have what is there 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.439
 and of course not these the starting position they want to get 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.760
 Percent has desired and yes today because of the performance possible 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.819
 would have been 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.989
 they were invited 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.629
 but then still do it 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.629
 Hannover missed and and Bundestag election leadership weakness 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.950
 also the first pursuer 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.989
 Oppenheim 1 0 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.289
 So generally good mood in the team 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:56.389
 today this is not anymore 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.610
 Jörg Asmussen 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.410
 yes maybe five possible that should help you then 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.879
 as well 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.760
 Who does not want to use so many of these so Mattes he at least in 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.670
 the appearance just the concentration so must in the conclusion to the ATS 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.329
 dogged with determination 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.859
 close to really taking the chance and doing things for yourself 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:16.759
 post 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.969
 that has not been done 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.859
 I think we are going to be around now too 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.859
 a lot of games in the legs, no one is that no excuse for it 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:24.490
 SIM 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.510
 the rotation on the printer has reminded us of course so more 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.599
 place 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.199
 MW Amstettner actually played quite well 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.859
 among men at river we all had a much easier time still closed 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.159
 switch together 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.790
 because I think that percent may still confess that 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.210
 Possibility to finish gave 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.069
 maybe even the 1 1 to do well and then it sounds percent 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.719
 "That has been better front 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.799
 the nation so problem here 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.339
 Thalhammer once said so now everyone on board 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.939
 and then it is over again then you have to do it mostly Naldo 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.699
 locked today, Mesut was not there and and he was not there and l 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:58.969
 around 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.329
 then Daniel Jensen was also after a few minutes then had to get out 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.199
 and will 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.069
 These are all things that of course affect our game 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.689
 that we make the short ways before the ways and percent funzt for us too 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.690
 use because both are then honorary door 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.680
 the land is the balls back and does not want that then 80 meters again 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.579
 return and to us the ball on our own sixteen will want so 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.449
 under he must work passages closed local group with 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.449
 working behind 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.599
 And if he does that, we'll be sure we'll do a lap 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.499
 we want to hear less done name wanted to get away from the other 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:32.979
 not like that anymore 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.979
 the timetables that have been done before and 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.800
 Malware would have been so useful to reach the ORF 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.839
 yes as a soloist 4 050 Book on Demand Notebook or play a lecture hall 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.180
 and 10 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.659
 if that is enough Veit 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.000
 Fischer Citizens Paying or 3 0 win cell is good that we are not 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:53.050
 Conceded goal 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.819
 sure right but increase 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.979
 We need to know that we have spoken so that many of us are one 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.309
 Hexenkessel expected 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.789
 Percent that lead neither to be properly demanded and we become whole 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.089
 need to provide another game to progress round with the more sociable 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.509
 Data has been preserved in nature 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.570
 that while making the 3 0 under a year hence has been a contented one 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:15.249
 but 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.360
 Océ 1 0 we will not concede a goal 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.780
 No who if we score in France then it looks even better for 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.589
 us off 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.759
 and then to submit it 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.009
 Now the next game should be the important game for us 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.569
 and around 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.379
 salt it okay but would have better care approx 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.569
 we have to get our soulful results 25'000 desired result 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.979
 it does not exist anymore 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.979
 in my on without having a good starting position 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.669
 that we play to zero already one is not so bad 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.099
 and percents for example have still won but 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.569
 the man should 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.149
 after you reach millions
