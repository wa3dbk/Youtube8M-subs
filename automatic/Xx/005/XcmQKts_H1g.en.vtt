00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.610 
lorac primer but this works great for
the<00:02:16.939> lids<00:02:17.150> for<00:02:17.450> me<00:02:17.599> least<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.019> I'm<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
the lids for me least and I'm like the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.130 
the lids for me least and I'm like the
wand<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:20.030> doesn't<00:02:20.390> really<00:02:20.510> give<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.840> that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
wand and it doesn't really give you that

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.000 
wand and it doesn't really give you that
much<00:02:21.319> product<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.220> elf<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.500> it's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
much product the elf one so and it's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.569 
much product the elf one so and it's
cheap<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:26.269> my<00:02:26.659> point<00:02:26.870> actually<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.769> that<00:02:28.430> it's

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
cheap so my point actually is that it's

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.339 
cheap so my point actually is that it's
good<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:28.970> travel<00:02:29.329> because<00:02:29.629> if<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.870> lose<00:02:30.049> it

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
good for travel because if you lose it

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.220 
good for travel because if you lose it
it's<00:02:30.530> okay<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.190> also<00:02:31.569> since<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.780> has<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.079> doe

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
it's okay and also since it has the doe

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.380 
it's okay and also since it has the doe
foot<00:02:33.500> applicator<00:02:34.090> since<00:02:35.090> you're<00:02:35.209> actually

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
foot applicator since you're actually

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.390 
foot applicator since you're actually
applying<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:36.200> your<00:02:36.290> eye<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.709> probably<00:02:36.950> want

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
applying to your eye you probably want

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.660 
applying to your eye you probably want
to<00:02:37.519> throw<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.730> out<00:02:38.060> more<00:02:38.359> often<00:02:38.590> because<00:02:39.670> you

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
to throw this out more often because you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.319 
to throw this out more often because you

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.190 
side note about the elf brushes they I
did<00:06:31.460> experience<00:06:31.970> a<00:06:32.300> little<00:06:32.480> bit<00:06:32.660> of<00:06:32.840> shedding

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
did experience a little bit of shedding

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.260 
did experience a little bit of shedding
that's<00:06:33.620> kind<00:06:33.950> of<00:06:34.010> what<00:06:34.220> you<00:06:34.310> would<00:06:34.430> expect<00:06:34.880> for

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
that's kind of what you would expect for

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.780 
that's kind of what you would expect for
a<00:06:35.330> cheaper<00:06:35.810> brush<00:06:36.110> you<00:06:36.530> want<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:37.370> know<00:06:37.490> some

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
a cheaper brush you want you know some

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.330 
a cheaper brush you want you know some
sort<00:06:38.030> of<00:06:38.120> starter<00:06:38.600> kit<00:06:38.900> horse<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:40.040> makeup

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
sort of starter kit horse and makeup

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.520 
sort of starter kit horse and makeup
brushes<00:06:40.580> these<00:06:41.150> could<00:06:41.630> definitely<00:06:42.080> work<00:06:42.470> for

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
brushes these could definitely work for

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.800 
brushes these could definitely work for
you<00:06:42.950> before<00:06:43.250> a<00:06:43.460> buck<00:06:43.790> these<00:06:44.180> were<00:06:44.390> totally

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
you before a buck these were totally

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.420 
you before a buck these were totally
worth<00:06:44.990> it<00:06:45.260> and<00:06:45.440> because<00:06:45.860> they're<00:06:45.980> only<00:06:46.130> a<00:06:46.220> buck

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
worth it and because they're only a buck

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.090 
worth it and because they're only a buck
I'm<00:06:46.670> not<00:06:46.850> worried<00:06:47.180> about<00:06:47.240> them<00:06:47.570> breaking

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
I'm not worried about them breaking

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.550 
I'm not worried about them breaking
especially<00:06:49.100> when<00:06:49.220> I<00:06:49.250> travel<00:06:49.990> so<00:06:50.990> I<00:06:51.020> think<00:06:51.440> if

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
especially when I travel so I think if

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.380 
especially when I travel so I think if
elf<00:06:51.770> has<00:06:52.040> another<00:06:52.340> sale<00:06:52.700> again<00:06:52.970> I<00:06:53.150> would

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
elf has another sale again I would

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.230 
elf has another sale again I would
probably<00:06:53.990> buy<00:06:54.200> these<00:06:55.070> brushes<00:06:55.370> again<00:06:55.970> the

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
probably buy these brushes again the

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.140 
probably buy these brushes again the
next<00:06:56.360> item<00:06:56.660> that<00:06:57.050> I<00:06:57.140> have<00:06:57.380> was<00:06:58.250> this<00:06:58.580> elf<00:06:58.850> high

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
next item that I have was this elf high

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.800 
next item that I have was this elf high
definition<00:06:59.780> powder<00:07:00.020> I<00:07:01.150> personally<00:07:02.150> wasn't

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
definition powder I personally wasn't

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.950 
definition powder I personally wasn't
that<00:07:03.290> crazy<00:07:03.770> about<00:07:03.980> it<00:07:04.280> I<00:07:04.430> felt<00:07:04.790> like<00:07:05.030> it<00:07:05.330> gave

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
that crazy about it I felt like it gave

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.290 
that crazy about it I felt like it gave
you<00:07:06.410> or<00:07:07.070> gave<00:07:07.490> me<00:07:07.760> a<00:07:08.620> white<00:07:09.620> cast<00:07:10.010> so<00:07:10.520> it<00:07:10.970> just

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
you or gave me a white cast so it just

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.410 
you or gave me a white cast so it just
didn't<00:07:12.080> work<00:07:12.320> for<00:07:12.380> flash<00:07:12.920> photography<00:07:13.420> maybe

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 
didn't work for flash photography maybe

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.940 
didn't work for flash photography maybe
if<00:07:14.600> you're<00:07:14.750> going<00:07:14.870> to<00:07:14.960> take<00:07:15.170> photographs<00:07:15.740> in

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
if you're going to take photographs in

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.070 
if you're going to take photographs in
natural<00:07:16.580> lighting<00:07:16.760> this<00:07:17.270> would<00:07:17.630> work<00:07:17.750> for<00:07:18.050> you

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
natural lighting this would work for you

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.200 
natural lighting this would work for you
I'm<00:07:18.470> sure<00:07:18.680> I<00:07:18.710> could<00:07:18.920> use<00:07:19.100> it<00:07:19.130> on<00:07:19.640> an<00:07:19.940> everyday

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210
