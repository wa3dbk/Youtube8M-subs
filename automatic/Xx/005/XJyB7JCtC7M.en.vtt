then<00:01:40.310> drag<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:40.880> MLV<00:01:41.450> until<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.440> encoder<00:01:42.830> so

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
then drag that MLV until the encoder so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.649 
then drag that MLV until the encoder so
it's<00:01:43.729> render<00:01:44.149> MLV<00:01:44.539> then<00:01:45.470> go<00:01:45.890> NP<00:01:46.310> foe<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:47.509> let's

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
it's render MLV then go NP foe so let's

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.760 
it's render MLV then go NP foe so let's
check<00:01:47.840> out<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.319> opens<00:01:49.250> up<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.520> new<00:01:49.550> folder
