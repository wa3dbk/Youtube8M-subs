00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.129
 will teach how to renew a skirt is 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.529
 missing this huge huge to me I do not 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.360
 remains and this for him against and voted 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.300
 then I will use it to 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.960
 order it in sister and let's see in 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.329
 where are the sewing here for example 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.430
 is here the sewing then there is 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:36.000
 where are we going to grab from this side 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.490
 and we're going to see everything we have left 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.400
 all that we have left over is what we are going 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.190
 to cut back so that we stay 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.250
 perfectly on the skirt here the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.040
 let's start putting pins all 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.020
 all all all all the way down to 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.020
 cut it out here for example already you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.830
 we cut out we cut this all this 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.050
 piece is here is for example has 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.920
 the background the background do not cut it 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.440
 completely what we are going to do is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.530
 which is for example already a little 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.460
 worn down here we're going to 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.090
 cut out this is the front so the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.000
 front will go shorter than the part of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.000
 back we're going to be careful with the background 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.140
 that we're going to cut it too but 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.840
 not right now 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.900
 they must leave room also for the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.930
 doubles since we met the skirt he 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.720
 the bottom what we are going to do is 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.380
 cut it 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.610
 we remove completely and cut nothing 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.610
 more is 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.290
 we give it shape 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.850
 and we are going to cut nothing else this side 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.560
 it was like a little skirt like this cloth 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.780
 transparent nothing else is for colors 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.510
 Well, it's almost ready 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.360
 we already knew it the only thing that we have left 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.810
 do is in the front we're going to 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.910
 open it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.910
 and we're going to make a hem 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.860
 and nothing else we will sew from this side 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.640
 in the mere little shore so we can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.000
 put the spring 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.790
 and we introduce here and it's like our 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.250
 lack is going to support the spring what 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.790
 let's measure it 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.570
 around our waist and where we have a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 little tight there is where we go to what 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.490
 that right now I was checking is that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.550
 so that they do not become more complicated 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.880
 put the spring we can go putting 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.880
 little by little, see here and I sewed it 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.080
 is already cooked and here goes the spring and 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.950
 nothing more very carefully without them going 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.620
 to sew the spring because if you do not 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.530
 is going to get stuck I would not create the 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.319
 function that we want the skirt to be us 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.020
 well then once we have already 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.890
 finished we will make here a knot 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.020
 and we are going to sew this part we sew it 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.830
 but it is forgiven and maximum to me 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.280
 charm 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.560
 here 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.630
 and I liked it very much I hope that 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.569
 really do it and if they do it 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.550
 can upload their images their videos 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.380
