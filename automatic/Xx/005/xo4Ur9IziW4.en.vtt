00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.120
 Dear garden friends 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.130
 surely they too have already 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.519
 friends about the preparation of the 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.990
 vegetable garden in the next spring 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.020
 entertained and have, of course 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.210
 everyone has their own opinion 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.189
 My motto here is with little 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.650
 crusade good division of 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.230
 gardening and as little as possible 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.869
 to achieve a good success 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.860
 the garden is not to be so for the load 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.710
 but he should stay happy before me 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.650
 only a handshake in the garden awake 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.520
 I consider myself in february / march plant 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.400
 or i do not see any vegetables 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.430
 vending machines should be back where it is 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.140
 in the last year confessed is if one 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.800
 does not really remember anymore 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.710
 what happened last year is 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.730
 it's good to make a sketch now 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.580
 write 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.100
 where to grow the vegetables this year 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.280
 especially if you have one 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.890
 big head makes this sketch is then 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.130
 a good help for the next year 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:20.200
 My garden looks and looks like this 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 I also write the most important 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:33.370
 measure it here are the three feet 50 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:36.470
 and here 650 on this side is a way 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.600
 and here i will also start mangold 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.220
 to see and salad to put 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:50.260
 I now draw a line in one 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:53.360
 distance of about 30 cm and write 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.350
 Mangold on this line that's mine 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.159
 later says RÃ¼hle and in another 30 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:07.990
 centimeter distance I draw again 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.990
 a line and write lettuce 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.609
 the mangold is really big is the 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:18.849
 lettuce already harvested and also on 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:22.409
 this site has the marketplace 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:27.670
 then I divide one way 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:30.310
 I'll do that for me so and for 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.950
 the way i use a press with it 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.090
 I stay with mine about that 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.579
 all goes away variable and the way it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.829
 the name continues to register 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.840
 I arrived on the other side 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.930
 but they do not have to do everything right away 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.810
 can be divided some space too 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.180
 For spontaneous ideas, this sketch 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.969
 Do not do much work 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.090
 Good planning and saves a lot and too 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.260
 work and trouble with the layout 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.849
 I also pay attention to the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.129
 tolerability of the plants 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.310
 important to each other for a good one 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.530
 growth like that and then you can do that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.950
 Planning has completed you can already 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.560
 Targeted buy the first seed since we 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.379
 yes we now have a plan we know too 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.500
 where our first vegetables should be 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.099
 and that's where we start to earth 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.319
 loosen 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.310
 but if loose the earth meet 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.930
 already two worldviews 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.400
 on each other 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.650
 ie digging or light we see 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.019
 dig up that big that some 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.780
 already in autumn do it once 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.479
 digging up will make the urus rich earth 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.379
 down the humus carries loose earth 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.290
 up 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.329
 that makes no sense to me 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.479
 residential structure will also be there 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.310
 destroys some use maybe 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.650
 fresh cattle is in the earth 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.599
 should be introduced 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.299
 yes of course, then really must 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.819
 dig up there with miss but no 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.950
 good experiences have made use 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.280
 I do not dig it in my whole 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.950
 more my goal to relax the earth 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.430
 has the graf cable or also saves 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.900
 fork called a sting and the earth 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.689
 just push up 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.720
 the school is crushed and that too 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.130
 weed unless it can negotiate equal 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.360
 to be removed 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.750
 the humus-rich soil remains at the top one 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.419
 good variant is also a so-called 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.160
 garden kalle may still stab 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.870
 with the foot a little deeper into the earth 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.930
 Press briefly to turn 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.639
 the ground gets loose and here too 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.010
 the eu has to have rich earth 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.110
 but only a little more 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.940
 planting rich enough to relax 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.590
 he also a very simple little hoe 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.330
 then larger lumps of soil are formed 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.599
 even smaller and closed 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.599
 the whole surface still live pulled 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:03.900
 Now the picture is ready where we sow 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:06.330
 and plant when seed in the earth 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.940
 and the plant is the right one 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.630
 It is also easy to sprinkle after casting 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.750
 mulched are often cloudy with 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.870
 Lawn is applied thinly 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.360
 because of the scatter is important the rain 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.880
 should be able to turn the mulch through 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.000
 and he should not be moldy, but 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.190
 can rot 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.810
 the first beet is finished with the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.630
 but the next one will not start immediately 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.090
 but only when the seed or 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.900
 planting of the respective vegetables 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.870
 has come 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.419
 when is that but I'm following me 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.389
 the moon calendar the time out 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.970
 flowering fruit leaf or root 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.669
 Shares the distributed working time in the 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.030
 garden and the work is only 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.669
 but the moon calendar days you can 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.430
 also to put the plants and also 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.970
 as a deadline to fertilize or hook 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.110
 to take 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.910
 all in all 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.510
 one is a little longer in the garden 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.360
 but only briefly does that 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.810
 get the fun at work and it 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.510
 In addition, hardly any cross or nivea arise 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.840
 I'll do with the tips shown 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.480
 work easily and thereby have each one 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.760
 was a lot of joy maybe 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.490
 It's also interesting for them to see 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.280
 others go for gardening 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.650
 In any case, I wish you how 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.710
 just mentioned that even to them 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.840
 the garden never becomes a burden but 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.840
 always just lust remains
