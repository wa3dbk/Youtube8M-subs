00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:14.119 

[Music]

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.099 

it's<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.189> very<00:02:15.370> complicated<00:02:15.609> question<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.480> I'm

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
it's a very complicated question and I'm

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.800 
it's a very complicated question and I'm
afraid<00:02:17.469> I<00:02:17.969> can't<00:02:18.969> really<00:02:19.120> give<00:02:19.329> a<00:02:19.359> very<00:02:19.599> clear

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
afraid I can't really give a very clear

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.929 
afraid I can't really give a very clear
answer<00:02:19.989> but<00:02:20.469> I<00:02:20.799> hope<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.040> one<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.370> at<00:02:21.489> least<00:02:21.639> I

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
answer but I hope that one is at least I

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.720 
answer but I hope that one is at least I
enough<00:02:22.719> to<00:02:22.930> serve<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.230> purpose<00:02:23.560> well<00:02:24.489> that

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
enough to serve the purpose well that

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.520 
enough to serve the purpose well that
something<00:02:25.030> was<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> long<00:02:25.870> answer<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.499> think

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
something was a long answer but I think

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.800 
something was a long answer but I think
we<00:02:26.859> regret<00:02:27.219> that<00:02:27.249> it<00:02:27.549> was<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.879> very<00:02:28.150> informative

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810

we regret that it was a very informative

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
answer I think anybody listening to that

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.149 
answer I think anybody listening to that
would<00:02:31.629> realize<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.200> complexities<00:02:32.859> of<00:02:32.889> the

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
would realize the complexities of the

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.830 
would realize the complexities of the
issues<00:02:33.430> involved<00:02:33.760> as<00:02:34.450> well<00:02:34.659> as<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
question that is also quite sensitive as

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.649 
question that is also quite sensitive as
