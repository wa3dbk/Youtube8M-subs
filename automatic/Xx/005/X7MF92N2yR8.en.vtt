it's<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.209> simply<00:02:42.600> getting<00:02:42.870> into<00:02:43.170> very<00:02:43.770> easy

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
positions with him two shooters so

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.520 
positions with him two shooters so
that's<00:02:45.480> why<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.660> think<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.320> best
