hey<00:00:00.390> in<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.780> video<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.170> want<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.469> talk<00:00:01.709> a

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
hey in this video I want to talk a

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.679 
hey in this video I want to talk a
little<00:00:02.040> bit<00:00:02.220> about<00:00:02.250> savings<00:00:03.149> versus

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
little bit about savings versus

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.570 
little bit about savings versus
investing<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.950> what<00:00:05.160> kind<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
investing and and what kind of the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.820 
investing and and what kind of the
difference<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.120> think<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
difference is I think this is a

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.720 
difference is I think this is a
something<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:08.630> unfortunately<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:10.700> lot<00:00:11.700> of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
something that unfortunately a lot of

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.249 
something that unfortunately a lot of
people<00:00:12.030> don't<00:00:12.150> think<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.570> or<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> lot<00:00:13.230> of

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
people don't think about or a lot of

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.660 
people don't think about or a lot of
people<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.799> think<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.190> lot<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.490> people

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
people I think a lot of people

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.129 
people I think a lot of people
understand<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.299> when<00:00:15.509> they<00:00:15.630> hear<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> but

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
understand this when they hear it but

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.019 
understand this when they hear it but
you<00:00:16.350> know<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:16.890> first<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.430> just<00:00:17.460> don't<00:00:17.789> really

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
you know at first we just don't really

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.849 
you know at first we just don't really
think<00:00:18.210> about<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.529> difference

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
think about this and what the difference

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.269 
think about this and what the difference
is<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> often<00:00:21.449> times<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.990> hear<00:00:22.260> people<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
is so often times I hear people on the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.400 
is so often times I hear people on the
radio<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:23.850> other<00:00:23.970> people<00:00:24.330> comparing<00:00:25.050> whole

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
radio or other people comparing whole

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.630 
radio or other people comparing whole
life<00:00:25.650> insurance<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.849> mutual<00:00:27.840> funds<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.640> 401ks

life insurance to mutual funds and 401ks

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
life insurance to mutual funds and 401ks
and<00:00:29.880> all<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.150> other<00:00:30.300> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.720> retirement

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and all these other kind of retirement

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.560 
and all these other kind of retirement
plans<00:00:31.710> well<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.910> really<00:00:33.149> an<00:00:33.239> apples

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
plans well that's not really an apples

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.900 
plans well that's not really an apples
to<00:00:33.630> apples<00:00:33.960> comparison<00:00:33.989> why<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.760> not

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
to apples comparison why is that so not

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720 
to apples comparison why is that so not
the<00:00:36.000> same<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.710> look<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.010> savings<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the same so if we look at savings and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.090 
the same so if we look at savings and
investments<00:00:39.329> what's<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> difference<00:00:40.350> well

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
investments what's the difference well

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.279 
investments what's the difference well
the<00:00:41.250> real<00:00:41.460> difference<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:43.040> risk

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.500 

particularly<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.890> savings<00:00:50.550> vehicles<00:00:51.120> do

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
particularly that savings vehicles do

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.619 
particularly that savings vehicles do
not<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.930> risk<00:00:52.699> investment<00:00:53.699> vehicles<00:00:54.149> have

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
not have risk investment vehicles have

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.920 
not have risk investment vehicles have
risk<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.350> an<00:00:56.309> investment<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.449> gain<00:00:57.690> money

going to lose you're not gonna have

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.539 
going to lose you're not gonna have
evaporation<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.270> vehicle<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:11.369> where
