00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.000 
cool thing which should kind of not
forget<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.060> say<00:03:52.360> about<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.780> galaxy<00:03:53.110> s5<00:03:53.470> it's

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
forget to say about the galaxy s5 it's

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.410 
forget to say about the galaxy s5 it's
something<00:03:54.610> really<00:03:54.850> cool<00:03:55.000> it's<00:03:55.300> actually

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
something really cool it's actually

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.990 
something really cool it's actually
water<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.650> dust-resistant<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.910> can

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
water and dust-resistant so you can

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.940 
water and dust-resistant so you can
actually<00:03:58.120> dunk<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.750> into<00:03:58.870> water<00:03:59.050> or<00:03:59.560> take<00:03:59.920> a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
actually dunk it into water or take a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.590 
actually dunk it into water or take a
spin<00:04:00.310> sand<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:00.970> still<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.300> phone<00:04:01.480> would

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
spin sand and still the phone would

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.440 
spin sand and still the phone would
function<00:04:01.870> properly<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:03.010> actually<00:04:03.100> ip67<00:04:03.880> 35

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450
