00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.100
 Hi how are you? 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.467
 You must think it strange that I appear like this. 

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:34.900
 Yeah, I confess I had to overcome myself 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.333
 To come and tell you here 

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:44.267
 And remind you of what I did not forget 

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:49.700
 Like what happened the first time I saw you 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.433
 Our eyes met and before I even saw you, I ... 

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:58.200
 I've loved you... 

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:04.533
 Tell me what I should do if I can not forget you? 

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:07.400
 I can not bear it any longer 

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:13.533
 This lack you make me, I already feel that I am incapable 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.533
 To live without you ... 

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:25.983
 Then it was so good, we both did not part 

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:34.767
 The world has become small, the problems ease, a peace 

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:40.900
 The plans for the future that we have made, the vows of eternal love 

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.930
 Where did they end up? 

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:46.800
 I spend my nights in clear 

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.970
 Thinking about where I may have gone wrong 

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.330
 There is no more peace 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.900
 I can not continue anymore 

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:03.870
 Tell me what I should do if I can not forget you? 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.100
 I can not stand it any more 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.970
 This lack you make me, I already feel that I am incapable 

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:16.070
 To live without you 

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:22.330
 Tell me what I should do if I can not forget you? 

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.470
 I can not bear it any longer 

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:31.170
 This lack you make me, I already feel that I am incapable 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.130
 Of living... 

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:43.100
 Without you... 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.270
 Tell me what I should do. 

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:24.030
 If I can not forget you? 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.770
 I can not bear it any longer 

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:29.670
 This lack you make me 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.370
 I already feel that I am incapable 

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:37.800
 To live without you ...
