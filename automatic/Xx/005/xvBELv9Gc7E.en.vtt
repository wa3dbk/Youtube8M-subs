00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 as at haguenau on the occasion of 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.780
 innovate days speaks again in a 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.390
 moment we are with andre erbs 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.790
 first deputy mayor of haguenau 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.410
 we are in your city today a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.840
 city ​​in full change since three 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.740
 four years already yes actually it started 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 the work on the city ​​center at 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.460
 modes started about ten years ago 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.160
 already we have a first operation it was 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.019
 2-2 a facelift of the pedestrian zone that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.210
 exists since the 70s that came 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 a little at the end of life the coating of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.679
 soil so we replaced all and 2004 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.010
 2005 and then we attacked a whole 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.140
 part that revolves around the hall that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.290
 hosts a biweekly market so 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.110
 there remained this space there that he had 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.910
 not benefited from renovations since 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.649
 very many years that is like a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.730
 merchant so that's the goal was to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.079
 to get to do a little can arrange this 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.940
 space to give a little value to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 trade also that is not 100% 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
 pedestrians this city because here we 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.609
 are in a meeting zone 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.899
 exact so unlike the area 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.449
 pedestrian which is next door 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 there we created what is called a 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.890
 encounter area then the car is 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.760
 tolerated but the weakest pedestrian 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.350
 always has priority 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.240
 it gives the detail there is more than 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.580
 sidewalks or a coping so that's it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.259
 so if we take one and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.600
 the layout before it was classic 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.830
 paved on the pavement a sidewalk of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.340
 parked cars in front of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 shops 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750
 and there the new space massaged over 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.890
 sidewalks more asphalt and more 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.060
 cars in front of the traders the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 parking is prohibited in this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.369
 zoned 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.549
 so what makes the motorist 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.840
 when there when he ventures there he and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.130
 he feels a bit uncomfortable he gets 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.509
 not really feel at home creates a little 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.530
 the goal you ride earthquake at the same time 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.060
 everyone meet bikes 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.829
 pedestrians and cars two 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.329
 goals and rolls gently so the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.920
 very speed very obvious speed 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.780
 but also and especially reduce traffic 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.229
 must know that on this axis we had 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 before some 3000 3500 vehicles by 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.520
 day and the last counts we have 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
 facts that are late 2012 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 we got off the monkey at 750 vehicles 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.479
 by day so I saw while walking with 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.729
 you solar panels and told me 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.840
 here we come to recharge his bike by 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.310
 addiction so that's it then that was 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.190
 an achievement we did with a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.819
 local business who who has this set 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.530
 this wireless charging device 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.700
 so this is the last year this 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.370
 it was actually a solar shelter 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.769
 which therefore allows there already captures the energy 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.870
 by the sun and that then allows 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.340
 to charge bikes without cable without 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.019
 yarn just you have a plate to 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.459
 induction that is on the ground one is his bike 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.900
 above and the bike is charles 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.519
 all these works there viage of the museum 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.410
 historical these areas of encounter was 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.260
 decided what to have more people a 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.940
 city ​​center more alive the leit motivates 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.829
 it was always making the other center 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.630
 city ​​enhance its attractiveness 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.069
 it's true that city centers 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.150
 today are in competition 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.890
 my enters already but also with zones 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.310
 commercial opportunities that are created in full 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.980
 nature 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.829
 So here we are, we want to keep 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.450
 shops in the city center their 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.140
 allow to live one must also have 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.060
 an arrangement I would say nice that gives 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.049
 want to walk kiki and safe 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.480
 also for children 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.280
 so that's all this whole of this 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.510
 realization is it working 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.769
 is there more people or is it 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.989
 that this downtown and reinvesting 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.250
 now also by the shops and 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.319
 by the people who come to do 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.150
 their races so ben I think that's 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.280
 walk it's true we've also managed to 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.250
 7 of the animation between the terraces 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.170
 one or one of the tracks if to do 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.549
 come the world and to animate a 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.139
 little space and create terraces 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.769
 so we have some terraces so that's 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.620
 true that the weather 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.959
 currently is still a little bit 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.650
 chilly so it'll come back from here 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.560
 next weekend 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.120
 so it's true that people have fun 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.440
 opposite and echoes the returns that we 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.389
 can have a pleasure to rediscover 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.859
 their city ​​center to be able to 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.959
 to appropriate it is the goal also of these 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.959
 concrete days this is this week
