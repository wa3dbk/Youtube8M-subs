00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
giving the kids instruction last a few

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.240 
giving the kids instruction last a few
minutes<00:06:29.409> now<00:06:30.409> is<00:06:30.560> where<00:06:30.680> you<00:06:30.740> just<00:06:30.889> got<00:06:31.009> to<00:06:31.130> let

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
minutes now is where you just got to let

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.439 
minutes now is where you just got to let
them<00:06:31.400> have<00:06:31.669> a<00:06:31.729> free<00:06:32.000> mind<00:06:32.180> and<00:06:32.389> just

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
them have a free mind and just

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:33.820 
them have a free mind and just
experiment<00:06:33.020> themselves<00:06:33.110> because<00:06:33.620> ultimately

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
experiment themselves because ultimately

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.100 
experiment themselves because ultimately
that's<00:06:34.039> what<00:06:34.220> it's<00:06:34.340> all<00:06:34.430> about<00:06:34.460> so<00:06:34.880> as<00:06:35.870> you<00:06:35.990> can

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
that's what it's all about so as you can

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.700 
that's what it's all about so as you can
see<00:06:36.319> they<00:06:36.500> always<00:06:36.830> try<00:06:37.039> and<00:06:37.270> do<00:06:38.270> things

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
see they always try and do things

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.480 
see they always try and do things
basically<00:06:39.710> get<00:06:39.800> them<00:06:39.889> to<00:06:39.949> have<00:06:40.009> a<00:06:40.099> free<00:06:40.310> man

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
basically get them to have a free man

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.279 
basically get them to have a free man
just<00:06:40.759> go<00:06:41.060> for<00:06:41.270> it<00:06:41.300> I<00:06:41.539> knew<00:06:41.750> this<00:06:41.780> is<00:06:41.960> when<00:06:42.199> you
