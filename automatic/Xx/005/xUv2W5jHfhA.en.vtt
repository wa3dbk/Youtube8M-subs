body<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.579> texture<00:00:39.350> if<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.410> come<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.860> long<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
body and texture if you come in long I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.619 
body and texture if you come in long I
probably<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.570> cut<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> first<00:00:43.320> dry<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.629> may

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
probably will cut you first dry I may

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.389 
probably will cut you first dry I may
leave<00:00:45.780> her<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.230> longer<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.800> time<00:00:47.100> so

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
leave her a little longer in the time so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.180 
leave her a little longer in the time so
I<00:00:47.430> don't<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:48.690> because

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
I don't like the top that first because

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.069 
I don't like the top that first because
you<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.520> short<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> sides<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you know how short I go on the sides and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.350 
you know how short I go on the sides and
it<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.379> determines<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.670> length<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it just determines what length but I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.810 
it just determines what length but I
really<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.020> her<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> top<00:00:58.640> in<00:00:59.640> order

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
really like for her and the top in order

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
really like for her and the top in order
to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.660> sleek<00:01:01.170> look<00:01:02.070> we'd

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.039
