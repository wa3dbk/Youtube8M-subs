00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
this is my plasma deck I was getting

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.700 
this is my plasma deck I was getting
some<00:00:05.100> practice<00:00:05.279> in<00:00:05.640> for<00:00:06.710> upcoming

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
some practice in for upcoming

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.549 
some practice in for upcoming
tournaments<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:09.330> run<00:00:09.630> up<00:00:09.750> against<00:00:10.200> quad

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
tournaments and I run up against quad

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.700 
tournaments and I run up against quad
Rayquaza<00:00:11.099> now<00:00:11.790> quadratic<00:00:12.480> rossa<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
Rayquaza now quadratic rossa is it's a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.129 
Rayquaza now quadratic rossa is it's a
fun<00:00:14.009> debt<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.969> really<00:00:15.570> totally<00:00:15.960> not

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
fun debt but it's really totally not

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.300 
fun debt but it's really totally not
serious<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:16.910> um<00:00:17.910> now<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:19.170> pretty<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
serious at all um now I pretty I have a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
serious at all um now I pretty I have a
beautiful<00:00:20.880> start<00:00:21.090> except<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> lack<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
beautiful start except for a lack of

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.800 
beautiful start except for a lack of
supporter<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.609> pretty<00:00:24.119> much<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:24.359> attach

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
supporter so I pretty much just attach

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.009 
supporter so I pretty much just attach
and<00:00:25.109> pass<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> way<00:00:26.880> quadric<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.810> works

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and pass so the way quadric was it works

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.550 
and pass so the way quadric was it works
is<00:00:28.289> there's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.189> ton<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> energy<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.019> for

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
is there's a ton of energy you have for

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.520 
is there's a ton of energy you have for
rayquaza<00:00:32.009> IX<00:00:32.840> looks<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:33.960> he<00:00:34.110> plays<00:00:34.320> some

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
rayquaza IX looks like he plays some

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.549 
rayquaza IX looks like he plays some
ether<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.730> might<00:00:35.940> play<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:36.840> search<00:00:37.140> as

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
ether it might play some some search as

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.180 
ether it might play some some search as
well<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.540> that's<00:00:39.540> pretty<00:00:40.020> much<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.410> he<00:00:41.010> also

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
well and that's pretty much it he also

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.729 
well and that's pretty much it he also
runs<00:00:41.520> lasers<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.270> um<00:00:42.840> puts<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:43.590> more

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
runs lasers so um puts a little more

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.940 
runs lasers so um puts a little more
pressure<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.489> uh<00:00:45.530> looks<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:46.770> plays

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
pressure on there uh looks like he plays

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
pressure on there uh looks like he plays
some<00:00:47.219> supporters<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> get

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
some supporters as well just to get

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.090 
some supporters as well just to get
other<00:00:48.930> stuff<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.800> pretty<00:00:50.010> much

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
other stuff out and you pretty much

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.080 
other stuff out and you pretty much
celestial<00:00:50.789> roar<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.510> uh<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:53.489> rotate<00:00:54.059> your

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
celestial roar and uh you rotate your

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.729 
celestial roar and uh you rotate your
celestial<00:00:54.539> war<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.170> use<00:00:55.379> oh

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
celestial war and then you use oh

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
celestial war and then you use oh
whatever<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> second<00:00:57.059> attack<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.780> KO

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
whatever the second attack is to KO

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.410 
whatever the second attack is to KO
everything<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.579> you're<00:00:59.699> getting<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.090> knockout

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
everything so you're getting a knockout

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.680 
everything so you're getting a knockout
every<00:01:00.840> other<00:01:00.989> turn<00:01:01.340> um<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.879> he<00:01:03.120> celestial

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
every other turn um so he celestial

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.190 
every other turn um so he celestial
roars<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:05.299> realized<00:01:06.299> my<00:01:06.390> caroms<00:01:06.810> about<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> be

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
roars I realized my caroms about to be

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
roars I realized my caroms about to be
dead<00:01:07.350> anyway<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.070> end<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.670> attaching

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
dead anyway so I end up just attaching

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.240 
dead anyway so I end up just attaching
to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> thunderous<00:01:10.049> instead<00:01:10.530> until<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to the thunderous instead until I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.539 
to the thunderous instead until I
hopefully<00:01:11.640> hit<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> supporter<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.549> hopefully

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
hopefully hit a supporter and hopefully

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
hopefully hit a supporter and hopefully
I<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.850> hang<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> little<00:01:15.869> while<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
I can just hang on for a little while so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.580 
I can just hang on for a little while so
he<00:01:17.220> hits<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.549> ether<00:01:17.850> again<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.450> um<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.049> nice

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
he hits it ether again so um a nice

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
he hits it ether again so um a nice
addition<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.280> Rayquaza<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
addition to Rayquaza I think this is the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480 
addition to Rayquaza I think this is the
only<00:01:21.720> quad<00:01:22.110> Rayquaza<00:01:22.500> I've<00:01:22.710> seen<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.189> runs

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
only quad Rayquaza I've seen that runs

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.660 
only quad Rayquaza I've seen that runs
ether<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.530> as<00:01:25.530> well<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.490> just

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
ether as well as well as really just

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.999 
ether as well as well as really just
most<00:01:27.030> quadrant<00:01:27.479> causes<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> seem<00:01:28.140> unjust<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
most quadrant causes I seem unjust for

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.990 
most quadrant causes I seem unjust for
Rayquaza<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.180> energy<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.619> he<00:01:32.159> captures

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
Rayquaza and then energy so he captures

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.090 
Rayquaza and then energy so he captures
up<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.240> thunderous<00:01:33.689> knocks<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.799> two

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
up my thunderous knocks it out for two

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
up my thunderous knocks it out for two
prizes<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.659> ouch<00:01:37.350> um<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.600> am<00:01:39.720> still<00:01:40.079> not

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
prizes so ouch um and I am still not

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.080 
prizes so ouch um and I am still not
trying<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> support<00:01:40.890> her<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> bust<00:01:41.909> out

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
trying to support her so I bust out

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.929 
trying to support her so I bust out
another<00:01:42.150> kiram<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.700> uh<00:01:46.520> I'm<00:01:47.520> gonna<00:01:47.670> just

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
another kiram and uh I'm gonna just

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
another kiram and uh I'm gonna just
start<00:01:48.090> doing<00:01:48.299> some<00:01:48.689> damage<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.290> hit<00:01:49.530> him<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.770> 50

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
start doing some damage I hit him for 50

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
start doing some damage I hit him for 50
on<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> active<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.960> bench

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
on the active and then the bench

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.950 
on the active and then the bench
Rayquaza<00:01:52.909> he<00:01:53.909> hits<00:01:54.119> me<00:01:54.180> with<00:01:54.240> another<00:01:54.570> laser

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
Rayquaza he hits me with another laser

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.649 
Rayquaza he hits me with another laser
and<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:56.399> don't<00:01:57.000> even<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.210> he<00:01:57.360> needs<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and I don't even think he needs to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.639 
and I don't even think he needs to
Celestra<00:01:58.140> war<00:01:58.460> or<00:01:59.460> 60<00:02:00.360> plus<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.899> laser<00:02:01.110> damage

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
Celestra war or 60 plus the laser damage

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.819 
Celestra war or 60 plus the laser damage
will<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.159> enough<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> knock<00:02:02.700> me<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:04.320> take

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
will be enough to knock me out and take

I'm<00:05:31.419> in<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.660> game<00:05:31.780> um<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.740> continued<00:05:33.220> to

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
I'm in the game um and I continued to

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.860 
I'm in the game um and I continued to
get<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.640> support<00:05:33.970> or<00:05:34.150> drought<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.540> think<00:05:34.780> he

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
get that support or drought I think he

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:43.460 
get that support or drought I think he
would<00:05:34.990> have<00:05:35.080> had<00:05:35.230> it<00:05:35.410> but<00:05:36.160> uh<00:05:37.740> yeah<00:05:38.740> I<00:05:39.360> think<00:05:40.360> I
