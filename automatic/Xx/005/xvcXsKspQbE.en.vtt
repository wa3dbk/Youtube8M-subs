00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.799
 Alexander Mazza in Leopard for thoughts I wanted to do 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.119
 before Ammann until 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.119
 Franken Anspach 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.380
 important replacement was given to all the old lady's people by their products or 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.280
 agree with the predator rappen 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.230
 at 11 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 that can quickly lead to disagreements 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.440
 not everyone likes guessing 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 Not everyone needs their loyalty 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.440
 and then 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.070
 Flee to Herbern the animals underneath 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.710
 there but Rotterdam again deliver the can not run 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.220
 around 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.220
 first of all always clarify everything with roommates 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.860
 Survey with the family 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.489
 especially if you are there generally 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.280
 and around 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.180
 Thank you 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 a very important point 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 yes, of course, the clothes issue received 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.470
 more important 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.570
 Percent rats are small to Peter Witte Thiel does not work Haug said she 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.890
 to prefer 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.160
 of course he four Klopp 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.840
 In this case, a ban, a small handful of deep I do not work too 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.550
 the one in the footprint is of course very important 8 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.010
 I am the tenant 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.240
 long 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.159
 and 50 inches deep 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.560
 and around 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.780
 Japan is at 4 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.590
 The minimum height of 80 cm should not be undercut 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.280
 to a young love just policing 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.520
 to complaints 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.350
 Weidmann also got the idea maybe another two 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 Animals to create more so rather directly 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
 Create a bigger player 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.070
 quietly around 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.069
 because you have to stop where you have space for it 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.069
 and 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.259
 the OPIC Wartenberg not to be underestimated 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:24.879
 small animals could small it is totally wrong here 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.339
 straight the BRD acquisition costs 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.339
 Wieker facilities 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.099
 and Bargteheide needs that's course way 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.359
 first moment Wertheimer 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.109
 Unfortunately the animals are not really 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.339
 around 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:47.319
 but there are also other costs to reduce further Heck 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.789
 Krakow that is unfortunately often like that 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.619
 that they can get sick 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.679
 and there you can 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:56.419
 important 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.119
 Veterinarian examination or would have already been on Schumann im 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.279
 three digit range 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.299
 percent 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.299
 You also have to set up in nine years 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.509
 around 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.259
 is just a matter of light waves that stop you from getting broken or 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.549
 At some point we are not playing anymore 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.549
 Gallen you have to pay attention to everything 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:23.549
 not necessarily winning today 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.149
 if you now high-quality products Gladbach course, percent 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.149
 Of course you would guess 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.269
 yes, as I said vet costs participant Milan 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.319
 there you should always or left something to the side, even if you have it 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.760
 but not if you have that then it was synonymous 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.319
 around 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.319
 Hartmann then at least up 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.499
 the grand prize 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.569
 Per cent, of course, they need the animals 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.839
 just in the beginning it was about the subjects Oetken you need a lot of patience and 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.159
 also soon 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.769
 To guess authors are not necessarily theirs now only in their activities 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.539
 but they need their spout one to two hours each day 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.319
 Of course, a lot of run-out has to secure maps 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.559
 but it will also be worth the euro 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.559
 in the video give funny how to do that 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.139
 Those in need of further employment need to be encouraged 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.229
 Wiegand and thinks at this time 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.089
 luckily her role could still get really asked tasks there 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:37.090
 you completely different things you lived 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.090
 disagree continued francs 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.139
 Also important is the question of how many animals would you have to ride 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.629
 An own attitude is absolutely out of the question 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.129
 two animals 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.400
 however, I said at least 3 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.729
 Weigeldt around 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.050
 you have the problem very fast that you are there then and entertainment 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.669
 now through construction work on the gang Sascha Rhyner 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.550
 but no one knows this means relatively well and then has again 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.470
 enough time to look after my enemies for more partners 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.169
 One thing is important too 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.059
 around 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.289
 Alinghi is still good enough what I have mentioned before 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.740
 because you wanted to stop thinking about it could keep the animals 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.639
 need their conspecifics 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.210
 around them have a very special social behavior 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.599
 What people do absolutely nothing 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.159
 can give 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.279
 or on 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.469
 can not replace at all 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.689
 almost other species 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:48.689
 Aigner had served 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.869
 if then, of course, they ask the question 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.210
 Gun business opportunity 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.889
 Prandelli my dress management received a duel with the number 13 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:07.680
 or comment or well-known song paper containing their departure 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.759
 maybe already behind you 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.089
 around 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.169
 Yes 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.279
 Percent of female animals must be 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.470
 I'd say a bit of music was a bit of a hype 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.760
 yes if Jan's general newspaper are the Taliban Drake Beam Morin 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.360
 the abroad had one percent 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.939
 for very important 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.690
 that's both 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.379
 A little quieter, too, thankful 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:35.569
 May from Schulz 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.169
 Apartments located around there can be prevented 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:44.329
 are my line after a half hour abroad based holding 

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:46.409
 guided and hands or 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.369
 the officials could 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:53.229
 there are the exceptions the test winner turnouts are totally polluted or they 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.050
 but suddenly completely exaggerated 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.330
 an official 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.590
 Karmann wants to wake up completely for life basically a compensation 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.589
 Females turned-up people calmer 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.629
 around 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:09.509
 structurally Huppert interpreted between keeping that today times 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.849
 Well, think about it 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.849
 before the expert acquires 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.309
 I can hardly wait in the end, of course, Eutin I told myself 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:24.579
 everything still
