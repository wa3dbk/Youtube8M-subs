00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.800 
got sick she ended up having cancer
throughout<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.150> spread<00:04:21.450> throughout<00:04:21.690> her

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
throughout and it spread throughout her

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.200 
throughout and it spread throughout her
body<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.410> we<00:04:23.100> had<00:04:23.190> to<00:04:23.250> put<00:04:23.340> her<00:04:23.400> down<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.880> that

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
was really upsetting and I think it goes

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.730 
was really upsetting and I think it goes
just<00:04:26.850> goes<00:04:27.450> without<00:04:27.660> saying<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.230> I<00:04:28.440> really

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740
