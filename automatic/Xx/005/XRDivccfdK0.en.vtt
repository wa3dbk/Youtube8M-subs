to create a half like this and then you
have<00:02:02.159> like<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.310> half<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.820> then<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.300> chop<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
have like a half and then I just chop it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.290 
have like a half and then I just chop it
and<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:05.009> thicker<00:02:05.369> chunks<00:02:05.909> just

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
and like little thicker chunks just

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.960 
and like little thicker chunks just
because<00:02:06.570> we're<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> boil<00:02:07.409> these<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.790> all

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
because we're going to boil these so all

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.220 
because we're going to boil these so all
I'm<00:02:12.090> doing<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.569> cutting<00:02:12.870> them<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:14.540> like<00:02:15.540> little

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
I'm doing is cutting them in like little

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:25.520 
I'm doing is cutting them in like little
chunks<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.769> this<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.760> halves<00:02:22.670> like<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.530> so

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
chunks like this in halves like that so

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.449 
chunks like this in halves like that so
hopefully<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.890> guys<00:02:26.010> can<00:02:26.070> see<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:28.459> so

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
hopefully you guys can see that and so

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.800 
hopefully you guys can see that and so
then<00:02:29.610> i'm<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> put<00:02:31.320> those<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.570> same

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
then i'm going to put those in the same

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.300 
then i'm going to put those in the same
boiling<00:02:34.170> water<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.620> i<00:02:34.650> was<00:02:34.800> using<00:02:35.010> again

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
boiling water that i was using again

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.840
