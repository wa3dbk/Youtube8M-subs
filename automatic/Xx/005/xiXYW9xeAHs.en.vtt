00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.719
 I'll show you what I mean in my little one 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.469
 table high with greenhouse today 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.469
 will plant 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:27.290
 Here I plant two peppers 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:30.320
 have to be well meant because centimeters 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.360
 they will not if they can 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.309
 I'll just drop you off yes and there 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.690
 inside they feel really good 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:42.290
 because through the greenhouse prevails 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.830
 naturally climatic conditions like 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.670
 in Sicily, for example, but that if we 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.970
 debug 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.519
 yes I think in two months can 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.030
 we are already the first paprika fruits 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.100
 see 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.610
 so now I've got a little earth 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.240
 stated 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.870
 the root of course enough 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.870
 three years 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.160
 that would be enough is about now 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.160
 a 20-centimeter story 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.549
 lovely 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.549
 machines plantlets 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.229
 Of course I will plant the peppers 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.390
 here in the side and sit there because 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.929
 I do not really have to do much and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.929
 the salad 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.360
 maybe get there 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.940
 plants come 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.159
 to say something 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:09.910
 I now have a gap of about 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.319
 25 cm enough space 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.939
 for the plants 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.939
 Now I want machines 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.420
 they look that way 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.960
 where about this little plant then 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.010
 already two months until the first harvest 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.640
 can be done 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.120
 but at the moment we have something like that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.120
 other side 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.860
 then I still have 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.950
 a few salad plants are coming now 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.569
 right in here in front of the place that I am 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.330
 I have to be open for the first time 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.640
 even think about what's coming up to here 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.340
 next time 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.340
 baumgartner christian ciao and bye
