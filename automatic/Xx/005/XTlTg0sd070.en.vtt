00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.360
 how to put a receiver ready to bus 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.490
 hammer difficulty levels 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.009
 whether it is level or slightly 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.080
 raised the catcher to tile offers 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.060
 an ideal solution you can link 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.430
 personalized decor and a perfect 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.810
 waterproofing you will need a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.050
 catcher for tiling with his 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.849
 base of abrasives from the band of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 hips and it and a products 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.309
 lubricant gel sealing of a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.670
 preformed angle its complete system of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.440
 emptying for bonding and sealing 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.780
 also provided pvc glue from 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 mortar glue lacolle tile epoxy 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.860
 of a pvc pipe and the tiles or the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.860
 mosaic of your choice 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.350
 take a meter of a pencil 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.539
 of a spirit level of a mixer of a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
 drill a trowel of a saw at 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.030
 metals from a handsaw of a dish 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.739
 stainless steel thouars with a notched spatula of a 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 marc with flowers of a plaster knife 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.920
 and a vise this type of receivers ready to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.500
 tiler exists in several formats 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.000
 square or rectangular and his profile 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.659
 integrates the necessary slope to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.909
 flow 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 it can be cut with a handsaw or 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.930
 the jigsaw to fit 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.060
 space devoted to your shower 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 however, it is important to respect 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.870
 geometry 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.270
 according to the position of the conduit 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.880
 evacuation you will have to choose between 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.460
 a vertical or horizontal dump for 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.440
 integrate a horizontal dump you have to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 use a rise in two parts 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.280
 the base then serves as 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.220
 support footings to integrate the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.650
 exhaust duct stick a tape 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 resilient on the outskirts of your refusal 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.570
 of recipients to mitigate 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.850
 dilation between the wall and the receiver 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
 spotted the duct passage on the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.679
 underbody panel and traces at 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.299
 pencil 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.060
 cut with a jigsaw or with a 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.489
 hand saw with fine teeth prepared 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.590
 elements of the flue 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.959
 to the receiver emptying systems 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.680
 remember that a slope of 1% is 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.680
 necessary 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.080
 without waiting to stick the elements of the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.900
 drives and connects the emptying system 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.190
 let the pvc glue test 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.380
 the evacuation remove the elements 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.720
 prepared the mortar sticks with a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.690
 blender then drop some pads 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.820
 regularly distributed ask the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.250
 underbody by compressing it on the ground 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.000
 while controlling flatness high 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.000
 spirit level 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.300
 by sticking the top of the underbody to 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.190
 mortar glue with a French spatula 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.350
 applied a bead of lubricants angela 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.959
 from the manufacturer on the seal of the system of 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.270
 dump also garnish the back of 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.560
 double mortar mortar trays 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.000
 glue using the stainless steel thouars dish 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.400
 turn the receiver over and place it 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.319
 against the bedrock by positioning 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.080
 the dump well under the frame 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.090
 integrated in the receiver clip parts 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.040
 emptying them by pulling towards the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.260
 up until you hear the clicks 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.239
 pressed on the entire surface of the receiver 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.320
 to adhere and control the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.320
 flatness high level bubble 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.639
 engaged gray support in the body 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.889
 from the siphon to the stop 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.499
 an element of your tile and measure 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.560
 the excess height postpone the measurement 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:48.469
 subtracting 3 mm for the thickness of 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.719
 the glue then signed the surplus and 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.849
 Burr and carefully place the cut 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.919
 the siphon cup then the anti system 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.129
 odors and finally place the support of 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.129
 wire rack 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.930
 prepare the special sealing product 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.520
 of the manufacturer applied on the periphery of 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.290
 catcher going up a little on the wall 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.690
 for sealing deposited in the corner 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.560
 a preformed and strengthened piece 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.900
 carefully recover without waiting 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.320
 a thin layer of egg products 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.470
 then the connections with the wall 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.610
 upholstered and cover with products 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.010
 treated equally the sides of the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.010
 elevation formed by your receiver 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.070
 with this title of receiver simplest 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.780
 to follow the slopes of flow without 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.250
 to make the cut is to 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.479
 use mosaic 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.030
 in any case you must use 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.950
