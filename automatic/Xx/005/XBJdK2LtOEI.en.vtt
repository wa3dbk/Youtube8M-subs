00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.410 
it's less kind of about this is how a

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.929 
it's less kind of about this is how a
thing<00:00:05.740> is<00:00:05.859> done<00:00:06.100> it's<00:00:06.309> more<00:00:06.460> kind<00:00:06.700> of<00:00:06.759> about

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.020 
thing is done it's more kind of about
just<00:00:07.269> like<00:00:07.750> having<00:00:08.080> a<00:00:08.170> disregard<00:00:09.040> for<00:00:09.219> the

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.030 
just like having a disregard for the

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.669 
just like having a disregard for the
tradition<00:00:10.599> of<00:00:10.690> the<00:00:10.809> instrument<00:00:11.259> and<00:00:11.349> this<00:00:11.530> is

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:11.679 
tradition of the instrument and this is

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.709 
tradition of the instrument and this is
just<00:00:11.860> a<00:00:11.950> piece<00:00:12.129> of<00:00:12.280> wood<00:00:12.429> it's<00:00:12.879> six<00:00:13.150> wires<00:00:13.389> it's

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
just a piece of wood it's six wires it's

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.049 
just a piece of wood it's six wires it's
a<00:00:13.780> few<00:00:13.959> electronics<00:00:14.650> you<00:00:15.039> know<00:00:15.160> and<00:00:15.400> I<00:00:15.610> was

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
a few electronics you know and I was

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.730 
a few electronics you know and I was
writing<00:00:16.330> down<00:00:16.360> notes<00:00:16.720> to<00:00:16.990> a<00:00:17.020> song<00:00:17.289> one<00:00:17.500> day<00:00:17.619> and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
writing down notes to a song one day and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.080 
writing down notes to a song one day and
I<00:00:17.800> had<00:00:17.890> penciled<00:00:18.190> my<00:00:18.280> hand<00:00:18.490> I<00:00:18.580> had<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:18.880> you

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
I had penciled my hand I had the you

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.080 
I had penciled my hand I had the you
know<00:00:19.180> the<00:00:19.500> delay<00:00:20.500> pedal<00:00:20.860> set<00:00:21.070> to<00:00:21.280> short<00:00:21.760> delay

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
know the delay pedal set to short delay

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:32.130 
know the delay pedal set to short delay
and<00:00:22.360> then<00:00:22.450> I<00:00:30.600> mean<00:00:31.600> that's<00:00:31.750> not<00:00:31.870> particularly

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
and then I mean that's not particularly

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.440 
and then I mean that's not particularly
rocket<00:00:32.590> science<00:00:32.980> it's<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.160> pencil<00:00:33.520> delay<00:00:34.090> pedal

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
rocket science it's a pencil delay pedal

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.420 
rocket science it's a pencil delay pedal
but

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.210 

this<00:00:40.820> was<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:41.150> 2003<00:00:42.020> helicopter<00:00:42.830> version

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
this was the 2003 helicopter version

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.310 
this was the 2003 helicopter version
which<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.550> again<00:00:44.330> a<00:00:44.360> delay<00:00:44.810> pedal<00:00:44.930> sets<00:00:45.260> a

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
which is again a delay pedal sets a

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.940 
which is again a delay pedal sets a
short<00:00:45.590> delay<00:00:46.090> sort<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:47.180> slap<00:00:47.450> back<00:00:47.690> delay

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
short delay sort of a slap back delay

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.140 
short delay sort of a slap back delay
the<00:00:48.950> whammy<00:00:49.130> pedal<00:00:49.280> set<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:50.000> an<00:00:50.270> octave<00:00:50.900> below

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
the whammy pedal set to an octave below

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.060 
the whammy pedal set to an octave below
and<00:00:53.320> then<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:54.680> just<00:00:55.040> use<00:00:55.840> picking<00:00:56.840> miles<00:00:57.110> and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
and then I just use picking miles and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.490 
and then I just use picking miles and
right<00:00:58.280> hand<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.670> just<00:00:58.790> sort<00:00:59.000> of<00:00:59.030> baby<00:00:59.900> slap<00:01:00.320> the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
right hand to just sort of baby slap the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:02:01.850 
right hand to just sort of baby slap the
strings<00:01:00.890> while<00:01:01.160> manipulating<00:01:01.760> them

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.310 

and<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.220> just<00:02:03.490> made<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.880> sound<00:02:04.320> more

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
and that just made to sound more

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.310 
and that just made to sound more
voluptuous<00:02:05.710> by<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.430> short<00:02:07.300> delay<00:02:07.570> the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
voluptuous by the short delay the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.240 
voluptuous by the short delay the
slapback<00:02:08.740> delay

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
slapback delay

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.280 
slapback delay
