companies in smartphones and that's
definitely<00:02:26.930> worth<00:02:27.110> noting<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.819> growth<00:02:29.209> that

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
definitely worth noting the growth that

potential to actually create a buying

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.879 
potential to actually create a buying
opportunity<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.810> would<00:03:06.079> remain<00:03:06.319> vigilant

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
opportunity so I would remain vigilant

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.160 
opportunity so I would remain vigilant
watch<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.430> shares<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.030> look<00:03:08.660> for<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> spot

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
watch the shares and look for a spot

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.770 
watch the shares and look for a spot
because<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:10.280> Apple<00:03:10.670> continues<00:03:11.389> to<00:03:11.540> fall

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
because if Apple continues to fall

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.870 
because if Apple continues to fall
there's<00:03:12.349> definitely<00:03:13.099> a<00:03:13.190> strong<00:03:13.609> argument

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
there's definitely a strong argument

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.289 
there's definitely a strong argument
that<00:03:14.709> shares<00:03:15.709> are<00:03:16.010> an<00:03:16.489> increasingly<00:03:17.030> good

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
that shares are an increasingly good

that shares are an increasingly good

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
value as the PT dropped below 12 and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.789
