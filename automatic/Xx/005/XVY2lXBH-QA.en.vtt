again<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.330> told<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.900> use<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.290> as<00:02:22.500> our<00:02:22.709> clip

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.850 

here<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.240> use<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.750> hanging<00:02:27.110> wire<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.530> hang<00:02:27.710> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
here I use the hanging wire to hang the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.970 
here I use the hanging wire to hang the
artwork<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:29.360> works<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:30.260> good<00:02:30.350> as<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
artwork and it works just as good as the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.100 
artwork and it works just as good as the
craft<00:02:31.220> lace<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.819> it's<00:02:32.209> an<00:02:32.330> invisible<00:02:32.480> wire<00:02:32.900> so

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
craft lace and it's an invisible wire so

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.420 
craft lace and it's an invisible wire so
that<00:02:33.140> gives<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.650> different<00:02:34.010> look<00:02:34.040> if<00:02:34.310> you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that gives it a different look if you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.370 
that gives it a different look if you
like<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.450> did<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.780> same<00:02:35.990> thing<00:02:36.260> as

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
like that and I did the same thing as

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.530 
like that and I did the same thing as
far<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.680> hanging<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.160> on<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.730> hooks<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.150> just

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
far as hanging it on the hooks I just

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.900 
far as hanging it on the hooks I just
made<00:02:38.870> knots<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.440> both<00:02:39.680> sides<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.610> can<00:02:40.760> make

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
made knots at both sides you can make

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.850 
made knots at both sides you can make
them<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:41.150> tight<00:02:41.390> as<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.570> need<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.620> wire

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.580 
them as tight as you need and this wire
again<00:02:43.400> remember<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.030> hangs<00:02:44.240> up<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.600> 50<00:02:45.230> pounds

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
again remember it hangs up to 50 pounds

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.230
