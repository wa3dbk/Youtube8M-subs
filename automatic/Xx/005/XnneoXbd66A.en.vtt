number<00:01:33.070> two

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.240 

so<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.420> process<00:01:39.929> at<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.170> point<00:01:40.469> in<00:01:40.560> time<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so the process at this point in time is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.510 
so the process at this point in time is
I'm<00:01:41.820> trying<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.539> bring<00:01:43.109> to<00:01:43.350> boil<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.369> liquid

I'm trying to bring to boil the liquid

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.870 
I'm trying to bring to boil the liquid
and<00:01:45.179> when<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.020> boiling<00:01:46.619> point<00:01:46.920> there<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and when I get to boiling point there is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.740 
and when I get to boiling point there is
this<00:01:48.090> lovely<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.920> safety<00:01:49.920> valve<00:01:50.719> which<00:01:51.719> is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this lovely little safety valve which is

also a ball bearing this ball bearing

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.469 
also a ball bearing this ball bearing
will<00:01:56.130> suck<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.020> stop<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.469> steam<00:01:58.799> issuing

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
will suck up and stop the steam issuing

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.380 
will suck up and stop the steam issuing
now<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.899> had<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.289> lever<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.209> that<00:02:03.209> is

now if I had the lever on one that is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.139 
now if I had the lever on one that is
what<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.869> will<00:02:04.530> look<00:02:04.679> like<00:02:04.859> on<00:02:05.069> my<00:02:05.250> valve<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.969> I

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
what one will look like on my valve if I

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.749 
what one will look like on my valve if I
have<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.659> which<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:07.799> wanting<00:02:08.610> my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
valve to go into that position there so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.150 
valve to go into that position there so
at<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> moment<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:13.079> bringing<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.590> boil<00:02:13.829> I

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
at the moment I'm bringing to boil I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.470 
at the moment I'm bringing to boil I
have<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> solid<00:02:15.750> stream<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:17.069> want<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.819> good

because I've asked for - my lever is on

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.039 
because I've asked for - my lever is on
-<00:02:33.120> she<00:02:33.870> will<00:02:34.019> get<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.310> high<00:02:35.310> pressure<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.049> I

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
- she will get to high pressure and I

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.979 
- she will get to high pressure and I
will<00:02:37.290> cook<00:02:37.500> my<00:02:38.190> sweet<00:02:38.790> corn<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.690> three

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
will cook my sweet corn for three

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.699 
will cook my sweet corn for three
minutes<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:41.430> my<00:02:42.030> aim<00:02:42.299> now<00:02:42.600> is<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:43.139> wait<00:02:43.290> for<00:02:43.590> my

saying to me turned down the energy

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.379 
saying to me turned down the energy
source<00:03:03.120> I'll<00:03:03.359> turn<00:03:03.989> her<00:03:04.230> down<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:05.389> I'm

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
now you can see that the valve because

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.970 
now you can see that the valve because
I've<00:03:23.400> turned<00:03:23.730> her<00:03:23.910> down<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.780> valve<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.410> slowly

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
I've turned her down the valve is slowly

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.260 
I've turned her down the valve is slowly
going<00:03:26.670> down<00:03:27.110> my<00:03:28.110> aim<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:28.980> stabilize<00:03:29.580> that

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
going down my aim is to stabilize that

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.190 
going down my aim is to stabilize that
valve<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:31.080> keep<00:03:31.349> her<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.370> position<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:33.200> don't

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
valve to keep her in a position I don't

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.920 
valve to keep her in a position I don't
particularly<00:03:34.650> want<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:35.099> not<00:03:35.760> see<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.540> second

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
particularly want to not see the second

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.350 
particularly want to not see the second
white<00:03:37.140> line<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.920> am<00:03:37.950> slowly<00:03:38.519> losing<00:03:39.120> it

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
white line and I am slowly losing it

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.780 
white line and I am slowly losing it
so<00:03:39.780> I'll<00:03:39.959> tweak<00:03:40.290> her<00:03:40.500> up

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
