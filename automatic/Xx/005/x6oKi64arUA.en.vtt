00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 all right 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.129
 in monumental passion we want the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.660
 fans know a little more thoroughly 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.460
 his players and that's why we were 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.869
 talking to jonatan maidana a little 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.369
 about his life and his beginnings in the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.910
 football and we leave everything you said 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.910
 so you see it 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.530
 well I did not even know how you started 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.720
 boy to play football there was someone who 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.660
 he gave you your first ball and told you 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.140
 taken tested 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.730
 it is maybe put by please subject 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 When he turned one year old I remember that 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.960
 they have given a silver beyond that one 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.120
 boy but 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.739
 already of the 56 years that one begins to 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.960
 play football and I also liked 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.910
 it was something that was emerging 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.830
 naturally I was given the possibility is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.260
 can play on it 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.840
 in the Andes and the first game arrives 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.760
 and for it to start a race that 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 maybe the cop surprises me but not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.790
 I always believe that football was in my 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.410
 lifetime 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 this boy when you play the ball 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.420
 maybe in your backyard within 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.500
 your house also broke many things you 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.460
 they steal because they broke things 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.990
 normal and that throws the ball to the yard 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.400
 of zinc and so on and you can reach 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.680
 download some plant from the mom some 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.260
 time it breaks but good beyond that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.780
 They are big boy and cute pranks 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.300
 I remember an idol of soccer that you have 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.170
 that maybe it's not the same as the one 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.020
 you were a boy 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.509
 there is no verona 21 always liked 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.810
 what great young people I 've always heard 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 you put it on my old man who killed himself 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.840
 working and that gave me the possibility of 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.700
 accompany me in what I like so 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.830
 well you can always see the big ones 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.310
 players that look out local football 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.430
 you can always reach him 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.620
 accelerate and today your family when 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.030
 come to see you here in the gallery after 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.030
 of a party that usually tells you 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.210
 in the reviews are generally not 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.860
 good tells me more than anything else the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.930
 mistakes that what one does well well 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.330
 has nothing but we pace a bit and already 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.490
 I already know well what they let you know when 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.040
 when you are wrong or are they before 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.300
 that lie or praise you prefer 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.810
 certain bad things so you can 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.810
 better let's say 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.350
 in the family
