00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
somewhat spider-man limited and

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.569

personally I didn't like it I thought it

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.270 
personally I didn't like it I thought it
was<00:03:40.640> complete<00:03:40.940> crap<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.359> be<00:03:41.480> honest<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.049> only

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
was complete crap to be honest the only

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.770 
was complete crap to be honest the only
thing<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.370> liked<00:03:43.609> about<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.910> was<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.120> they<00:03:44.599> did

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
thing I liked about it was that they did

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.979 
thing I liked about it was that they did
a<00:03:44.870> fusion<00:03:45.349> between<00:03:45.440> carnage<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.400> venom

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
a fusion between carnage and venom

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.960 
a fusion between carnage and venom
Barnidge<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.139> think<00:03:48.410> or<00:03:48.919> something<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.910> that

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
Barnidge I think or something like that

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.050 
Barnidge I think or something like that
and<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:51.650> turns<00:03:51.829> out<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.040> was<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.579> only<00:03:52.730> one<00:03:52.910> who

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
and it turns out I was the only one who

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.879 
and it turns out I was the only one who

about<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:29.800> after<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:30.830> they<00:04:31.099> had

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
about it and after that they had

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.159 
about it and after that they had
spectacular<00:04:31.460> spiderman<00:04:32.270> which<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:33.020> my

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
spectacular spiderman which in my

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.870 
spectacular spiderman which in my
opinion<00:04:33.289> i<00:04:33.740> actually<00:04:34.099> liked<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.490> when<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.639> came

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
opinion i actually liked it when it came

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.550 
opinion i actually liked it when it came
on<00:04:34.910> i<00:04:35.389> mean<00:04:36.349> i<00:04:36.849> think<00:04:37.849> that<00:04:38.260> since<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
on i mean i think that since the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.800 
on i mean i think that since the
animated<00:04:40.070> series<00:04:40.099> is<00:04:40.580> probably<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.630> most

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
animated series is probably the most

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.750 
animated series is probably the most
accurate<00:04:42.199> of<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.590> comics<00:04:43.070> and<00:04:43.310> not<00:04:43.520> only<00:04:43.639> that

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
accurate of the comics and not only that

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.670 
accurate of the comics and not only that
but<00:04:43.970> also<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.449> best<00:04:44.720> representation<00:04:45.200> of

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
but also the best representation of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.310 
but also the best representation of
spider-man<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.580> many<00:04:47.450> also<00:04:47.659> claim<00:04:48.110> that's

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
spider-man and many also claim that's

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.040 
spider-man and many also claim that's
actually<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.890> best<00:04:49.070> representation

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
actually the best representation

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.320 
actually the best representation
spider-man<00:04:50.560> outside<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.729> comics<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:54.330> you

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
spider-man outside the comics so you

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.290 
spider-man outside the comics so you
know<00:04:55.449> it's<00:04:55.539> something<00:04:55.720> that's<00:04:56.020> very

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
know it's something that's very

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.659 
know it's something that's very
significant<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:59.009> definitely<00:05:00.009> mile<00:05:00.280> still<00:05:00.550> in

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
significant and definitely mile still in

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:07.439 
significant and definitely mile still in
spider-man<00:05:01.259> TV<00:05:02.259> history<00:05:05.789> now<00:05:06.789> like<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.330> only

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
spider-man TV history now like the only

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.450 
spider-man TV history now like the only
thing<00:05:07.569> I<00:05:07.750> didn't<00:05:08.169> like<00:05:08.199> about<00:05:08.460> spectacular

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.330 
thing I didn't like about spectacular
spiderman<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:10.240> would<00:05:10.509> say<00:05:10.720> was<00:05:10.979> probably<00:05:11.979> the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
spiderman I would say was probably the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.369 
spiderman I would say was probably the
the<00:05:15.340> animation<00:05:16.030> other<00:05:16.300> than<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.539> the<00:05:16.900> suit

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
the animation other than that the suit

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.040 
the animation other than that the suit
series<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.889> good<00:05:18.190> too<00:05:19.180> bad<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.389> guy<00:05:19.569> canceled

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.790 
to ultimate spider-man good gosh this is
probably<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.569> worst<00:05:28.719> spider-man<00:05:29.349> series

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
probably the worst spider-man series

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.119 
probably the worst spider-man series
i've<00:05:30.039> ever<00:05:30.159> seen<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:31.080> it's<00:05:32.080> not<00:05:32.319> that<00:05:32.560> like<00:05:32.830> it

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
looks bad in terms of like animations

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.369 
looks bad in terms of like animations
the<00:05:35.919> animation<00:05:36.280> is<00:05:36.340> actually<00:05:36.550> pretty<00:05:36.699> good

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
the animation is actually pretty good

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.129 
the animation is actually pretty good
the<00:05:38.379> only<00:05:38.530> problem<00:05:38.830> well<00:05:39.280> not<00:05:40.090> only<00:05:40.270> but<00:05:40.870> main

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
the only problem well not only but main

the only problem well not only but main
problem<00:05:41.500> I<00:05:41.560> have<00:05:41.710> with<00:05:41.740> this<00:05:41.949> series<00:05:42.699> was<00:05:43.000> just

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
problem I have with this series was just

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.659 
problem I have with this series was just
the<00:05:45.219> premise<00:05:45.639> of<00:05:45.789> it<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.719> lack<00:05:47.199> of

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
the premise of it the lack of

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.640 
the premise of it the lack of
faithfulness<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:48.879> the<00:05:48.940> comics<00:05:49.509> as<00:05:50.199> a<00:05:50.379> thing

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
faithfulness to the comics as a thing

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.930 
faithfulness to the comics as a thing
only<00:05:50.830> read<00:05:51.099> the<00:05:51.190> comments<00:05:51.490> that<00:05:51.550> much<00:05:51.759> but

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
only read the comments that much but

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.309 
only read the comments that much but
even<00:05:52.000> I<00:05:52.300> could<00:05:52.449> point<00:05:52.569> out<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.840> flaws<00:05:52.990> it's

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
even I could point out the flaws it's

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:58.189 
even I could point out the flaws it's
like<00:05:53.500> for<00:05:53.680> instance<00:05:55.050> he<00:05:56.050> doesn't<00:05:56.349> work<00:05:56.469> for<00:05:56.650> JJ

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
like for instance he doesn't work for JJ

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.529 
like for instance he doesn't work for JJ
one<00:05:59.199> of<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.380> people<00:05:59.740> that<00:05:59.770> have<00:06:00.190> inspired<00:06:00.610> the

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
one of the people that have inspired the

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.640 
one of the people that have inspired the
state<00:06:02.050> Spiderman<00:06:02.620> was<00:06:02.650> Nick<00:06:03.430> Fury<00:06:03.759> and

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
state Spiderman was Nick Fury and

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.990 
state Spiderman was Nick Fury and
another<00:06:05.650> thing<00:06:05.800> I<00:06:05.860> didn't<00:06:06.069> like<00:06:06.099> the<00:06:06.550> show<00:06:06.789> was

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
another thing I didn't like the show was

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.399 
another thing I didn't like the show was
there<00:06:07.150> was<00:06:07.240> way<00:06:07.419> too<00:06:07.449> many<00:06:07.659> crossover<00:06:08.380> the

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
there was way too many crossover the

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.620 
there was way too many crossover the
season<00:06:09.039> one<00:06:09.219> it<00:06:09.430> was<00:06:09.490> so<00:06:09.699> ridiculous<00:06:09.849> data

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
season one it was so ridiculous data

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.920 
season one it was so ridiculous data
crossover<00:06:11.169> every<00:06:11.440> freaking<00:06:11.800> episode<00:06:12.219> I<00:06:14.490> mean

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
crossover every freaking episode I mean

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.909 
crossover every freaking episode I mean
that's<00:06:16.930> one<00:06:17.199> thing<00:06:17.349> I've<00:06:17.500> always<00:06:17.620> been

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
that's one thing I've always been

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.830 
that's one thing I've always been
wondering<00:06:18.460> I<00:06:18.639> mean<00:06:18.849> I<00:06:19.029> could<00:06:19.210> go<00:06:19.360> on<00:06:19.389> but<00:06:19.629> I

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
for other videos but I mean to me
