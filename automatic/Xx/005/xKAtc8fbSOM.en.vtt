very strong wiring that would have about
a<00:01:44.850> thousand<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.420> uses<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:46.049> any<00:01:46.200> prepper

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
a thousand and one uses in any prepper

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.980 
a thousand and one uses in any prepper
situation<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.820> galvanized<00:01:48.450> 50<00:01:49.229> foot<00:01:49.439> steel

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
situation it's galvanized 50 foot steel

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.660 
situation it's galvanized 50 foot steel
so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.079> figured<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.009> only<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> buck<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
so I figured there was only a buck so I

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.690 
so I figured there was only a buck so I
said<00:01:53.909> okay<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:56.369> lot<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
said okay I'm going for it a lot of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.190 
said okay I'm going for it a lot of
these<00:01:56.820> things<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.299> are<00:01:57.780> hard<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> get

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
these things you know are hard to get

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.420 
these things you know are hard to get
couponing<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.119> this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> pack<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:01.430> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
couponing so this is just a pack of you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.069 
couponing so this is just a pack of you
know<00:02:02.549> those<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:02.909> sponge<00:02:03.329> paint<00:02:03.780> brushes

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
know those little sponge paint brushes

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.399 
know those little sponge paint brushes
because<00:02:05.450> containers<00:02:06.450> probably<00:02:07.049> from<00:02:07.229> their

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
because containers probably from their

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.050 
because containers probably from their
70s<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:09.110> anyway<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.200> think<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.800> was<00:02:10.979> 50<00:02:11.730> cents

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
70s but anyway I think that was 50 cents

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.510 
70s but anyway I think that was 50 cents
can<00:02:13.630> always<00:02:13.810> use<00:02:13.959> those<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.920> course<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.340> always

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
can always use those of course I always

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.339 
can always use those of course I always

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
and I like to use the candle as a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.240 
and I like to use the candle as a
combination<00:02:21.910> deal<00:02:22.870> like<00:02:23.230> for<00:02:23.500> example<00:02:24.010> I

situation it's just a very very long

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.990 
situation it's just a very very long
roll<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:32.160> plastic<00:02:33.160> sheeting<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:35.910> she<00:02:36.910> had

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
five bucks on it and I know I didn't

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.720 
five bucks on it and I know I didn't
want<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> pay<00:02:38.680> five<00:02:38.920> bucks<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.459> thought<00:02:39.670> oh

is the greatest deal in the world but I

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.660 
is the greatest deal in the world but I

really wanted to get the plastic I don't
know<00:03:06.730> if<00:03:06.790> these<00:03:06.880> people<00:03:07.120> will<00:03:07.209> sort<00:03:07.390> people

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
know if these people will sort people

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.839 
know if these people will sort people
were<00:03:08.049> painters<00:03:08.470> before<00:03:08.830> or<00:03:09.010> what<00:03:09.190> but<00:03:09.400> they

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
were painters before or what but they

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.110 
were painters before or what but they
had<00:03:10.000> some<00:03:10.180> thicker<00:03:10.510> grade<00:03:11.730> plastic<00:03:12.730> sheeting

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
had some thicker grade plastic sheeting

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.380 
had some thicker grade plastic sheeting
as<00:03:13.239> well<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.690> big<00:03:13.870> roll<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:16.239> is

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
as well and a big roll and this is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.780 
as well and a big roll and this is
probably<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.900> don't<00:03:17.140> know<00:03:17.290> maybe<00:03:17.739> five<00:03:18.549> times

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
probably I don't know maybe five times

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.670 
probably I don't know maybe five times
as<00:03:19.000> thick<00:03:19.180> as<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.390> other<00:03:19.510> one<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.840> thought<00:03:20.380> that

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
as thick as the other one I thought that

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.740 
as thick as the other one I thought that
would<00:03:20.920> be<00:03:21.070> good<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.489> -<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.359> never<00:03:22.570> know

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
would be good to have - you never know

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.770 
would be good to have - you never know
what<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.140> might<00:03:23.290> need<00:03:23.350> plastic<00:03:24.010> sheeting<00:03:24.400> for

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
what you might need plastic sheeting for

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.880 
what you might need plastic sheeting for
so<00:03:26.579> there<00:03:27.579> we<00:03:27.730> go<00:03:27.880> got<00:03:28.359> some<00:03:28.569> math<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.170> think<00:03:29.590> was

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
so there we go got some math I think was

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.390 
so there we go got some math I think was
my<00:03:30.010> best<00:03:30.190> pepper<00:03:30.519> find<00:03:30.819> for<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:33.160> morning

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
my best pepper find for the the morning

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.670 
my best pepper find for the the morning
of<00:03:33.989> scavenging<00:03:34.989> around<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.350> neighborhood

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
of scavenging around the neighborhood

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.699 
of scavenging around the neighborhood

but oh I was gonna give it a go it
looked<00:03:51.790> like<00:03:51.850> it<00:03:52.060> was<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.389> quiet<00:03:52.630> part<00:03:52.930> in

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
looked like it was in a quiet part in

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.629 
looked like it was in a quiet part in
the<00:03:53.109> garage<00:03:53.319> that<00:03:53.350> hadn't<00:03:53.739> been<00:03:53.769> hustled<00:03:54.459> with

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
the garage that hadn't been hustled with

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.000 
the garage that hadn't been hustled with
too<00:03:54.850> much<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:56.440> just<00:03:56.650> like<00:03:56.769> these<00:03:56.950> little

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
too much and I just like these little

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.069 
too much and I just like these little
candle<00:03:57.910> holders<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.450> think<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.720> might<00:03:58.870> put<00:03:58.989> them

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
candle holders I think I might put them

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.319 
candle holders I think I might put them
in<00:03:59.200> my<00:03:59.319> garden<00:03:59.500> somewhere<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.370> put<00:04:01.209> some

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
in my garden somewhere and put some

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.720 
in my garden somewhere and put some
candles<00:04:01.630> in<00:04:01.780> them<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:01.989> think<00:04:02.139> that'd<00:04:02.230> be<00:04:02.260> pretty

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
candles in them I think that'd be pretty

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.309 
candles in them I think that'd be pretty
but<00:04:03.730> they<00:04:03.940> were<00:04:04.000> only<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.239> buck<00:04:04.420> each<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.260> I

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
but they were only a buck each so I

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.319 
but they were only a buck each so I
thought<00:04:05.470> that<00:04:05.530> was<00:04:05.829> fair<00:04:06.040> but<00:04:06.459> anyway<00:04:06.760> most<00:04:07.120> of

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
thought that was fair but anyway most of

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.050 
thought that was fair but anyway most of
stuff<00:04:07.540> was<00:04:07.720> long<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:07.959> prepper<00:04:08.530> lines<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.130> I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.309
