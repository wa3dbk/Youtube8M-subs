throws<00:03:16.330> here<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.810> there<00:03:16.990> but<00:03:17.170> for<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.380> most

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
throws here and there but for the most

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.400 
throws here and there but for the most
part<00:03:17.830> just<00:03:17.970> he<00:03:18.970> had<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.390> lot<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.660> balls<00:03:19.960> bedded

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
part just he had a lot of balls bedded

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.810 
part just he had a lot of balls bedded
down<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:20.800> line<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.040> scrimmage<00:03:21.130> early<00:03:21.670> on

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
down to the line of scrimmage early on

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.440 
down to the line of scrimmage early on
that<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.810> mean<00:03:22.990> his<00:03:23.200> height<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.620> factor<00:03:24.130> yes

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
that I mean his height is a factor yes

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.060 
that I mean his height is a factor yes
it's<00:03:25.450> one<00:03:25.780> thing<00:03:26.020> that'd<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.440> short<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:26.980> have

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
it's one thing that'd be short and have

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.630 
it's one thing that'd be short and have
a<00:03:27.100> high<00:03:27.340> release<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.320> he<00:03:29.320> had<00:03:29.560> he's<00:03:29.950> pretty

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
a high release and he had he's pretty

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.240 
a high release and he had he's pretty
short<00:03:31.030> that's<00:03:31.720> pretty<00:03:32.290> much<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.530> side<00:03:32.890> armer

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
short that's pretty much a side armer

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.860 
short that's pretty much a side armer
I'm<00:03:33.460> not<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> complete<00:03:34.060> side<00:03:34.330> on<00:03:34.450> release<00:03:34.690> but

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
I'm not a complete side on release but

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.450 
I'm not a complete side on release but
more<00:03:35.290> my<00:03:35.380> guys<00:03:35.500> are<00:03:35.590> three<00:03:35.770> quarters<00:03:36.130> at<00:03:36.250> least

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
more my guys are three quarters at least

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.570 
more my guys are three quarters at least
so<00:03:37.050> that's<00:03:38.050> gonna<00:03:38.260> be<00:03:38.350> an<00:03:38.560> issue<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.890> think<00:03:39.010> and

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
so that's gonna be an issue I think and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.310 
so that's gonna be an issue I think and
you<00:03:39.730> have<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.030> fix<00:03:40.270> that<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.690> also<00:03:40.810> Stephen

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
you have to fix that and also Stephen

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.590 
you have to fix that and also Stephen
Morris<00:03:41.710> didn't<00:03:42.700> look<00:03:42.760> too<00:03:42.940> impressive<00:03:43.300> either

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
Morris didn't look too impressive either

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.420 
Morris didn't look too impressive either
I<00:03:43.690> think<00:03:43.750> he<00:03:44.020> ended<00:03:44.230> up<00:03:44.410> with<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.710> most<00:03:44.920> yards

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
I think he ended up with the most yards

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.880 
I think he ended up with the most yards
on<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.760> North<00:03:45.940> was<00:03:46.630> he<00:03:46.750> what<00:03:47.020> he<00:03:47.230> was<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.500> was

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
on the North was he what he was in was

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.100 
on the North was he what he was in was
in<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.100> north<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.850> why<00:03:49.150> was<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.690> God<00:03:49.930> for

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
in the north you why was that to God for

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.110 
in the north you why was that to God for
my<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.530> guess<00:03:50.770> hit<00:03:51.190> my<00:03:51.340> hand<00:03:51.550> while<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:51.760> was<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.970> guy

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
other receivers that look pretty solid

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.500 
other receivers that look pretty solid
was<00:04:23.830> uh<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.310> Crockett<00:04:24.700> Gilmore<00:04:25.060> tight<00:04:25.270> in<00:04:25.419> out

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
just a late add in after somebody opted

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.869 
just a late add in after somebody opted
out<00:04:29.139> he<00:04:29.379> came<00:04:29.650> in<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.370> first<00:04:30.460> touchdown

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
out he came in but the first touchdown

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.899

of<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.210> game<00:04:31.270> ended<00:04:31.840> up<00:04:31.900> 61<00:04:32.409> yards<00:04:33.340> I'm<00:04:33.699> Bob

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
of the game ended up 61 yards I'm Bob

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.610 
of the game ended up 61 yards I'm Bob
receptions<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:34.629> without<00:04:34.930> wind<00:04:35.199> touchdown

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
receptions and without wind touchdown

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.649 
receptions and without wind touchdown
that<00:04:36.279> was<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.490> belief<00:04:36.759> that<00:04:36.789> was<00:04:37.210> from<00:04:37.389> Derek

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
that was a belief that was from Derek

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.179 
that was a belief that was from Derek
Carr<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:37.990> was<00:04:38.080> their<00:04:38.229> cars<00:04:38.529> one<00:04:38.740> touchdown

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:39.189 
Carr that was their cars one touchdown

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.719 
Carr that was their cars one touchdown
so<00:04:39.520> looks<00:04:40.120> pretty<00:04:40.569> solid<00:04:40.749> they're<00:04:41.550> not<00:04:42.550> too

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
so looks pretty solid they're not too

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:43.980 
so looks pretty solid they're not too
many<00:04:42.849> receiving<00:04:43.300> staying<00:04:43.569> out<00:04:43.719> from<00:04:43.900> the
