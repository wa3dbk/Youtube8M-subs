here and then what I'll do is I just
push<00:01:24.530> up<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:24.980> little<00:01:25.010> bit<00:01:25.490> like<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:25.910> and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
push up just a little bit like this and

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.340 
push up just a little bit like this and
then<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.980> work<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.310> door<00:01:28.900> shake<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.200> out

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
then I work the door shake the out

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.760 
then I work the door shake the out
of<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.590> for<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.800> little<00:01:30.920> bit<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:33.290> has<00:01:33.560> been

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
of it for a little bit and that has been

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.380 
of it for a little bit and that has been
slowly<00:01:34.190> but<00:01:34.520> surely<00:01:34.550> bringing<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.390> up<00:01:35.540> and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
slowly but surely bringing it up and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.850 
slowly but surely bringing it up and
it's<00:01:38.390> going<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.720> come<00:01:39.050> out<00:01:39.230> here<00:01:39.470> very<00:01:39.710> very
