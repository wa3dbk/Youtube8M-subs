Dutch<00:00:52.839> right<00:00:53.409> here<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:54.460> add<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.730> only

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
Dutch right here and add the only

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.579 
Dutch right here and add the only

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
problem is that touches the ball joint

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.989 
problem is that touches the ball joint
on<00:00:59.829> this<00:01:00.069> head<00:01:00.879> it's<00:01:01.659> a<00:01:01.839> little<00:01:02.050> bit<00:01:02.170> smaller

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
on this head it's a little bit smaller

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.990 
on this head it's a little bit smaller
than<00:01:03.999> this<00:01:04.239> guy<00:01:04.770> all<00:01:05.770> right<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.340> here's<00:01:06.760> the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000

bottom of the Dutch helmet you know so

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.590 
bottom of the Dutch helmet you know so
what<00:01:11.260> I<00:01:11.290> what<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.740> did<00:01:12.010> was<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.730> took<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.180> dremel

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
what I what I did was I took a dremel

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.800 
what I what I did was I took a dremel
and<00:01:14.400> basically<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.640> socket<00:01:16.090> here<00:01:16.300> wasn't

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
and basically the socket here wasn't

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.080 
and basically the socket here wasn't
wide<00:01:16.990> enough<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:17.890> just<00:01:18.250> took<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.550> dremel<00:01:18.970> and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
wide enough so I just took a dremel and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
wide enough so I just took a dremel and
then<00:01:19.240> drilled<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.690> little<00:01:19.930> bit<00:01:20.080> too<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.520> wind

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
then drilled a little bit too to wind

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070 
then drilled a little bit too to wind
the<00:01:23.110> socket<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.620> little<00:01:23.830> bit<00:01:23.980> so<00:01:24.940> now<00:01:25.180> you'll<00:01:25.960> be

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
the socket a little bit so now you'll be

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.480 
the socket a little bit so now you'll be
able<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.320> fit<00:01:26.560> onto<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:28.510> ODST<00:01:29.050> figure<00:01:29.680> but<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
able to fit onto the ODST figure but the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.890 
able to fit onto the ODST figure but the
jetpack<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.640> see<00:01:33.970> without<00:01:34.420> the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
jetpack and here you see without the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.010 
jetpack and here you see without the
neck<00:01:35.080> brace<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:36.610> here<00:01:36.910> it<00:01:37.780> looks<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.990> bit

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
neck brace right here it looks a bit

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.710 
neck brace right here it looks a bit
weird<00:01:38.650> it's<00:01:39.580> neck<00:01:39.880> that's<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.210> little<00:01:40.360> bit<00:01:40.510> too

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.030 
weird it's neck that's a little bit too
long<00:01:40.930> but<00:01:41.740> that's<00:01:42.190> just<00:01:42.370> so<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:44.470> order<00:01:44.680> to<00:01:44.800> fix

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
long but that's just so in order to fix

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.700 
long but that's just so in order to fix
that<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.430> could<00:01:45.670> just<00:01:45.880> drill<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.710> socket

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
that you could just drill that socket

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.320 
that you could just drill that socket
joint<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:48.070> little<00:01:48.100> bit<00:01:48.490> further<00:01:48.760> down<00:01:49.030> and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
joint a little bit further down and

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.540 
joint a little bit further down and
you'll<00:01:49.660> be<00:01:49.840> able<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.110> fix<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.620> problem<00:01:50.890> but

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
you'll be able to fix that problem but

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.340 
you'll be able to fix that problem but

that<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.750> showed<00:02:33.260> up<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:34.390> there's<00:02:35.390> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
that just showed up at on there's the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.160 
that just showed up at on there's the
peg<00:02:35.780> hole<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.640> now<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:37.910> glued<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:38.959> to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
peg hole and now I just glued it on to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.270 
peg hole and now I just glued it on to
this<00:02:39.260> ODST<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.570> it's<00:02:41.570> not<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> perfect<00:02:42.800> fit

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
this ODST and it's not a perfect fit

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.180 
this ODST and it's not a perfect fit
cuz<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:44.240> hole<00:02:44.420> on<00:02:44.990> his<00:02:45.020> arm<00:02:45.440> it's<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:45.980> little

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
cuz the hole on his arm it's a little

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.270 
cuz the hole on his arm it's a little
bit<00:02:46.280> bigger<00:02:46.489> tiny<00:02:47.450> bit<00:02:47.630> bigger<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:49.040> peg

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
bit bigger tiny bit bigger and the peg

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.360 
bit bigger tiny bit bigger and the peg
is<00:02:49.489> not<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.000> long<00:02:50.300> not<00:02:51.110> long<00:02:51.170> enough<00:02:51.530> for<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
is not that long not long enough for it

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.610 
is not that long not long enough for it
to<00:02:52.430> go<00:02:52.580> in<00:02:52.700> all<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.880> way<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.350> bit

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
to go in all the way so it is a bit

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.530 
to go in all the way so it is a bit
loose<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:55.130> basically<00:02:55.850> all<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.060> have<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.330> do<00:02:56.450> is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
loose so basically all you have to do is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.740 
loose so basically all you have to do is
just<00:02:56.690> glue<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:58.700> you'll<00:02:59.239> have<00:02:59.570> his

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
just glue it on and they you'll have his

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.729 
just glue it on and they you'll have his
shoulder<00:03:00.290> pads<00:03:01.300> one<00:03:02.300> over<00:03:02.720> here<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.410> one<00:03:03.470> over

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
shoulder pads one over here and one over

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.970 
shoulder pads one over here and one over
here<00:03:04.270> thought<00:03:05.270> about<00:03:05.450> removing<00:03:05.660> his<00:03:06.170> chest

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
here thought about removing his chest

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.530 
here thought about removing his chest
piece<00:03:08.500> too<00:03:09.530> cuz<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:10.820> then<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.330> thing<00:03:11.390> is

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
piece too cuz but then this thing is

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.789 
piece too cuz but then this thing is
glued<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.020> up<00:03:12.260> pretty<00:03:12.590> well<00:03:12.770> so<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:17.690> could<00:03:18.350> take

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
glued on up pretty well so I could take

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.490 
glued on up pretty well so I could take
that<00:03:19.040> go<00:03:19.310> piece<00:03:19.840> cut<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:20.989> whole<00:03:21.170> thing<00:03:21.320> off

here's<00:04:36.569> a<00:04:36.690> size<00:04:36.900> comparison<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.220> can<00:04:38.340> see

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
here's a size comparison so you can see

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.540 
here's a size comparison so you can see
the<00:04:40.440> old<00:04:40.620> hoot<00:04:41.190> est<00:04:41.990> figure<00:04:43.129> it's<00:04:44.129> definitely

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
the old hoot est figure it's definitely

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.800 
the old hoot est figure it's definitely
shorter<00:04:44.819> than<00:04:45.120> than<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:45.960> custom<00:04:46.650> one<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.069> uh

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
shorter than than this custom one and uh

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.170 
shorter than than this custom one and uh
Forge<00:04:48.810> is<00:04:49.080> also<00:04:50.000> shorter<00:04:51.919> him<00:04:52.919> as<00:04:53.099> well<00:04:53.430> but<00:04:53.460> he

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
Forge is also shorter him as well but he

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.550 
Forge is also shorter him as well but he
is<00:04:54.210> definitely<00:04:54.479> shorter<00:04:55.460> than<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.669> Spartan

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
is definitely shorter than a Spartan
