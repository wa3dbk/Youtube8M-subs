00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello girls summer flew by quickly and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.859
 couple sleep in school sometimes want 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.179
 I want to diversify my manicure today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.789
 show you 2 manicure options 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 school subjects and mines we will begin with the first 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 Manicure options for us to start 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.220
 need alcohol you can buy it in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.720
 the pharmacy also has a white lacquer and newspaper 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.849
 you can experiment and use 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040
 magazines cut pieces with text or 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.370
 pattern or print out the form 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.050
 numbers yourself from the internet and i 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 tried all options all options 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 I have already applied the base layer 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.590
 boiled white nail polish 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 Now I will bring the alcohol to suit any 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.899
 capacity and most importantly that it fit 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.539
 newspaper clippings and now i'm omitting 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.250
 a piece of newspaper and wait 10 seconds pieces 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.039
 newspapers should be made larger 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.020
 than the nail itself so it will be more convenient through 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.300
 10 seconds I pull out my piece 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 newspapers with tweezers and then I 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.090
 I bring this piece to my fingernail and 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.619
 I press the newspaper carefully and need to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.080
 try to keep a piece of newspaper not 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.250
 moved when you press it otherwise 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
 drawing will deteriorate 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.360
 remove what is imprinted on the skin 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.970
 around the nail and put the top layer and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.119
 then turn to the other marigolds on 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.170
 thumb or little finger and doing 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.170
 same with them 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.600
 and now comes the turn of the water 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.700
 stickers for nails as these cats 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.619
 stickers called stickers sliders 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.899
 they are very thin 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.270
 film with a picture and and very, very difficult 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.069
 notice i cut off two stickers now 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.020
 let them down for 5 10 seconds 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.719
 I take out the stickers separating the water 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.149
 stickers from the backing and transfer them to 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.149
 nails on the middle finger we are in green 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.049
 I wipe with a napkin and put the top 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.049
 layer 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.110
 and on this the first version of manicure is ready 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.360
 if your school is allowed 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.130
 experiment with nail makeup and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.290
 so then I think you can try 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.090
 This option looks like it very, very 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.370
 interest now we come to the second 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.830
 option and using a removal fluid 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.260
 lacquer i will remove my design tapes 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.760
 nails and put the base coat back on 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.440
 army white nail polish 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.570
 and then applied varnish from meybellin 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.130
 Kalashov in the shade of the club to reduce to 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.740
 nails on the index and little finger and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.480
 thumb seems to me that this way 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.910
 pretty good with water 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:08.100
 stickers like cats and redistribution of this 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:10.820
 option is very original and on this 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.930
 stage, our second version of manicure is ready 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.490
 be sure to write which option out 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.830

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.020

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.870
