00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
with this camera so what we're going to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.459 
with this camera so what we're going to
do<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.420> we're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.719> turn<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:09.990> our<00:00:10.139> camera

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
do is we're going to turn on our camera

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.919 
do is we're going to turn on our camera
we're<00:00:10.950> going<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.160> switch<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.610> over<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.969> M<00:00:12.360> which

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
we're going to switch it over to M which

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.070 
we're going to switch it over to M which
stands<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.290> manual<00:00:13.820> now<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:14.969> manual<00:00:15.420> exposure

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
stands for manual now in manual exposure

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.179 
stands for manual now in manual exposure
mode<00:00:16.289> that's<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.340> you're<00:00:17.960> controlling

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
mode that's where you're controlling

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.200 
mode that's where you're controlling
basically<00:00:20.189> three<00:00:20.400> main<00:00:20.550> settings<00:00:20.910> shutter

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
basically three main settings shutter

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.439 
basically three main settings shutter
speed<00:00:21.480> aperture<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.080> ISO<00:00:22.279> to<00:00:23.279> manipulate<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
speed aperture and ISO to manipulate the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
speed aperture and ISO to manipulate the
amount<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> light<00:00:25.019> coming<00:00:25.710> into<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.359> camera

amount of light coming into the camera

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.109 
amount of light coming into the camera
and<00:00:27.960> trying<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.010> right<00:00:29.099> exposure<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and trying to get the right exposure and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999 
and trying to get the right exposure and
I'll<00:00:30.210> set<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> link<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.170> another<00:00:31.410> video<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.769> have

if<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> learn<00:00:32.640> more<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:32.940> exactly

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
if you want to learn more about exactly

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.620 
if you want to learn more about exactly
how<00:00:33.750> SLRs<00:00:34.350> work<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:36.030> now<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.510> see

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
how SLRs work so right now you can see

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.229 
how SLRs work so right now you can see
I'm<00:00:36.840> an<00:00:36.960> M<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> M<00:00:37.920> mode<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.969> shutter

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I'm an M and M mode it has the shutter

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.420 
I'm an M and M mode it has the shutter
speed<00:00:39.420> highlighted<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.290> shutter<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
speed highlighted the shutter is the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
speed highlighted the shutter is the
door<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.180> sits<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.540> front<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> sensor<00:00:43.079> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
door that sits in front of the sensor so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.760 
door that sits in front of the sensor so
if<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.010> lift<00:00:44.160> open<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:45.030> mirror<00:00:45.539> here<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.350> can

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
if I lift open my mirror here you can

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.650 
if I lift open my mirror here you can
almost<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.730> door<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.390> there<00:00:48.450> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
almost see the door right there that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
almost see the door right there that
sits<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.140> front<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> sensor<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
sits in front of the sensor that's the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
sits in front of the sensor that's the
shutter<00:00:50.610> door<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> decide<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.539> long

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
shutter door and you decide how long

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.020 
shutter door and you decide how long
that<00:00:52.050> stays<00:00:52.320> open<00:00:52.850> now<00:00:54.020> when<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
that stays open now when you do that I

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
that stays open now when you do that I
see<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.420> pop-up<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.800> order<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> do

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
see here get a pop-up in order to do

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
see here get a pop-up in order to do
that<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.370> turn<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.670> mode<00:01:00.210> dial<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that you turn your mode dial here and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.389 
that you turn your mode dial here and
you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.500> change<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.160> shutter

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you can see that change is my shutter

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
you can see that change is my shutter
speed<00:01:02.489> as<00:01:02.910> I'm<00:01:03.600> changing<00:01:03.780> my<00:01:04.080> shutter<00:01:04.350> speed

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
speed as I'm changing my shutter speed

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.590 
speed as I'm changing my shutter speed
you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.580> ISO<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> changing

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you can see that my ISO is changing

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.850 
you can see that my ISO is changing
that's<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.200> automatic<00:01:07.409> right

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that's because it's on automatic right

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.789 
that's because it's on automatic right
now<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.640> compensating<00:01:09.270> automatically<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:10.680> I

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
now it's compensating automatically if I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.830 
now it's compensating automatically if I
want<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> change<00:01:11.189> my<00:01:11.460> aperture<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.630> hold

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
want to change my aperture then I hold

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
want to change my aperture then I hold
down<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> AV<00:01:13.650> button<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
down the AV button and you can see it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.999 
down the AV button and you can see it
switches<00:01:15.810> over<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> aperture<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.830> use<00:01:16.979> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
switches over to aperture and I use that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
switches over to aperture and I use that
same<00:01:17.400> wheel<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.850> manipulate<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
same wheel to manipulate that the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.710 
same wheel to manipulate that the
aperture<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.890> iris<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.909> inside<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
aperture is the iris that's inside the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.760 
aperture is the iris that's inside the
lens

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
lens

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
lens
it's<00:01:23.100> always<00:01:23.520> open<00:01:23.820> until<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> take<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it's always open until you take the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.480 
it's always open until you take the
picture<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.500> use<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> debit<00:01:26.100> field

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
picture or if you use a debit field

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.399 
picture or if you use a debit field
preview<00:01:26.820> button<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.869> kind<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.049> difficult

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
preview button so it's kind of difficult

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.590 
preview button so it's kind of difficult
to<00:01:28.439> demonstrate<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.130> camera<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.850> ISO<00:01:30.390> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to demonstrate on this camera the ISO is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.999 
to demonstrate on this camera the ISO is
accessed<00:01:31.110> through<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.500> button<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:31.829> here

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
accessed through this button right here

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.060

put it on auto right now I'm going to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.060 
put it on auto right now I'm going to
put<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.960> 400<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> good<00:01:40.560> ISO<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
put it on 400 which is a good ISO to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.889 
put it on 400 which is a good ISO to
have<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:41.759> general<00:01:41.909> shooting<00:01:42.390> outside

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
have just for general shooting outside

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.800 
have just for general shooting outside
or<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.680> maybe<00:01:43.860> inside<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.549> decent<00:01:44.880> light<00:01:45.060> now

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
or or maybe inside with decent light now

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
or or maybe inside with decent light now
as<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.500> tap<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> shutter<00:01:47.220> button<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.850> going

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
as I tap the shutter button it's going

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.399 
as I tap the shutter button it's going
to<00:01:48.119> wake<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.540> my<00:01:48.659> light<00:01:48.899> meter<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
to wake up my light meter and this

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.170 
to wake up my light meter and this
little<00:01:49.740> peg<00:01:50.040> appears<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.729> disappears

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
little peg appears and it disappears

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.179 
little peg appears and it disappears
after<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.479> couple<00:01:51.720> seconds<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> tap<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
after a couple seconds but if I tap it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.069 
after a couple seconds but if I tap it
again<00:01:53.369> it'll<00:01:53.520> come<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.869> light

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
again it'll come up that is the light

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.200 
again it'll come up that is the light
meter<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.860> camera<00:01:56.430> telling<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:56.969> if

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
meter that is the camera telling me if

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.810 
meter that is the camera telling me if
the<00:01:57.930> exposure<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.680> correct<00:01:59.159> or<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the exposure is correct or not and I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.880 
the exposure is correct or not and I
need<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> manipulate<00:02:00.659> these<00:02:00.869> settings<00:02:01.380> in

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
need to manipulate these settings in

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
need to manipulate these settings in
order<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.790> little<00:02:03.000> peg<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.960> in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
order to get that little peg to be in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.620 
order to get that little peg to be in
the<00:02:04.259> middle<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.890> Xero<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.180> order<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> do

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the middle in Xero so in order to do

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.109 
the middle in Xero so in order to do
that<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.920> let's<00:02:08.280> say<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> change<00:02:09.000> my

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that I can let's say I want to change my

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.729 
that I can let's say I want to change my
aperture<00:02:09.509> first<00:02:09.869> I'm<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> open<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.590> this

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
aperture first I'm going to open up this

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.460 
aperture first I'm going to open up this
apertures<00:02:11.280> why<00:02:11.520> does<00:02:11.760> it'll<00:02:12.000> go<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.660> will

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
apertures why does it'll go so it will

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.590 
apertures why does it'll go so it will
let<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:14.280> light<00:02:14.460> as<00:02:14.700> possible<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.480> in

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
let in as much light as possible so in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.840 
let in as much light as possible so in
order<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.840> do<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.500> push<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.070> AV<00:02:17.520> button

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
order to do that I push the AV button

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.970 
order to do that I push the AV button
and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.810> move<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.200> dial<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.770> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and then I move the dial and this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.310 
and then I move the dial and this
particular<00:02:20.550> lens<00:02:20.760> will<00:02:20.970> only<00:02:21.120> open<00:02:21.510> up<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.750> 3.5

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
particular lens will only open up to 3.5

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.110 
particular lens will only open up to 3.5
the<00:02:22.620> lower<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.010> number<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.490> more<00:02:23.880> light

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the lower this number is the more light

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.720 
the lower this number is the more light
it<00:02:24.360> will<00:02:24.570> let<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.650> lens<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.130> 1855

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
it will let in but this lens is 1855

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.510 
it will let in but this lens is 1855
standard<00:02:27.300> will<00:02:27.420> only<00:02:27.540> open<00:02:27.840> up<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.050> 3.5<00:02:28.680> so

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
standard will only open up to 3.5 so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.890 
standard will only open up to 3.5 so
that<00:02:29.670> means<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.120> shutter<00:02:30.360> speed<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.660> can

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that means that my shutter speed you can

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.930 
that means that my shutter speed you can
see<00:02:31.080> my<00:02:31.260> exposure<00:02:31.560> still<00:02:31.950> way<00:02:32.130> overexposed

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
see my exposure still way overexposed

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.290 
see my exposure still way overexposed
I'm<00:02:33.470> more<00:02:34.470> than<00:02:34.590> four<00:02:35.250> times<00:02:35.460> actually<00:02:36.000> higher

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
I'm more than four times actually higher

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.540 
I'm more than four times actually higher
more<00:02:36.720> light<00:02:36.930> coming<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.680> need<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.520> that

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
more light coming in that I need so that

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.770 
more light coming in that I need so that
means<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.820> need<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.000> slower<00:02:39.240> shutter<00:02:39.330> speed

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
means I need a slower shutter speed

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.060 
means I need a slower shutter speed
that's<00:02:39.930> fractions<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.530> second<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:40.980> can

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
that's fractions of a second so you can

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.970 
that's fractions of a second so you can
see<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.550> manipulate<00:02:42.180> my<00:02:42.360> shutter<00:02:42.630> speed<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
see as I manipulate my shutter speed you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.070 
see as I manipulate my shutter speed you
can<00:02:44.130> see<00:02:44.400> my<00:02:44.580> light<00:02:44.790> year<00:02:45.000> goes<00:02:45.210> toward<00:02:45.600> zero

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
can see my light year goes toward zero

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.310 
can see my light year goes toward zero
so<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> might<00:02:46.440> 1<00:02:46.620> 807<00:02:47.580> now<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.300> at<00:02:48.450> 400<00:02:48.960> ISO

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
so I might 1 807 now that's at 400 ISO

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.130 
so I might 1 807 now that's at 400 ISO
the<00:02:49.350> ISO<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.730> light<00:02:50.970> sensitivity<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the ISO is the light sensitivity of the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.870 
the ISO is the light sensitivity of the
digital<00:02:52.470> sensor<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.520> higher<00:02:53.670> this

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
digital sensor and the higher this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.310 
digital sensor and the higher this
number<00:02:53.940> goes<00:02:54.330> it's<00:02:54.600> basically<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.930> pumping

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
number goes it's basically just pumping

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.840 
number goes it's basically just pumping
more<00:02:55.500> electricity<00:02:55.860> through<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.250> sensor<00:02:56.580> to

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
more electricity through the sensor to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.090 
more electricity through the sensor to
make<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.390> same<00:02:57.570> picture<00:02:57.930> with<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.590> less

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
make the same picture with the less

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.760 
make the same picture with the less
light<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.450> trade-off<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.410> tends<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
light the trade-off is that it tends to

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.490 
light the trade-off is that it tends to
be<00:03:01.890> grainy<00:03:02.160> err<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.520> not<00:03:02.640> very<00:03:02.880> high<00:03:03.030> quality

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
be grainy err and not very high quality

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.620 
be grainy err and not very high quality
now<00:03:04.500> once<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.460> that<00:03:05.640> done<00:03:05.970> I'm<00:03:06.510> gonna

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
now once you have that done I'm gonna

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.180 
now once you have that done I'm gonna
turn<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> live<00:03:07.080> view<00:03:07.290> here<00:03:07.650> by<00:03:07.800> pushing<00:03:07.980> this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
turn the live view here by pushing this

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.340 
turn the live view here by pushing this
one<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.610> make<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.760> little<00:03:08.880> easier<00:03:09.240> I<00:03:09.450> have

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
one just to make a little easier I have

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.370 
one just to make a little easier I have
um<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.550> move<00:03:11.790> your<00:03:12.030> focus<00:03:12.480> point<00:03:12.540> during

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
focus now I can push it all the way down

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.940

to<00:03:34.860> take<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.040> photo<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.410> now<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.680> see<00:03:37.800> my

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
to take the photo and now you can see my

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.460 
to take the photo and now you can see my
photo<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.340> correctly<00:03:38.760> exposed<00:03:39.180> now<00:03:39.870> let's<00:03:40.110> say

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
photo is correctly exposed now let's say

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.810 
photo is correctly exposed now let's say
I'm<00:03:40.650> going<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.830> turn<00:03:40.950> off<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> live<00:03:41.459> view<00:03:41.610> here

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
I'm going to turn off the live view here

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.240 
I'm going to turn off the live view here
for<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> second<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.510> let's<00:03:42.720> say<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.470> take<00:03:44.100> my

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
for a second and let's say I take my

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.150 
for a second and let's say I take my
shutter<00:03:44.519> speed<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.739> manipulate<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.890> so

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
shutter speed and I manipulate it so

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.580 
shutter speed and I manipulate it so
that<00:03:47.370> my<00:03:47.580> light<00:03:47.760> meter<00:03:47.940> reads<00:03:48.450> negative<00:03:49.019> two

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
that my light meter reads negative two

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.590 
that my light meter reads negative two
so<00:03:50.250> that's<00:03:50.400> 30<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.850> hundreds<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.269> seconds

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
so that's 30 to hundreds of a seconds

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.490 
so that's 30 to hundreds of a seconds
it's<00:03:51.690> very<00:03:51.870> fast

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
it's very fast

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.520 
it's very fast
go<00:03:53.190> back<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.459> my<00:03:53.550> live<00:03:53.760> view<00:03:53.989> now<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.170> see

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.550 

that<00:03:58.530> picture<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:58.920> almost<00:03:59.310> completely<00:03:59.700> dark

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
that picture is almost completely dark

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.350 
that picture is almost completely dark
but<00:04:01.560> if<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.860> change<00:04:02.220> my<00:04:02.400> shutter<00:04:02.700> speed<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.090> can

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
but if I change my shutter speed you can

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.759 
but if I change my shutter speed you can
see<00:04:03.480> my<00:04:03.600> light<00:04:03.780> meter<00:04:03.900> moving<00:04:04.290> here<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.650> can

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
see my light meter moving here you can

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.440 
see my light meter moving here you can
see<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.070> gives<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.340> an<00:04:05.430> exposure<00:04:05.730> preview

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
see it gives you an exposure preview

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.229 
see it gives you an exposure preview
look<00:04:06.600> at<00:04:06.690> that<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.489> tell<00:04:08.760> through<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
look at that so you can tell through the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.000 
look at that so you can tell through the
live<00:04:09.420> view<00:04:09.720> how<00:04:10.050> bright<00:04:10.350> or<00:04:10.380> dark<00:04:10.680> something

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
live view how bright or dark something

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.420 
live view how bright or dark something
is<00:04:11.220> going<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.610> be<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.090> see<00:04:12.980> visually<00:04:13.980> as<00:04:14.190> well

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
is going to be and see visually as well

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.130 
is going to be and see visually as well
as<00:04:14.580> on<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> light<00:04:14.970> meter<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.360> then<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:16.019> I

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
as on the light meter and then if I

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.530 
as on the light meter and then if I
manipulate<00:04:16.650> my<00:04:16.950> aperture<00:04:17.609> which<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.209> can<00:04:18.390> only

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
manipulate my aperture which I can only

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.229 
manipulate my aperture which I can only
make<00:04:18.989> smaller<00:04:19.560> right<00:04:20.310> now<00:04:20.459> it'll<00:04:21.000> make<00:04:21.209> a

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
make smaller right now it'll make a

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.659 
make smaller right now it'll make a
darker<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.620> that's<00:04:22.770> an<00:04:22.860> excellent<00:04:23.220> learning

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
darker so that's an excellent learning

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.159 
darker so that's an excellent learning
tool<00:04:23.880> an<00:04:24.060> excellent<00:04:24.360> way<00:04:24.539> of<00:04:24.720> really<00:04:25.080> getting

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
tool an excellent way of really getting

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.930 
tool an excellent way of really getting
into<00:04:25.560> photography<00:04:26.070> that's<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.550> basics

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
into photography that's just the basics

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.350 
into photography that's just the basics
so<00:04:27.090> go

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
so go
