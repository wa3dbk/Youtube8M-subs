00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.570
10 Rare Medical Conditions With Weird Effects

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:02.570
10) Basolateral Amygdala Lesions
These lesions grow inside and shut down the

00:00:02.570 --> 00:03:01.840
trust centers in the brain.&nbsp;
Sufferers are overly generous even when they

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.130
can't afford it, and are more susceptible
to cons.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.130
9) Persistant Genital Arousal Disorder

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.492
An irregular nervous system may cause the
genitals to be constantly aroused.

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:06.492
Orgasms only provide temporarily relief - so
far there's no known cure.

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:07.492
8) Urbach-Wiethe Disease

00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:08.492
This disease shrivels up the part of the brain
that controls emotions, particularly fear.

00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:09.492
Consequently sufferers are unable to experience
fear, even when being mugged.

00:03:09.492 --> 00:03:10.492
7) Ross' Syndrome

00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:11.492
A neurological condition where eyes react
to light more slowly than usual.

00:03:11.492 --> 00:03:12.492
It also prevents sweating. Sufferers overheat
&amp; wear wet clothes to stay cool during exercise.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:13.492
6) The Cotard Delusion

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:14.492
People believe they are actually dead and
hang around graveyards to be with their kind.

00:03:14.492 --> 00:03:15.492
Electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective
treatment for it.

00:03:15.492 --> 00:03:16.492
5) Muscle Hypertrophy

00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:18.600
This condition stops the body producing myostatin,
which inhibits muscle growth.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.780
Toddlers with this condition have six packs
and can lift two 5lb weights.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.780
4) Gastroschisis

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.812
Babies' bellies don't fully form in the womb,
leaving a small hole.

00:03:24.812 --> 00:03:25.812
They're born with their intestines outside
their bodies - luckily 90% survive.

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:26.812
3) Analgesia

00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:27.970
These people feel no pain at all. One person
walked on a broken ankle all day before noticing.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.290
It could be caused by there being too many
endorphins in the brain.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.290
2) Hyperekplexia

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.290
Sufferers have too much muscle tone and are
easily startled by loud noises.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.790
A surprising bang or clap makes their body
freeze and they fall over, like a fainting

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.790
goat.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.790
1) Auto-Brewery Syndrome

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.790
An infection of Baker's Yeast turned a Texas
man's intestines into a brewery.&nbsp;

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.803
The yeast converted his food into alcohol
and got him drunk every day.
