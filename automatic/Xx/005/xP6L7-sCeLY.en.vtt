00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
now last week the Niners proved

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.170 
now last week the Niners proved
something<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> second<00:01:41.759> time<00:01:41.970> this

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
something for the second time this

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.090 
something for the second time this
season<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> team<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.829> built

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
season they are not a team that is built

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
season they are not a team that is built
to<00:01:44.189> play<00:01:44.430> from<00:01:44.670> behind<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:45.990> an

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to play from behind they have to get an

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.420 
to play from behind they have to get an
early<00:01:46.320> lead<00:01:46.500> otherwise<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.979> get<00:01:47.159> themselves

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
early lead otherwise they get themselves

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
early lead otherwise they get themselves
sunk<00:01:47.880> into<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.149> big<00:01:48.450> hole<00:01:48.689> because<00:01:49.049> their<00:01:49.259> team

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
sunk into a big hole because their team

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.929 
sunk into a big hole because their team
is<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.770> leaning<00:01:50.159> towards<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.549> passing

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
is not leaning towards the passing

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.730 
is not leaning towards the passing
offense<00:01:51.299> obviously<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:52.200> run<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> football

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
offense obviously they run the football

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.410 
offense obviously they run the football
with<00:01:52.979> Frank<00:01:53.310> Gore<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.149> didn't<00:01:54.390> work

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
with Frank Gore and it didn't work

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
with Frank Gore and it didn't work
against<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> Giants<00:01:55.740> last<00:01:55.860> week<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
against the Giants last week and so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.069 
against the Giants last week and so
that's<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> main<00:01:57.479> focus<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that's gonna be the main focus for the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
that's gonna be the main focus for the
Seahawks<00:01:58.290> whichever<00:01:58.860> team<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.850> team

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
Seahawks whichever team I think the team

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
Seahawks whichever team I think the team
that<00:02:00.180> gets<00:02:00.270> off<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> fastest<00:02:01.290> Lert<00:02:01.590> could

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that gets off to the fastest Lert could

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.679 
that gets off to the fastest Lert could
be<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> tema<00:02:02.520> ends<00:02:02.790> up<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:02.969> his<00:02:03.090> victory<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
be the tema ends up with his victory and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.749 
be the tema ends up with his victory and
I<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.259> not<00:02:04.469> expect<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> points<00:02:05.610> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
I do not expect a lot of points this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.459 
I do not expect a lot of points this
week<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.180> mean<00:02:06.360> both<00:02:06.540> these<00:02:06.780> teams<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.290> some

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
week I mean both these teams have some

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
week I mean both these teams have some
good<00:02:07.680> weapons<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.160> offense<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
good weapons on offense but the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.729 
good weapons on offense but the
quarterbacks<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.840> starting<00:02:10.080> gunslingers

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
quarterbacks just starting gunslingers

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.869 
quarterbacks just starting gunslingers
and<00:02:10.830> they're<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:11.400> basically<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
and they're just there basically to

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.350 
and they're just there basically to
manage

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
manage

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.240 
manage
football<00:02:12.720> game<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.860> game<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.220> I

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
football game and then a game that I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.860 
football game and then a game that I
expect<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.850> very<00:02:15.060> tight<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.390> defensively

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
expect to be very tight and defensively

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.450 
expect to be very tight and defensively
focused<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.680> can't<00:02:16.920> afford<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.370> have

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
focused you can't afford to have

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.310 
focused you can't afford to have
turnovers<00:02:18.090> especially<00:02:18.540> eternal<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:19.020> within

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
turnovers especially eternal was within

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.740 
turnovers especially eternal was within
your<00:02:19.680> own<00:02:19.830> side<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.340> field<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.820> so<00:02:21.360> Alex

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
your own side of the field and so Alex

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.810 
your own side of the field and so Alex
Smith<00:02:21.990> had<00:02:22.230> three<00:02:22.620> interceptions<00:02:23.100> last<00:02:23.550> week

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
Smith had three interceptions last week

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.460 
Smith had three interceptions last week
but<00:02:24.240> that's<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.720> they<00:02:24.840> were<00:02:24.960> reliant<00:02:25.290> on

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
but that's because they were reliant on

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.630 
but that's because they were reliant on
the<00:02:25.590> passing<00:02:25.950> game<00:02:26.070> when<00:02:26.220> they<00:02:26.310> were<00:02:26.370> down<00:02:26.580> by

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the passing game when they were down by

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.370 
the passing game when they were down by
a<00:02:26.820> bunch<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.210> scores<00:02:27.480> after<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.900> Giants<00:02:28.260> took

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
a bunch of scores after the Giants took

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.170 
a bunch of scores after the Giants took
their<00:02:28.590> lead<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.610> compare<00:02:29.970> these<00:02:30.120> two

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
their lead and so you compare these two

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.420 
their lead and so you compare these two
teams<00:02:30.630> they<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:30.960> very<00:02:31.350> similar<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
teams they are very similar and the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.680 
teams they are very similar and the
style<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.880> they<00:02:32.970> like<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.150> play<00:02:33.300> obviously

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
style that they like to play obviously

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.780 
style that they like to play obviously
I've<00:02:34.080> touched<00:02:34.620> on<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.890> little<00:02:34.980> bit<00:02:35.190> but

be needed today I pound the ball to move
the<00:02:43.830> chains<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:44.370> keep<00:02:44.550> drives<00:02:44.880> moving

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
the chains and they keep drives moving

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.520

be<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> great<00:03:08.520> matchup<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:09.030> think<00:03:09.360> I'm<00:03:09.480> excited

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
be a great matchup I think I'm excited

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.810 
be a great matchup I think I'm excited
for<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.350> mean<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.920> think<00:03:11.100> this<00:03:11.430> game<00:03:11.610> is

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
for it I mean I think this game is

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.150 
for it I mean I think this game is
definitely<00:03:12.030> big<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.870> sense<00:03:13.830> that<00:03:13.920> it's<00:03:14.100> a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
definitely big in the sense that it's a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.010 
definitely big in the sense that it's a
divisional<00:03:14.550> matchup<00:03:15.030> but<00:03:15.570> I<00:03:15.600> think<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
divisional matchup but I think if the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.539 
divisional matchup but I think if the
Niners<00:03:16.230> lose<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.739> game<00:03:16.980> though<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.370> gonna

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
Niners lose this game though it's gonna

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.150 
Niners lose this game though it's gonna
be<00:03:17.760> very<00:03:18.060> very<00:03:18.480> bad<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:18.840> them<00:03:19.170> because<00:03:19.350> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
be very very bad for them because the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.860 
be very very bad for them because the
Vikings<00:03:20.580> game<00:03:20.700> was<00:03:21.030> considered<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.540> wake<00:03:21.690> up

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
dominant on the offensive side of the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.660 
dominant on the offensive side of the
ball<00:03:43.560> with<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.860> running<00:03:44.220> game<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.549> that's

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
ball with the running game and that's

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.920 
ball with the running game and that's
how<00:03:44.790> they<00:03:44.880> control<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.239> pace<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.660> game<00:03:45.900> I

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
how they control the pace of this game I

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.080 
how they control the pace of this game I
think<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> Niners<00:03:47.459> have<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.670> focus<00:03:47.970> on

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
think and so a Niners have to focus on

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.580 
think and so a Niners have to focus on
getting<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.390> running<00:03:48.630> game<00:03:48.750> established<00:03:49.410> and

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
getting the running game established and

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.259 
getting the running game established and
getting<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.010> passing<00:03:50.459> game<00:03:50.549> going<00:03:50.940> with

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
getting the passing game going with

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.240 
getting the passing game going with
Vernon<00:03:51.720> Davis<00:03:51.989> was<00:03:52.170> definitely<00:03:52.860> their<00:03:53.010> best

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
Vernon Davis was definitely their best

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.860 
Vernon Davis was definitely their best
offensive<00:03:53.730> threat<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> passing<00:03:54.510> game<00:03:54.660> and

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
offensive threat in the passing game and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.960 
offensive threat in the passing game and
for<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.440> Seahawks<00:03:55.650> they<00:03:56.010> can't<00:03:56.250> get<00:03:56.459> cocky

which team runs the football the past in

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.090 
which team runs the football the past in
which<00:04:06.600> quarterback<00:04:07.140> manages<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.769> game<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
which quarterback manages the game the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.190 
which quarterback manages the game the
best<00:04:08.310> my<00:04:08.790> main<00:04:09.000> concern<00:04:09.420> for<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.690> Seahawks<00:04:09.930> is

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
best my main concern for the Seahawks is

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.180 
best my main concern for the Seahawks is
maybe<00:04:10.380> they<00:04:10.500> come<00:04:10.650> out<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> little<00:04:10.860> bit<00:04:10.980> too

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
maybe they come out a little bit too

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.490 
maybe they come out a little bit too
cocky<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.269> Niners<00:04:12.750> are<00:04:12.900> ready<00:04:13.110> for<00:04:13.350> when

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
cocky and the Niners are ready for when

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.750 
cocky and the Niners are ready for when
they<00:04:13.590> get<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:13.829> good<00:04:13.980> lead<00:04:14.190> on<00:04:14.250> them<00:04:14.400> early<00:04:14.519> and

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
they get a good lead on them early and

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.120 
they get a good lead on them early and
they<00:04:15.180> don't<00:04:15.360> bounce<00:04:15.480> back<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.079> also<00:04:16.229> Russell

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
they don't bounce back but also Russell

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.650 
they don't bounce back but also Russell
Wilson's<00:04:17.430> look<00:04:17.579> good<00:04:17.760> late<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.150> games<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.540> mean

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
Wilson's look good late in games I mean

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.000 
Wilson's look good late in games I mean
you<00:04:18.870> can<00:04:18.989> look<00:04:19.109> at<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.290> Packer<00:04:19.500> game<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.919> say

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
you can look at that Packer game and say

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.650 
you can look at that Packer game and say
it<00:04:20.100> wasn't<00:04:20.280> legit<00:04:20.729> but<00:04:20.970> Russell<00:04:21.330> Wilson

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
it wasn't legit but Russell Wilson

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.150 
it wasn't legit but Russell Wilson
himself<00:04:21.780> has<00:04:22.140> played<00:04:22.380> good<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.919> end<00:04:23.039> of

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
himself has played good in the end of

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.520 
himself has played good in the end of
game<00:04:23.340> some<00:04:23.580> even<00:04:23.880> week<00:04:24.030> one<00:04:24.210> against<00:04:24.479> Arizona

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
game some even week one against Arizona

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.870 
game some even week one against Arizona
or<00:04:25.620> he<00:04:25.800> had<00:04:25.920> them<00:04:26.070> in<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.190> position<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.580> win<00:04:26.700> that

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
or he had them in a position to win that

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.610 
or he had them in a position to win that
game<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.150> his<00:04:27.450> receivers<00:04:27.870> did<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.260> bail<00:04:28.470> him

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
game and his receivers did not bail him

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.050 
game and his receivers did not bail him
out<00:04:28.710> all<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.160> endzone<00:04:29.460> they<00:04:29.610> drop<00:04:29.820> past

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
out all in the endzone they drop past

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.129 
out all in the endzone they drop past
and<00:04:30.240> spread<00:04:30.420> out<00:04:30.600> where<00:04:30.690> he's<00:04:30.780> talked<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:30.930> pass

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
and spread out where he's talked to pass

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.870 
and spread out where he's talked to pass
in<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.320> end<00:04:31.350> zone<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:32.550> game<00:04:32.730> is

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
in the end zone and so if this game is

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.640 
in the end zone and so if this game is
close<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.570> it's<00:04:33.810> late<00:04:34.080> in<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.260> game<00:04:34.410> and

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
close and it's late in the game and

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.350 
close and it's late in the game and
Russell<00:04:34.889> Wilson<00:04:35.160> has<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.370> football<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.970> don't

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
Russell Wilson has the football I don't

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.940 
Russell Wilson has the football I don't
doubt<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.660> Seahawks<00:04:37.139> can<00:04:37.320> get<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.440> victory<00:04:37.860> in

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
doubt the Seahawks can get a victory in

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.770 
doubt the Seahawks can get a victory in
this<00:04:38.070> one<00:04:38.340> but<00:04:38.880> I'm<00:04:39.090> taking<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.570> San

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
this one but I'm taking the San

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.870 
this one but I'm taking the San
Francisco<00:04:40.350> 49ers<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:41.130> week<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.400> bounce<00:04:41.610> back

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
Francisco 49ers this week to bounce back

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.550 
Francisco 49ers this week to bounce back
against<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.240> Seahawks<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.900> think<00:04:43.470> you're

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
against the Seahawks I think you're

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.200 
against the Seahawks I think you're
gonna<00:04:43.680> bring<00:04:43.919> some<00:04:44.130> pressure<00:04:44.340> at<00:04:44.639> Russell

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
gonna bring some pressure at Russell

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.520 
gonna bring some pressure at Russell
Wilson<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.630> they're<00:04:45.780> gonna<00:04:45.900> make<00:04:46.200> life<00:04:46.470> a

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
Wilson and they're gonna make life a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.690 
Wilson and they're gonna make life a
little<00:04:46.620> bit<00:04:46.740> more<00:04:46.800> difficult<00:04:47.370> on<00:04:47.550> the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
little bit more difficult on the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700 
little bit more difficult on the
first-year<00:04:48.240> quarterback<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:48.900> so<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.530> game

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
first-year quarterback and so this game

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.200 
first-year quarterback and so this game
is<00:04:49.740> probably<00:04:50.040> gonna<00:04:50.160> come<00:04:50.250> down<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.030> tough

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
is probably gonna come down to the tough

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.850 
is probably gonna come down to the tough
defenses<00:04:51.780> of<00:04:51.900> course<00:04:52.139> but<00:04:52.380> running<00:04:52.740> the

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
defenses of course but running the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.470 
defenses of course but running the
football<00:04:53.040> who<00:04:53.340> has<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.610> most<00:04:53.790> success<00:04:54.270> new

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
football who has the most success new

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.120 
football who has the most success new
can<00:04:54.660> churn<00:04:54.870> out<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.080> most<00:04:55.230> first<00:04:55.530> downs<00:04:55.830> and

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
can churn out the most first downs and

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.860 
can churn out the most first downs and
which<00:04:56.520> team<00:04:56.790> keeps<00:04:57.030> their<00:04:57.210> defense<00:04:57.600> off<00:04:57.840> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
which team keeps their defense off the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.990 
which team keeps their defense off the
field<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.410> most<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.919> that<00:04:59.310> which<00:04:59.520> team<00:04:59.790> can

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
field the most and that which team can

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.280 
field the most and that which team can
win<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.240> turnover<00:05:00.510> differential<00:05:01.020> and

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
win the turnover differential and

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.630 
win the turnover differential and
turnover<00:05:01.620> battle<00:05:01.800> because<00:05:02.220> they<00:05:02.400> can't

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
turnover battle because they can't

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.100 
turnover battle because they can't
afford<00:05:02.730> to<00:05:03.000> have<00:05:03.210> turnovers<00:05:03.660> in<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.810> game<00:05:03.960> like

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
afford to have turnovers in a game like

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.659 
afford to have turnovers in a game like
this<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.470> defenses<00:05:04.919> are<00:05:05.040> too<00:05:05.190> good<00:05:05.430> for<00:05:05.460> them

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
this the defenses are too good for them

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.850 
this the defenses are too good for them
to<00:05:05.730> come<00:05:05.910> back<00:05:05.940> from<00:05:06.300> big<00:05:06.600> deficits<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.290> so

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
to come back from big deficits and so

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.440 
to come back from big deficits and so
I'm<00:05:07.950> looking<00:05:08.100> forward<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:08.640> game<00:05:08.730> but<00:05:09.330> I'm

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
I'm looking forward to this game but I'm

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.960 
I'm looking forward to this game but I'm
taking<00:05:09.870> San<00:05:10.169> Francisco<00:05:10.800> at<00:05:10.980> home<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.730> get<00:05:11.880> the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
taking San Francisco at home to get the

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.420 
taking San Francisco at home to get the
victory<00:05:12.270> 24<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.260> 19<00:05:13.770> in<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:14.040> very<00:05:14.250> good

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
victory 24 to 19 in a very good

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.190 
victory 24 to 19 in a very good
defensive<00:05:14.880> fight<00:05:15.180> but<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.780> can<00:05:15.990> see<00:05:16.110> the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
defensive fight but I can see the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.240 
defensive fight but I can see the
Seahawks<00:05:16.530> winning<00:05:16.710> this<00:05:16.800> game<00:05:17.010> definitely

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
Seahawks winning this game definitely

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.219 
Seahawks winning this game definitely
especially<00:05:18.120> if<00:05:18.270> it's<00:05:18.419> Russell<00:05:18.720> Wilson<00:05:19.050> late

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
especially if it's Russell Wilson late

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.659 
especially if it's Russell Wilson late
in<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.380> game<00:05:19.560> with<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.130> way<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.430> he's<00:05:20.550> been

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
in the game with the way that he's been
