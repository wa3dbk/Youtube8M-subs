00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.880 
about it till now but I mean the till I
washed<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.290> odd<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> wash

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
washed it but it's really odd to wash

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.200 
washed it but it's really odd to wash
because<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.549> how<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.850> supposed<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
because you know how you're supposed to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.300 
because you know how you're supposed to
have<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.630> brushes<00:01:43.200> drain<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:44.040> slow

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
have your brushes drain down with slow

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
have your brushes drain down with slow
the<00:01:45.149> water<00:01:45.509> doesn't<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.110> into<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.409> bristles

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the water doesn't get into the bristles

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.050 
the water doesn't get into the bristles
it's<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.130> hard<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> dry<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> su<00:01:47.850> khine<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's really hard to dry the su khine a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's really hard to dry the su khine a
few<00:01:48.240> light<00:01:48.390> flat<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.470> not<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> best<00:01:50.009> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
few light flat and it's not the best for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.300 
few light flat and it's not the best for
the<00:01:50.399> brush<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.619> has<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> flat

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
