down the mortars going down and then

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.730 
down the mortars going down and then

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
once those two are down since he's only

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
once those two are down since he's only
a<00:01:19.890> townhall<00:01:20.250> 5<00:01:20.490> he<00:01:20.729> has<00:01:20.759> no<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.119> splash

a townhall 5 he has no more splash
defense<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.259> pretty<00:01:22.439> much<00:01:22.530> spam<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
defense and I can pretty much spam the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.710 
defense and I can pretty much spam the
rest<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.340> troops<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:24.299> ready<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
attack him from the top hand side all
right<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.000> splash<00:01:27.270> damages<00:01:27.780> are<00:01:27.900> down<00:01:28.080> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
pretty solid raid the way that it was

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.520 
pretty solid raid the way that it was
laid<00:02:11.310> out<00:02:11.340> definitely<00:02:11.940> interesting<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.959> save

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
laid out definitely interesting to save

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.230 
laid out definitely interesting to save
least<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.800> Italo<00:02:14.069> five<00:02:14.370> he<00:02:14.819> actually<00:02:15.120> had

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
least for Italo five he actually had

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.520 
least for Italo five he actually had
some<00:02:15.270> really<00:02:15.480> good<00:02:15.660> upgrades<00:02:16.020> all<00:02:16.200> his<00:02:16.319> walls

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
some really good upgrades all his walls

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.990 
some really good upgrades all his walls
were<00:02:16.680> level<00:02:16.920> five<00:02:17.100> he<00:02:17.310> could<00:02:17.459> upgraded<00:02:17.910> his

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
were level five he could upgraded his

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.570 
were level five he could upgraded his
cannons<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.480> stuff<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.750> little<00:02:18.959> bit<00:02:19.050> more<00:02:19.230> but

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
cannons and stuff a little bit more but

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.650 
cannons and stuff a little bit more but
definitely<00:02:20.580> needed<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.940> redesign<00:02:21.209> his<00:02:21.480> base

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
definitely needed to redesign his base

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.270 
definitely needed to redesign his base
and<00:02:21.959> because<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.650> fact<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.950> he<00:02:23.100> threw

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and because of the fact that he threw

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.440 
and because of the fact that he threw
but<00:02:23.430> his<00:02:23.580> most<00:02:23.730> important<00:02:24.150> stuff<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
but his most important stuff in the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.180 
but his most important stuff in the
outside<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.959> were<00:02:25.110> able<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.380> get<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.650> three-star

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
outside we were able to get a three-star

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.250 
outside we were able to get a three-star
against<00:02:26.670> his<00:02:26.790> base<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.569> pretty<00:02:27.780> solid<00:02:28.080> let's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
against his base so pretty solid let's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.350 
against his base so pretty solid let's

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and rake through right there and then

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.580 
and rake through right there and then
unfortunately<00:03:45.420> as<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:46.019> dropped<00:03:46.260> my<00:03:46.350> wall

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
unfortunately as I dropped my wall

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.680 
unfortunately as I dropped my wall
breakers<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.190> think<00:03:47.640> they<00:03:47.730> got<00:03:47.940> shot<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.390> by

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
breakers I think they got shot down by

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.539 
breakers I think they got shot down by
the<00:03:48.750> power<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.410> wizard<00:03:49.769> tower<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.220> I

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
the power of the wizard tower and I

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.039 
the power of the wizard tower and I
wasn't<00:03:50.790> able<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.180> break<00:03:51.390> inside<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> base

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
wasn't able to break inside of the base

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.810 
wasn't able to break inside of the base
so<00:03:52.290> at<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.620> point<00:03:52.829> sort<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.430> scrounging

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
so at this point sort of just scrounging

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.520 
so at this point sort of just scrounging
around<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.150> see<00:03:54.269> what<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.630> get<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:55.320> are

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
around to see what I can get there are

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
around to see what I can get there are
some<00:03:55.799> level<00:03:56.280> 10<00:03:56.459> gold<00:03:56.730> mines<00:03:56.910> on<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.090> outside

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
some level 10 gold mines on the outside

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.819 
some level 10 gold mines on the outside
and<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.930> honest<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.320> probably<00:03:58.470> should<00:03:58.799> have

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
and to be honest I probably should have

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.319 
and to be honest I probably should have
taken<00:03:58.980> care<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.340> those<00:03:59.519> before<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.910> did<00:04:00.150> much

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
taken care of those before I did much

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.880 
taken care of those before I did much

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
to be in the mines and pumps so let's go

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.300 
to be in the mines and pumps so let's go
ahead<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:54.870> go<00:04:54.960> corner<00:04:55.440> by<00:04:55.560> corner<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:56.100> try<00:04:56.250> to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
ahead and go corner by corner and try to

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.980 
ahead and go corner by corner and try to
get<00:04:56.490> all<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.790> resources<00:04:56.910> in<00:04:57.449> this<00:04:57.510> guy's<00:04:57.720> base

get all the resources in this guy's base

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.330 
get all the resources in this guy's base
so<00:04:58.290> even<00:04:58.620> though<00:04:58.680> his<00:04:58.800> base<00:04:58.919> looks<00:04:59.160> pretty

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
so even though his base looks pretty

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.010 
so even though his base looks pretty
easy<00:04:59.550> it's<00:04:59.850> going<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.270> be<00:05:00.330> really<00:05:00.570> important

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
easy it's going to be really important

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.360 
easy it's going to be really important
that<00:05:01.169> we<00:05:01.290> don't<00:05:01.380> waste<00:05:01.650> our<00:05:01.800> troops<00:05:02.160> on<00:05:02.340> a

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
that we don't waste our troops on a

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.100 
that we don't waste our troops on a
certain<00:05:02.700> side<00:05:02.910> we<00:05:03.240> need<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.510> be<00:05:03.690> able<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.930> tack

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
certain side we need to be able to tack

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.960 
certain side we need to be able to tack
every<00:05:04.560> single<00:05:04.889> corner<00:05:05.220> because<00:05:05.820> the

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
every single corner because the

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.760 
every single corner because the
resources<00:05:06.450> are<00:05:06.690> on<00:05:06.840> every<00:05:07.139> single<00:05:07.440> side<00:05:07.620> of

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
resources are on every single side of

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.620 
resources are on every single side of
the<00:05:07.830> base<00:05:07.979> so<00:05:08.669> starting<00:05:09.000> off<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:09.240> took<00:05:09.300> care<00:05:09.600> of

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
the base so starting off I took care of

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.180 
the base so starting off I took care of
that<00:05:09.780> mortar<00:05:10.229> I'm<00:05:10.380> also<00:05:10.530> gonna<00:05:10.740> take<00:05:10.979> care<00:05:11.100> of

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
that mortar I'm also gonna take care of

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.560 
that mortar I'm also gonna take care of
this<00:05:11.280> wizard<00:05:11.610> tower<00:05:11.760> right<00:05:11.970> here<00:05:12.000> just<00:05:12.389> trying

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
this wizard tower right here just trying

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.610 
this wizard tower right here just trying
to<00:05:12.660> get<00:05:12.750> rid<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:12.990> those<00:05:13.050> splash<00:05:13.290> damaged

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
to get rid of those splash damaged

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.110 
to get rid of those splash damaged
buildings<00:05:13.979> not<00:05:14.130> focused<00:05:14.490> on<00:05:14.580> too<00:05:14.760> much<00:05:14.880> else

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
buildings not focused on too much else

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.150 
buildings not focused on too much else
and<00:05:15.419> then<00:05:15.960> after<00:05:16.350> that<00:05:16.470> I'm<00:05:16.710> gonna<00:05:16.889> attack

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
left and let's see if we can steal what

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.360 
left and let's see if we can steal what
this<00:05:21.030> guy's<00:05:21.210> got<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:22.590> barbarians<00:05:23.100> are<00:05:23.190> going

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
this guy's got so barbarians are going

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.680 
this guy's got so barbarians are going
in<00:05:23.490> I'm<00:05:23.669> destroying<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.120> defense<00:05:24.389> on<00:05:24.570> the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
in I'm destroying the defense on the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.200 
in I'm destroying the defense on the
outside<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.289> as<00:05:25.500> I'm<00:05:25.770> attacking<00:05:26.130> I<00:05:26.460> sort<00:05:27.150> of

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
outside and as I'm attacking I sort of

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.580 
outside and as I'm attacking I sort of
noticed<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.660> this<00:05:27.810> guy<00:05:27.930> doesn't<00:05:28.199> have<00:05:28.410> a<00:05:28.440> lot

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
noticed that this guy doesn't have a lot

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.050 
noticed that this guy doesn't have a lot
of<00:05:28.620> defenses<00:05:29.160> towards<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.550> inside<00:05:29.880> of<00:05:29.970> his

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
of defenses towards the inside of his

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.000 
of defenses towards the inside of his
base<00:05:30.300> he<00:05:30.600> has<00:05:30.630> cannons<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.410> Archer<00:05:31.680> towers<00:05:31.860> on

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
base he has cannons and Archer towers on

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.680 
base he has cannons and Archer towers on
the<00:05:32.070> outside<00:05:32.430> and<00:05:32.700> I<00:05:33.060> already<00:05:33.210> destroyed<00:05:33.479> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
the outside and I already destroyed the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.150 
the outside and I already destroyed the
mortars<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.260> are<00:05:34.350> on<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.530> outside<00:05:34.889> there's

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
mortars that are on the outside there's

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.920 
mortars that are on the outside there's
really<00:05:35.340> only<00:05:35.610> with<00:05:35.850> one<00:05:36.180> wizard<00:05:36.539> tower<00:05:36.690> that

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
really only with one wizard tower that

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.050 
really only with one wizard tower that
sort<00:05:37.169> of<00:05:37.229> tucked<00:05:37.440> away<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.889> in<00:05:38.639> the<00:05:38.760> beginning

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
sort of tucked away and in the beginning

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.340 
sort of tucked away and in the beginning
I<00:05:39.270> was<00:05:39.450> really<00:05:39.479> just<00:05:39.930> going<00:05:40.139> for<00:05:40.289> the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
I was really just going for the

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.290 
I was really just going for the
resources<00:05:41.010> but<00:05:41.190> at<00:05:41.280> this<00:05:41.400> point<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.820> definitely

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
resources but at this point I definitely

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.820 
resources but at this point I definitely
can<00:05:42.419> see<00:05:42.450> how<00:05:42.720> I<00:05:42.750> can<00:05:42.960> get<00:05:43.080> 3<00:05:43.320> stars<00:05:43.560> against

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
can see how I can get 3 stars against

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.830 
can see how I can get 3 stars against
this<00:05:43.979> space<00:05:44.190> so<00:05:44.760> destroying<00:05:45.539> all<00:05:45.720> the

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
this space so destroying all the

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.779 
this space so destroying all the
defense's<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.440> only<00:05:46.650> thing<00:05:46.830> is<00:05:46.979> left<00:05:47.220> is<00:05:47.400> that

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
defense's the only thing is left is that

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.040 
defense's the only thing is left is that
cannon<00:05:48.180> right<00:05:48.300> there<00:05:48.479> in<00:05:48.599> that<00:05:48.630> wizard<00:05:49.020> tower

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
cannon right there in that wizard tower

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.379 
cannon right there in that wizard tower
and<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.830> should<00:05:50.250> be<00:05:50.370> good<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.610> go<00:05:50.700> and<00:05:50.970> as<00:05:51.090> I<00:05:51.210> drop

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
and I should be good to go and as I drop

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.490 
and I should be good to go and as I drop
these<00:05:51.539> goblins<00:05:51.900> they'll<00:05:52.080> break<00:05:52.200> through<00:05:52.260> the

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
these goblins they'll break through the

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.800 
these goblins they'll break through the
wall<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:52.860> they<00:05:53.729> should<00:05:54.030> destroy<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.599> gold

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
wall and they should destroy the gold

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.390 
wall and they should destroy the gold
storage<00:05:55.080> in<00:05:55.320> mines<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.830> then<00:05:55.889> after<00:05:56.280> that

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
storage in mines and then after that

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.890 
storage in mines and then after that
they'll<00:05:56.669> turn<00:05:56.849> around<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.360> probably<00:05:57.630> smack

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
they'll turn around and probably smack

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.629 
they'll turn around and probably smack
that<00:05:58.110> cannon<00:05:58.440> in<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.650> face<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:59.130> there<00:05:59.310> are<00:05:59.460> no

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
that cannon in the face if there are no

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.610 
that cannon in the face if there are no
more<00:05:59.820> resources<00:06:00.300> left<00:06:00.630> so<00:06:00.840> this<00:06:01.320> looks<00:06:01.530> like

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
more resources left so this looks like

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.510 
more resources left so this looks like
it's<00:06:01.770> gonna<00:06:01.830> be<00:06:01.979> a<00:06:02.039> pretty<00:06:02.160> good<00:06:02.340> raid

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
it's gonna be a pretty good raid

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.950 
it's gonna be a pretty good raid
honestly<00:06:03.030> I<00:06:03.060> didn't<00:06:03.389> think<00:06:03.510> I<00:06:03.660> was<00:06:03.750> going<00:06:03.870> to

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
honestly I didn't think I was going to

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.930 
honestly I didn't think I was going to
get<00:06:04.050> 3<00:06:04.260> stars<00:06:04.500> but<00:06:04.740> again<00:06:05.039> as<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.310> raid<00:06:05.760> you

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
get 3 stars but again as you raid you

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.430 
get 3 stars but again as you raid you
sort<00:06:06.120> of<00:06:06.180> have<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.419> adapt<00:06:06.720> to<00:06:06.750> what<00:06:06.930> you<00:06:07.169> see

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
sort of have to adapt to what you see

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.140 
sort of have to adapt to what you see
and<00:06:07.680> then<00:06:08.070> when<00:06:08.190> I<00:06:08.220> notice<00:06:08.610> that<00:06:08.729> most<00:06:08.910> of<00:06:09.030> his

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
and then when I notice that most of his

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.670 
and then when I notice that most of his
defenses<00:06:09.599> were<00:06:09.690> on<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:09.870> outside<00:06:10.200> that's<00:06:10.530> when

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
defenses were on the outside that's when

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.320 
defenses were on the outside that's when
I<00:06:10.710> really<00:06:11.010> started<00:06:11.310> to<00:06:11.400> use<00:06:11.580> my<00:06:11.610> barbarians

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
I really started to use my barbarians

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.820 
I really started to use my barbarians
and<00:06:12.419> archers<00:06:12.570> to<00:06:12.960> take<00:06:13.139> those<00:06:13.289> out<00:06:13.500> and

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
and archers to take those out and

was sort of weird I didn't get a lot of
bases<00:06:20.940> that<00:06:21.090> I<00:06:21.120> had<00:06:21.240> a<00:06:21.270> lot<00:06:21.419> of<00:06:21.539> trophies

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
bases that I had a lot of trophies

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.839 
bases that I had a lot of trophies
available<00:06:22.289> like<00:06:22.680> this<00:06:22.830> one<00:06:22.979> at<00:06:23.099> 16<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.820> other

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
available like this one at 16 the other

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.969 
available like this one at 16 the other
one<00:06:24.180> had<00:06:24.360> 14<00:06:24.900> or<00:06:25.139> something<00:06:25.320> like<00:06:25.530> that<00:06:25.590> I

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
one had 14 or something like that I

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.589 
one had 14 or something like that I
don't<00:06:26.250> think<00:06:26.370> any<00:06:26.550> of<00:06:26.639> them<00:06:26.729> had<00:06:26.880> more<00:06:27.090> than<00:06:27.240> 20

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
don't think any of them had more than 20
