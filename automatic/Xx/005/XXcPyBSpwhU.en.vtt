should<00:00:27.210> learn<00:00:27.330> not<00:00:27.390> same<00:00:27.869> person<00:00:28.260> marks<00:00:28.619> ID<00:00:28.980> 32

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
should learn not same person marks ID 32

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.700 
should learn not same person marks ID 32
why<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> raven<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.309> writing<00:00:32.430> desk<00:00:32.759> I

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
why is a raven like a writing desk I

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
why is a raven like a writing desk I
believe<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.890> guess<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> think

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
