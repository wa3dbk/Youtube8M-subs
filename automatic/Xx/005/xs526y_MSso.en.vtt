00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.150

 Well, if it's just like a clip from the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.650
 video simply the information for 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.250
 teach you to tell you 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.970

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.830
 you do not have a car, but here is a 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.830
 bunch of cars 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.980
 but if he stops and does not hit me 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.980
 hit by a car 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.100
 Where is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.390
 I have the little mountains 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.999
 as if that force transport you 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.890
 a crude is no longer my transport mind 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:53.200
 the car does not go transport you to me 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.649
 side we call things a nava is 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.649
 no car no 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.510
 tell me if you get the car 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.910
 It is not worth transport post from the 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.910
 teletransport looks better stay still 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.150
 but take 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.150
 update positions 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.140
 these to ivÃ¡n a 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.680
 where are you here through certain 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.070
 I say thanks to leo I go to the motherfucker 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.070
 be true 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.800
 and here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.870
 I'm going to put some bikes to do 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.870
 hands 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.900
 this will tell us 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.680
 I can do everything but the car does not 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.800
 It's worth the effort I make in Q2 very well 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.299
 and there you have it 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.390
 that only the car has invincible 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.390
 technically 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.349
 we check if you have invincible or not 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.550
 at the moment it is holding 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.549
 with profit 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.549
 the whore 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.380
 I wanted to check has put the mo 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.460
 current 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.460
 tarapoto degree 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.230
 of this car lacks grip 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.930
 to launch the best car we do not arrive is 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.489
 I believe that I am in position or 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.489
 no more or less yes 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.810
 we will always arrive we will wait faster 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.810
 because there we arrive faster 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.380
 I will position on the road and 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.289
 again give will be for palante always 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.050
 not if you're upside down but good 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:48.510
 dale dale twice there happen twice 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:52.260
 no question pedrÃ­n type perfect arrived 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.300
 and you wait as between inside I stay in 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.480
 paper I put a little bit further and I 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.510
 I give 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.850
 here it simply jumps and already 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.650
 I jumped you can not jump here 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.650
 let me jump with what 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:13.430
 what do you mean, jump with the 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:15.650
 car as it stands out with the continent that 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.500
 with this car to see if it jumps 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.000
 but with a boy jumping or not 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.240
 He says 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.360
 smart if you get high but not 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.150
 you are going to enter 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.090
 or if I did not want to do that 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.980
 to that is car halo in what is so 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.300
 main online 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.700
 and because we're going directly 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.870
 walking and we put the super jump and 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.870
 we enter the force in q2 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.960
 down I come to put the super jump 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:57.400
 for a little then we do not have a car 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:06:01.240
 look here, I have the car 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.360
 when accessing faster than you 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.840
 I am already inside you 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.139
 well then 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.600
 to prepare for for during 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:18.150
 was the assumption online 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.580
 these machine gun names like 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.639
 came in with the super jump and hit and 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.229
 get in 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.229
 that the second fence does not jump 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.900
 you have to put machine gun 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:39.650
 put this on the tier of me I do not 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.650
 disparate 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.879
 look this better 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.210
 that he does not have is immortal he does 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:50.210
 dumbass 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.030

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.860
 Well, good guys, it was just that 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:06.500
 find out about the 50 likes I'll start 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.770
 do to create a session would invite the 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.920
