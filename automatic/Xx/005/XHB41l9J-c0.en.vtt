00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
what circle it feeds into his academics

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.020 
what circle it feeds into his academics
he<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.320> reading<00:04:11.320> he's<00:04:11.590> learning<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.550> he's

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
he is reading he's learning and he's

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.840 
he is reading he's learning and he's
figuring<00:04:13.540> out<00:04:13.720> how<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.960> incorporate<00:04:14.550> all<00:04:15.550> of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
figuring out how to incorporate all of

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.450 
figuring out how to incorporate all of
the<00:04:15.970> technology<00:04:16.630> into<00:04:17.170> that<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:18.400> think

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
the technology into that and I think

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.550 
the technology into that and I think
it's<00:04:18.760> teaching<00:04:19.390> him<00:04:19.630> different<00:04:20.260> ways<00:04:20.380> to

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
it's teaching him different ways to

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.990 
it's teaching him different ways to
think<00:04:20.770> about<00:04:20.830> things<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.460> figure<00:04:21.820> out

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
think about things and to figure out

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.080 
think about things and to figure out
problems<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.990> see<00:04:23.710> him<00:04:23.980> becoming<00:04:24.790> even<00:04:25.030> a

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
problems so I see him becoming even a

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.580 
problems so I see him becoming even a
better<00:04:25.300> student<00:04:25.660> as<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.590> result<00:04:28.230> sometimes<00:04:29.230> we

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
better student as a result sometimes we

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.860 
better student as a result sometimes we

jaylen is typical in the sense that I

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.560 
jaylen is typical in the sense that I
think<00:05:23.230> he<00:05:23.620> embraces<00:05:23.980> exploration<00:05:24.820> but<00:05:25.390> I

think he embraces exploration but I

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.420 
think he embraces exploration but I
think<00:05:25.990> he's<00:05:26.170> a<00:05:26.260> little<00:05:26.620> bit<00:05:26.710> more<00:05:26.830> unique<00:05:27.160> in

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
think he's a little bit more unique in

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.680 
think he's a little bit more unique in
the<00:05:27.760> sense<00:05:27.910> that<00:05:28.030> he<00:05:28.210> takes<00:05:28.450> it<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:28.660> step

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
the sense that he takes it a step

further on his own very often so he

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.480 
further on his own very often so he
