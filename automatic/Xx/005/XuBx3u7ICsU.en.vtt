one through eight and then believe

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.930 
one through eight and then believe
that's<00:00:42.410> connecting<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.800> wireless<00:00:43.980> thing

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that's connecting to the wireless thing

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
millimeter cable which is fairly long

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.880 
millimeter cable which is fairly long
not<00:01:36.659> exactly<00:01:36.900> sure<00:01:37.380> how<00:01:37.409> long

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
not exactly sure how long

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.510 
not exactly sure how long
so<00:01:38.340> first<00:01:39.200> let's<00:01:40.200> say<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> ps3<00:01:40.979> will<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.280> your

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so first let's say the ps3 will be your

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.859 
so first let's say the ps3 will be your
audio<00:01:42.270> source<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> there's<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> ps3<00:01:44.689> I'm<00:01:45.689> not

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
audio source so there's a ps3 I'm not

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
audio source so there's a ps3 I'm not
gonna<00:01:46.020> plug<00:01:46.290> any<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.040> I'll<00:01:47.189> try<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

if they they both fit perfectly and this

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.220 
if they they both fit perfectly and this
will<00:03:02.680> require<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.760> triple-a<00:03:04.450> batteries<00:03:04.930> right

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
will require to triple-a batteries right

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.560 
will require to triple-a batteries right
there<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.530> power<00:03:05.710> it<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.640> after<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.240> put<00:03:07.420> in

there to power it on so after you put in
your<00:03:07.750> two<00:03:07.930> triple<00:03:08.350> a's<00:03:08.500> hopefully<00:03:09.040> they're

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
your two triple a's hopefully they're

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.930 
your two triple a's hopefully they're
brand<00:03:09.550> new<00:03:09.640> not<00:03:10.030> used<00:03:10.300> before

you turn it on and so your wireless

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.430 
you turn it on and so your wireless
transmitter<00:03:31.210> is<00:03:31.360> on<00:03:31.570> channel<00:03:31.930> 2<00:03:32.080> right<00:03:32.290> now

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.720 
the wireless transmitter can I get to
your<00:03:49.000> ps3<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:50.590> may<00:03:51.010> sound<00:03:51.460> a<00:03:51.550> little<00:03:51.580> bit

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
your ps3 that may sound a little bit

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.420 
your ps3 that may sound a little bit
confusing<00:03:52.150> I<00:03:52.480> did<00:03:52.990> when<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.200> set<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:56.430> listen

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
confusing I did when I set it but listen

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.220 
confusing I did when I set it but listen
over<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.210> couple<00:03:58.390> times<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:58.990> guess

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
over it a couple times and I guess

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.440 
over it a couple times and I guess
hopefully<00:04:00.130> you'll<00:04:00.280> get<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.270> that

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
hopefully you'll get it and so that

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.390 
hopefully you'll get it and so that
should<00:04:01.690> connect<00:04:02.050> it<00:04:02.170> wirelessly<00:04:02.620> now<00:04:02.920> a

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
should connect it wirelessly now a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.270 
should connect it wirelessly now a
separate<00:04:04.060> way<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.240> do<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.800> with<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:06.040> wires

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
separate way to do this with the wires

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.810 
separate way to do this with the wires
instead<00:04:06.850> of<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.060> wireless<00:04:07.360> transmitter<00:04:07.780> is

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
instead of the wireless transmitter is

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.900 
instead of the wireless transmitter is
pretty<00:04:09.820> much<00:04:10.560> take<00:04:11.560> your<00:04:11.710> ps3<00:04:12.220> or<00:04:12.340> any<00:04:12.520> audio

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
pretty much take your ps3 or any audio

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.420 
pretty much take your ps3 or any audio

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
source plug in here same way and take

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.510 
source plug in here same way and take
your<00:04:15.750> 3.5<00:04:16.750> millimeter<00:04:17.080> cable<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.770> just<00:04:18.220> take

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
your 3.5 millimeter cable and just take

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.210 
your 3.5 millimeter cable and just take
this<00:04:18.880> side<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.210> put<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.630> into<00:04:19.960> the<00:04:20.049> chair<00:04:20.290> so

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
this side and put it into the chair so

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.620 
this side and put it into the chair so
right<00:04:21.430> there<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:21.790> take<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.030> into<00:04:22.240> air<00:04:22.390> that's

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
right there and take it into air that's

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.240 
right there and take it into air that's
input<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.230> there<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.860> go

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
input and there you go

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.900 
input and there you go
works<00:04:24.580> either<00:04:24.820> way

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
works either way

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.820 
works either way
he's<00:04:26.120> powered<00:04:26.450> on<00:04:26.600> in<00:04:26.780> volume<00:04:27.200> base<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.710> don't

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
he's powered on in volume base you don't

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.800 
he's powered on in volume base you don't
need<00:04:28.070> any<00:04:28.310> channels<00:04:28.790> nothing<00:04:29.210> right<00:04:29.390> here<00:04:29.630> and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
need any channels nothing right here and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.630 
need any channels nothing right here and
have<00:04:30.200> your<00:04:30.350> power<00:04:30.560> plugged<00:04:30.890> in<00:04:31.040> for<00:04:31.280> the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
have your power plugged in for the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.450 
have your power plugged in for the
speaker<00:04:31.940> seat<00:04:32.150> work<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.290> so<00:04:34.040> that's<00:04:34.220> pretty

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
speaker seat work and so that's pretty

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.300 
speaker seat work and so that's pretty
much<00:04:34.610> how<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.000> would<00:04:35.360> set<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.600> up<00:04:35.980> hopefully<00:04:36.980> it

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
much how I would set it up hopefully it

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.060 
much how I would set it up hopefully it
will<00:04:37.370> work<00:04:37.610> if<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.150> if<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.810> if<00:04:39.200> you<00:04:39.620> guys<00:04:39.770> find
