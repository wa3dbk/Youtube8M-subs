I<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> areas<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
I think it's one of the areas that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.220 
I think it's one of the areas that
perhaps<00:00:37.670> we<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.790> feeders<00:00:39.149> often<00:00:39.570> overlook<00:00:39.989> we

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
perhaps we as feeders often overlook we

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.069 
perhaps we as feeders often overlook we
get<00:00:40.379> busy<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.579> don't<00:00:41.760> rigidly<00:00:42.719> follow

certainly early in those pigs lives it's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690 
certainly early in those pigs lives it's
important<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.219> would<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.489> those

two<00:02:12.830> main<00:02:13.340> areas<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:14.240> need<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.600> analyze

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
two main areas that we need to analyze

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.130 
two main areas that we need to analyze
at<00:02:15.260> all<00:02:15.440> times<00:02:15.970> know<00:02:16.970> these<00:02:17.270> young<00:02:17.540> developing

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
at all times know these young developing

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.080 
at all times know these young developing
pigs<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.860> sixty<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.490> hundred<00:02:19.550> pound

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
pigs in that sixty to a hundred pound

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.500 
pigs in that sixty to a hundred pound
range<00:02:20.420> again<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.590> want<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.100> them<00:02:22.390> developed

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
range again I want to get them developed

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.500 
range again I want to get them developed
as<00:02:24.220> best<00:02:25.220> possible<00:02:25.820> but<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.120> don't<00:02:26.300> want<00:02:26.480> to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
as best possible but we don't want to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.620 
as best possible but we don't want to
get<00:02:26.690> those<00:02:26.870> pigs<00:02:27.200> too<00:02:27.410> heavy<00:02:27.620> muscle<00:02:28.160> at<00:02:29.000> that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
get those pigs too heavy muscle at that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.390 
get those pigs too heavy muscle at that
young<00:02:29.900> developing<00:02:30.440> age<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.860> think<00:02:30.920> with

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
young developing age I think with

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.120 
young developing age I think with
today's<00:02:31.760> genetics<00:02:32.450> we<00:02:33.350> have<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> lot<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.860> heavy

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
today's genetics we have a lot of heavy

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.970 
today's genetics we have a lot of heavy
muscle<00:02:34.580> hogs<00:02:34.790> out<00:02:35.060> there<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:36.530> pushing

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
muscle hogs out there we get pushing

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.800 
muscle hogs out there we get pushing
these<00:02:37.100> hogs<00:02:37.310> too<00:02:37.670> hard<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.210> get<00:02:38.360> too<00:02:38.600> much

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
these hogs too hard and get too much

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.560 
these hogs too hard and get too much
muscle<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:40.220> these<00:02:40.520> young<00:02:40.730> developing<00:02:41.300> show

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
muscle in these young developing show

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.080 
muscle in these young developing show
pigs<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.170> think<00:02:42.500> personally<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.790> lends

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
pigs I think personally that that lends

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.270 
pigs I think personally that that lends
to<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> lot<00:02:44.570> of<00:02:44.690> joint<00:02:44.930> issues<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.709> these<00:02:45.800> these

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
to a lot of joint issues and these these

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.640 
to a lot of joint issues and these these
as<00:02:46.459> these<00:02:46.610> young<00:02:46.790> hogs<00:02:47.200> don't<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.470> their

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
as these young hogs don't have their

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.830 
as these young hogs don't have their
joints<00:02:49.070> fully<00:02:49.310> developed<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.360> start<00:02:50.660> laying

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
joints fully developed we start laying

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.140 
joints fully developed we start laying
on<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.170> lot<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.620> masses<00:02:52.220> these<00:02:52.370> jobs<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.880> trying

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
on a lot of masses these jobs of trying

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.720 
on a lot of masses these jobs of trying
to<00:02:53.209> grow<00:02:53.920> versus<00:02:54.920> just<00:02:55.160> trying<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.459> get<00:02:55.550> some

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
to grow versus just trying to get some

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.670 
to grow versus just trying to get some
skeletal<00:02:56.180> growth<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.600> bring<00:02:56.780> mass<00:02:57.020> later<00:02:57.410> I

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
skeletal growth and bring mass later I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.620 
skeletal growth and bring mass later I
think<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.430> really<00:02:58.610> compound<00:02:59.209> some<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.540> those

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
think you really compound some of those

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.690 
think you really compound some of those
joint<00:02:59.990> issues<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.980> have<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.520> make<00:03:01.670> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
joint issues so you have to make a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.210 
joint issues so you have to make a
decision<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:03.200> have<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.350> couple<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.770> products

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
decision we have a couple of products

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.600 
decision we have a couple of products
that<00:03:04.400> after<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.510> 11<00:03:05.900> 148<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:06.980> really<00:03:07.430> like

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
that after the 11 148 that I really like

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.690 
that after the 11 148 that I really like
to<00:03:07.640> position<00:03:08.360> if<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.200> have<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.470> hog<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:10.130> that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
to position if you have a hog that that

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.430 
to position if you have a hog that that
needs<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.360> come<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.959> little<00:03:12.290> more

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
needs to come on with a little more

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.990 
needs to come on with a little more
muscle<00:03:12.890> there<00:03:13.100> early

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
muscle there early

is<00:04:08.420> very<00:04:08.989> good<00:04:09.230> on<00:04:09.380> this<00:04:09.590> feed

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
is very good on this feed

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.940 
is very good on this feed
and<00:04:10.969> it<00:04:11.359> just<00:04:11.569> kind<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.930> helps<00:04:12.230> those<00:04:12.379> hogs<00:04:12.620> uh

kind of naturally develop in terms of
their<00:04:16.669> shape<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.150> muscle<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.139> so<00:04:18.500> that's

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
their shape and muscle and so that's

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.629 
their shape and muscle and so that's
product<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.639> that<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.600> find<00:04:21.289> myself<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:22.009> lot<00:04:22.580> of
