actually<00:04:38.009> taking<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.639> real<00:04:38.970> broad<00:04:39.449> head<00:04:39.690> and

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
actually taking a real broad head and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.059 
actually taking a real broad head and
polluted<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:42.180> wouldn't<00:04:42.569> deploying<00:04:42.990> open<00:04:43.379> but

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069

the noose whackers that come with the
new<00:04:46.680> packaging<00:04:47.220> actually<00:04:47.639> have<00:04:47.789> a<00:04:47.819> practice

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
new packaging actually have a practice

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.279 
new packaging actually have a practice
broad<00:04:48.990> head<00:04:49.229> that<00:04:50.210> is<00:04:51.210> set<00:04:51.479> up<00:04:51.509> in<00:04:51.750> design<00:04:52.050> so

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
broad head that is set up in design so

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.659 
broad head that is set up in design so
it<00:04:52.379> doesn't<00:04:52.680> deploy<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.099> that<00:04:53.250> allows<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.580> to

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
it doesn't deploy and that allows you to

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.920 
it doesn't deploy and that allows you to
practice<00:04:53.849> and<00:04:54.270> see<00:04:54.360> how<00:04:54.449> there<00:04:54.629> is<00:04:54.750> going<00:04:54.870> to
