your leg you want to bring it all off so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
your leg you want to bring it all off so
you're<00:01:31.460> mobilizing<00:01:32.460> those<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.780> nerve

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
you're mobilizing those that nerve

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
you're mobilizing those that nerve
through<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> soft<00:01:35.189> tissues<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.210> mean

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
through the soft tissues and but I mean

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
through the soft tissues and but I mean
so<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> pretty<00:01:37.200> pretty<00:01:37.409> general<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so I have a pretty pretty general it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
so I have a pretty pretty general it

so that whole immune system mobilizing

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
so that whole immune system mobilizing
it<00:01:42.659> through<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.229> life<00:01:43.470> 30<00:01:43.770> times<00:01:44.159> in

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
you're going to start mobilizing so you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.169 
you're going to start mobilizing so you
can<00:02:07.409> sit<00:02:07.649> there

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640 
their ankle dorsiflexion and plantar
fascia<00:02:14.120> that's<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.689> really<00:02:15.110> good<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.349> to<00:02:15.409> work

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
fascia that's a really good one to work

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.330 
fascia that's a really good one to work
on<00:02:15.829> again<00:02:16.189> 30<00:02:16.819> times<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.200> set<00:02:18.530> or<00:02:18.890> something

on again 30 times and a set or something

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.089 
on again 30 times and a set or something
now<00:02:20.120> that's<00:02:20.959> just<00:02:21.230> sort<00:02:21.439> of<00:02:21.470> initial<00:02:21.860> part

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
now that's just sort of initial part

now that's just sort of initial part
that's<00:02:22.280> what<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.489> started<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.390> get<00:02:23.569> away<00:02:23.689> once

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
that's what I started to get away once

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.960 
that's what I started to get away once
you've<00:02:24.260> loosened<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:25.040> little<00:02:25.370> bit<00:02:25.459> then<00:02:25.939> you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
you've loosened that little bit then you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.399 
you've loosened that little bit then you
can<00:02:26.209> add<00:02:26.329> on<00:02:26.359> some<00:02:26.629> moment<00:02:26.930> push<00:02:27.109> with<00:02:27.319> the

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
can add on some moment push with the

balance you can use a towel that's just

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.059 
balance you can use a towel that's just
not<00:02:44.269> as<00:02:44.359> effective<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.109> up<00:02:45.799> into<00:02:46.010> this

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
not as effective so up into this

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.369 
not as effective so up into this
position<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.700> here<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.450> can<00:02:47.840> sort<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.049> really

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
position and here I can sort of really

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.379 
position and here I can sort of really
hold<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.889> here<00:02:49.099> and<00:02:49.340> with<00:02:49.609> a<00:02:49.700> baby<00:02:49.879> pressure<00:02:50.239> to

hold on here and with a baby pressure to

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.599 
hold on here and with a baby pressure to
so<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:51.109> first<00:02:51.139> point<00:02:51.620> again<00:02:52.040> what<00:02:52.340> I'm<00:02:52.430> going

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
to try and do now is keep that if I can

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.740 
to try and do now is keep that if I can
come<00:02:57.200> around<00:02:57.290> here

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.830 
really work on that band using the quads
there<00:03:12.859> and<00:03:13.639> I<00:03:13.699> came<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:13.970> straight<00:03:14.419> line<00:03:14.660> neat

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
there and I came the straight line neat

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.800 
there and I came the straight line neat
helps<00:03:15.790> relax<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.060> antagonist<00:03:17.629> of<00:03:17.750> the
