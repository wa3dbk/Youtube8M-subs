00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.380
 Hello everyone, today I would like to do 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.380
 small overview on the geyser coffee maker 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:19.789
 everyone is used to making coffee in the Turks either 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:23.539
 sublimated here just recently found out 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.580
 there are no geyser coffee makers not 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.230
 society you have known for a long time but in 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.340
 Russia as it is very represented 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:36.079
 she looks so very stylish 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.600
 brilliant here it cost only 1200 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.739
 rubles 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:55.250
 it works like this 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:01:01.629
 open the key twist here 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:04.899
 such a bottom before the water is poured 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.899
 the amount we need 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:15.229
 here is such a lattice 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.330
 before the ground coffee stands up is very important 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.400
 make coffee a recommendation 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.080
 coffee maker to be more 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.670
 coarse grinding and what through these 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.189
 holes will fall through and spoil 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.340
 coffee 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.340
 learn from 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.520
 there is such a valve just in case 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.070
 there is something to clog and to have a coffee maker 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.740
 not exploded not exploded and very 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:01.370
 more pressure he will be from here 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.310
 blow off steam and actually we put on 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:10.490
 the fire 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:12.200
 turn on now heat up and we'll see 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.800
 how will it work minutes itself 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.520
 starts working the first time I even 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.180
 scared because she publishes such 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.180
 scary sounds 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.230
 begins 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.940
 watch 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.360
 so hard to see here is part of the coffee already 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.360
 got up not so good 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:35.810
 actually how it works when heated 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.650
 water it rocks 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.200
 steam expands and passing through coffee under 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:52.400
 pressure rises this top 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:04:01.450
 cup capacity the whole floor we wanted to swim 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:07.370
 and it turns out such pure coffee without oil cake 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:10.959
 that's all coffee ready what dignity that 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.950
 Here is a pure coffee without cake 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:19.959
 It turns out and I repeat once again and there 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:23.150
 stylish looking beautiful 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.270
 what a drawback she is here 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.770
 heats up and so here and then 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.650
 open clean need to wait bye 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.800
 cool all rinse thoroughly and to 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.910
 reassemble need to dry it all 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.729
 because otherwise there will be just 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:49.150
 musty water is rotten then drink coffee in 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:51.890
 Generally, I use such a box 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.880
 I hope there are more geysers 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.330
 small there are bigger ones so 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.900
 past the day someone will be helpful to everyone 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.900
 until
