00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.540 

I<00:00:14.480> think<00:00:15.480> every<00:00:15.690> every<00:00:16.230> victory<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I think every every victory have is is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.670 
I think every every victory have is is
right<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:19.050> because<00:00:19.170> there's<00:00:19.470> always<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
right I think because there's always a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.040 
right I think because there's always a
journey<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.210> victory<00:00:21.570> there's<00:00:21.750> always<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
journey to that victory there's always a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.740 
journey to that victory there's always a
build-up<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.710> always<00:00:22.980> unexpected<00:00:23.750> obstacles

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
build-up as always unexpected obstacles

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.720 
build-up as always unexpected obstacles
when<00:00:24.930> you're<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.350> way<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.670> think

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
when you're on the way to it and I think

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.519 
when you're on the way to it and I think
for<00:00:26.970> us<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.269> Germany<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.260> had<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> great

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
for us in Germany we we had a great

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.410 
for us in Germany we we had a great
qualifying<00:00:28.920> session<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:30.029> practice

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
qualifying session which from practice

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.880 
qualifying session which from practice
we<00:00:30.599> didn't<00:00:30.810> expect<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.650> know<00:00:31.769> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
we didn't expect to be we know in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
we didn't expect to be we know in
practice<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.399> were<00:00:32.489> six<00:00:32.730> tenths<00:00:32.940> off<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.870> we

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
practice we were six tenths off when we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.170 
practice we were six tenths off when we
don't<00:00:34.440> understand<00:00:34.860> why<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:35.969> sudden

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
don't understand why and then all sudden

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.170 
don't understand why and then all sudden
qualifying<00:00:36.809> when<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.050> went<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> low<00:00:37.500> fuel<00:00:37.739> will

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
qualifying when we went to low fuel will

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.920 
qualifying when we went to low fuel will
competitively<00:00:39.180> right<00:00:39.390> there<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:39.840> we

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
competitively right there and then we

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.470 
competitively right there and then we
had<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> race<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.649> had<00:00:41.090> some<00:00:42.090> new<00:00:42.270> bits

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
had the race and we had some new bits

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360 
had the race and we had some new bits
that<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.559> didn't<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.890> whether<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.309> were

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that we didn't know whether they were

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
that we didn't know whether they were
going<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> last<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.270> we've<00:00:45.480> pushed<00:00:45.989> as

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
going to last you know we've pushed as

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.799 
going to last you know we've pushed as
hard<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.100> them<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
hard as we can to get them there and

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.000 
hard as we can to get them there and
then<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.110> know<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.410> sort<00:00:49.590> through<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.890> whole

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
then you know we sort through the whole

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.880 
then you know we sort through the whole
race<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.399> did<00:00:50.550> great<00:00:50.940> pit<00:00:51.180> stops<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.739> was

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
race we did great pit stops we it was

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:02.780 
race we did great pit stops we it was
pretty<00:00:53.250> awesome

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.660 

every<00:01:03.720> upgrade<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.290> versus<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.370> result

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
every upgrade you have versus the result

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.550 
every upgrade you have versus the result
but<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.240> us<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:07.200> only<00:01:07.320> had<00:01:07.530> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
but I think for us we we only had a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.930 
but I think for us we we only had a
couple<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.950> small<00:01:08.250> operates<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> we're

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
couple of small operates and we're

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.450 
couple of small operates and we're
looking<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.360> big<00:01:09.600> chunks<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.230> moment<00:01:10.530> we

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
looking for big chunks at the moment we

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.890 
looking for big chunks at the moment we
thought<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.850> were<00:01:11.910> looking<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.180> big<00:01:12.600> chunks

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
thought we were looking for big chunks

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.480 
thought we were looking for big chunks
and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.920> looking<00:01:14.220> for

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and I think we are really looking for

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.250 
and I think we are really looking for
big<00:01:14.970> steps<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.570> had<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:15.720> couple<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.110> very

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
big steps but we had a couple of very

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.770 
big steps but we had a couple of very
very<00:01:16.320> small<00:01:16.680> things<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> came<00:01:17.570> which<00:01:18.570> were

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
very small things that came which were

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.240 
very small things that came which were
positive<00:01:19.170> steps<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> direction<00:01:19.560> right

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
positive steps in the direction right

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
positive steps in the direction right
direction<00:01:20.550> but<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:21.330> enough<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:23.400> were

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
direction but not enough but there were

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.380 
direction but not enough but there were
enough<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.150> us<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.590> topple<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.390> competitors

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
enough for us to topple the competitors

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.110 
enough for us to topple the competitors
for<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:28.080> weekend<00:01:28.440> but<00:01:28.670> also<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
for that weekend but also I think the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:41.370 
for that weekend but also I think the
conditions<00:01:30.570> played<00:01:30.900> into<00:01:31.110> our<00:01:31.229> hands<00:01:31.410> as<00:01:31.530> well

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.230 

this<00:01:42.380> is<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.620> it<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.400> a<00:01:43.430> very<00:01:43.670> good<00:01:43.730> foot<00:01:44.060> stuck

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
this is a it is a very good foot stuck

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.060 
this is a it is a very good foot stuck
into<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.810> make<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.380> constantly<00:01:45.890> you're

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
into it make it is constantly you're

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.440 
into it make it is constantly you're
constantly<00:01:46.370> turning<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.940> don't<00:01:47.090> really<00:01:47.240> have

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
constantly turning you don't really have

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.390 
constantly turning you don't really have
many<00:01:47.630> straights<00:01:47.960> between<00:01:48.260> each<00:01:48.410> corner<00:01:48.650> to

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
many straights between each corner to

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.220 
many straights between each corner to
get<00:01:49.520> up<00:01:49.700> behind<00:01:49.940> someone<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:50.930> a

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
get up behind someone and so it's a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.990 
get up behind someone and so it's a
little<00:01:51.530> more<00:01:51.770> much<00:01:52.010> more<00:01:52.250> like<00:01:52.460> Monaco<00:01:52.850> in

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
little more much more like Monaco in

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.450 
little more much more like Monaco in
that<00:01:53.120> sense<00:01:53.360> but<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.170> think<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.980> is<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.190> track

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
that sense but I think this is a track

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.320 
that sense but I think this is a track
where<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.730> need<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:55.940> be<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.120> pole<00:01:56.300> position

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
where you need to be in pole position

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.170 
where you need to be in pole position
and<00:01:57.080> needs<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.380> disappear<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.730> we<00:01:59.000> haven't

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
and needs to disappear and so we haven't

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.990 
and needs to disappear and so we haven't
had<00:01:59.480> a<00:01:59.510> pole<00:01:59.780> position<00:02:00.230> this<00:02:00.320> year<00:02:00.640> so<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.670> you

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
had a pole position this year so I you

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.180 
had a pole position this year so I you
know<00:02:02.060> my<00:02:02.720> name<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:03.470> weekend<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.040> get<00:02:04.160> our

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
know my name this weekend is to get our

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:14.460 
know my name this weekend is to get our
first<00:02:04.430> fall

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.130 

I<00:02:14.620> think<00:02:15.370> there's<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:15.970> definitely<00:02:16.690> circuit

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
I think there's this definitely circuit

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.760 
I think there's this definitely circuit
stepped<00:02:17.470> on<00:02:17.830> your<00:02:18.730> driving<00:02:19.000> style<00:02:19.240> soups<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
stepped on your driving style soups the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.070 
stepped on your driving style soups the
the<00:02:21.160> circuit<00:02:21.580> perhaps<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.630> little<00:02:22.750> bit<00:02:22.960> more

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
the circuit perhaps a little bit more

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.770 
the circuit perhaps a little bit more
than<00:02:23.140> others<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.450> honest<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:25.720> think

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
than others and to be honest I think

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.960 
than others and to be honest I think
it's<00:02:26.020> really<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.560> lot<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> car<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.820> know

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
it's really a lot to do a car you know

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.330 
it's really a lot to do a car you know
if<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.530> aero<00:02:29.680> package<00:02:29.920> that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
if you have a good aero package that

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.310 
if you have a good aero package that
works<00:02:30.520> well<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:30.940> high<00:02:31.120> speed<00:02:31.390> circuits<00:02:31.570> and

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
works well in high speed circuits and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.860 
works well in high speed circuits and
high<00:02:32.590> high<00:02:33.100> speed<00:02:33.310> corners<00:02:33.430> it's<00:02:34.390> good<00:02:34.630> if<00:02:34.780> you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
high high speed corners it's good if you

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.830 
high high speed corners it's good if you
have<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.440> car<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.430> works<00:02:36.730> better<00:02:37.030> on<00:02:37.270> places

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
have a car that works better on places

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.680 
have a car that works better on places
like<00:02:37.870> Monaco<00:02:38.350> just<00:02:39.310> high<00:02:39.430> downforce<00:02:39.670> but<00:02:40.180> not

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
like Monaco just high downforce but not

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.440 
like Monaco just high downforce but not
so<00:02:40.870> high<00:02:41.080> speed<00:02:41.320> corners<00:02:42.000> bumpy<00:02:43.000> circuits

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
so high speed corners bumpy circuits

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.380 
so high speed corners bumpy circuits
then<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.920> can<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.160> faster<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.670> mean<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.360> look

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
then you can go faster I mean you look

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.380 
then you can go faster I mean you look
at<00:02:46.690> for<00:02:47.620> us<00:02:47.650> over<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.070> years<00:02:48.100> we've<00:02:49.090> generally

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
at for us over the years we've generally

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.970 
at for us over the years we've generally
been<00:02:49.540> quite<00:02:49.750> good<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:49.990> places<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.500> Monaco

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
been quite good on places like Monaco

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.820 
been quite good on places like Monaco
and<00:02:51.250> Hungary<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.510> slow<00:02:52.690> speed<00:02:52.750> corners<00:02:53.290> when

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
and Hungary the slow speed corners when

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.110 
and Hungary the slow speed corners when
you<00:02:53.890> get<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.130> silver<00:02:54.430> certain<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.790> we've<00:02:54.970> not

you get to silver certain that we've not

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.030 
you get to silver certain that we've not
read<00:02:55.330> generally<00:02:55.660> been<00:02:55.840> too<00:02:56.440> quick<00:02:56.620> on<00:02:56.680> on

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
read generally been too quick on on

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.199 
read generally been too quick on on
circuits<00:02:57.459> like<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.760> which<00:02:57.940> are<00:02:58.060> high

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
circuits like that which are high

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.420 
circuits like that which are high
downforce<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:59.440> at<00:02:59.860> high<00:03:00.040> speed

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
downforce in at high speed

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:10.020 
downforce in at high speed
you

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.020 

when<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> first<00:03:11.020> started<00:03:11.170> testing<00:03:11.819> with<00:03:12.819> much

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
when I first started testing with much

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.390 
when I first started testing with much
grippier<00:03:13.390> tires<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:14.020> was<00:03:14.170> tougher<00:03:14.980> than<00:03:15.010> and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
grippier tires it was tougher than and

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.210 
grippier tires it was tougher than and
much<00:03:16.240> more<00:03:16.450> downforce<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:17.170> was<00:03:17.319> you<00:03:17.860> know<00:03:17.980> it

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
much more downforce it was you know it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.990 
much more downforce it was you know it
was<00:03:18.250> tougher<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.900> was<00:03:20.260> erased

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
was tougher and so I was erased

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.270 
was tougher and so I was erased
2007-2008<00:03:22.000> was<00:03:22.270> in<00:03:22.390> that<00:03:22.540> similar<00:03:23.290> bracket

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
2007-2008 was in that similar bracket

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.770 
2007-2008 was in that similar bracket
and<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.580> has<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:24.819> of<00:03:24.940> got<00:03:25.120> less<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:25.510> less<00:03:25.600> and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
and it has kind of got less and less and

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.620 
and it has kind of got less and less and
less<00:03:25.900> since<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:26.950> but<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.520> still<00:03:27.819> but<00:03:28.390> also

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
less since then but it is still but also

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.750 
less since then but it is still but also
your<00:03:28.870> body<00:03:29.050> gets<00:03:29.350> used<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.620> it<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.610> every<00:03:30.730> time

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
your body gets used to it so every time

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.250 
your body gets used to it so every time
you<00:03:30.940> build<00:03:31.180> your<00:03:31.330> body<00:03:31.510> up<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.900> prepare<00:03:32.230> for

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
you build your body up to prepare for

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.430 
you build your body up to prepare for
those<00:03:32.560> conditions<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.720> then<00:03:34.840> your<00:03:35.050> your

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
those conditions and and then your your

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.930 
those conditions and and then your your
fitness<00:03:35.890> drops<00:03:36.220> off<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> little<00:03:36.580> bit<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:36.850> the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
fitness drops off a little bit in the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.059 
fitness drops off a little bit in the
year<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.270> then<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:38.230> next<00:03:38.380> winter<00:03:38.709> you<00:03:38.860> build

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
year but then the next winter you build

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.380 
year but then the next winter you build
your<00:03:39.190> body<00:03:39.370> up<00:03:39.489> again<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.060> get<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> little

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
your body up again so you get a little

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.210 
your body up again so you get a little
bit<00:03:40.510> fitter<00:03:40.690> again<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:41.860> every<00:03:42.040> time<00:03:42.070> you

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
bit fitter again and so every time you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.060 
bit fitter again and so every time you
just<00:03:42.459> get<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.610> pit<00:03:42.820> in<00:03:42.850> phila<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.630> may<00:03:44.560> now<00:03:44.769> say

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
just get a pit in phila so I may now say

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.430 
just get a pit in phila so I may now say
it<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.430> feels<00:03:45.700> easier<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:46.840> might<00:03:47.140> just<00:03:47.290> be

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
it it feels easier but I might just be

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:56.699 
it it feels easier but I might just be
fitted

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.679 

tire<00:03:57.709> degradation<00:03:57.829> in<00:03:58.459> Hungary<00:03:58.909> is<00:03:59.120> always<00:03:59.569> an

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
tire degradation in Hungary is always an

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.360 
tire degradation in Hungary is always an
issue<00:03:59.750> generally<00:04:00.530> because<00:04:00.920> it's<00:04:01.040> so<00:04:01.159> hot

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
issue generally because it's so hot

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.369 
issue generally because it's so hot

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
there subtractive track temperatures

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.860 
there subtractive track temperatures
like<00:04:03.700> 40-45<00:04:04.700> degrees<00:04:04.970> or<00:04:05.420> something<00:04:05.659> silly

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
like 40-45 degrees or something silly

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.789 
like 40-45 degrees or something silly
and<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:07.659> there's<00:04:08.659> not<00:04:08.900> that<00:04:08.930> many<00:04:09.439> stripes

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
and and there's not that many stripes

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.530 
and and there's not that many stripes
for<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.069> tires<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.640> cool<00:04:10.849> down<00:04:10.879> you<00:04:11.299> always

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
for the tires to cool down you always

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.750 
for the tires to cool down you always
quite<00:04:12.470> heavy<00:04:12.650> load<00:04:12.859> to<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.400> plus<00:04:13.579> you<00:04:13.670> look

quite heavy load to and plus you look

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.620 
quite heavy load to and plus you look
quite<00:04:13.909> high<00:04:14.090> breaking<00:04:14.650> areas<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:17.000> the

quite high breaking areas so and the

quite<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.759> small<00:04:19.930> circuit<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:22.430> because

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
quite a small circuit so and because

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.070 
quite a small circuit so and because
it's<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.000> bumpy<00:04:23.210> also<00:04:23.600> going<00:04:23.780> through<00:04:23.990> those

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
it's so bumpy also going through those

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.320 
it's so bumpy also going through those
corners<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:24.850> generate<00:04:25.850> quite<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> lot<00:04:26.210> of

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
corners you generate quite a lot of

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.140 
corners you generate quite a lot of
energy<00:04:26.930> in<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.320> tires<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.340> we're<00:04:28.850> kind<00:04:29.090> of

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
energy in the tires so we're kind of

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.909 
energy in the tires so we're kind of
currently<00:04:29.600> working<00:04:29.780> on<00:04:29.960> trying<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.289> adapt<00:04:30.830> the

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
currently working on trying to adapt the

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.500 
currently working on trying to adapt the
setup<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.430> also<00:04:31.699> are<00:04:31.850> calling<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.360> make<00:04:32.449> sure

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
setup and also are calling to make sure

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:43.740 
setup and also are calling to make sure
that<00:04:32.810> we<00:04:32.900> can<00:04:32.990> call<00:04:33.139> our<00:04:33.199> ties

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.810
