00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
at the bottom of the stomach there's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930 
at the bottom of the stomach there's
five<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> other<00:00:37.260> pieces<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.670> skip

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
five the other pieces so you can skip

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.760 
five the other pieces so you can skip
the<00:00:39.059> side<00:00:39.239> pieces<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.170> go<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> next

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the side pieces and then go to the next

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.799 
the side pieces and then go to the next
piece<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.430> insert<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> legs<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.600> there

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
piece in and insert the legs in there

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
piece in and insert the legs in there
but<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.489> close

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
but if you do that they look so close

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
but if you do that they look so close
together<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> looks<00:00:45.899> ok<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
together if it looks ok like that you

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.799 
together if it looks ok like that you
can<00:00:46.920> leave<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.210> me<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> put

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
can leave it like that but for me I put

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.690 
can leave it like that but for me I put
one<00:00:49.020> point<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> piece<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
one point in this piece and then the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.130 
one point in this piece and then the
other<00:00:50.879> point<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> piece<00:00:51.629> diagonally

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
other point and the piece diagonally

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.529 
other point and the piece diagonally
above<00:00:52.260> er<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> point<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.730> there<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
above er so this point in there in the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
above er so this point in there in the
left<00:00:54.750> point<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.320> piece<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> makes

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
left point in that piece so this makes

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.049 
left point in that piece so this makes
the<00:01:00.449> leaks<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:02.059> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the leaks go out just a little bit so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.609 
the leaks go out just a little bit so
that<00:01:03.090> they're<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.510> too<00:01:03.719> close<00:01:03.960> together<00:01:06.619> and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that they're not too close together and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.260 
that they're not too close together and
then<00:01:07.740> put<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> tail<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> back<00:01:09.090> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
then put the tail go to the back and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
then put the tail go to the back and
then<00:01:09.510> count<00:01:09.750> four<00:01:09.960> green<00:01:10.170> pieces<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
then count four green pieces at the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
then count four green pieces at the
bottom<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> shell<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:12.420> two<00:01:12.750> three

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
bottom of the shell so one two three

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.330 
bottom of the shell so one two three
four<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.710> insert<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> tail<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.670> piece

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
four and insert the tail in that piece

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.249 
four and insert the tail in that piece
and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> chicas<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:19.080> up

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and then with the chicas go up

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200 
and then with the chicas go up
diagonally<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> glue<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> bead<00:01:20.759> eyes<00:01:20.970> in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
diagonally and glue the bead eyes in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
diagonally and glue the bead eyes in
there<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.680> black

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
there if you want you can use black

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
there if you want you can use black
pieces<00:01:23.130> instead<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.729> beads<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> eyes<00:01:24.869> are

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
pieces instead of beads so the eyes are

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.179 
pieces instead of beads so the eyes are
going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> go<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.799> I'm<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
going to go in here so I'm going to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.450 
going to go in here so I'm going to
remove<00:01:26.400> these<00:01:26.670> pieces<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.189> two<00:01:29.250> black

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
remove these pieces and so two black

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.569 
remove these pieces and so two black
piece<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:31.710> doesn't<00:01:32.009> slot<00:01:32.189> over<00:01:32.460> any

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
piece in there it doesn't slot over any

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.890 
piece in there it doesn't slot over any
points<00:01:35.030> they've<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.210> put<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> green<00:01:36.659> pieces

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
points they've just put the green pieces

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.679 
points they've just put the green pieces
back<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:37.979> four<00:01:38.280> points<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.450> black

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
back on of all four points so one black

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
back on of all four points so one black
point<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.170> one<00:01:40.409> green<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.100> one

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
point and one green point going one

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.310 
point and one green point going one
pocket

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.120 

so<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.410> can<00:01:48.530> make<00:01:48.680> these<00:01:48.830> in<00:01:49.010> different

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130

so you can make these in different
colors<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:50.120> can<00:01:50.180> change<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.690> color<00:01:50.870> of<00:01:51.020> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
colors you can change the color of the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.260 
colors you can change the color of the
shells<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.530> make<00:01:51.560> couples<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.640> like<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.850> boy<00:01:53.090> and
