00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
let's see we have what is this this

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140 
let's see we have what is this this
appears<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.830> think<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> pouch

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
appears to be I think some kind of pouch

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.109 
appears to be I think some kind of pouch
maybe<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.320> cover<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> screen<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
maybe it's a cover for the screen like a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.280 
maybe it's a cover for the screen like a
dust<00:01:21.390> cover<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.960> back<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.159> later<00:01:24.110> we<00:01:25.110> got

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
dust cover all back to that later we got

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
dust cover all back to that later we got
the<00:01:25.680> stand<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.740> pretty<00:01:29.369> hefty<00:01:29.759> stand

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the stand it's a pretty hefty stand

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.240 
the stand it's a pretty hefty stand
feels<00:01:31.049> relatively<00:01:31.560> solid

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:44.110 

and<00:01:34.370> then<00:01:35.150> here<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:37.270> note<00:01:40.900> B<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:42.410> guess<00:01:43.120> arm

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
and then here is the note B I guess arm

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.690 
and then here is the note B I guess arm
part<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.200> stand<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.100> monitor<00:01:46.520> would

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
part of the stand that the monitor would

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.900 
part of the stand that the monitor would
attach<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.510> this<00:01:47.960> also<00:01:48.260> feels<00:01:48.680> very<00:01:49.040> hefty

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
attach to and this also feels very hefty

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
attach to and this also feels very hefty
it's<00:01:50.590> definitely<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:52.210> decent<00:01:53.210> build<00:01:53.660> quality

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
it's definitely a decent build quality

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.950 
it's definitely a decent build quality
and<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:55.729> under<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.780> whole<00:01:57.770> lot<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.040> styrofoam

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
and then under a whole lot of styrofoam

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:08.520 
and then under a whole lot of styrofoam
we<00:01:59.960> have<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.560> actual<00:02:01.490> panel<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:04.360> if<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.390> out

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:24.490 

let<00:02:09.530> me<00:02:09.619> make<00:02:09.739> some<00:02:09.950> room<00:02:10.009> for<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:23.260> no<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
let me make some room for this no the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.040 
let me make some room for this no the
panel<00:02:25.190> is<00:02:25.370> actually<00:02:25.880> surprisingly<00:02:26.090> light

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
panel is actually surprisingly light

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.660 
panel is actually surprisingly light
given<00:02:27.500> its<00:02:27.620> size

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.540 

yeah<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.840> would<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.440> be<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.650> panel<00:02:37.099> which

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
yeah that would just be the panel which

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.820 
yeah that would just be the panel which
I<00:02:37.940> can't<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:39.020> get<00:02:39.260> out<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> phone

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
right now so that's about it for the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.960 
right now so that's about it for the
contents<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.690> box<00:02:44.930> as<00:02:45.520> mainly<00:02:46.520> curious

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
is kind of hard to figure out online so

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260 
is kind of hard to figure out online so
now<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.500> guys<00:02:54.920> would<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.790> always<00:02:56.000> know<00:02:56.239> that

then the dual link DVI um if you wanted
to<00:03:05.030> know<00:03:05.739> what<00:03:06.739> exactly<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.459> guy<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:12.010> can

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
to know what exactly this guy is I can

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.979 
to know what exactly this guy is I can
never<00:03:13.160> get<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.519> out<00:03:13.700> with<00:03:13.940> single<00:03:14.810> hand<00:03:18.910> swans

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.729 

okay<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:26.350> would<00:03:27.350> be<00:03:29.019> yeah<00:03:30.019> i<00:03:30.049> think<00:03:30.350> my

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
okay so that would be yeah i think my

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.870 
okay so that would be yeah i think my
original<00:03:31.250> guess<00:03:31.640> was<00:03:31.880> correct<00:03:33.160> yeah<00:03:36.069> so<00:03:37.069> this

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
original guess was correct yeah so this

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.670 
original guess was correct yeah so this
is<00:03:38.000> just<00:03:38.120> kind<00:03:38.420> of<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:39.579> thin<00:03:40.579> i<00:03:41.060> guess<00:03:41.680> nylon

think you can kind of poke the top of
this<00:03:58.370> guy<00:03:58.700> through<00:03:59.090> so<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:01.670> can<00:04:01.790> see<00:04:02.060> there

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750

you can most likely poke the handle
through<00:04:10.040> there<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.609> then<00:04:11.390> carry<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.900> with

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
through there and then carry it with
