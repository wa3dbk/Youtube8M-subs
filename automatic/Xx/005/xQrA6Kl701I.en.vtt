00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 you already know our collaboration is 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.609
 essential for this type of 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.170
 projects can be carried forward and I 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.690
 I would take advantage so that this also 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.790
 a tribute to all those scientists to 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.469
 all those teachers to all those 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 teachers who have given their lives so that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.770
 we live better have dedicated their 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.750
 although existence for example 50 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.430
 hundred of us today we do not have to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.430
 come here with two crutches because we 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.650
 they vaccinated from polio and they know that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.599
 we are happier and that's why 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.399
 we are here to continue that race 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.140
 as you know the situation of the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.329
 research in this country is a 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 authentic disaster and all our 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.010
 scientists have had to go outside to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 investigate but I wanted to highlight another 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 question and that is that I come from a world 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 because I 'm probably already the oldest 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.780
 of all this sports palace and I'm 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.090
 very proud that he had come to be 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.789
 in this state of health thank you 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.430
 precisely to that I come from a world 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.460
 alive where all the discoveries 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 scientists the next day was a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.030
 World Heritage Site and currently 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.159
 all that work is being bought by some 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.850
 vultures that speculate with the lives of 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.850
 citizens 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.940
 well the empire went out and when you talk about 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.430
 these things he says is not collaboration 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.960
 of the public with the private and we 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.660
 they want the right to recover the investment 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.090
 but now we are seeing as cases 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.280
 as for example of hepatitis c that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.050
 and it has multiplied many times 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.600
 the money they invested are 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.360
 proposing to sell the treatment 60 thousand 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.850
 euros per person and there are people who are 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.280
 dying in this country every day 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 because they have no money to pay 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.200
 to put an end to that once 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.659
 forever 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.670
 because it is enough misfortune already 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.280
 they get diseases like this that today 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.640
 are interested in research if it arrives 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.710
 some positive point will be for all 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.090
 we benefit from it because if it is 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.000
 a misfortune to have this kind of 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.010
 disease is much more misfortune is still 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.530
 know there is a remedy and there are 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.960
 someone a fellow of yours who suffers 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.670
 since you know that he says goodbye to you and you 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.350
 He says sorry I have money thinking 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.060
 you die 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.060
 that's bullshit 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.680
 87 and tell you do not speculate with the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.330
 life of a thousand citizens 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.850
 it's good to talk about terrorism and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.700
 of demagoguery this is causing more 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.600
 deaths that terrorism jihadism and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.600
 we are getting 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.409
 yes 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.550
 the already mythical group not only for the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.980
 cities works but because in their subjects 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.620
 they are in the collective unconscious of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.660
 all Spaniards and the name dear 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.640
 Friends of the group represents 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.350
 perfectly the state of science in 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.350
 this sinister country
