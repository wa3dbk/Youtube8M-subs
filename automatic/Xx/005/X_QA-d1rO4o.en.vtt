always make sure that the slot is below

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
always make sure that the slot is below
the<00:01:08.280> surface<00:01:08.700> level<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.390> otherwise<00:01:09.659> if

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the surface level because otherwise if

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.420 
the surface level because otherwise if
you<00:01:10.080> put<00:01:10.260> pressure<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> slot<00:01:11.159> from<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you put pressure on the slot from the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
you put pressure on the slot from the
screwdriver<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.570> half<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> slot

normally<00:01:13.740> breaks<00:01:14.010> off<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> end<00:01:15.150> up

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
normally breaks off and then you end up

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
normally breaks off and then you end up
with<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> broken<00:01:15.720> grub<00:01:16.110> screw<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.920> may<00:01:17.070> be

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
with a broken grub screw and it may be

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
with a broken grub screw and it may be
difficult<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:18.990> sure

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
difficult to get it out so make sure

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.380 
difficult to get it out so make sure
that<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> grub<00:01:19.590> screw<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.310> definitely<00:01:20.939> below

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that the grub screw is definitely below

of the slot this is a Stuart Turner
James<00:01:28.619> Cole's<00:01:28.950> engine<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> very

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
James Cole's engine and it's a very

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.819 
James Cole's engine and it's a very
weird<00:01:30.360> engine<00:01:30.810> really<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> cross<00:01:31.590> head

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
weird engine really with the cross head

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
weird engine really with the cross head
above<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> cylinder<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.150> very

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
above the cylinder and a very

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
above the cylinder and a very
complicated<00:01:33.689> linkage<00:01:34.380> from<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> eccentric

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
complicated linkage from the eccentric

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.609 
complicated linkage from the eccentric
to<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> valve<00:01:35.820> chest<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:37.140> problem<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
to the valve chest and one problem that

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.319 
to the valve chest and one problem that
I've<00:01:37.770> had<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.250> engine<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I've had with this engine is that the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.270 
I've had with this engine is that the
eccentric<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.079> still<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.590> tight<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
eccentric is still a little tight and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
eccentric is still a little tight and
this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> causing<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.450> valve<00:01:42.689> links<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> kick

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
this is causing the valve links to kick

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
this is causing the valve links to kick
a<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.399> make<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> slight<00:01:45.000> noise

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
a little bit and make a slight noise

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.120 
a little bit and make a slight noise
after<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.200> while<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.100> disappear

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
after a while this will disappear

after a while this will disappear
as<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> mentioned<00:01:50.579> early<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.780> purpose<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
as I mentioned early on the purpose of

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.200 
as I mentioned early on the purpose of
running<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.490> smooth<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.030> surface

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.270 
running in is to smooth out the surface
of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> metal<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.860> look<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of the metal if you look at this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.249 
of the metal if you look at this

you'll<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.399> awfully<00:01:59.850> rough<00:02:00.000> under

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you'll see that it's awfully rough under

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.690 
you'll see that it's awfully rough under
the<00:02:00.360> microscope<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.920> looks<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> lot<00:02:02.549> of

quite tight after a while the black oil

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.199 
quite tight after a while the black oil
disappeared<00:03:04.280> looking<00:03:05.280> at<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> exhaust<00:03:05.850> pipe

disappeared looking at the exhaust pipe

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.569 
disappeared looking at the exhaust pipe
you<00:03:06.959> will<00:03:07.140> see<00:03:07.380> black<00:03:07.680> oil<00:03:07.920> coming<00:03:08.250> out<00:03:08.370> of

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
you will see black oil coming out of

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.509 
you will see black oil coming out of
there<00:03:08.760> too<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.690> should<00:03:09.900> happen<00:03:10.079> for<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> while

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
there too this should happen for a while

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.770 
there too this should happen for a while
particularly<00:03:11.519> as<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.940> piston<00:03:12.329> does<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.510> lot<00:03:12.720> of

particularly as the piston does a lot of

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.740 
particularly as the piston does a lot of
work<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.440> wears<00:03:14.100> itself<00:03:14.459> into<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.910> bar<00:03:15.120> if

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
work and wears itself into the bar if

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.509 
work and wears itself into the bar if
your<00:03:15.989> steam<00:03:16.260> engine<00:03:16.620> has<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.829> piston<00:03:17.310> that's

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.390 
like this a better run at the scale type
speed<00:03:39.239> more<00:03:39.959> like<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.319> see<00:03:40.530> here<00:03:40.739> nice<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
speed more like you see here nice and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
although sometimes it is good fun to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.520 
although sometimes it is good fun to
open<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.579> regulator<00:03:45.030> wide<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:46.049> once<00:03:46.350> the

open the regulator wide and once the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
an engine of this type going like this

when<00:04:01.530> I've<00:04:01.650> finished<00:04:01.800> rebuilding<00:04:02.490> an<00:04:02.580> engine

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
when I've finished rebuilding an engine

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.330 
when I've finished rebuilding an engine
I<00:04:03.240> run<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:03.870> warp<00:04:04.110> speed<00:04:04.290> for<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.710> few<00:04:04.950> seconds

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
I run it at warp speed for a few seconds

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.790 
I run it at warp speed for a few seconds
like<00:04:05.520> this<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.480> don't<00:04:06.810> recommend<00:04:07.140> this<00:04:07.470> but

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
like this and I don't recommend this but

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.920 
like this and I don't recommend this but
to<00:04:08.250> just<00:04:08.460> show<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.420> engine<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.780> in

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
to just show you that the engine is in

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.200 
to just show you that the engine is in
good<00:04:10.110> order<00:04:10.290> if<00:04:10.860> anything<00:04:11.280> was<00:04:11.460> wrong<00:04:11.760> it

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
good order if anything was wrong it

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.270 
good order if anything was wrong it
would<00:04:12.360> really<00:04:12.570> show<00:04:12.870> up<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.290> speed<00:04:13.620> but

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
would really show up of the speed but

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.620 
would really show up of the speed but
don't<00:04:14.550> do<00:04:14.730> this<00:04:14.760> for<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.180> prolonged<00:04:15.540> period

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
don't do this for a prolonged period

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.720 
don't do this for a prolonged period
because<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> oil<00:04:16.650> will<00:04:16.769> be<00:04:17.070> spun<00:04:17.370> off<00:04:17.519> by

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
because the oil will be spun off by

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.030 
because the oil will be spun off by
centrifugal<00:04:18.480> force<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:19.320> you<00:04:19.590> end<00:04:19.769> up<00:04:19.890> with

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
centrifugal force and you end up with

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.410 
centrifugal force and you end up with
dry<00:04:20.280> bearings<00:04:20.760> very<00:04:20.850> quickly<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:23.180> quick<00:04:24.180> word

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
dry bearings very quickly a quick word

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.410 
dry bearings very quickly a quick word
about<00:04:24.630> oil<00:04:25.020> additives<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.800> few<00:04:26.700> years<00:04:26.940> ago<00:04:27.090> I

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
about oil additives a few years ago I

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.450 
about oil additives a few years ago I
was<00:04:27.840> working<00:04:28.200> at<00:04:28.350> an<00:04:28.470> oil<00:04:28.560> refinery<00:04:28.890> in

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
was working at an oil refinery in

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.400 
was working at an oil refinery in
Glasgow<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.630> was<00:04:30.750> speaking<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.230> a

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
Glasgow and I was speaking to a

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.530 
Glasgow and I was speaking to a
laboratory<00:04:31.710> man<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:32.970> was<00:04:33.060> asking<00:04:33.420> him

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
laboratory man and I was asking him

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.350 
laboratory man and I was asking him
which<00:04:34.140> is<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.500> best<00:04:34.680> oil<00:04:35.010> additive<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:36.030> he

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
which is the best oil additive and he

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.950 
which is the best oil additive and he
said<00:04:36.630> by<00:04:37.080> far<00:04:37.440> without<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:38.130> doubt<00:04:38.750> rapeseed<00:04:39.750> oil

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
said by far without a doubt rapeseed oil

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.440 
said by far without a doubt rapeseed oil
is<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.530> best<00:04:40.590> additive<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.430> thought<00:04:42.120> what

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
is the best additive I thought what

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.890 
is the best additive I thought what
rapeseed<00:04:43.260> oil<00:04:43.940> but<00:04:44.940> then<00:04:45.120> he<00:04:45.210> went<00:04:45.360> into<00:04:45.570> great

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
rapeseed oil but then he went into great

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.410 
rapeseed oil but then he went into great
detail<00:04:46.380> about<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.970> talking<00:04:47.970> about<00:04:48.180> such

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
detail about it talking about such

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.360 
detail about it talking about such
things<00:04:48.720> as<00:04:48.900> long-chain<00:04:49.380> molecules<00:04:49.620> and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
things as long-chain molecules and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.880 
things as long-chain molecules and
binding<00:04:51.090> this<00:04:51.480> than<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.930> other<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.620> I

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
binding this than the other and I

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.910 
binding this than the other and I
thought<00:04:53.130> moly<00:04:53.700> must<00:04:53.970> be<00:04:54.120> right<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.740> next

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
thought moly must be right so the next

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.140 
thought moly must be right so the next
time<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.130> went<00:04:56.310> up<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.730> Model<00:04:56.970> Railway

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
time I went up to the Model Railway

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.690 
time I went up to the Model Railway
Society<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.080> was<00:04:58.800> speaking<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.250> some<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.550> the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
Society I was speaking to some of the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.460 
Society I was speaking to some of the
men<00:04:59.880> who<00:05:00.030> used<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.270> work<00:05:00.480> on<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.810> railways<00:05:01.230> in

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
men who used to work on the railways in

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.100 
men who used to work on the railways in
the<00:05:01.560> old<00:05:02.130> days<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:03.360> I<00:05:03.450> was<00:05:03.540> telling<00:05:03.840> them<00:05:03.960> this

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
the old days and I was telling them this

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.200 
the old days and I was telling them this
story<00:05:04.440> of<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:05.130> scientist<00:05:05.669> at<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.060> old

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
story of the scientist at the old

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.560 
story of the scientist at the old
refinery<00:05:06.600> and<00:05:07.050> they<00:05:07.980> said<00:05:08.220> yeah<00:05:08.790> he's<00:05:09.000> right

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
refinery and they said yeah he's right

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.870 
refinery and they said yeah he's right
they<00:05:10.110> said<00:05:10.320> years<00:05:10.590> ago<00:05:10.919> we<00:05:11.520> used<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.760> have

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
they said years ago we used to have

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.490 
they said years ago we used to have
something<00:05:12.120> called<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.570> special<00:05:12.780> stuff<00:05:13.350> in

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
something called the special stuff in

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.100 
something called the special stuff in
the<00:05:13.590> superintendent's<00:05:13.950> office<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:15.330> if<00:05:15.960> one

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
the superintendent's office and if one

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.840 
the superintendent's office and if one
of<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.350> engines<00:05:16.710> Baird<00:05:16.950> is<00:05:17.130> he's<00:05:17.280> running<00:05:17.490> hot

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
of the engines Baird is he's running hot

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.390 
of the engines Baird is he's running hot
as<00:05:18.090> was<00:05:18.570> common<00:05:18.960> with<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.500> inside<00:05:19.830> cylinders

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
as was common with the inside cylinders

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.730 
as was common with the inside cylinders
of<00:05:20.550> steam<00:05:20.820> locomotives<00:05:21.510> we<00:05:22.200> used<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.470> get<00:05:22.560> some

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
of steam locomotives we used to get some

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.860 
of steam locomotives we used to get some
of<00:05:22.890> this<00:05:22.980> special<00:05:23.460> stuff<00:05:23.730> and<00:05:23.970> add<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.600> to<00:05:24.630> the
