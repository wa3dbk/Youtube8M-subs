verb is a fantastic way to embrace
renewable<00:00:38.480> energy<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.020> we<00:00:39.440> really<00:00:39.740> need<00:00:39.920> the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
renewable energy and we really need the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.070 
renewable energy and we really need the
government<00:00:40.220> to<00:00:40.460> step<00:00:40.730> up<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.060> accept<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.630> to

get<00:00:43.760> these<00:00:44.270> wave<00:00:44.540> energy<00:00:44.750> devices<00:00:45.260> in<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:45.860> sea

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
get these wave energy devices in the sea

00:00:46.040 --> 00:01:05.740 
get these wave energy devices in the sea
as<00:00:46.160> soon<00:00:46.370> as<00:00:46.520> possible

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750

10<00:01:06.750> miles<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> sea<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.800> we<00:01:08.400> could<00:01:08.580> have

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
10 miles out to sea here we could have

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
10 miles out to sea here we could have
energy<00:01:09.450> being<00:01:09.720> created<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.409> from<00:01:10.590> waves<00:01:10.830> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
energy being created just from waves so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.460 
energy being created just from waves so
there's<00:01:11.640> no<00:01:11.909> nuclear<00:01:12.360> waste<00:01:12.630> involved

there's no nuclear waste involved

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.040 
there's no nuclear waste involved
there's<00:01:14.190> no<00:01:14.700> co2<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> atmosphere

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
there's no co2 going into the atmosphere

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.560 
there's no co2 going into the atmosphere
making<00:01:16.770> climate<00:01:17.400> change<00:01:17.640> even<00:01:17.970> worse<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.510> us

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
