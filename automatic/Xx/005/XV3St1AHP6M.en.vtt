chickens roosting there now another

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.580 
chickens roosting there now another
thing<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.960> bit<00:02:49.080> different<00:02:49.500> about

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
thing is a little bit different about

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.180 
thing is a little bit different about
the<00:02:49.860> coop<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.640> size<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.210> 12<00:02:51.510> by<00:02:51.690> 12<00:02:51.960> square<00:02:52.470> but

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the coop the size is 12 by 12 square but

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.850 
the coop the size is 12 by 12 square but
I've<00:02:53.280> divided<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.970> coop<00:02:54.210> in<00:02:54.390> half<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.830> I

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
I've divided the coop in half and so I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.430 
I've divided the coop in half and so I
