00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
of the boat itself or the aircraft

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.340 
of the boat itself or the aircraft
carrier<00:02:44.150> sorry<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:44.959> can<00:02:45.080> actually<00:02:45.170> see

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
carrier sorry and you can actually see

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.110 
carrier sorry and you can actually see
that<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.590> does<00:02:45.769> have<00:02:45.799> an<00:02:46.190> open<00:02:46.610> hatch<00:02:46.819> there

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
that it does have an open hatch there

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.970 
that it does have an open hatch there
which<00:02:47.269> only<00:02:47.480> suggests<00:02:47.930> two<00:02:48.560> things<00:02:48.799> really

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
which only suggests two things really

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.979 
which only suggests two things really
won<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.489> boat<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:49.970> heading<00:02:50.239> towards<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.690> open

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
won the boat is heading towards the open

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.020 
won the boat is heading towards the open
hatch<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.830> actually<00:02:52.130> get<00:02:52.340> on<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.790> upper

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
hatch to actually get on it to the upper

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.100 
hatch to actually get on it to the upper
level<00:02:53.299> of<00:02:53.390> course<00:02:53.600> going<00:02:53.810> through<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
level of course going through the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.750 
level of course going through the
interior<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.560> get<00:02:54.860> onto<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.160> upper<00:02:55.310> level<00:02:55.610> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
interior to get onto the upper level and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.520 
interior to get onto the upper level and
the<00:02:56.150> second<00:02:56.480> one<00:02:56.569> is<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> fact<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.319> may

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
the second one is the fact that it may

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.589 
the second one is the fact that it may
have<00:02:57.560> an<00:02:57.890> interior<00:02:58.430> dressed<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:58.910> itself<00:02:59.269> which

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the portion of the trailer which also

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.470

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
mission so if we actually slow down the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.710 
mission so if we actually slow down the
portion<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.790> highest<00:03:14.120> shredder<00:03:14.299> itself

to go ahead and kind of rub these
vehicles<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.489> then<00:04:04.880> bring<00:04:05.060> them<00:04:05.180> back<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.510> a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
vehicles and then bring them back to a

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.780 
vehicles and then bring them back to a
certain<00:04:05.840> location<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.560> that's<00:04:07.130> probably<00:04:07.549> how

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
certain location and that's probably how

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.640 
certain location and that's probably how
you're<00:04:07.970> going<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.329> complete<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.049> whether

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
you're going to complete it so whether

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.319 
you're going to complete it so whether
or<00:04:09.769> not<00:04:09.859> this<00:04:09.980> huge<00:04:10.400> aircraft<00:04:10.639> carrier<00:04:11.120> is

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
or not this huge aircraft carrier is

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.729 
or not this huge aircraft carrier is
going<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.690> in<00:04:11.750> addition<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.109> free<00:04:12.350> room<00:04:12.560> is

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
going to be in addition to free room is

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.220 
going to be in addition to free room is
still<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.280> mystery<00:04:13.880> but<00:04:14.150> what<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:14.569> can<00:04:14.780> say<00:04:14.810> is

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
still a mystery but what I can say is

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.870 
still a mystery but what I can say is
from<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.590> highest<00:04:15.859> trailer<00:04:16.039> itself<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.639> does

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
from the highest trailer itself it does

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.099 
from the highest trailer itself it does
seem<00:04:17.090> as<00:04:17.209> though<00:04:17.299> something<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.720> going<00:04:18.019> down

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
seem as though something is going down

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.020 
seem as though something is going down
on<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.769> are<00:04:19.100> more<00:04:19.310> than<00:04:19.430> likely<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.760> heist

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
on that and are more than likely a heist

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.640 
on that and are more than likely a heist
mission<00:04:20.479> in<00:04:20.630> itself<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.289> I<00:04:21.320> guess<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.500> little

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
mission in itself and I guess a little

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.020 
mission in itself and I guess a little
bit<00:04:21.830> more<00:04:21.919> additional<00:04:22.280> information<00:04:22.760> on<00:04:22.849> this

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
bit more additional information on this

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.610 
bit more additional information on this
is<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.300> fact<00:04:23.479> that<00:04:23.539> Fernando<00:04:23.960> e<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.229> ditch<00:04:24.440> me

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
is the fact that Fernando e to ditch me

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.420 
is the fact that Fernando e to ditch me
out<00:04:24.770> as

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
out as

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.010 
out as
the<00:04:25.729> loading<00:04:25.940> code<00:04:26.300> for<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.690> aircraft

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
the loading code for the aircraft

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.350 
the loading code for the aircraft
carrier<00:04:27.289> itself<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:28.430> fact<00:04:28.610> added<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.240> the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
carrier itself is in fact added to the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.820 
carrier itself is in fact added to the
emission<00:04:29.720> control<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.169> skills<00:04:30.410> which<00:04:30.470> means

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
emission control of skills which means

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.680 
emission control of skills which means
that<00:04:30.860> it's<00:04:31.039> supposed<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.490> spawn<00:04:31.789> drawing

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
that it's supposed to spawn drawing

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.600 
that it's supposed to spawn drawing
missions<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.289> probably<00:04:33.860> only<00:04:34.070> for<00:04:34.430> highest

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
missions and probably only for highest

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.520 
missions and probably only for highest
so<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:35.120> hope<00:04:35.539> that<00:04:35.600> isn't<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.199> case<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.500> course

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
so I hope that isn't the case of course

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.050 
so I hope that isn't the case of course
racks<00:04:36.889> that<00:04:37.009> haven't<00:04:37.310> confirmed<00:04:37.610> this<00:04:37.820> and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
racks that haven't confirmed this and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.790 
racks that haven't confirmed this and
hopefully<00:04:38.900> when<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.080> highest<00:04:39.199> update<00:04:39.560> does

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
hopefully when the highest update does

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.260 
hopefully when the highest update does
eventually<00:04:40.039> arrive<00:04:40.460> that<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.759> thing<00:04:41.000> will

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
eventually arrive that that thing will

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.390 
eventually arrive that that thing will
actually<00:04:41.300> be<00:04:41.720> available<00:04:42.169> for<00:04:42.800> everybody<00:04:43.009> in

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
actually be available for everybody in

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.090 
actually be available for everybody in
free<00:04:43.759> roam<00:04:44.030> but<00:04:44.539> anyway<00:04:45.199> moving<00:04:45.410> on<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.979> the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
free roam but anyway moving on it to the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.320 
free roam but anyway moving on it to the
final<00:04:46.400> part<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.610> video<00:04:46.759> today<00:04:47.030> which<00:04:47.150> once

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
final part of video today which once

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.640 
final part of video today which once
again<00:04:47.449> is<00:04:47.600> going<00:04:47.870> over<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.110> few<00:04:48.289> pieces<00:04:48.500> of

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
again is going over a few pieces of

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.680 
again is going over a few pieces of
information<00:04:48.860> about<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.550> interior<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.539> not

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
information about the interior and not

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.790 
information about the interior and not
too<00:04:50.810> much<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.080> go<00:04:51.169> over<00:04:51.199> but<00:04:51.470> I'm<00:04:51.560> going<00:04:51.740> to

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
too much to go over but I'm going to

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.219 
too much to go over but I'm going to
conclude<00:04:52.009> you<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.430> dis<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.240> one<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.960> BTW

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
conclude you on a dis so one of the BTW

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.450 
conclude you on a dis so one of the BTW
once<00:04:54.410> again<00:04:54.620> tweety<00:04:54.860> now<00:04:54.979> i<00:04:55.009> think<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.340> was

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
once again tweety now i think it was

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.550 
once again tweety now i think it was
yesterday<00:04:55.759> or<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.090> day<00:04:56.120> before<00:04:56.380> pretty<00:04:57.380> much

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
yesterday or the day before pretty much

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.960 
yesterday or the day before pretty much
stating<00:04:58.009> a<00:04:58.039> lot<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.460> code<00:04:58.669> that<00:04:58.940> actually

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
stating a lot of code that actually

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.580 
stating a lot of code that actually
suggests<00:04:59.630> that<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.840> aircraft<00:04:59.960> carrier<00:05:00.380> has

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
suggests that the aircraft carrier has

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.800 
suggests that the aircraft carrier has
in<00:05:00.860> fact<00:05:01.039> got<00:05:01.849> an<00:05:01.910> interior<00:05:02.330> as<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:02.599> can<00:05:02.720> see

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
in fact got an interior as you can see

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.980 
in fact got an interior as you can see
there<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.020> does<00:05:03.139> say<00:05:03.380> set<00:05:03.800> radar<00:05:04.250> as<00:05:04.430> interior

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
there it does say set radar as interior

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.390 
there it does say set radar as interior
this<00:05:05.990> frame<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:06.680> he<00:05:06.740> says<00:05:06.889> that's<00:05:07.190> they're

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
this frame and he says that's they're

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.860 
this frame and he says that's they're
just<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.759> confirm<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.180> this<00:05:08.240> has<00:05:08.509> in<00:05:08.690> fact

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
just the confirm that this has in fact

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.010 
just the confirm that this has in fact
got<00:05:09.740> an<00:05:09.830> interior<00:05:10.370> now<00:05:10.669> of<00:05:11.240> course<00:05:11.449> once<00:05:11.780> again

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
got an interior now of course once again

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.200 
got an interior now of course once again
from<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.560> screenshot<00:05:12.949> before<00:05:13.250> with<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.910> open

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
from the screenshot before with the open

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.339 
from the screenshot before with the open
hatch<00:05:14.360> it<00:05:14.570> definitely<00:05:14.930> suggests<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.199> it

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
hatch it definitely suggests that it

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.260 
hatch it definitely suggests that it
does<00:05:15.500> have<00:05:15.530> an<00:05:15.740> open<00:05:15.919> in<00:05:16.009> Syria<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.580> there's

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
does have an open in Syria and there's

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.999 
does have an open in Syria and there's
also<00:05:17.419> an<00:05:17.599> image<00:05:17.840> as<00:05:17.990> well<00:05:18.169> with<00:05:18.470> what<00:05:18.650> people

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
also an image as well with what people

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.520 
also an image as well with what people
are<00:05:19.130> saying<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.699> could<00:05:20.330> in<00:05:20.509> fact<00:05:20.690> be<00:05:20.840> inside<00:05:21.500> of

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
are saying I could in fact be inside of

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.749 
are saying I could in fact be inside of
the<00:05:21.860> aircraft<00:05:22.250> carrier<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:22.580> is<00:05:22.729> a

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
the aircraft carrier and this is a

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.820 
the aircraft carrier and this is a
confirmed<00:05:23.360> rockstar<00:05:24.020> screenshot<00:05:24.530> as<00:05:24.620> you<00:05:24.710> can

confirmed rockstar screenshot as you can

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.620 
confirmed rockstar screenshot as you can
see<00:05:24.949> right<00:05:24.979> now<00:05:25.130> within<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.060> screenshot<00:05:26.539> you

military style clothing once again I

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.960 
military style clothing once again I
with<00:05:39.530> night-vision<00:05:39.889> goggles<00:05:40.580> and<00:05:40.699> so<00:05:40.909> of

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
with night-vision goggles and so of

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.700 
with night-vision goggles and so of
course<00:05:41.030> I<00:05:41.300> suggest<00:05:41.630> that<00:05:41.690> this<00:05:41.840> is<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.020> very<00:05:42.409> a

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
course I suggest that this is a very a

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.649 
course I suggest that this is a very a
very<00:05:42.849> dark<00:05:43.849> error<00:05:44.120> you're<00:05:44.300> gonna<00:05:44.419> have<00:05:44.570> to

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
very dark error you're gonna have to

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.360 
very dark error you're gonna have to
kind<00:05:44.810> of<00:05:44.870> traverse<00:05:45.199> through<00:05:45.440> this<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:45.889> you

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
kind of traverse through this and you

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.710 
kind of traverse through this and you
know<00:05:46.460> it's<00:05:46.550> maybe<00:05:46.729> a<00:05:46.789> very<00:05:46.970> very<00:05:47.150> dark<00:05:47.300> area

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
know it's maybe a very very dark area

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.659 
know it's maybe a very very dark area
which<00:05:47.870> is<00:05:48.020> where<00:05:48.199> the<00:05:48.349> night<00:05:49.099> vision<00:05:49.370> goggles

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
which is where the night vision goggles

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.339 
which is where the night vision goggles
come<00:05:49.789> into<00:05:50.000> play<00:05:50.150> book<00:05:50.419> what<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.930> key<00:05:51.080> point

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
come into play book what the key point

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.450 
come into play book what the key point
here<00:05:51.380> is<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.860> fact<00:05:52.039> that<00:05:52.099> he's<00:05:52.310> wearing

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
here is the fact that he's wearing

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.279 
here is the fact that he's wearing
military-style<00:05:53.210> clothing<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.169> is

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
military-style clothing and that is

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.080 
military-style clothing and that is
where<00:05:54.949> the<00:05:55.039> speculation<00:05:55.580> comes<00:05:55.759> into<00:05:55.970> play

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
where the speculation comes into play

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.339 
where the speculation comes into play
because<00:05:56.240> he's<00:05:56.539> very<00:05:56.750> military<00:05:57.080> style

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
because he's very military style

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:58.930 
because he's very military style
clothing<00:05:57.590> and<00:05:58.250> because<00:05:58.550> of<00:05:58.580> course<00:05:58.820> the

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
clothing and because of course the

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.670 
clothing and because of course the
aircraft<00:05:59.330> carrier<00:05:59.659> is<00:05:59.840> a<00:05:59.870> very<00:06:00.169> kind<00:06:00.620> of

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
aircraft carrier is a very kind of

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.649 
aircraft carrier is a very kind of
military-style<00:06:01.130> location<00:06:01.909> this<00:06:02.389> could

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
military-style location this could

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.110 
military-style location this could
possibly<00:06:02.930> be<00:06:03.289> inside<00:06:04.039> of<00:06:04.070> the<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:04.759> know<00:06:04.880> the

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
possibly be inside of the you know the

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.700 
possibly be inside of the you know the
aircraft<00:06:05.570> carrier<00:06:05.840> which<00:06:06.020> I<00:06:06.259> guess<00:06:06.680> makes

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
aircraft carrier which I guess makes

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.589 
aircraft carrier which I guess makes
perfect<00:06:07.460> sense<00:06:07.639> at<00:06:07.789> the<00:06:07.849> same<00:06:08.030> time<00:06:08.210> but<00:06:08.419> once

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
perfect sense at the same time but once

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.210 
perfect sense at the same time but once
again<00:06:08.720> i<00:06:08.990> recall<00:06:09.470> II<00:06:09.500> don't<00:06:09.740> know<00:06:09.860> but<00:06:10.039> I<00:06:10.070> did

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
again i recall II don't know but I did

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.409 
again i recall II don't know but I did
