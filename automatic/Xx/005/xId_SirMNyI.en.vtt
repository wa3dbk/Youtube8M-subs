00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
problems and don't even try it oh as far

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.719 
problems and don't even try it oh as far
as<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.850> guide<00:01:47.060> goes<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:49.220> most<00:01:49.460> cost

and<00:02:06.740> they<00:02:07.250> won't<00:02:07.490> really<00:02:07.640> take<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:07.850> long

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
and they won't really take that long

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.080 
and they won't really take that long
anyway<00:02:08.979> I'm<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.160> most<00:02:10.280> cost<00:02:10.519> efficient<00:02:11.000> way

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
anyway I'm the most cost efficient way

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.670 
anyway I'm the most cost efficient way
to<00:02:11.329> get<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.260> 99<00:02:12.650> from<00:02:13.040> 3299<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.480> buy<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:15.470> I

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
to get to 99 from 3299 is to buy like I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.950 
to get to 99 from 3299 is to buy like I
think<00:02:15.950> it's<00:02:16.040> 190<00:02:16.730> k<00:02:16.850> where<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> logs<00:02:17.299> which

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
think it's 190 k where the logs which

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.280 
think it's 190 k where the logs which
I<00:02:19.020> think<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.710> ridiculous<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:21.150> that's<00:02:22.140> the
