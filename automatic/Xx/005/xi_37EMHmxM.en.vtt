00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.279
 it's a new series of has to stop the game of man rouvoet from bothering 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.619
 because they are allowed to perform 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.699
 because it was more of it 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.699
 that's why he always misses my voice problems 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.419
 I 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.679
 I had a weekly yesterday that I knew where I was already scared 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.039
 we had to restore people 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.060
 but his bid it would still be a little bit of arem's voice 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.400
 watch the people some of all the inflammation by Jan 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.410
 In addition, fragments come to see how I can do this, but a storm comes 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.650
 one throughout Flanders usually the xyz one the Amsterdam old is that they what 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.050
 you will find that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.240
 as the sp there rules 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.680
 this first was the turn calling press 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.140
 the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.850
 I have I once had a quarter of that game console Finland and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.200
 there among other things laura lynn voting boxes knit everything 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.170
 there we are century we still seemed profit I think that is absolutely not 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.850
 after but I think I think so 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.500
 quite an honor 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.729
 anyway money is happy with the men a weird brush m 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.100
 marijn a gymnast will say today that was noticeable rome 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.910
 but yes it is a mirror image and I sweat a lot in May it was like 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.150
 a small child has a lot of shops there 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.010
 9 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.300
 making me jump like it 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.240
 the children and that of course from the television song festival over three years 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.120
 I think 6 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.950
 and with 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.780
 damiaan mark fourth 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.850
 how much did he look back on that period 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.780
 years with savings interest that until you imagine that I was there anyway 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.530
 until the semi-final is reached 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.010
 but 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.140
 I got to know a lot of people and that's how it gets a kick out of it 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.680
 a whole whole 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.130
 fantastic experience can i came from spain nobody knew me here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 I will already be in Spain in the meantime 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.120
 whatever that was kind of a derby opened form 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.180
 when I look back on it I can certainly be like a newcomer 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.290
 that I 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.430
 what not so badly done I think of mine and I went to my taste 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.389
 sometimes to himself 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.489
 that competition and 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.779
 h 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.679
 are you planning to do something with it 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.619
 lee 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.779
 the atmosphere on the future but with pascal planning i have the 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.279
 surely Flanders cannot participate in the coming years 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.219
 because 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.479
 was in waxaar that your child was sent out of nowhere 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.260
 including maria 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.099
 the new canal and and many others 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.859
 the real craftsmen who trees 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.639
 much possible from a lot of potential and let shahzad 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.659
 and that they belong to me and thousands of cyclists 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.739
 refuse 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.739
 I personally think that through a boycott 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.739
 Bruinisse also sees them all busy nowadays 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.749
 well we are working on the word sing or mainly bank funds 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.639
 become it 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.529
 early March next year 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.859
 the church entity year are sizes 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.699
 as there are so many plans to make so choices 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.179
 that it is very difficult to decide everything a few months later 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:13.339
 sure or five six months in between 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:15.040
 and that only with 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.009
 for the fore 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.459
 vacation and everything 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.459
 nevertheless celibacy knows the bowl and then opens again for a summer 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:26.299
 parking costs only for the honor will receive a record contract abroad 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.129
 therefore you are obliged to press abroad with as 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.239
 leaving behind the french family 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.949
 what are you doing 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.609
 as nu.nl 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.199
 Yes indeed 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.139
 i never leave anyone behind the people who kick me next i go i 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.449
 just take it no 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.829
 or still propose 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.249
 alma when i get chances for ratzinger abroad 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.109
 that is usually larger amounts and 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.659
 if your future is expanding and there henkel problem I have the people 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.450
 love brook milly so it is all certain what followed was a whole 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.299
 much to learn 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.299
 so why should they not thorn again 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.299
 and the girlfriend of one of the name I will drag along 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.529
 imagine you can divide the gate into 9 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:13.459
 well-known artist alike 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.489
 the boat 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.109
 if from abroad who was strict and why 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.120
 usually someone or under a fake name 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.949
 In March I may say I have the stage that you learn naturally 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.140
 if that's true only a part 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.120
 because his little princess has not simply declined 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.520
 put his walks of english can sing line flemish 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.740
 actually I think kind is and remains the greatest moment of beringen on one 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.449
 musically then you still have 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.319
 al tammo like sponsor hue 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.319
 all and dams abroad 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.099
 as a tour of somers 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.040
 and 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.860
 that takes care of all 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.860
 the style of the series knows us and our voice 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.049
 the iphone say more about that makes sure i sing a song from her husband quite a bit 

00:05:02.049 --> 00:05:03.229
 would be the loot 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.850
 I think it is a nice stab amesz logical that there is ever written desire 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.300
 and, as the previous one said, the most powerful voted 10 more 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.439
 in line but came with humor 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.439
 nl so we are going to be a whole team 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.009
 as a kid tips all of this herein to a starting artist what would that be 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.249
 set 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:26.279
 he 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.819
 I am still too young to stab 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.419
 but I can say for it and 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.559
 per kg achieved work on the presence 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.409
 for example, if they are on which the match is not suspended with the same clothes because 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.599
 he didn't wear the same clothes for a job 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.809
 trying to count everything down to perfection people will watch 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:44.830
 and 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.330
 always be the same 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.839
 the anp label 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.469
 I've watched everything with you I've seen your spanier was living on a bit 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:52.349
 like a soap 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.179
 and I am grateful for the opportunities created and floating networks 

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:57.240
 part of the Randstad 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.889
 I have wear with which the band will sail and that's that is the Waal Rule Scholarships 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.369
 are on 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:04.270
 markit 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.630
 thanks for integrating and good luck and have fun tonight
