almost<00:01:07.750> immediately<00:01:08.500> after<00:01:08.799> construction<00:01:09.340> so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
almost immediately after construction so

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.469 
almost immediately after construction so
that's<00:01:09.640> something<00:01:09.850> else<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.090> think<00:01:10.270> about

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
that's something else to think about

that<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.420> mahogany<00:01:20.320> woods<00:01:20.619> offer<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.070> tone

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
that the mahogany woods offer a tone

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.990 
that the mahogany woods offer a tone
that's<00:01:21.670> really<00:01:22.210> deep<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:23.010> once<00:01:24.010> this<00:01:24.670> sound

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
that's really deep and once this sound

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's really deep and once this sound
carries<00:01:25.619> through<00:01:26.619> there's<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.340> lot<00:01:27.490> of<00:01:27.640> nice

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
carries through there's a lot of nice

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.120 
carries through there's a lot of nice
mid<00:01:28.210> tone<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.780> lot<00:01:28.960> of<00:01:28.990> nice<00:01:29.260> range<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.979> it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
mid tone and a lot of nice range to it

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.370 
mid tone and a lot of nice range to it
but<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.790> think<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.150> still<00:01:31.330> also<00:01:31.659> retains<00:01:32.080> that

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
but I think it still also retains that

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.039 
but I think it still also retains that
crisp<00:01:32.860> overtone<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:34.299> can<00:01:34.450> even<00:01:34.659> can<00:01:34.930> be

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
crisp overtone that can even can be

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.780 
crisp overtone that can even can be
reminiscent<00:01:35.619> of<00:01:35.650> spruce<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.220> that's<00:01:36.640> what

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
reminiscent of spruce so that's what

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.820 
reminiscent of spruce so that's what
makes<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.150> my<00:01:37.330> favorite<00:01:37.840> wood<00:01:38.080> for<00:01:38.350> acoustic

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
makes it my favorite wood for acoustic

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.399 
makes it my favorite wood for acoustic
guitar<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:39.729> don't<00:01:40.330> forget<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.780> factory
