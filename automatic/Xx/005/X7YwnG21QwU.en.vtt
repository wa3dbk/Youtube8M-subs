different<00:02:02.390> looking<00:02:02.750> than<00:02:03.020> any<00:02:03.170> other<00:02:03.380> other

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
different looking than any other other

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.070 
different looking than any other other
succulent<00:02:04.340> I've<00:02:04.490> seen<00:02:04.790> but<00:02:05.510> when<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.660> got<00:02:05.810> there

they<00:02:06.410> didn't<00:02:06.650> have<00:02:06.800> any<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.370> course<00:02:07.730> so<00:02:08.600> when<00:02:09.110> I

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
they didn't have any of course so when I

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.770 
they didn't have any of course so when I
walked<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.710> there<00:02:10.040> like<00:02:10.790> promo<00:02:11.240> table<00:02:11.630> when
