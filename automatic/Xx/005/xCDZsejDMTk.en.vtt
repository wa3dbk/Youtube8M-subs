00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
just kind of suspended there there's a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.929 
just kind of suspended there there's a
black<00:01:19.950> sack<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.420> here'sh<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:23.640> see

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
black sack right about here'sh you see

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.690 
black sack right about here'sh you see
it's<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.720> piece<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.140> plastic<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
it's on this piece of plastic here and I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.830 
it's on this piece of plastic here and I
originally<00:01:27.240> thought<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.650> was<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.130> book

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
originally thought that it was a book

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.170 
originally thought that it was a book
which<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.960> figure<00:01:31.409> would<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.799> pretty<00:01:32.610> cool<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
which I figure would be pretty cool to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.710 
which I figure would be pretty cool to
have<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> bug<00:01:34.079> stuck<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:34.979> Megaman<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.540> does

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
have a bug stuck in my Megaman so does

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.700 
have a bug stuck in my Megaman so does
that<00:01:36.780> make<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.200> any<00:01:37.290> cooler<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.799> don't<00:01:38.280> know

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
that make it any cooler I don't know

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.410 
that make it any cooler I don't know
because<00:01:40.710> well<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> zoomed<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.270> my

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
because well I zoomed in on it with my

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.590 
because well I zoomed in on it with my
camera<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.500> picture<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.640> it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
camera it's a picture of it and it's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
camera it's a picture of it and it's
very<00:01:45.659> fuzzy<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.409> both<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> don't

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
very fuzzy and both like but I don't

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.719 
very fuzzy and both like but I don't
believe<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.000> bug<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.509> just

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
believe it's a bug it's just

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.080 
believe it's a bug it's just
weird-looking<00:01:50.729> fuzzy<00:01:51.420> woolly<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:53.030> do<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
weird-looking fuzzy woolly so do you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.660 
weird-looking fuzzy woolly so do you
think<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.600> makes<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.829> figure<00:01:56.159> even<00:01:56.460> cooler

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
think this makes this figure even cooler

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.940 
think this makes this figure even cooler
do<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.840> defect<00:01:58.560> which

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
do you think it's just a defect which

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.460 
do you think it's just a defect which
you<00:01:59.310> know

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
you know

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.460 
you know
you<00:02:00.890> know<00:02:01.480> lessons<00:02:02.480> the<00:02:02.690> coolness<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.290> this

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
you know lessons the coolness of this

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.820 
you know lessons the coolness of this
figure

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
figure

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.830 
figure
either<00:02:04.340> way<00:02:04.580> it's<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.820> bit<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.060> an<00:02:05.180> oddity<00:02:05.360> I

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
either way it's a bit of an oddity I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.230 
either way it's a bit of an oddity I
don't<00:02:06.710> know<00:02:06.860> if<00:02:07.010> I've<00:02:07.190> seen<00:02:07.520> anything<00:02:07.760> like<00:02:07.940> it

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
don't know if I've seen anything like it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.570 
don't know if I've seen anything like it
before<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:09.140> mean<00:02:09.800> every<00:02:10.070> now<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.340> then<00:02:10.430> you

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
before I mean every now and then you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.100 
before I mean every now and then you
look<00:02:10.760> at<00:02:10.910> an<00:02:11.060> action<00:02:11.390> figure<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.780> package

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
look at an action figure and the package

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.510 
look at an action figure and the package
in<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.410> head<00:02:12.590> or<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.800> air<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.190> will<00:02:13.310> fall<00:02:13.490> out

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
in the head or the air and will fall out

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160 
in the head or the air and will fall out
for<00:02:13.910> something<00:02:14.150> like<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.450> or<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.630> hot<00:02:14.870> wheels

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
for something like that or a hot wheels

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.080 
for something like that or a hot wheels
will<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.980> know<00:02:16.010> backwards<00:02:16.760> or<00:02:16.970> something

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
will be you know backwards or something

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.430 
will be you know backwards or something
like<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:17.600> then<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.900> think<00:02:17.960> this<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.380> the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
like that but then I think this is the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.870 
like that but then I think this is the
first<00:02:18.590> time<00:02:18.800> I'd<00:02:18.920> ever<00:02:18.950> seen<00:02:19.160> anything<00:02:19.520> bug

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
first time I'd ever seen anything bug

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.730 
first time I'd ever seen anything bug
