but we'll leave that as it is I go back

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.330 
but we'll leave that as it is I go back
again<00:04:20.229> we<00:04:21.229> can<00:04:21.380> now<00:04:21.500> go<00:04:21.650> straight<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:22.010> burn<00:04:22.160> if

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
again we can now go straight to burn if

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.560 
again we can now go straight to burn if
you<00:04:22.430> want<00:04:22.640> so

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
you want so

you want so
but<00:04:24.260> we'll<00:04:24.380> preview<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.890> DVD<00:04:25.010> and<00:04:25.430> see<00:04:25.580> what

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
but we'll preview the DVD and see what

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.770 
but we'll preview the DVD and see what
it<00:04:25.760> look<00:04:25.910> like<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.460> how<00:04:28.640> the<00:04:29.300> DVD<00:04:29.630> will

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
it look like so this is how the DVD will

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.800 
it look like so this is how the DVD will
look<00:04:29.900> when<00:04:30.020> we<00:04:30.080> put<00:04:30.230> into<00:04:30.380> our<00:04:30.470> DVD<00:04:30.860> play<00:04:31.070> it

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
look when we put into our DVD play it

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.730 
look when we put into our DVD play it
talks<00:04:32.810> about<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.080> play<00:04:33.260> button<00:04:33.560> or<00:04:33.620> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
talks about the play button or the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.870 
talks about the play button or the
scenes<00:04:33.980> button<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:35.450> if<00:04:35.540> we<00:04:35.660> kick<00:04:35.810> play<00:04:36.880> well

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
scenes button and if we kick play well

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.730 
scenes button and if we kick play well
then<00:04:38.030> go<00:04:38.180> through<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:40.480> DVD<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:42.560> how<00:04:42.680> it

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
then go through the DVD and the how it

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.330 
then go through the DVD and the how it
is<00:04:42.830> going<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.100> look<00:04:44.620> we<00:04:45.620> just<00:04:45.650> don't<00:04:45.800> care<00:04:46.100> that

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
is going to look we just don't care that

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.840 
is going to look we just don't care that
one<00:04:47.120> of<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.300> things<00:04:51.220> it's<00:04:52.220> quite<00:04:52.430> important

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
one of the things it's quite important

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.150 
one of the things it's quite important
and<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.180> slideshow<00:04:53.450> button<00:04:53.870> here<00:04:54.160> you'll

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
and the slideshow button here you'll

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.440 
and the slideshow button here you'll
notice<00:04:55.370> when<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.640> went<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:55.970> preview<00:04:56.300> then

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
notice when I went to the preview then

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.540 
notice when I went to the preview then
that<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.750> showed<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.260> pictures<00:04:57.890> fading<00:04:58.310> in

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
that it showed the pictures fading in

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.610 
that it showed the pictures fading in
and<00:04:58.610> out<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:59.080> this<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.230> done<00:05:00.380> on<00:05:00.410> this

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
and out and this is done on this

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.490 
and out and this is done on this
transition<00:05:01.160> here<00:05:01.540> so<00:05:02.540> this<00:05:02.810> is<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.170> how<00:05:03.440> many

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
transition here so this is the how many

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.890 
transition here so this is the how many
seconds<00:05:03.980> it's<00:05:04.130> actually<00:05:04.520> on<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:05.360> screen<00:05:05.630> for

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
seconds it's actually on the screen for

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.990 
seconds it's actually on the screen for
so<00:05:06.470> we<00:05:06.530> can<00:05:06.680> change<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:07.130> to<00:05:07.280> 5<00:05:07.460> seconds<00:05:07.910> for

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
so we can change that to 5 seconds for

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.690 
so we can change that to 5 seconds for
example<00:05:08.030> of<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.480> leaks<00:05:09.470> time<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:10.520> then

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
example of it leaks time and then

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.580 
example of it leaks time and then
transition<00:05:11.210> attack<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.990> how<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.230> does<00:05:12.380> that

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
transition attack and how it does that

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.610 
transition attack and how it does that
so<00:05:12.770> if<00:05:12.860> we'll<00:05:13.010> just<00:05:13.330> change<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.630> to<00:05:14.690> flip<00:05:15.290> for

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
so if we'll just change that to flip for

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.380 
so if we'll just change that to flip for
example<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:18.080> we'll<00:05:18.290> change<00:05:18.800> slideshow<00:05:19.390> and

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
example and we'll change slideshow and

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.150 
example and we'll change slideshow and
we'll<00:05:20.510> preview<00:05:23.410> now<00:05:24.410> when<00:05:24.590> we<00:05:24.710> go<00:05:24.830> into<00:05:24.980> the

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
we'll preview now when we go into the

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.430 
we'll preview now when we go into the
pictures<00:05:25.660> you'll<00:05:26.660> see<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.020> when<00:05:27.170> we<00:05:27.230> push

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
pictures you'll see that when we push

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.490 
pictures you'll see that when we push
play

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.890 

that<00:05:33.040> it<00:05:33.130> flips<00:05:33.400> over<00:05:33.660> when<00:05:34.660> it<00:05:34.750> does<00:05:34.870> a

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
that it flips over when it does a

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.610 
that it flips over when it does a
transition

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.410 

well<00:05:41.130> okay<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.090> one

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.470 

so<00:05:46.020> if<00:05:46.170> we<00:05:46.290> check<00:05:46.440> out<00:05:46.680> leave<00:05:47.430> flip<00:05:47.730> in<00:05:47.940> and<00:05:48.150> use

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
so if we check out leave flip in and use

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.970 
so if we check out leave flip in and use
the<00:05:48.630> pan<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:48.960> zoom<00:05:48.990> effect<00:05:49.380> for<00:05:49.530> pictures<00:05:49.830> we

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
the pan and zoom effect for pictures we

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.260 
the pan and zoom effect for pictures we
turn<00:05:50.190> out<00:05:50.370> as<00:05:50.610> well<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.030> will<00:05:51.090> just

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
turn out as well and it will just

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.470 
turn out as well and it will just
literally<00:05:51.630> put<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:53.390> picture<00:05:54.390> on<00:05:56.390> in<00:05:57.390> the

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
literally put the picture on in the

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.980 
literally put the picture on in the
central<00:05:57.810> screen

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.860 

instead<00:06:03.650> five<00:06:03.980> seconds<00:06:04.640> and<00:06:05.090> flip<00:06:05.480> over<00:06:05.660> to

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
instead five seconds and flip over to

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.810 
instead five seconds and flip over to
the<00:06:05.900> next<00:06:06.050> one

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.510 

so<00:06:13.480> now<00:06:13.630> we're<00:06:13.780> into<00:06:13.870> this<00:06:14.080> we've<00:06:14.860> finalized

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
so now we're into this we've finalized

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.170
