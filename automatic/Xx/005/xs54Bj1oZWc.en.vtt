charging<00:00:05.190> today<00:00:05.460> we're<00:00:05.609> talking<00:00:05.759> about

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
charging today we're talking about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.839 
charging today we're talking about
inductive<00:00:06.660> charging<00:00:07.080> technology<00:00:10.460> so<00:00:11.460> for<00:00:11.730> our

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
inductive charging technology so for our

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.759 
inductive charging technology so for our
first<00:00:12.120> pick<00:00:12.389> we've<00:00:12.599> got<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.049> current<00:00:13.500> table

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
first pick we've got the current table

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.589 
first pick we've got the current table
and<00:00:14.130> now<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.580> piece<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:15.000> furniture<00:00:15.150> is

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
and now this piece of furniture is

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.599 
and now this piece of furniture is
unique<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.320> respect<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.340> only

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
unique in the respect that it's not only

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.580 
unique in the respect that it's not only
going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.970> look<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> fantastic<00:00:19.020> piece<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
going to allow you to charge your

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.279 
going to allow you to charge your
devices<00:00:23.609> while<00:00:24.180> you're<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.720> placing<00:00:25.230> them

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
devices while you're just placing them

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.950 
devices while you're just placing them
on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.529> surface<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> table<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.210> not<00:00:27.810> only

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
on the surface of the table so not only

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
on the surface of the table so not only
that<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> device<00:00:28.920> also<00:00:29.429> has<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.240> ability

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
that but the device also has the ability

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
that but the device also has the ability
to<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:31.050> charged<00:00:31.439> via<00:00:31.650> solar<00:00:31.949> panels<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> his

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
to be charged via solar panels and his

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030 
to be charged via solar panels and his
solar<00:00:33.000> powered<00:00:33.329> itself<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.739> put<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:34.980> in

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
solar powered itself so if you put it in

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.350 
solar powered itself so if you put it in
a<00:00:35.130> sunny<00:00:35.340> room<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.120> able<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
a sunny room it's going to be able to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.389 
a sunny room it's going to be able to
power<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:36.930> devices<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.530> day<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.250> if

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
power all your devices all day so if

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.770 
power all your devices all day so if
you're<00:00:38.550> looking<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.940> break<00:00:39.180> into<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you're looking to break into the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.479 
you're looking to break into the
wireless<00:00:40.350> charging<00:00:40.800> world<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> you're<00:00:41.460> not

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
wireless charging world and you're not

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.130 
wireless charging world and you're not
really<00:00:41.760> sure<00:00:41.879> where<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> start<00:00:42.360> perhaps

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
really sure where to start perhaps

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.180 
really sure where to start perhaps
something<00:00:43.469> that's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
something that's a little bit of a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
something that's a little bit of a
smaller<00:00:44.579> investment<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.719> best

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
smaller investment would be your best

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.110 
smaller investment would be your best
bet<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.440> next<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> cheap<00:00:47.820> wooden

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
bet so next up we have the cheap wooden

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.930 
bet so next up we have the cheap wooden
speaker<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.870> now<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.739> sustainably<00:00:50.460> sourced

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
speaker and now this sustainably sourced

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
speaker and now this sustainably sourced
piece<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.510> material<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.320> actually<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> device

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
piece of material is actually a device

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.830 
piece of material is actually a device
that<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.789> allow<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.180> charge<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.780> phone

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
then they switch wireless charger might

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.990 
then they switch wireless charger might
be<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> best<00:01:10.380> bet<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.790> made

with sustainable materials and it's also

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
with sustainable materials and it's also
going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> best<00:01:15.330> design

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
going to have one of the best design

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690
