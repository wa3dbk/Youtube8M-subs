announcement today came in the form of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.220

for<00:02:22.740> starters<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.250> got<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.460> learn<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> little

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
for starters we got to learn a little

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.880 
for starters we got to learn a little
bit<00:02:23.940> about<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> process<00:02:24.480> itself<00:02:25.140> which<00:02:25.680> comes

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
bit about the process itself which comes

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
bit about the process itself which comes
through<00:02:26.130> an<00:02:26.190> item<00:02:26.370> called<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.820> mega<00:02:27.030> ring<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
through an item called the mega ring and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.720 
through an item called the mega ring and
the<00:02:27.960> key<00:02:28.230> stone<00:02:28.530> which<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.950> Pokemon<00:02:29.340> holds

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the key stone which the Pokemon holds

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.820 
the key stone which the Pokemon holds
apparently<00:02:30.570> some<00:02:30.780> sort<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.020> energy<00:02:31.470> field<00:02:31.500> is

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
apparently some sort of energy field is

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
apparently some sort of energy field is
created<00:02:32.010> between<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.820> ring<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
created between this ring and the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.750 
created between this ring and the
Pokemon<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.320> it's<00:02:34.410> held<00:02:34.590> item<00:02:34.740> allowing<00:02:35.580> mega

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
Pokemon and it's held item allowing mega

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.580 
Pokemon and it's held item allowing mega
evolution<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.420> happen<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:37.020> normally<00:02:37.410> not

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
evolution to happen when normally not

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.890 
evolution to happen when normally not
possible<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:39.060> does<00:02:39.240> leave<00:02:39.540> some

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
possible now this does leave some

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.870 
possible now this does leave some
interesting<00:02:40.500> questions<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.550> going<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
interesting questions is this going to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.490 
interesting questions is this going to
have<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.120> deal<00:02:42.300> with<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.540> plot<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.080> EXO<00:02:43.350> why

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
have to deal with the plot of EXO why

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.920 
have to deal with the plot of EXO why
are<00:02:44.100> these<00:02:44.280> mega<00:02:44.820> evolutions<00:02:45.480> some<00:02:45.660> kind<00:02:45.870> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
are these mega evolutions some kind of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.810 
are these mega evolutions some kind of
genetic<00:02:46.410> modification<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:47.370> things<00:02:47.700> that

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
genetic modification like things that

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.760 
genetic modification like things that
Team<00:02:48.150> Plasma<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.810> Team<00:02:48.990> Rocket<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.530> done<00:02:49.680> in

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
Team Plasma and Team Rocket have done in

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.580 
Team Plasma and Team Rocket have done in
the<00:02:49.860> past<00:02:50.040> very<00:02:50.910> very<00:02:51.540> interested<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.230> how

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the past very very interested to see how

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.500 
the past very very interested to see how
this<00:02:52.980> plays<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> plot<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.390> you're

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
this plays out in the plot but if you're

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.150 
this plays out in the plot but if you're
like<00:02:54.660> me<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.200> probably<00:02:55.230> don't<00:02:55.740> care<00:02:55.800> too<00:02:56.130> much

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
like me you probably don't care too much

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.740 
like me you probably don't care too much
about<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.610> actual<00:02:56.730> process<00:02:57.240> of<00:02:57.570> mega
