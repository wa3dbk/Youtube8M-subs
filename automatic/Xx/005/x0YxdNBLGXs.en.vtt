00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.520
 Welcome people to my new anime 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.210
 This time, review was about the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 anime barroso madoka magica in 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.110
 Germany is there for me under the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.109
 title paula marie madoka magica on dvd 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 available at marco schomaker magica 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.029
 it is an original bank that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.029
 2011 was produced by studio sharp 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.369
 It includes twelve episodes with two recap 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.439
 film that means the whole thing again 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.480
 has summarized the film and im 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.520
 october of this year is still in japan 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.739
 times an additional film appeared the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.739
 tells a slightly different story 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.449
 Imagine you can get one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.370
 wish to fulfill the election order 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.110
 light for that, but animal would have your life 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 you would risk it 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.949
 risk and what would I give you 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.019
 Ever wanted to ask these questions 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.269
 I put the girl marica as me 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.610
 here suddenly a little sweet creature 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.350
 escaped and you offer tackles 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.170
 This pact says that you are a medical 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.149
 girl is going and witches fought for it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.890
 but even before marica really 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.720
 she is already in 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 this whole world involved with and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.970
 you actually calm and peaceful 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.740
 live suddenly turned upside down 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.080
 First of all you have to say Mario Joka 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.869
 Magica is not what it is on 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.090
 At first glance it seems it has become here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.890
 not around little cute girls the area 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.039
 like witches fighting or happy on 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.300
 live as if nothing had happened 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.159
 this is the packing 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.869
 mystery drama with a really nice one 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.090
 atmosphere really profound 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.340
 Aspects The story is nothing in itself 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.619
 how special is he actually near 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.539
 already a girl clichÃ©es the one 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.600
 special power gets against the 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.329
 to fight evil what the special 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.649
 this is that the medical girls would have 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.960
 I just out of one I can 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.360
 another and new view is told 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.070
 despite server bison had some one 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.110
 pretty good tells tom cruise will be 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.299
 neither too fast nor too slow 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.519
 tells and it will actually be for 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.470
 All pretty well received 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.930
 biggest plus one one really 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.060
 this psychological aspect for me 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.549
 The setting psychological is an anime 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.829
 always huge plus point and 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.230
 here where that just so well represented 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.180
 The atmosphere was gloomier overall 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.489
 and the emotions like fear despair 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.620
 are doing really well here and not 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.450
 artificially or exaggerated 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.359
 here were the shadow sides of the da 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.130
 seitz illustrated and generally liked 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.600
 i very much like the world and the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.670
 Humanity represented here as well 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.260
 it was questioned it will be very 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.750
 profound and easy 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 automatically thinking of what I am 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.310
 are fascinated still on the to him 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.620
 two points on the one hand that it is very much 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.390
 unpredictable is so as me 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.639
 personally , there are often surprises 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.770
 I did not expect the second one 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.510
 point is the outstanding end 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.700
 it was simple and nothing 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.860
 what to expect after a few follow 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.660
 In general we have the animation in it 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.310
 well done the music is great 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.070
 The fights are just super good 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.410
 staged that draws the first on 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.280
 in the beginning of my opinion something 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.110
 it took some getting used to 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.850
 outside so typical medical girl 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.100
 character style but somehow i liked it 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.350
 this illustration of the heads at the beginning 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.610
 not so it takes some getting used to though 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.180
 you get used to pretty fast 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.280
 it 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.020
 which is definitely diversified 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.310
 the abstract illustration inside 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.680
 parry these witches 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.600
 this just as artistic and 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.460
 The abstract design was easy 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.400
 to look so beautiful and I would have 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.170
 watch this witch baba for hours 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.000
 can possible by doing so 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.220
 You can also represent abstract 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.530
 Once again, you know what you are looking for 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.970
 symbolism and the objects and so on 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.650
 shown in there 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.320
 interpret what a nice thing 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.970
 after so much praise it has to be natural 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.830
 also criticize 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.600
 a weak head is in my opinion 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.340
 After was the characters because they were easy 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.230
 are so stereo typical 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.080
 they are not bad but 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.580
 just nothing special I found 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.230
 on the whole, they are quite whole 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.209
 interesting but there was no 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.410
 character where I thought wow it 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.120
 really well done 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.310
 Furthermore, a bit bothers me 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.780
 fact that the girls are so around the 14th 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.930
 should be years old 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.620
 my, it is not total now 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.540
 decisive but because they 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.430
 are so young in the trade sometimes 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.470
 a bit difficult to understand because of themselves 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.170
 a child does not normally behave like that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.670
 But we would be anime here 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.280
 and that's probably why I should 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.080
 Do not doubt it does too 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.670
 actually a lot but it is just like that 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.890
 a small but he thought me 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.830
 grope the biggest weak point 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.770
 The anime is episodes of number it too 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.150
 little episode in such 24 episodes would have 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.890
 you just get a lot better at that 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.930
 characters and if all these emotions 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.610
 You could also go fast 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.130
 the whole paste also takes care of the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.640
 All psychological aspects are there 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.060
 edited a bit more precisely 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.650
 been 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.180
 i can do the psychological aspects 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.070
 really great and i would have me 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.710
 Happy if you have a bit more 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.850
 will received thereon 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.770
 In summary, one can say that do 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.050
 giorgio armani came in too 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.780
 medical 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.250
 totally different style i would never have been in 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.830
 my life is waiting for me 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.659
 medical girl anime so fascinating 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.150
 actually could impress at all 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.039
 no fan of this setting was this anime 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.050
 but that creates his atmosphere 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.090
 by being through his psychological 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.280
 and profound aspects of one 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.550
 really stick off the screen 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.470
 third episode I have the rest like that 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.310
 bred because he is just so good and 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.580
 is exciting 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.530
 I'm telling you hereby giving it to him 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.659
 their best chance the first three 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.719
 Episodes do not have the first ones 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:43.370
 both episodes not quite so 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.639
 impressed but from the third what then 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.759
 happen to me and I find one 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.310
 class tells me your opinion 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.090
 anime or any 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.979
 suggestions for improvement comments 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.810
 criticism what do I know 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.590
 We'll see you at the next one 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.590
 bye bye 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.870
 the 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.620
 runs to
