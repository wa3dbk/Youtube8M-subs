00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
show you one of these sport ear hooks as

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.339 
show you one of these sport ear hooks as
well<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.840> one<00:02:17.020> out<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
well just like the one out of the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.800 
well just like the one out of the
packaging<00:02:17.800> without<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.250> label<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.660> these

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
packaging without the label on and these

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.600 
packaging without the label on and these
are<00:02:20.020> really<00:02:20.379> effective<00:02:20.860> actually<00:02:21.040> because

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
are really effective actually because

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.950 
are really effective actually because
normally<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.750> would

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
normally you would

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.010 
normally you would
use<00:02:23.200> these<00:02:23.530> earphones<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:25.120> putting<00:02:25.930> them

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
use these earphones just putting them

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.710 
use these earphones just putting them
into<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.380> ear<00:02:26.500> canal<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.210> then<00:02:28.210> if<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.510> were

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
into the ear canal and then if you were

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.260 
into the ear canal and then if you were
running<00:02:29.070> sometimes<00:02:30.070> they<00:02:30.250> do<00:02:30.310> vibrate<00:02:31.030> and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
running sometimes they do vibrate and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.870 
running sometimes they do vibrate and
and<00:02:31.690> work<00:02:31.870> their<00:02:32.140> way<00:02:32.170> out<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.470> your<00:02:32.710> ear<00:02:32.920> but

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and work their way out of your ear but

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.600 
and work their way out of your ear but
you<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.090> actually<00:02:34.240> fit<00:02:34.720> these<00:02:35.220> these<00:02:36.220> ear

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
you can actually fit these these ear

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.640 
you can actually fit these these ear
hooks<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.810> they're<00:02:37.930> very<00:02:38.050> simple<00:02:38.530> too

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
hooks on and they're very simple too

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.770 
hooks on and they're very simple too
though<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.830> just<00:02:39.160> offer<00:02:39.340> up<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:40.240> cable<00:02:40.660> in

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
though you just offer up the cable in

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.290 
though you just offer up the cable in
the<00:02:40.900> right<00:02:41.110> sort<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.620> length<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.940> then<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
the right sort of length and then you

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.020 
the right sort of length and then you
feed<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.320> cable<00:02:44.830> through<00:02:45.210> this<00:02:46.210> back<00:02:46.510> channel

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
feed the cable through this back channel

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.250 
feed the cable through this back channel
and<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.270> have<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.570> sort<00:02:49.720> push<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.170> into

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
and you just have to sort push it into

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.670 
and you just have to sort push it into
the<00:02:50.380> grooves<00:02:50.740> like<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:53.140> then<00:02:53.350> help

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
the grooves like so and then help

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.750 
the grooves like so and then help
through<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.190> back<00:02:54.520> groove<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.980> then<00:02:57.550> once

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
through this back groove and then once

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.110 
through this back groove and then once
that's<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.180> place<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:59.680> loops<00:03:00.460> can<00:03:00.790> actually

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
that's in place these loops can actually

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.190 
that's in place these loops can actually
go<00:03:01.300> over<00:03:01.740> your<00:03:02.740> earlobe<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.790> then<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:04.810> fits

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
go over your earlobe and then this fits

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.190 
go over your earlobe and then this fits
in<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:06.010> your<00:03:06.250> ear<00:03:06.670> canal<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.660> very<00:03:08.110> very

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
in to your ear canal so a very very

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.040 
in to your ear canal so a very very
effective<00:03:09.100> way<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.850> keeping<00:03:10.180> everything<00:03:10.780> in

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
effective way of keeping everything in

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.200 
effective way of keeping everything in
place<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.700> lot

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
place so I like that a lot

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.540 
place so I like that a lot
let's<00:03:14.170> take<00:03:14.380> this<00:03:14.530> off<00:03:14.710> again<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.250> I'm<00:03:15.430> going

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
let's take this off again and I'm going

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.920 
let's take this off again and I'm going

millimeter audio jack on it this is a
45-degree<00:03:29.200> angle<00:03:29.230> as<00:03:29.800> well<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.460> it's<00:03:30.610> a<00:03:30.730> nice

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
45-degree angle as well so it's a nice

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.540 
45-degree angle as well so it's a nice
sort<00:03:31.210> of<00:03:31.270> design<00:03:31.960> feature<00:03:32.350> makes<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.340> come<00:03:33.520> out

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
sort of design feature makes it come out

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.450 
sort of design feature makes it come out

an<00:03:36.730> angle<00:03:37.090> which<00:03:37.240> i<00:03:37.360> think<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.810> much<00:03:38.350> better

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
and that is the only issue I've got

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.620 
and that is the only issue I've got
