00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello everyone with you krauzer this is my 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.810
 first review mods 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.970
 Today vaguely browser in game Minekravt 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.710
 give the most senior browser agree 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.320
 you can think of a use for this 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.270
 to the substance of this rectangle 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.279
 give it run to run 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.199
 he is off clicking on the shift button pro mouse 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.390
 him to his forehead 7 will set abruptly white 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.800
 also all he activated now we 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.750
 fully activated in order to 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.940
 him with him continue to work on 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.550
 push again shift the truth reeds and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.100
 and we introduce some kind of what you need 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:47.199
 let's say a site well let's take where 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.720
 yandex yandex mister alaska translate 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.830
 yandex.ru there is everything and click ok 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.049
 everyone led us here immersed I lived 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.940
 With some kind of advertising , we do not need it now 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.769
 I will show how you can enter on it 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.360
 driver's letters naturally can 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.890
 cook go now let's say in the card 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.900
 we can go to see what the court 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.350
 beautiful burned your city perehali in 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.820
 the market slept okay okay slept 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.549
 go to the brand here everything is possible 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.340
 look great everything can be seen 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.290
 You can directly sit in mykrafte choose 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.200
 yourself some kind of microphone mouse for 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.400
 to minecraft all brinkley so 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.510
 let's take a look at 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.580
 crafting first installment 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.560
 this is the web screen itself what does this consist of 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.840
 huge rectangle 16 by 9 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.300
 I think everyone is familiar with the resolution of 16 by 9 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.560
 often say in reviews 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.840
 To paint you need three dye 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.270
 it's red green and lapis lazuli 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.880
 and the neck is in such glass 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.700
 panels of them turns 16 web screenshots 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.850
 which is filled again this is all 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.760
 the substance is necessary 144 just their 16 like 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.490
 that there will be 144 so I continue on 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.990
 how is he all craft this is mouse craft yes it is 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.159
 the most real mouse as the price is easy 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.390
 red dust stick ender pearls and 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.300
 the button also somehow costs enough 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.270
 cheap, in principle, only ender pearls 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.680
 although its too in bulk with us and now 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.039
 I show how you can print anything here 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.819
 enter push first on monitor now 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.690
 on the keyboard 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.849
 and we are connected now click where 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.740
 we want to introduce something let's say 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.590
 I want to enter here that I want to drive 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.470
 I do not know right now let's take a video 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.200
 let's say 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.040
 keyboard or there monitor could monitor 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.780
 monitor and wish to enter everything he starts 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.180
 look for 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.650
 to exit you need to press escape here to us 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.450
 already showed one monitor 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.580
 monitor is wonderful by the way now 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.830
 I'll show you the craft of the most real 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.330
 keyboard it is stone yes guys and who 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.130
 of us boasts a stone 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.170
 keyboard she got to air and 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.330
 the plates here are so thin it turns out 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.849
 of these looms and laid out counties 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.769
 middle red dust and such 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.040
 it turns out the keyboard is given two blocks 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.040
 look here cool keyboard two 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.170
 2 block unit clean and such huge and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.209
 not that everything was clearly visible I see 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.950
 principle from you fashion a bunch of use 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.510
 I will say the most basic is probably 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.780
 real cinema mikroft need 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.489
 beautifully all this issue and will 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.560
 real cinema without any pistons 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.810
 can I bring any video here 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.269
 in principle, it will even go with sound 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.580
 some cards and you can make arrested 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.350
 schemes to see you drive here redstone 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.150
 scheme on the monitor look on the Internet such 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.400
 super ration schemes which is very difficult 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.600
 remember to output puts this wrong 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.150
 next to everything you want to build 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.950
 the device is a jetter circuit build then 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.750
 when looked forgot a little bit again 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.690
 looked all done wonderful 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.340
 so real help miner 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.280

 quick not to go out 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.090
 rather than go to the real browser on 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.769
 computer therefore the principle of application 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.940
