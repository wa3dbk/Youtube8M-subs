I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> new<00:01:54.659> world<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.350> are<00:01:55.380> going

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
I think in the new world there are going

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
I think in the new world there are going
to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:56.100> more<00:01:56.130> devil<00:01:56.969> fruit<00:01:57.299> weapons

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to be way more devil fruit weapons

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.990 
to be way more devil fruit weapons
because<00:01:58.229> there<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.860> devil<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.280> user<00:01:59.579> army

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
because there is a devil for user army

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
because there is a devil for user army
so<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.240> makes<00:02:00.390> sense<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.530> would

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
so it makes sense to me that they would

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
so it makes sense to me that they would
try<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> make<00:02:02.100> more<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.579> devil<00:02:02.939> for

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
weapons speaking of the army i think

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310 
weapons speaking of the army i think
