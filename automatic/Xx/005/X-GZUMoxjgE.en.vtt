00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.920 
I thought I'd do a little test video
here<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.570> got<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> new<00:00:16.680> iPhone<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:18.119> today<00:00:18.539> well

here I got the new iPhone for today well
I<00:00:19.140> guess<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.529> not<00:00:19.650> new<00:00:19.920> its<00:00:20.100> new<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.550> me<00:00:20.580> but

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
I guess it's not new its new for me but

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.470 
I guess it's not new its new for me but
yeah<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.039> got<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> movie<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.090> phone<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
yeah so I got a movie on my phone I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.400 
yeah so I got a movie on my phone I
guess<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:26.300> we<00:00:27.300> were<00:00:27.390> trying<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.779> tow<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.170> low

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
guess I we were trying to tow it on low

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.980 
guess I we were trying to tow it on low
geese<00:00:28.680> obviously<00:00:29.519> he's<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:30.000> 12<00:00:30.420> he's<00:00:30.779> been

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
geese obviously he's got 12 he's been

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.770 
geese obviously he's got 12 he's been
doing<00:00:31.170> some<00:00:31.439> bids<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.279> figure<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:33.570> he

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
doing some bids on it so I figure if he

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.190 
doing some bids on it so I figure if he
can<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> copycat<00:00:34.559> goof<00:00:35.010> why<00:00:35.850> can't<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
can be a copycat goof why can't I but

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
can be a copycat goof why can't I but
then<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> text<00:00:38.219> message<00:00:38.550> from<00:00:38.850> him<00:00:39.210> he

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
then I got a text message from him he

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.470 
then I got a text message from him he
said<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:39.750> goof<00:00:40.290> police<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.980> goof<00:00:41.730> belizean

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
said I'm goof police you goof belizean

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.979 
said I'm goof police you goof belizean
so<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.280> very<00:00:44.520> nice<00:00:44.850> low-key<00:00:45.210> but

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so it's not very nice low-key but

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.910 
so it's not very nice low-key but
anyways<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> new<00:00:47.399> unit<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.989> just

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
in the middle of trying to figure it all

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.569 
in the middle of trying to figure it all
out<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.620> hook<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.629> I'm<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
out and hook it all up but I'm going to

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.090 
out and hook it all up but I'm going to
find<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.760> nice<00:00:56.940> home<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.859> stowed<00:00:58.859> away

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
find a nice home for that stowed away

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.650 
find a nice home for that stowed away
but<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.899> terabyte<00:01:02.210> motion<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
but this is a one terabyte motion you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.789 
but this is a one terabyte motion you
can<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:04.850> see<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:05.880> says<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.840> each<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
can see see what says are on each one it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.240 
can see see what says are on each one it
records<00:01:08.729> each<00:01:09.150> channel<00:01:09.630> independently<00:01:10.439> only

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
records each channel independently only

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
records each channel independently only
if<00:01:11.340> there's<00:01:11.580> motion<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> screen<00:01:12.900> but

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
if there's motion on the screen but

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.840 
if there's motion on the screen but
you'd<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.830> there's<00:01:14.189> water<00:01:14.490> dripping

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you'd see like there's water dripping

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
you'd see like there's water dripping
and<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> screens<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.770> stuff

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and in some of the screens and stuff

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.310 
and in some of the screens and stuff
like<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.610> set<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> sensitivity

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
like that so you can set the sensitivity

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
like that so you can set the sensitivity
so<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.470> every<00:01:19.710> time<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> car<00:01:20.220> drives<00:01:20.610> by<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
so like every time a car drives by and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.999 
so like every time a car drives by and
stuff<00:01:21.420> it'll<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:22.110> record<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> few

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
stuff it'll just record for a few

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
stuff it'll just record for a few
seconds<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.909> saves<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.960> know

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
seconds but it just saves you you know

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.450 
seconds but it just saves you you know
probably<00:01:25.409> record<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> friggin<00:01:26.700> year<00:01:28.460> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
probably record for a friggin year you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.870 
probably record for a friggin year you
know<00:01:30.740> recording<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.130> writ<00:01:32.430> whereas<00:01:32.729> if

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
know recording like this writ whereas if

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.140 
know recording like this writ whereas if
it<00:01:33.060> recorded<00:01:33.659> 24<00:01:34.259> hours<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> day<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.729> don't<00:01:35.939> get
