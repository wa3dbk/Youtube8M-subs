since<00:00:23.419> New<00:00:24.320> Jersey<00:00:24.650> how<00:00:24.860> was<00:00:25.040> it<00:00:25.239> it<00:00:26.239> was<00:00:26.360> good

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
since New Jersey how was it it was good

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.790 
since New Jersey how was it it was good
it<00:00:26.660> was<00:00:26.779> a<00:00:26.810> little<00:00:27.410> different<00:00:27.680> than<00:00:27.770> I

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
it was a little different than I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.630 
it was a little different than I
expected<00:00:28.279> it<00:00:28.400> was<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:29.860> just<00:00:30.860> initially<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:31.279> start

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
expected it was a just initially I start

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.639 
expected it was a just initially I start
from<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.880> beginning<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:33.170> seating<00:00:33.500> position

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
from the beginning the seating position

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.040 
from the beginning the seating position
and<00:00:34.160> never<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.760> way<00:00:35.120> Matt<00:00:35.360> rides<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.720> bike<00:00:35.899> it

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
and never the way Matt rides a bike it

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.900 
and never the way Matt rides a bike it
felt<00:00:36.230> really<00:00:36.410> awkward<00:00:36.710> compared<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.730> what<00:00:37.820> I'm

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
felt really awkward compared to what I'm

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.270 
felt really awkward compared to what I'm
used<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.359> I<00:00:38.480> don't<00:00:38.629> I<00:00:38.780> think<00:00:38.989> it's<00:00:39.109> just

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
used to and I don't I think it's just

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.459 
used to and I don't I think it's just
our<00:00:40.280> body<00:00:40.519> size<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:41.629> initially<00:00:42.140> was<00:00:42.260> like

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
our body size that initially was like

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.290 
our body size that initially was like
this<00:00:42.920> doesn't<00:00:43.219> feel<00:00:43.340> like<00:00:43.519> I'm<00:00:43.670> used<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:43.940> but<00:00:44.239> I

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
this doesn't feel like I'm used to but I

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.330 
this doesn't feel like I'm used to but I
was<00:00:44.449> fine<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:45.559> then<00:00:45.739> they<00:00:45.829> had<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.070> street

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
was fine and then they had the street

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.729 
was fine and then they had the street
shifting<00:00:47.239> pattern<00:00:47.570> which<00:00:47.719> I<00:00:48.170> haven't<00:00:48.559> done

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
shifting pattern which I haven't done

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.229 
shifting pattern which I haven't done
that<00:00:48.829> for<00:00:49.039> about<00:00:49.070> ten<00:00:49.340> years<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:50.059> was<00:00:50.210> a

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
that for about ten years so that was a

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.990 
that for about ten years so that was a
little<00:00:50.510> weird<00:00:50.780> but<00:00:51.070> in<00:00:52.070> general<00:00:52.609> just<00:00:52.879> the

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
little weird but in general just the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.360 
little weird but in general just the
feel<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.629> bike<00:00:53.809> was<00:00:54.050> easier<00:00:54.769> than<00:00:54.949> ride<00:00:55.190> than

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
feel the bike was easier than ride than

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.709 
feel the bike was easier than ride than
I<00:00:55.429> thought<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.760> would<00:00:55.850> be<00:00:56.000> from<00:00:56.239> things<00:00:56.539> I've

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
I thought it would be from things I've

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.739 
I thought it would be from things I've
written<00:00:56.839> in<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.050> past<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:58.640> power<00:00:59.300> banner<00:00:59.600> was

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
written in the past the power banner was

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.979 
written in the past the power banner was
really<00:01:00.109> linear<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:01.730> didn't<00:01:02.300> feel<00:01:02.420> big<00:01:02.629> hit<00:01:02.809> did

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
really linear I didn't feel big hit did

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.079 
really linear I didn't feel big hit did
you<00:01:03.109> know<00:01:03.559> now<00:01:03.829> exactly<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:04.640> don't<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.059> I

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
you know now exactly you don't you I

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.790 
you know now exactly you don't you I
expected<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.930> little<00:01:06.050> bit<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:06.440> it's<00:01:06.650> pretty

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
expected a little bit but it's pretty

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.660 
expected a little bit but it's pretty
mellow<00:01:07.100> yeah<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:08.030> it's<00:01:08.180> deceivingly<00:01:08.630> fast

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
mellow yeah but it's deceivingly fast

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.550

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
after the big horseshoe uh-huh I really

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.480 
after the big horseshoe uh-huh I really
came<00:01:15.260> out<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.560> there<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.680> cranked<00:01:16.070> on<00:01:16.160> it<00:01:16.400> in

came out of there and cranked on it in
second<00:01:16.850> gear<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.240> no<00:01:17.540> fast<00:01:17.780> no<00:01:18.260> but<00:01:18.890> then<00:01:19.040> the

next thing yeah but the next thing you
know<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:20.780> felt<00:01:21.230> like<00:01:21.260> oh<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.620> wheels<00:01:21.770> light<00:01:22.310> off

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
know I felt like oh the wheels light off

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.580 
know I felt like oh the wheels light off
the<00:01:22.700> ground<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.330> then<00:01:23.570> like<00:01:23.810> oh<00:01:24.020> yeah<00:01:24.230> the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
the ground and then like oh yeah the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.190 
the ground and then like oh yeah the
turn<00:01:24.800> came<00:01:25.070> yeah<00:01:25.670> quick<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.480> then<00:01:26.720> that's

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
turn came yeah quick and then that's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.750 
turn came yeah quick and then that's
what<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.410> noticed<00:01:27.830> was<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.160> didn't<00:01:28.370> feel<00:01:28.460> fast

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
what I noticed was it didn't feel fast

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.250 
what I noticed was it didn't feel fast
until<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.090> actually<00:01:29.180> tried<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.510> slow<00:01:29.780> down<00:01:29.960> for

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
until I actually tried to slow down for

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.100 
until I actually tried to slow down for
the<00:01:30.350> corner<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:31.720> especially<00:01:32.720> at<00:01:32.780> this<00:01:32.900> track

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
the corner and especially at this track

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.720 
the corner and especially at this track
you<00:01:33.140> can<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.410> go<00:01:33.530> from<00:01:33.710> such<00:01:33.920> high<00:01:34.100> speeds<00:01:34.430> to

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
you can you go from such high speeds to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.880 
you can you go from such high speeds to
like<00:01:34.880> almost<00:01:35.300> stopped<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:36.020> feels<00:01:36.230> like<00:01:36.440> so<00:01:36.650> I

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
like almost stopped it feels like so I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.650 
like almost stopped it feels like so I
think<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> different<00:01:38.000> track<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.360> probably

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
think it a different track it probably

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.440 
think it a different track it probably
feel<00:01:38.840> maybe<00:01:39.380> better<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.770> ride<00:01:40.040> but<00:01:40.340> all<00:01:41.120> in<00:01:41.270> all

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
feel maybe better to ride but all in all

bike I feel like I had to actually pull

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.670 
bike I feel like I had to actually pull
the<00:02:12.000> bike<00:02:12.150> over<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.480> little<00:02:12.690> bit<00:02:12.840> more<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.560> I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the bike over a little bit more and I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
the bike over a little bit more and I
would<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:13.830> gone<00:02:14.010> more<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.520> direction

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
would have gone more in that direction

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.150 
would have gone more in that direction
if<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.150> could<00:02:15.420> right<00:02:15.870> make<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> bike<00:02:16.740> more

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
if I could right make the bike more

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.930 
if I could right make the bike more
stable<00:02:17.880> less<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.540> know<00:02:18.660> less<00:02:18.960> turning<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.940> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
stable less you know less turning so you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.110 
stable less you know less turning so you
know<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.630> think<00:02:22.080> for<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.070> five<00:02:23.280> ten<00:02:23.520> laps<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
know I think for the five ten laps I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.540 
know I think for the five ten laps I
felt<00:02:24.720> pretty<00:02:24.900> good<00:02:24.990> with<00:02:25.410> what<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.650> was<00:02:25.770> very

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
felt pretty good with what it was very

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.230 
felt pretty good with what it was very
cool<00:02:26.730> yeah<00:02:27.210> at<00:02:27.930> my<00:02:28.110> speeds<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.680> couldn't<00:02:29.240> notice

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
cool yeah at my speeds I couldn't notice

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.030 
cool yeah at my speeds I couldn't notice
a<00:02:30.480> discernible<00:02:31.110> difference<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.440> felt<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
a discernible difference I felt like the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
a discernible difference I felt like the
one<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.270> said<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.600> falling<00:02:33.960> in<00:02:34.080> was<00:02:34.290> a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
one that you said was falling in was a

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.770 
one that you said was falling in was a
little<00:02:34.650> more<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:35.280> little<00:02:35.370> more<00:02:35.730> nervous<00:02:36.420> yeah

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
little more a little more nervous yeah

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.140 
little more a little more nervous yeah
and<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.710> other<00:02:37.920> one<00:02:38.070> felt<00:02:38.250> more<00:02:38.490> stable

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
and that the other one felt more stable

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.000 
and that the other one felt more stable
and<00:02:39.270> planted<00:02:39.660> yeah<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.440> doesn't<00:02:40.650> take<00:02:40.770> much

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
and planted yeah it doesn't take much

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
and planted yeah it doesn't take much
was<00:02:41.280> steering<00:02:41.550> head<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.270> get<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
was steering head to get that in the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.650 
was steering head to get that in the
feeling<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.790> were<00:02:44.910> definitely<00:02:45.090> unfair

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
feeling but you were definitely unfair

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.120 
feeling but you were definitely unfair
at<00:02:45.750> advantage<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.440> having<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> learn<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
at advantage with having to learn the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.940 
at advantage with having to learn the
bike<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> track<00:02:48.000> yeah<00:02:48.620> especially<00:02:49.620> here

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
bike and the track yeah especially here

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.920 
bike and the track yeah especially here
there's<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.190> lot<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.460> just<00:02:50.670> tight<00:02:51.180> corners<00:02:51.750> with

there's a lot of just tight corners with

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.810 
there's a lot of just tight corners with

can be pretty fun at speed like it could
flow<00:03:10.800> like<00:03:11.100> coming<00:03:11.970> off<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> banking<00:03:12.600> yeah

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
flow like coming off the banking yeah

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.870 
flow like coming off the banking yeah
it's<00:03:13.650> decent<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.220> not<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:14.700> not<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
it's decent it's not the it's not the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.460 
it's decent it's not the it's not the
worst<00:03:15.150> track<00:03:15.420> ah<00:03:15.470> worst<00:03:16.470> turn<00:03:16.650> attract<00:03:17.040> but

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
worst track ah worst turn attract but

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.260 
worst track ah worst turn attract but
you<00:03:19.470> know<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.650> general<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:20.340> tracks<00:03:20.610> just<00:03:20.880> kind

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
you know in general the tracks just kind

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.550 
you know in general the tracks just kind
of<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.420> compromised<00:03:21.930> office<00:03:22.200> because<00:03:22.380> it's

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
of a compromised office because it's

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.699 
of a compromised office because it's
it's<00:03:22.920> flat<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.610> twisty<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:25.380> know<00:03:25.530> your

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
it's flat and twisty but you know your

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.620 
it's flat and twisty but you know your
high<00:03:25.830> speed<00:03:25.890> stuff<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.540> little

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
high speed stuff and so it's a little

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.410 
high speed stuff and so it's a little
bumpy<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.920> know<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:30.030> what<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> was

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
bumpy to see you know that's what I was

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.060 
bumpy to see you know that's what I was
gonna<00:03:30.600> talk<00:03:30.959> about<00:03:31.110> next<00:03:31.380> was<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.620> bumps

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
gonna talk about next was the bumps

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.520 
gonna talk about next was the bumps
because<00:03:32.220> mat<00:03:32.790> suspension<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:33.930> stiff<00:03:34.290> I

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
because mat suspension is so stiff I

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
because mat suspension is so stiff I
mean<00:03:34.739> was<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.100> it's<00:03:35.430> stiff<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.030> or<00:03:36.270> did

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
mean was it a it's stiff for you or did

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.170 
mean was it a it's stiff for you or did
it<00:03:36.540> no<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> felt<00:03:37.320> stiff<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.800> then<00:03:38.190> also<00:03:38.370> um<00:03:38.790> they

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
it no I felt stiff and then also um they

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.160 
it no I felt stiff and then also um they
said<00:03:39.390> they<00:03:39.450> actually<00:03:39.720> backed<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.050> off<00:03:40.110> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
said they actually backed it off a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.410 
said they actually backed it off a
spring<00:03:40.530> right<00:03:40.650> yeah<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.220> yeah

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
spring right yeah so yeah

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.440 
spring right yeah so yeah
was<00:03:43.569> its<00:03:44.410> he<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.069> his<00:03:45.280> own<00:03:45.370> style<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.240> works

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
was its he is his own style and it works

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.449 
was its he is his own style and it works
great<00:03:46.750> for<00:03:46.810> him<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.470> think<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.830> takes<00:03:48.010> a

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
great for him and I think it takes a

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.449 
great for him and I think it takes a
certain<00:03:49.090> type<00:03:49.380> Rider<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.590> style<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.130> fit<00:03:51.310> that

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
certain type Rider and style to fit that

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.670 
certain type Rider and style to fit that
which<00:03:51.849> you<00:03:52.330> know<00:03:52.450> he's<00:03:53.080> different<00:03:53.260> Mars

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
which you know he's different Mars

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.280 
which you know he's different Mars
obviously<00:03:54.190> back<00:03:54.430> because<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.480> because<00:03:56.080> there's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
obviously back because I because there's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.750 
obviously back because I because there's
a<00:03:56.349> lot<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.620> bumps<00:03:56.890> coming<00:03:57.160> out<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.580> last

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760

probably the hardest part is just trying
to<00:04:23.830> stay<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.669> bike<00:04:24.820> going<00:04:25.300> through<00:04:25.510> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
to stay on the bike going through the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.690 
to stay on the bike going through the
bumps<00:04:25.870> cuz<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.169> know<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.650> know<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.040> tank<00:04:27.370> grip

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
bumps cuz you know and know a tank grip

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.080 
bumps cuz you know and know a tank grip
and<00:04:27.910> it's<00:04:28.030> slippery<00:04:28.389> and<00:04:29.639> but<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.669> liked<00:04:30.940> it

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
and it's slippery and but I liked it

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.180 
and it's slippery and but I liked it
braking<00:04:31.660> power<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.020> mean<00:04:32.229> it<00:04:32.380> was<00:04:32.500> fantastic<00:04:33.160> to

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
braking power I mean it was fantastic to

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.379 
braking power I mean it was fantastic to
me<00:04:33.400> but<00:04:33.550> I've<00:04:33.639> only<00:04:33.790> ever<00:04:33.880> really<00:04:34.240> written

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
me but I've only ever really written

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.210 
me but I've only ever really written
street<00:04:34.720> bikes<00:04:34.960> compared<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.889> other<00:04:36.040> race

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
street bikes compared to the other race

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.700 
street bikes compared to the other race
bikes<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.580> have<00:04:36.760> same-same<00:04:37.419> or<00:04:37.690> super<00:04:38.080> on<00:04:38.200> one

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
bikes you have same-same or super on one

bikes you have same-same or super on one
finger<00:04:38.979> yeah<00:04:39.520> I<00:04:40.000> couldn't<00:04:40.600> even<00:04:40.780> use<00:04:40.930> the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
finger yeah I couldn't even use the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.440 
finger yeah I couldn't even use the
brakes<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:43.419> max<00:04:43.660> because<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:46.060> bars<00:04:46.300> were

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
brakes to the max because the bars were

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.630 
brakes to the max because the bars were
so<00:04:46.630> low<00:04:46.840> every<00:04:47.260> time<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.440> try<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.770> put<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.370> lot<00:04:48.550> of

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
levers down a little Teddy to mop it I

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.390 
levers down a little Teddy to mop it I
rotated<00:05:14.050> much<00:05:14.200> yeah<00:05:14.350> they're<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.650> lot<00:05:15.160> down

rotated much yeah they're a lot down
further<00:05:15.729> than<00:05:15.910> what<00:05:16.030> I'm<00:05:16.120> used<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.419> doing<00:05:16.539> okay

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
further than what I'm used to doing okay
