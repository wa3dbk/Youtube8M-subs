00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.259
 welcome to the upper deck in 2013 with 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.759
 the brand new revo now too 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.370
 will finally be in germany soon 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.889
 we've got regus full 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.509
 Wired are the headphones in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.860
 his headphones are above all the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.809
 Wines are interesting because you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.490
 she can drive by nfc and that the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490
 unboxing so we'll go right now 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.890
 had to and only make the two films 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.199
 or so close tesafilm here 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.060
 pull up, so to speak, and then we come 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 also fast in the box when 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 I am strong 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 After a week's effect is no more 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.469
 quite simply on the other side too 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.210
 Again we do not expect that now 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.930
 but we have too many packaging in it 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 are excited 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.829
 the price would have to be over 200 euros 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.059
 lie for the wireless and from the in 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.800
 Wired there are two again 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.670
 versions then according to the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.610
 So we have prices once 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 a black box their 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.060
 Let's see what they will be in me 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.090
 think a cable that you can 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.200
 also wired the wireless exactly 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.320
 as you can see we once have 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.580
 a usb charging cable in orange micro-usb 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.080
 so of course you could , for example 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.660
 also for your phones use eg 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.060
 smartphones then we have a standards 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.650
 three and a half meters connection and at 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.120
 both hands that is finally that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.580
 what you plug in your headphones 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.050
 the headphones and the phone call can do it 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.740
 also use the other way around because they both 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.450
 are exactly the same and here is also 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.950
 microphone is not forgotten there 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.450
 so if she uses wired 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.840
 could also be calls to the with 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.210
 1 button percent on android and ios 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
 and of course a small bag 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.270
 we already from jÃ¶rg m 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.680
 this standard bag here the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 actually lets sound through 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.890
 being in the scenarios does not have it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.149
 But you can really be here 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.450
 wonderful to pull up nice and there 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.399
 the headphones reintun so natural yet 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.930
 something to read here getting started and 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.020
 I think here are also still 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.610
 sticker and similar in it exactly yourself 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.260
 a few things but that's what I want now 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 Not so much here also his 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.830
 names 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.310
 these are papers here and of course then 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.290
 the revo itself here with one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.740
 Velcro is still beautiful 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.740
 strong here 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.300
 built when you should buy it 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.250
 work wonderfully and look us 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.690
 always we have on it mwc 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.730
 you can already see it 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.120
 fold up so take away are 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.610
 she really is really great 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.930
 comfortable and nice small and can drive 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.540
 you here a course nor the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.670
 size then fall quite high 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.420
 So at least five inches here on 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.940
 both sides 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.170
 so that they too convenient for everyone are the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.090
 Sentences before then could see 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.130
 how it looks like then put it on 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.480
 Press down a bit and have already 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.640
 We are really comfortable headphones here 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.020
 they are already setting the tone here 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.530
 bit for me then wants to get in here 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.420
 the hall 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.800
 So I hear myself now more like 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.660
 anything that happens around me 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.830
 but you do not have any active news 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.570
 look a bit hard 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.370
 we will have here, of course 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.840
 the micro-usb connection already said 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.900
 here could be bluetooth pairing 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.970
 turn on and then turn on 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.320
 we still have two status leds what i have 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.630
 can show so you can see that 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.739
 glows green accordingly and when I am 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.540
 here long with bluetooth on it remains 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.040
 then I think it is starting to blue 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.260
 It's exactly there that it blinks 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.130
 and then of course I can pair 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.230
 of course you can still be interesting 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.090
 not just the whole pair with all 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.570
 but also operate according to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.650
 the wireless business touch design here 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.450
 in the middle is a player 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.940
 impulse could turn accordingly for 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.220
 volume and I still believe it 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.390
 another gesture going forward and back 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.190
 but it actually looks like it even here 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.150
 So touch twice on one side 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.040
 is then 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.450
 if it's the last song and so on 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.310
 and on the other side until then 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.720
 according to still nfc installed that is 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.090
 you can take your smartphone to 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.709
 example Samsung Galaxy S3 on it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.879
 put and already is with bluetooth 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.799
 connected and you do not have to think 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.310
 Pairing mode go in and so on 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.110
 and so on 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.650
 and yes it was a chance of that 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.209
 first impression of the first hands-on 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.700
 and here can also look very stable 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.010
 similar to this example or 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.150
 the sol republic so that should be too 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.650
 not quite as easily broken and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.819
 that they are completely off yet 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.010
 Metal here that really feels 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.239
 very high quality and it has too 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.159
 still in the know as I have already said 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.590
 the speech is the first one thinks only 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.329
 have watched in black orange my 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.109
 name is alaska with the first unboxing 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.880
 of the brand new talk here from jabra to 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:21.340
 next time 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.340
 from the term 2013 1100 spectators
