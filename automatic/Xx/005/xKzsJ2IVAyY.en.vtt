00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
reports in Excel of course have you ever

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.649

had<00:01:09.960> too<00:01:10.290> many<00:01:10.439> columns<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.420> time

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
had too many columns to see at one time

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.940 
had too many columns to see at one time
and<00:01:12.900> you've<00:01:12.990> had<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> continually<00:01:13.650> scroll

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and you've had to continually scroll

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.289 
and you've had to continually scroll
back<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> forth<00:01:14.460> yeah<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> think<00:01:15.030> that's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
back and forth yeah I think that's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.550 
back and forth yeah I think that's
pretty<00:01:15.509> typical<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.049> basically<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
pretty typical you basically have to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.899 
pretty typical you basically have to
freeze<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> frames<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.460> toggle<00:01:17.729> between

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
freeze the frames or you toggle between

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
freeze the frames or you toggle between
the<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.540> back<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.750> forth<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> pretty

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the two go back and forth it is pretty

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.230 
the two go back and forth it is pretty
typical<00:01:19.920> let<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.280> show<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.460> an<00:01:20.610> example<00:01:20.670> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
typical let me show you an example I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.990 
typical let me show you an example I
