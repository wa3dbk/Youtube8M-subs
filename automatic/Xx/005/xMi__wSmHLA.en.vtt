00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.020 
see where the eSports mentality can come
into<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.260> especially<00:03:59.160> from<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.670> death<00:03:59.820> panel

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
into it especially from the death panel

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.030 
into it especially from the death panel
where<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.900> guys<00:04:01.019> consider<00:04:01.560> what<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:01.950> guys

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
where you guys consider what you guys

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.490 
where you guys consider what you guys
think<00:04:02.190> about<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.549> upcoming<00:04:03.410> possibility<00:04:04.410> of

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
think about the upcoming possibility of

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.350 
think about the upcoming possibility of
a<00:04:04.560> spectator<00:04:04.980> mode<00:04:05.190> if<00:04:05.940> we<00:04:06.120> could<00:04:06.269> have

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
a spectator mode if we could have

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.430 
a spectator mode if we could have
spectator<00:04:06.840> mode<00:04:06.989> that'd<00:04:07.200> be<00:04:07.260> fantastic

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
spectator mode that'd be fantastic

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.860 
spectator mode that'd be fantastic
because<00:04:07.860> people<00:04:08.250> do<00:04:08.489> genuinely<00:04:09.120> want<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.720> see

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
because people do genuinely want to see

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.069 
because people do genuinely want to see
how<00:04:10.079> we<00:04:10.140> do<00:04:10.530> things<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:11.220> know<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:12.870> know<00:04:12.930> the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
how we do things you know you know the

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.870 
how we do things you know you know the
abilities<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.470> we<00:04:13.799> do<00:04:13.980> how<00:04:14.430> fast<00:04:14.700> we<00:04:14.850> can

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
abilities that we do how fast we can

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.400 
abilities that we do how fast we can
fight<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.480> things<00:04:15.570> like<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.810> would<00:04:16.079> be<00:04:16.200> great

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
fight and things like I would be great

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.409

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
but also from a recording perspective as

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.240 
but also from a recording perspective as
well<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.780> mean<00:04:19.140> at<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.320> moment<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:19.950> all<00:04:20.220> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
well I mean at the moment I do all the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.920 
well I mean at the moment I do all the
recording<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.030> matches<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.450> we<00:04:21.660> play

put them onto YouTube or whatnot but

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.180
