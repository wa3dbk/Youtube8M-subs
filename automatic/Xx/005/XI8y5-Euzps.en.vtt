00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.320 
song United so unlike the bass the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
guitar doesn't have a whole lot of that

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.029 
guitar doesn't have a whole lot of that
same<00:00:15.750> repetitive<00:00:16.320> line<00:00:16.529> through<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.890> whole

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
same repetitive line through the whole

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.220 
same repetitive line through the whole
thing<00:00:20.180> there's<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.539> much<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> going

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
thing there's not as much of that going

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
thing there's not as much of that going
on<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> guitar<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:24.119> song<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.510> there

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
on on the guitar in this song as there

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.370 
on on the guitar in this song as there
is<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> bass<00:00:25.670> it's<00:00:26.869> there's<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.260> bit

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
is on the bass it's there's a little bit

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
is on the bass it's there's a little bit
of<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.070> exactly<00:00:29.730> necessary

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
of that it's not exactly necessary

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.209 
of that it's not exactly necessary
though<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.590> mostly<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> be

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
though so it's mostly going to be

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.060 
though so it's mostly going to be
dealing<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.610> rhythm<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:34.530> couple<00:00:34.770> lead

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
dealing with rhythm and a couple lead

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.180 
dealing with rhythm and a couple lead
parts<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.710> first<00:00:37.920> part

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
parts here and there so that first part

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700 
parts here and there so that first part
we<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.610> hear<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> guitar<00:00:39.239> come<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.930> on

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
we really hear the guitar come in is on

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.330 
we really hear the guitar come in is on
the<00:00:40.890> very<00:00:41.460> first<00:00:41.820> pre-chorus<00:00:42.450> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
the very first pre-chorus kind of a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.069 
the very first pre-chorus kind of a
fairly<00:00:44.340> simple<00:00:44.789> lead<00:00:44.969> line<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.719> little

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
fairly simple lead line with a little

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.750 
fairly simple lead line with a little
bit<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> delay<00:00:46.530> or<00:00:46.680> reverb<00:00:47.010> whichever<00:00:47.520> one<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
bit of delay or reverb whichever one you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.400 
bit of delay or reverb whichever one you
prefer

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
prefer

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.670 
prefer
so<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.559> lines<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.010> start<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> B<00:00:51.680> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so that lines going to start on a B you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.799 
so that lines going to start on a B you
can<00:00:52.829> start<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.730> third<00:00:54.149> string<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
can start up on the third string on the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:10.290 
can start up on the third string on the
fourth<00:00:55.110> fret

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.990 

so<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.450> lines<00:01:11.660> basically<00:01:11.930> between<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.620> B<00:01:13.100> C

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
so that lines basically between a B C

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.210 
so that lines basically between a B C
sharp<00:01:14.270> E<00:01:14.450> flat<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.110> an<00:01:15.260> E<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:15.830> that's<00:01:16.010> pretty

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
sharp E flat and an E so that's pretty

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.200 
sharp E flat and an E so that's pretty
much<00:01:16.310> gonna<00:01:16.700> go

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
much gonna go

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.440 
much gonna go
during<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.810> first<00:01:18.050> pre-chorus<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.240> up<00:01:20.240> until

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
during the first pre-chorus and up until

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.080 
during the first pre-chorus and up until
the<00:01:21.020> vocals<00:01:21.380> come<00:01:21.530> back<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:21.860> for<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.670> second

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
the vocals come back in for the second

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:39.029 
the vocals come back in for the second
verse<00:01:23.270> starting<00:01:23.720> from<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:23.960> be

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.149 

and<00:01:40.119> then<00:01:41.119> once<00:01:41.390> we<00:01:41.630> get<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.679> end<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.070> the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
and then once we get to the end of the

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.370 
and then once we get to the end of the
pre-course<00:01:43.729> you're<00:01:44.030> gonna<00:01:44.149> kind<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:45.049> loop<00:01:45.200> it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
pre-course you're gonna kind of loop it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.929 
pre-course you're gonna kind of loop it
back<00:01:45.409> again<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.159> it's<00:01:46.280> going<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.429> be<00:01:46.549> half<00:01:46.819> of

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
back again but it's going to be half of

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.779 
back again but it's going to be half of
that<00:01:50.649> it<00:01:51.649> was<00:01:51.770> pretty<00:01:51.979> much<00:01:52.130> gonna<00:01:52.369> go<00:01:52.520> from

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
that it was pretty much gonna go from

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.569 
that it was pretty much gonna go from
the<00:01:53.149> B<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.899> C<00:01:54.200> sharp<00:01:54.439> E<00:01:54.740> flat<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.399> then

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
the B to the C sharp E flat and then

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:04.650 
the B to the C sharp E flat and then
back<00:01:55.850> down

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.210 

there<00:02:05.660> is<00:02:05.870> another<00:02:06.230> lead<00:02:06.590> line<00:02:06.890> in<00:02:07.130> that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
there is another lead line in that

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
string of course so the first part

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:30.210 
string of course so the first part
you're<00:02:20.930> gonna<00:02:20.990> go<00:02:21.140> between<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.500> B<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.130> b-flat

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.490 

the<00:02:31.220> second<00:02:31.670> part<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.270> an<00:02:32.600> E<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.110> an<00:02:33.320> E

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the second part of it is an E and an E

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.260 
the second part of it is an E and an E
flat<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.070> can<00:02:34.190> either<00:02:34.400> play<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.940> down

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
flat and you can either play that down

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.730 
flat and you can either play that down
here<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:38.030> up<00:02:38.060> here<00:02:41.020> so<00:02:42.020> it's<00:02:42.170> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> go<00:02:42.500> like

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
here or up here so it's going to go like

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:58.980 
here or up here so it's going to go like
this<00:02:49.810> or<00:02:50.810> like<00:02:51.500> this

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.900 

at<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.200> end<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.590> there's<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:01.220> little<00:03:01.490> bend

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
at the end of that there's a little bend

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.080 
at the end of that there's a little bend
to<00:03:02.330> kind<00:03:02.570> of<00:03:02.630> finish<00:03:02.810> off<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.170> line<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
to kind of finish off the line so the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.140 
to kind of finish off the line so the
bend<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.630> from<00:03:09.050> an<00:03:09.170> e-flat<00:03:09.590> bending<00:03:10.580> up<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.970> an

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
bend is from an e-flat bending up to an

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.550 
bend is from an e-flat bending up to an
e<00:03:11.330> then<00:03:11.750> back<00:03:12.050> down<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.590> down<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> D<00:03:14.560> for

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
e then back down and down to a D for

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.070 
e then back down and down to a D for
that<00:03:15.740> reason<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.310> kind<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.670> prefer<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:17.150> use<00:03:17.360> this

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
that reason I kind of prefer to use this

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:31.870 
that reason I kind of prefer to use this
version<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.560> from<00:03:21.800> that<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.190> flat<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:30.700> then<00:03:31.700> you

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
version so from that a flat and then you

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:41.020 
version so from that a flat and then you
end<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.240> that<00:03:32.450> B<00:03:32.660> again<00:03:32.960> so<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.880> whole

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
end on that B again so so that whole

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:50.860 
end on that B again so so that whole
thing<00:03:41.270> together

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.750 

so<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.110> basic<00:03:52.740> chord<00:03:52.950> progression<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.550> goes

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
so the basic chord progression that goes

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.390 
so the basic chord progression that goes
through<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.570> verse<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.200> pre-chorus<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
through the verse and the pre-chorus and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.600 
through the verse and the pre-chorus and
the<00:03:57.150> little<00:03:57.390> instrumental<00:03:57.870> parts<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.890> G

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
the little instrumental parts is a G

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:11.060 
the little instrumental parts is a G
sharp<00:03:59.820> minor<00:04:00.090> E<00:04:04.400> B<00:04:06.200> F<00:04:07.200> sharp<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.710> second

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
sharp minor E B F sharp so the second

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.010 
sharp minor E B F sharp so the second
time<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.340> get<00:04:11.490> to<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.790> pre-chorus<00:04:12.270> we're

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
time we get to the pre-chorus we're

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.200 
time we get to the pre-chorus we're
gonna<00:04:13.140> do<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.560> basic<00:04:14.220> chord<00:04:14.700> progression

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
gonna do that basic chord progression

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:32.560 
gonna do that basic chord progression
they're<00:04:15.390> kind<00:04:16.080> in<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.260> back

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.690 

now<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.630> chords<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.170> I'm<00:04:34.350> using<00:04:34.680> I'm<00:04:35.430> using

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
now the chords that I'm using I'm using

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.310 
now the chords that I'm using I'm using
a<00:04:36.000> root<00:04:36.750> v<00:04:37.200> octave<00:04:37.920> shape<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:42.720> can<00:04:42.900> do<00:04:43.080> just

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
a root v octave shape you can do just

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.540 
a root v octave shape you can do just
the<00:04:43.470> root<00:04:43.590> insis<00:04:43.890> if<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.190> want<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:47.310> like

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
the root insis if you want I just like

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.710 
the root insis if you want I just like
it<00:04:47.730> with<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.910> octave<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.240> makes<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.570> little

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
it with the octave that makes a little

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.100 
it with the octave that makes a little
more<00:04:48.900> full<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.210> next<00:04:54.390> part<00:04:54.630> we<00:04:54.750> got<00:04:54.840> is<00:04:54.990> the

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
more full so the next part we got is the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.670 
more full so the next part we got is the
chorus<00:04:55.560> that's<00:04:56.370> gonna<00:04:56.720> go<00:04:57.720> between<00:04:57.960> B<00:04:58.650> e

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
chorus that's gonna go between B e

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.450 
chorus that's gonna go between B e
f-sharp<00:04:59.400> and<00:05:00.000> g-sharp<00:05:00.090> minor<00:05:01.070> so<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.250> course

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
f-sharp and g-sharp minor so the course

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:20.960 
f-sharp and g-sharp minor so the course
is<00:05:02.580> gonna<00:05:02.790> go<00:05:02.940> like<00:05:03.150> this

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.670 

after<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.090> first<00:05:22.390> course<00:05:22.780> during<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.500> verse

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
after the first course during the verse

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.470 
after the first course during the verse
there's<00:05:24.040> a<00:05:24.160> part<00:05:24.610> where<00:05:24.760> it's<00:05:24.910> just<00:05:25.090> pretty

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
there's a part where it's just pretty

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.560 
there's a part where it's just pretty
much<00:05:25.570> vocals<00:05:26.170> and<00:05:26.320> guitar<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:28.060> parts<00:05:28.420> going

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
much vocals and guitar that parts going

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.990 
much vocals and guitar that parts going
to<00:05:28.630> be<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:29.260> same<00:05:29.500> basic<00:05:29.950> progression<00:05:30.130> except

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
to be the same basic progression except

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.860 
to be the same basic progression except
you're<00:05:31.750> going<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:31.930> go<00:05:32.080> between<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.830> high<00:05:33.220> E<00:05:33.250> and

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
you're going to go between a high E and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.130 
you're going to go between a high E and
a<00:05:34.870> high<00:05:35.020> f-sharp

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.990 

personally<00:05:41.140> I<00:05:41.170> prefer<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:42.280> mix<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.700> up<00:05:42.820> between

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
personally I prefer to mix it up between

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000 
personally I prefer to mix it up between
the<00:05:43.210> highs<00:05:43.450> and<00:05:43.480> the<00:05:43.750> lows<00:05:43.810> to<00:05:44.680> make<00:05:44.830> it<00:05:44.950> a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
the highs and the lows to make it a

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.860 
the highs and the lows to make it a
little<00:05:45.190> more<00:05:45.310> diverse<00:05:45.970> make<00:05:46.570> it<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.750> little

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
little more diverse make it a little

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.710 
little more diverse make it a little
fuller<00:05:47.400> so<00:05:48.400> this<00:05:48.580> is<00:05:48.760> a<00:05:48.790> basic<00:05:49.150> idea<00:05:49.600> of<00:05:49.660> what

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
fuller so this is a basic idea of what

00:05:49.720 --> 00:06:13.050 
fuller so this is a basic idea of what
I'd<00:05:49.990> like<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.410> do<00:05:50.680> with<00:05:50.770> it

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.240 

next<00:06:14.060> part<00:06:14.360> is<00:06:14.570> the<00:06:14.750> bridge<00:06:15.050> that's<00:06:15.980> pretty

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
next part is the bridge that's pretty

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.950 
next part is the bridge that's pretty
much<00:06:16.340> going<00:06:16.550> between<00:06:16.760> the<00:06:17.030> c-sharp<00:06:17.360> minor<00:06:17.600> and

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
much going between the c-sharp minor and

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:38.350 
much going between the c-sharp minor and
in<00:06:18.140> E<00:06:35.950> so<00:06:36.950> as<00:06:37.070> you<00:06:37.190> can<00:06:37.310> see<00:06:37.460> there's<00:06:37.670> that<00:06:37.880> B<00:06:38.180> at

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
in E so as you can see there's that B at

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.990 
in E so as you can see there's that B at
the<00:06:38.540> end<00:06:38.720> there<00:06:38.990> that<00:06:39.400> just<00:06:40.400> kind<00:06:40.580> of<00:06:40.610> closes

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
the end there that just kind of closes

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.240 
the end there that just kind of closes
it<00:06:41.090> up<00:06:41.240> and<00:06:41.480> gets<00:06:41.870> it<00:06:42.140> ready<00:06:42.170> for<00:06:42.470> the<00:06:43.010> course

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
it up and gets it ready for the course

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.630 
it up and gets it ready for the course
again<00:06:47.740> once<00:06:48.740> the<00:06:48.860> bridge<00:06:49.070> is<00:06:49.190> done<00:06:49.340> there's<00:06:49.580> a

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640 
again once the bridge is done there's a

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.350 
again once the bridge is done there's a
few<00:06:49.880> breaks<00:06:50.210> once<00:06:50.780> we<00:06:50.990> get<00:06:51.110> to<00:06:51.260> the<00:06:51.380> chorus

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
few breaks once we get to the chorus

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.810 
few breaks once we get to the chorus
they're<00:06:53.360> gonna<00:06:53.510> go<00:06:54.130> the<00:06:55.130> first<00:06:55.310> one's<00:06:55.520> gonna
