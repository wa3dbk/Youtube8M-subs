00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.730
 What will happen with time 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.070
 next few hours and fundamentally 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.080
 we add to that question maría vélez 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.820
 what has to do with the localities 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.310
 tourist ones that preferably 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.769
 the public prefers to pass this end 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.840
 long week these three days why 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.210
 we select some of the many 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.220
 locations where Argentines go to 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.610
 enjoy this last long holiday 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.320
 of the year 2010 well let's start 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.170
 then to see how the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.210
 situation for example in the center of 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.969
 country where we said that the conditions 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.460
 weather are very nice 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.649
 temperatures in slight rise is the case 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.899
 from cordoba cielos practically 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.609
 clear to slightly cloudy with 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.280
 temperature as we see on average 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.319
 around the 24 degrees there from 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.850
 córdoba we go to another of the 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:50.979
 also preferred locations like 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.729
 may be the area of the Buenos Aires coast 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:57.609
 to know how the time comes the coast 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.679
 Mar del Plata for example between 11 and 16 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.809
 degrees to start Saturday and Sunday the 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.909
 Sunday maybe a little bit cloudy 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.199
 cool in the morning but in the afternoon 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.049
 transforms into water 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.240
 there are other locations also where 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.100
 people mostly choose this end of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 week as is the case with cataracts 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.979
 in iguazú the chord temperatures for 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.009
 the north of our country average 28 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.100
 degrees the sky practically clear 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.329
 we move forward and we also go to bariloche 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.250
 see what happens with 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.990
 cool temperatures in the morning in the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.759
 Saturday's case may be something 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.189
 unstable still in the morning but 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.280
 quickly improves and starts to ascend 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.439
 the temperature we also go to another 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.270
 locality as mendoza to know how 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.220
 is going to be this long weekend 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.259
 where the conditions are good between 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.840
 Saturday and Sunday but tension that the 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.720
 Monday and becomes probability 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.280
 of rainfall and some storms 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.530
 isolated and finally closer to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.569
 buenos aires-rosario to know how it goes 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.759
 to be this weekend where the 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.349
 temperatures will be much more pleasant 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.409
 than in the city of buenos aires- the 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.450
 time also accompanies so the sky 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.399
 will be practically clear or 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.440
 slightly cloudy as is the case 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.019
 also from the city of buenos aires 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.790
 where between Saturday and Sunday there may be 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.530
 a little more 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.350
 but the weather conditions in 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.870
 definitive except for the south that would be 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.340
 usual in this case where they are forecast 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.930
 some rain for the weekend 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.230
 all the rest of the national territory 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.530
 with excellent conditions great in 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.530
 weather
