00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
let me let me talk about a category of

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.450 
let me let me talk about a category of
things<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.230> most<00:00:04.380> advanced<00:00:04.830> phones<00:00:05.190> are

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
things the most advanced phones are

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.640 
things the most advanced phones are
called<00:00:05.670> smartphones<00:00:07.220> so<00:00:08.220> they<00:00:08.400> say<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.650> they

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
called smartphones so they say and they

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.830 
called smartphones so they say and they
typically<00:00:11.070> combine<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> phone<00:00:11.969> plus<00:00:12.570> some

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
typically combine a phone plus some

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.709 
typically combine a phone plus some
email<00:00:13.590> capability<00:00:14.400> plus<00:00:14.940> they<00:00:15.210> say<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
email capability plus they say it's the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.779 
email capability plus they say it's the
Internet's<00:00:16.199> or<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> baby<00:00:16.710> internet<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
Internet's or the baby internet in the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.099 
Internet's or the baby internet in the
one<00:00:17.970> device<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.539> they<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.960> these

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
one device and they all have these

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.820 
one device and they all have these
plastic<00:00:20.070> little<00:00:20.310> keyboards<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
plastic little keyboards on them and the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.150 
plastic little keyboards on them and the
problem<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:24.019> they're<00:00:25.019> not<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.560> smart<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
problem is that they're not so smart and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.269 
problem is that they're not so smart and
they're<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.359> easy<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.840> use<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
they're not so easy to use so if you

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
they're not so easy to use so if you
kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.609> make<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.840> know<00:00:30.929> business<00:00:31.289> school

phones are kind of right there they're

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
phones are kind of right there they're
not<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.340> smart<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.270> they're<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
not so smart and they're you know not so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.180 
not so smart and they're you know not so
easy<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.890> use<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:43.350> smart<00:00:43.739> phones<00:00:44.010> are

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
easy to use but smart phones are

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
easy to use but smart phones are
definitely<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> little<00:00:44.789> smarter<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.450> they

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
definitely a little smarter but they

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.500 
definitely a little smarter but they
actually<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:46.200> harder<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> use<00:00:47.160> their<00:00:48.000> really

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
actually are harder to use their really

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
actually are harder to use their really
complicated<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.039> basic<00:00:50.460> stuff

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
complicated just for the basic stuff

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
complicated just for the basic stuff
people<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> hard<00:00:51.660> time<00:00:51.840> figuring<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.320> how

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
people have a hard time figuring out how

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010 
people have a hard time figuring out how
to<00:00:52.440> use<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:53.390> well<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.539> don't<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> do

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
to use them well we don't want to do

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.380 
to use them well we don't want to do
either<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.710> these<00:00:55.890> things<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.180> want

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
either one of these things what we want

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.590 
either one of these things what we want
to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.870> make<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.500> leapfrog<00:00:58.620> product<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to do is make a leapfrog product that is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.500 
to do is make a leapfrog product that is
way<00:01:01.590> smarter<00:01:02.039> than<00:01:02.280> any<00:01:02.640> mobile<00:01:02.760> device<00:01:03.120> has

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
way smarter than any mobile device has

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.859 
way smarter than any mobile device has
ever<00:01:03.660> been<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.140> super<00:01:05.070> easy<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.610> use<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.540> is

research and development and of course

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.649 
research and development and of course
it's<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.369> interplay<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.880> hardware<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it's an interplay of hardware and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.649 
it's an interplay of hardware and

anything we want put any user interface
up<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:51.390> pointing<00:02:51.900> device<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:52.920> solved<00:02:53.250> it

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
up and a pointing device we solved it

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.120 
up and a pointing device we solved it
with<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.580> mouse<00:02:53.750> right<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:55.650> solve<00:02:55.950> this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
with the mouse right we solve this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.740 
with the mouse right we solve this
problem<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:56.640> how<00:02:56.820> are<00:02:56.880> we<00:02:56.970> going<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.270> take<00:02:57.540> this
