00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.290 

earlier<00:00:22.300> in<00:00:22.750> my<00:00:22.780> career<00:00:23.590> I<00:00:24.220> made<00:00:25.000> some

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
earlier in my career I made some

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.180 
earlier in my career I made some
boo-boos<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:26.020> learning<00:00:26.380> how<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.530> film<00:00:26.920> I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
boo-boos and learning how to film I

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.420 
boo-boos and learning how to film I
think<00:00:27.610> we<00:00:27.789> all<00:00:28.090> have<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.650> is<00:00:29.890> actually

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
think we all have this is actually

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.490 
think we all have this is actually
Glenn's<00:00:30.789> very<00:00:31.390> first<00:00:31.720> guitar<00:00:32.169> which

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
Glenn's very first guitar which

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.090 
Glenn's very first guitar which
surprisingly<00:00:33.160> sounds<00:00:33.670> really<00:00:33.940> good<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:35.100> it's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
surprisingly sounds really good it it's

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.720 
surprisingly sounds really good it it's
not<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.059> bad-looking<00:00:37.300> guitar<00:00:37.960> but<00:00:38.859> he<00:00:39.519> made<00:00:39.699> a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
not a bad-looking guitar but he made a

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.180 
not a bad-looking guitar but he made a
few<00:00:39.969> mistakes<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.719> if<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:41.589> look<00:00:41.800> close<00:00:42.159> you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
few mistakes and if you look close you

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.969 
few mistakes and if you look close you
can<00:00:42.579> see<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:44.260> we<00:00:44.469> go<00:00:44.620> with<00:00:45.339> glue<00:00:45.609> signature

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
can see here we go with glue signature

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.950 
can see here we go with glue signature
now<00:00:47.979> he<00:00:48.429> did<00:00:48.609> tell<00:00:48.850> me<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.059> he<00:00:49.390> knew<00:00:49.539> super

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
now he did tell me that he knew super

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.709 
now he did tell me that he knew super
glue<00:00:50.109> on<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.440> binding<00:00:50.859> now<00:00:51.819> the<00:00:51.879> problem<00:00:52.600> with

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
glue on the binding now the problem with

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.779 
glue on the binding now the problem with
using<00:00:52.989> super<00:00:53.679> glue<00:00:53.859> on<00:00:54.069> the<00:00:54.309> binding

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
using super glue on the binding

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.729 
using super glue on the binding
especially<00:00:55.479> when<00:00:55.659> we're<00:00:55.839> talking<00:00:56.019> mahogany

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
especially when we're talking mahogany

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.059 
especially when we're talking mahogany
is<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.969> it<00:00:58.239> has<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.449> tendency<00:00:59.069> because

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
is that it has a tendency because

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.840 
is that it has a tendency because
mahogany<00:01:00.789> is<00:01:00.909> so<00:01:01.059> porous<00:01:01.389> it'll<00:01:01.929> suck<00:01:02.170> into<00:01:02.530> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
mahogany is so porous it'll suck into it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.980 
mahogany is so porous it'll suck into it
then<00:01:03.850> whatever<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.930> put<00:01:05.199> in<00:01:05.530> as<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:06.220> filler<00:01:06.990> or

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
then whatever you put in as a filler or

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.810 
then whatever you put in as a filler or
a<00:01:08.049> stain<00:01:08.710> it<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:10.479> shows<00:01:10.960> up<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.250> when<00:01:12.670> you're

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
a stain it just shows up so when you're

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.749 
a stain it just shows up so when you're
doing<00:01:13.000> your<00:01:13.390> binding<00:01:14.170> work<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.649> like<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.549> use

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
doing your binding work I like to use

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.190 
doing your binding work I like to use
fish<00:01:16.329> glue<00:01:16.539> or<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.380> will<00:01:18.130> we<00:01:18.219> use<00:01:18.810> tight<00:01:19.810> bonds

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
fish glue or I will we use tight bonds

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.639 
fish glue or I will we use tight bonds
but<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.350> do<00:01:20.439> prefer<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.890> fish<00:01:21.159> group<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:21.670> then

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
but I do prefer the fish group and then

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.899 
but I do prefer the fish group and then
all<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.829> areas<00:01:24.250> that<00:01:24.280> you're<00:01:24.490> going<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.729> have

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
all the areas that you're going to have

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.389 
all the areas that you're going to have
an<00:01:25.030> opening<00:01:25.479> like<00:01:26.289> times<00:01:26.560> out<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.799> 10<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:27.250> will

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
an opening like times out of 10 you will

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.279 
an opening like times out of 10 you will
add<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:27.880> at<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.479> waist<00:01:28.689> which<00:01:28.990> he<00:01:29.109> does

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
add that at the waist which he does

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.859 
add that at the waist which he does
happen<00:01:29.740> not<00:01:30.609> the<00:01:30.820> end<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.149> world<00:01:31.329> next

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
happen not the end of the world next

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.389 
happen not the end of the world next
time<00:01:32.079> what<00:01:32.259> you<00:01:32.350> want<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.649> do<00:01:32.799> is<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.189> use<00:01:33.369> a

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
time what you want to do is to use a

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.139 
time what you want to do is to use a
clamp<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.539> come<00:01:35.049> across<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:37.000> you're

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
clamp and come across when you're

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.969 
clamp and come across when you're
applying<00:01:37.600> your<00:01:37.929> Cape<00:01:38.200> you're<00:01:38.770> always

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
applying your Cape you're always

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.080 
applying your Cape you're always
thinking<00:01:39.520> about<00:01:39.579> down<00:01:40.179> and<00:01:40.600> in<00:01:41.259> down<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.640> in

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
thinking about down and in down and in

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.810 
thinking about down and in down and in
and<00:01:43.299> on<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.929> inside<00:01:44.409> corner<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.310> binding

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
and on the inside corner of the binding

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.359 
and on the inside corner of the binding
you<00:01:46.479> want<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.750> break<00:01:46.960> that<00:01:47.170> sharp<00:01:47.560> corner<00:01:48.130> so

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
you want to break that sharp corner so

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.959 
you want to break that sharp corner so
that<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.640> doesn't<00:01:48.969> hold<00:01:49.119> things<00:01:49.539> off<00:01:50.820> well<00:01:51.820> you

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
that it doesn't hold things off well you

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.690 
that it doesn't hold things off well you
have<00:01:52.210> gaps<00:01:52.590> chances<00:01:53.590> are<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.859> probably<00:01:54.070> will

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
have gaps chances are you probably will

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.429 
have gaps chances are you probably will
so<00:01:54.999> how<00:01:55.149> can<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.509> hide<00:01:55.749> a<00:01:55.780> gap

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
so how can you hide a gap

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.550 
so how can you hide a gap
well<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.969> fallacy<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.600> glue<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.109> dust

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
well the fallacy of glue and dust

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.539 
well the fallacy of glue and dust
I<00:01:59.649> discovered<00:02:00.479> doesn't<00:02:01.479> always<00:02:01.719> work<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:03.520> I

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
I discovered doesn't always work when I

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.480 
I discovered doesn't always work when I
found<00:02:03.969> that<00:02:04.090> work<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.719> best<00:02:05.189> what<00:02:06.189> I<00:02:06.219> found

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
found that work the best what I found

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.750 
found that work the best what I found
that<00:02:06.670> works<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.210> best

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
that works the best

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.970 
that works the best
is<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.150> a<00:02:10.330> continue<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:11.900> with<00:02:12.350> completing

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
is this a continue to go with completing

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.560 
is this a continue to go with completing
