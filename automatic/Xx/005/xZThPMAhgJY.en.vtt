00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740 
width is 186 millimeters the angles that
I'm<00:00:55.739> running<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.160> 40<00:00:56.579> degrees<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.090> front<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I'm running are 40 degrees up front and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
I'm running are 40 degrees up front and
20<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> back<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.920> bushings<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
20 in the back and the bushings that I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.780 
20 in the back and the bushings that I
have<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:04.680> 95<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.580> they're

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
have in there are actually 95 a they're

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.679 
have in there are actually 95 a they're
pretty<00:01:06.030> hard<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.020> our<00:01:07.350> trucks<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
pretty hard but because our trucks use a

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.170 
pretty hard but because our trucks use a
support<00:01:09.689> system<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.549> then<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.850> run<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
support system so then I can run it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.570 
support system so then I can run it
harder<00:01:12.720> bushings<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> gain<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
harder bushings just to gain back a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.260 
harder bushings just to gain back a
little<00:01:14.820> bit<00:01:14.970> more<00:01:15.180> stability<00:01:16.189> but<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
little bit more stability but then I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.350 
little bit more stability but then I
thought<00:01:18.479> my<00:01:18.689> GMR<00:01:19.350> skateboard<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.360> that's

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
thought my GMR skateboard here that's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
thought my GMR skateboard here that's
got<00:01:21.570> aluminum<00:01:21.930> inserts<00:01:22.560> both<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> front

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
got aluminum inserts both on the front

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
got aluminum inserts both on the front
and<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.869> strengthen<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and back just to me strengthen up the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.700 
and back just to me strengthen up the
the<00:01:26.159> neck<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.450> continue<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> cut<00:01:28.470> away

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the neck so we can continue to cut away

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.359 
the neck so we can continue to cut away
and<00:01:28.920> let<00:01:29.820> people<00:01:30.090> run<00:01:30.420> narrow<00:01:30.750> hangers<00:01:31.369> big

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and let people run narrow hangers big

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.800 
and let people run narrow hangers big
wide<00:01:32.579> wheels<00:01:32.909> without<00:01:33.119> having<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> worry

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
wide wheels without having to worry

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.200 
wide wheels without having to worry
about<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.200> bite<00:01:37.250> yeah<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.490> season<00:01:38.970> has
