gonna be sitting on top of their figure

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.670 
gonna be sitting on top of their figure
a<00:01:17.450> little<00:01:17.690> bit<00:01:17.810> higher<00:01:18.050> I<00:01:18.080> put<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.500> little

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
a little bit higher I put a little

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.190 
a little bit higher I put a little
further<00:01:18.920> out<00:01:19.040> but<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.510> is<00:01:20.660> actually<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.020> one

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
further out but this is actually the one

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.750 
further out but this is actually the one
part<00:01:21.530> we're<00:01:21.650> gonna<00:01:21.740> experiment<00:01:22.130> with<00:01:22.400> I'm

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
part we're gonna experiment with I'm

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.850 
part we're gonna experiment with I'm
gonna<00:01:22.880> build<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.210> all<00:01:23.360> up<00:01:23.570> first<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:24.680> got

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
gonna build it all up first and I got

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.830 
gonna build it all up first and I got
some<00:01:25.040> extra<00:01:25.160> pipe<00:01:25.520> left<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.210> I'm<00:01:26.420> gonna<00:01:26.540> see

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
some extra pipe left and I'm gonna see

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.960 
some extra pipe left and I'm gonna see
if<00:01:26.870> maybe<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.380> want<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:28.280> know<00:01:28.310> leave<00:01:28.760> it<00:01:28.850> up

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
if maybe I want to you know leave it up

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.480 
if maybe I want to you know leave it up
higher<00:01:29.240> or<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.840> might<00:01:30.290> not<00:01:30.470> glue<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.980> section

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
higher or I might not glue that section

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.010 
higher or I might not glue that section
down<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:31.940> kind<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.180> play<00:01:32.330> around<00:01:32.450> with<00:01:32.660> it<00:01:32.900> an

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
down and kind of play around with it an

00:01:33.020 --> 00:02:19.119 
down and kind of play around with it an
experiment<00:01:33.350> will<00:01:33.950> sit

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.309 

we<00:02:20.129> got<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.519> put<00:02:20.700> together<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.989> need

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
we got it all put together I just need

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.839 
we got it all put together I just need
to<00:02:22.410> drill<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> hole<00:02:22.769> so<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.610> put<00:02:23.819> that

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
to drill a hole so I can put that

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.640 
to drill a hole so I can put that
quarter<00:02:24.330> inch<00:02:24.390> screws<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> tripod

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
quarter inch screws and do the tripod

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:45.210 
quarter inch screws and do the tripod
mount

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.470 

so<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.490> kind<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.820> setup<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.240> haven't

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
so this is kind of a setup I haven't

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.240 
so this is kind of a setup I haven't
glued<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.870> yet<00:02:48.020> like<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.380> said<00:02:48.590> I'm<00:02:48.770> not<00:02:48.800> the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
glued it yet like I said I'm not the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.230 
glued it yet like I said I'm not the
first<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.640> do<00:02:49.790> this

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
first to do this

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.300 
first to do this
I<00:02:50.270> just<00:02:50.540> wanted<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.870> build<00:02:51.080> one<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.680> since<00:02:52.220> I

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I just wanted to build one and since I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.100 
I just wanted to build one and since I
was<00:02:52.430> building<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.850> figure<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.210> she's<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> video

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
was building a figure I she's a video

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.030 
was building a figure I she's a video
with<00:02:54.410> it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
with it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040 
with it
just<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.640> couple<00:02:55.820> things<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.210> note<00:02:56.450> some<00:02:56.840> things

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
just a couple things to note some things

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.870 
just a couple things to note some things
that<00:02:57.350> that<00:02:57.770> I'm<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.550> don't<00:02:58.700> know

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
that that I'm going to do I don't know

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.880 
that that I'm going to do I don't know
if<00:02:59.030> other<00:02:59.180> people<00:02:59.540> are<00:02:59.630> doing<00:02:59.780> them<00:02:59.990> one<00:03:00.590> I'm

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
if other people are doing them one I'm

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.290 
if other people are doing them one I'm
probably<00:03:01.130> not<00:03:01.340> going<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.550> glue<00:03:01.700> down<00:03:01.730> this<00:03:02.090> top

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
probably not going to glue down this top

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.120 
probably not going to glue down this top
bar<00:03:02.570> as<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.930> yet<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.140> want<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.500> play<00:03:03.680> around<00:03:03.950> with

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
bar as of yet I want to play around with

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.710 
bar as of yet I want to play around with
it<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.400> see<00:03:04.580> what<00:03:04.730> kind<00:03:04.850> of<00:03:04.970> height<00:03:05.150> variation

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
it and see what kind of height variation

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.570 
it and see what kind of height variation
does<00:03:06.230> when<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.740> comes<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.130> shot<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.490> the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
does when it comes to the shot on the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.860 
does when it comes to the shot on the
camera<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.150> gotta<00:03:08.480> remember<00:03:08.750> that

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
camera you gotta remember that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.970 
camera you gotta remember that
oftentimes<00:03:09.440> we're<00:03:09.590> gonna<00:03:09.710> be<00:03:09.800> shooting

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
oftentimes we're gonna be shooting

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.590 
oftentimes we're gonna be shooting
towards<00:03:10.400> boats<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.360> do<00:03:11.480> have

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
towards boats and that and you do have

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.510 
towards boats and that and you do have
the<00:03:11.750> wall<00:03:11.930> or<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.350> side<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:12.830> boat<00:03:13.040> on<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
the wall or the side of the boat on the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.670 
the wall or the side of the boat on the
hull<00:03:13.700> there<00:03:14.030> where<00:03:14.570> depending<00:03:15.260> on<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.470> shot

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
hull there where depending on the shot

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.320 
hull there where depending on the shot
you're<00:03:15.890> trying<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.220> get<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.880> might<00:03:17.060> want<00:03:17.270> to

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
you're trying to get you might want to

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.640 
you're trying to get you might want to
go<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.420> little<00:03:17.510> higher<00:03:17.900> if<00:03:18.260> you're<00:03:18.380> trying<00:03:18.620> to

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
go a little higher if you're trying to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.380 
go a little higher if you're trying to
get<00:03:18.830> like<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.010> real<00:03:19.250> cool<00:03:19.520> little<00:03:19.820> water<00:03:20.030> splash

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
get like a real cool little water splash

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.000 
get like a real cool little water splash
and<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.780> want<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.050> go<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.140> little<00:03:21.230> lower

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
and I want to go a little lower

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.080 
and I want to go a little lower
the<00:03:22.280> other<00:03:22.430> thing<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.940> pay

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
the other thing you have to pay

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.610 
the other thing you have to pay
attention<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.780> is<00:03:23.930> sometimes<00:03:24.350> you're<00:03:24.500> gonna

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
attention to is sometimes you're gonna

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.800 
attention to is sometimes you're gonna
get<00:03:24.860> glare<00:03:25.220> from<00:03:25.490> the<00:03:25.550> foam<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.360> you're

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
get glare from the foam and you're

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.700 
get glare from the foam and you're
actually<00:03:26.930> gonna<00:03:27.110> pick<00:03:27.380> up<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.680> phone

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
actually gonna pick up the phone

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.620 
actually gonna pick up the phone
depending<00:03:28.370> on<00:03:28.460> how<00:03:28.610> high<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.850> go<00:03:29.090> so<00:03:29.360> I<00:03:29.420> want

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
depending on how high you go so I want

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.120 
depending on how high you go so I want
to<00:03:29.690> experiment<00:03:29.990> with<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.470> because<00:03:30.920> frankly

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
to experiment with that because frankly

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.920 
to experiment with that because frankly
I've<00:03:31.790> never<00:03:31.820> done<00:03:32.180> one<00:03:32.210> of<00:03:32.360> these<00:03:32.480> before

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
I've never done one of these before

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.460 
I've never done one of these before
um<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.650> other<00:03:33.740> thing<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.190> did<00:03:34.490> to<00:03:35.470> instead

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
um the other thing that I did to instead

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.560 
um the other thing that I did to instead
of<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:36.950> measuring<00:03:37.460> it<00:03:37.670> just<00:03:37.970> right<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.450> get

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
of just measuring it just right to get

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.900 
of just measuring it just right to get
the<00:03:38.690> GoPro<00:03:38.870> tripod<00:03:39.830> mount<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.580> there

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
the GoPro tripod mount in there

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.620 
the GoPro tripod mount in there
I<00:03:40.940> took<00:03:41.360> my<00:03:41.630> quarter<00:03:41.930> inch<00:03:42.020> screw<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.740> put

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
I took my quarter inch screw I put

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.449 
I took my quarter inch screw I put
washers<00:03:44.630> on<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:45.020> but<00:03:45.170> then<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.350> used<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.770> lock<00:03:46.430> nut

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
washers on it but then I used a lock nut

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.449 
washers on it but then I used a lock nut
and<00:03:47.020> basically<00:03:48.020> it<00:03:48.440> just<00:03:48.470> it'll<00:03:48.890> allow<00:03:49.190> me<00:03:49.220> to

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
and basically it just it'll allow me to

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.760 
and basically it just it'll allow me to
turn<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.330> move<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.690> around<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.620> it's

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
turn this and move it around but it's

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.490 
turn this and move it around but it's
gonna<00:03:51.920> keep<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:53.260> basically<00:03:54.260> it's<00:03:54.410> gonna

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
gonna keep that basically it's gonna

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.710 
gonna keep that basically it's gonna
keep<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.830> from<00:03:54.890> loosening<00:03:55.400> as<00:03:56.150> much<00:03:56.420> as<00:03:56.570> it

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
keep it from loosening as much as it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.830 
keep it from loosening as much as it
would<00:03:56.930> if<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.920> had<00:03:58.370> measured<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.850> just<00:03:59.180> right<00:03:59.510> to

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
would if I had measured it just right to

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.780 
would if I had measured it just right to
get<00:03:59.959> it<00:04:00.200> in<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.530> quarter<00:04:00.950> inch<00:04:01.010> tripod<00:04:01.520> mount

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
get it in that quarter inch tripod mount

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.220 
get it in that quarter inch tripod mount
but<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:02.330> where<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.510> can<00:04:02.690> kind<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.900> turn<00:04:03.080> it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
but this where I can kind of turn it

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.540 
but this where I can kind of turn it
back<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.410> forth<00:04:03.830> especially<00:04:04.220> when<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:04.489> a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
back and forth especially when I have a

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.800 
back and forth especially when I have a
camera<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:04.910> there<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.270> I<00:04:05.360> have<00:04:05.510> some<00:04:05.690> more

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
camera on there and I have some more

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.020 
camera on there and I have some more
leverage<00:04:06.230> but<00:04:06.830> it's<00:04:07.340> gonna<00:04:07.459> keep<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.850> nice<00:04:08.000> and

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
leverage but it's gonna keep it nice and

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.400 
leverage but it's gonna keep it nice and
title<00:04:08.510> in<00:04:08.600> there<00:04:08.720> without<00:04:08.870> any<00:04:09.140> kind<00:04:09.320> of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
title in there without any kind of

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.650 
title in there without any kind of
slippage<00:04:09.860> but<00:04:10.430> I'm<00:04:10.700> gonna<00:04:10.820> go<00:04:11.000> ahead<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.330> I'm

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
slippage but I'm gonna go ahead and I'm

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.720 
slippage but I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna<00:04:11.780> glue<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.410> base<00:04:12.590> here<00:04:13.100> because<00:04:13.519> that's

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
gonna glue the base here because that's

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.060 
gonna glue the base here because that's
pretty<00:04:14.000> much<00:04:14.180> locked<00:04:14.480> in<00:04:14.750> pretty<00:04:15.260> simple<00:04:15.739> you

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
pretty much locked in pretty simple you

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.190 
pretty much locked in pretty simple you
know<00:04:16.190> been<00:04:16.850> kind<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.239> rough<00:04:17.390> cut<00:04:17.690> job<00:04:17.930> but<00:04:18.140> I

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
know been kind of a rough cut job but I

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.570 
know been kind of a rough cut job but I
don't<00:04:18.380> really<00:04:18.530> care<00:04:18.769> just<00:04:18.980> so<00:04:19.070> long<00:04:19.190> as<00:04:19.370> it

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
don't really care just so long as it

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.849 
don't really care just so long as it
floats<00:04:19.850> one<00:04:20.510> other<00:04:20.810> note<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.350> think<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.709> am

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
floats one other note that I think I am

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.280 
floats one other note that I think I am
going<00:04:22.100> to<00:04:22.160> do<00:04:22.280> too<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.970> I'm<00:04:23.360> going<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.990> take

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
going to do too is I'm going to take

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.590 
going to do too is I'm going to take
some<00:04:24.680> zip<00:04:24.890> ties<00:04:25.120> these<00:04:26.120> things<00:04:26.330> are<00:04:26.450> pretty

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
some zip ties these things are pretty

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.450 
some zip ties these things are pretty
snug<00:04:27.020> on<00:04:27.169> here<00:04:27.440> these<00:04:27.620> floats<00:04:28.010> from<00:04:28.310> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
snug on here these floats from the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.159 
snug on here these floats from the
noodle<00:04:28.790> but<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.330> think<00:04:29.600> I'm<00:04:29.720> gonna<00:04:29.900> take<00:04:30.110> a

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
noodle but I think I'm gonna take a

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.230 
noodle but I think I'm gonna take a
couple<00:04:30.440> zip<00:04:30.710> ties<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.370> just<00:04:31.669> go<00:04:31.820> over<00:04:31.910> on<00:04:32.090> them

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
couple zip ties and just go over on them

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.300 
couple zip ties and just go over on them
and<00:04:32.360> kind<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.570> lock<00:04:32.960> them<00:04:33.200> down<00:04:33.230> so<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.190> I'm

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
and kind of lock them down so that I'm

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.490 
and kind of lock them down so that I'm
not<00:04:34.340> getting<00:04:34.760> too<00:04:35.210> much<00:04:35.260> waviness

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
not getting too much waviness

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.750 
not getting too much waviness
I<00:04:36.770> don't<00:04:37.100> know<00:04:37.190> if<00:04:37.310> that'll<00:04:37.580> actually

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
I don't know if that'll actually

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.350 
I don't know if that'll actually
stabilize<00:04:38.600> if<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.140> moves<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.800> think<00:04:40.070> yeah<00:04:41.060> I

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
stabilize if it moves I think yeah I

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.640 
stabilize if it moves I think yeah I
think<00:04:41.510> we're<00:04:41.840> gonna<00:04:41.960> lock<00:04:42.169> them<00:04:42.320> down<00:04:42.530> because

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
think we're gonna lock them down because

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.080 
think we're gonna lock them down because
it's<00:04:42.919> just<00:04:43.070> going<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.220> keep<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.580> more<00:04:43.820> stable

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
it's just going to keep it more stable

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.800 
it's just going to keep it more stable
and<00:04:44.450> then<00:04:44.540> you

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
and then you

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.330 
and then you
the<00:04:44.930> camera<00:04:45.290> kind<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.560> stabilized<00:04:45.980> the<00:04:46.130> shot

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
the camera kind of stabilized the shot

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.000 
the camera kind of stabilized the shot
that's<00:04:47.150> about<00:04:47.389> it<00:04:47.630> look<00:04:48.290> for<00:04:48.470> some<00:04:48.590> shots<00:04:48.830> with

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
that's about it look for some shots with

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.290 
that's about it look for some shots with
this<00:04:49.190> thing<00:04:49.370> we'll<00:04:49.550> see<00:04:49.580> how<00:04:49.790> she<00:04:49.850> turns<00:04:50.150> out

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
this thing we'll see how she turns out

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.670 
this thing we'll see how she turns out
on<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.570> water<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:51.020> like<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.169> said<00:04:51.410> I'm<00:04:51.500> gonna

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
on the water and like I said I'm gonna

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.280 
on the water and like I said I'm gonna
play<00:04:51.860> around<00:04:51.980> with<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.370> height<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.290> we'll

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
play around with the height and we'll

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.490 
play around with the height and we'll
see<00:04:54.440> if<00:04:54.530> we<00:04:54.590> have<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.800> make<00:04:54.950> any<00:04:55.130> changes
