think they are loud enough but to each

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.050 
think they are loud enough but to each
his<00:02:25.319> own<00:02:25.530> we<00:02:25.739> can't<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.129> like<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.580> same<00:02:26.610> shoe

that way pricing on these has not been

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.280 
that way pricing on these has not been

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
released but I'm thinking they'll be

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.130 
released but I'm thinking they'll be
between<00:02:31.620> 250<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.459> 275<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:33.989> look<00:02:34.110> for
