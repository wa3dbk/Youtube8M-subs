all<00:00:01.860> right<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.100> one<00:00:02.280> was<00:00:02.399> pretty

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
all right this one was pretty

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.360 
all right this one was pretty
interesting<00:00:03.330> it's<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> Python<00:00:04.770> script<00:00:04.799> that

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
interesting it's on a Python script that

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.830 
interesting it's on a Python script that
will<00:00:06.859> you<00:00:07.859> know<00:00:07.890> Oh<00:00:08.309> minimize<00:00:09.090> all<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> open

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
will you know Oh minimize all the open

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.790 
will you know Oh minimize all the open
applications

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
applications

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.470 
applications
besides<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.580> active<00:00:11.940> one<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.360> you're

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
besides the active one that you're

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.660 
besides the active one that you're
looking<00:00:12.750> at<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.650> feature<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.040> reminds<00:00:14.519> me

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
looking at so this feature is reminds me

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.590 
looking at so this feature is reminds me
of<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:16.379> aerial<00:00:16.740> shake<00:00:17.220> feature<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:18.449> know

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
of the the aerial shake feature you know

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120 
of the the aerial shake feature you know
you<00:00:18.660> shake<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> stupid<00:00:19.439> window<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
you shake the stupid window and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.300 
you shake the stupid window and
everything<00:00:21.000> else<00:00:21.320> minimizes<00:00:22.320> except<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
everything else minimizes except for the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.070 
everything else minimizes except for the
one<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.640> you're<00:00:23.820> shaking<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
one that you're shaking or the one that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.009 
one that you're shaking or the one that
is<00:00:25.170> active<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.449> that's<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.599> we're<00:00:27.720> gonna<00:00:27.810> do

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
is active so that's what we're gonna do

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.410 
is active so that's what we're gonna do
okay<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.039> let<00:00:29.250> me<00:00:29.369> demonstrate<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.240> let

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
okay and let me demonstrate this out let

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.830 
okay and let me demonstrate this out let
me<00:00:30.510> open<00:00:30.630> some<00:00:30.929> applications<00:00:31.590> here<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> it's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
me open some applications here so it's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.720 
me open some applications here so it's
open<00:00:34.260> let's<00:00:34.980> say<00:00:35.100> PLC<00:00:35.960> open<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> totem<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.670> up

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
open let's say PLC open the totem so up

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.260 
open let's say PLC open the totem so up
in<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.940> terminal<00:00:39.680> let's<00:00:40.680> open<00:00:40.860> GP<00:00:41.809> rename

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
in the terminal let's open GP rename

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.250 
in the terminal let's open GP rename
yeah<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.899> for

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
yeah I think that's about it for

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.670 
yeah I think that's about it for
applications<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:50.660> let<00:00:51.660> me<00:00:51.719> put<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.500> aside

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
applications and let me put this aside

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.209 
applications and let me put this aside
first

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.369 

all<00:00:56.820> right<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.809> four

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
all right so you see that they have four

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.889 
all right so you see that they have four
applications<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.460> no<00:01:00.329> denying<00:01:00.660> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
applications here right no denying that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.789 
applications here right no denying that
and<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.219> wanted<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:03.379> minimize<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
and if I wanted to minimize that the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.180 
and if I wanted to minimize that the
rest<00:01:05.009> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.460> ones<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.600> want

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
rest of the other ones that I don't want

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.460 
rest of the other ones that I don't want
and<00:01:08.190> only<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.240> maybe<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.900> movie<00:01:10.229> player

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and only have like maybe my movie player

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.090 
and only have like maybe my movie player
open<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.509> Windows<00:01:12.960> 7<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.740> shake

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
open so in Windows 7 you know you shake

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.240 
open so in Windows 7 you know you shake
the<00:01:14.250> stupid<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:17.040> can't

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the stupid thing right in here you can't

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.740 
the stupid thing right in here you can't
do<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> shaking<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.720> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
do this shaking but you can do like a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
do this shaking but you can do like a
high<00:01:19.020> key<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.500> something<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.580> maybe

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
high key or something like that or maybe

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.590 
high key or something like that or maybe
a<00:01:21.000> hot<00:01:21.180> corner<00:01:21.690> so<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.409> example<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.039> do<00:01:23.100> this

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
a hot corner so for example if I do this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.029 
a hot corner so for example if I do this
I'll<00:01:24.600> minimize<00:01:24.780> everything<00:01:25.110> else<00:01:25.470> except<00:01:25.890> for

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
I'll minimize everything else except for

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.160 
I'll minimize everything else except for
the<00:01:26.130> active<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.750> script<00:01:27.960> doesn't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the active one now this script doesn't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.710 
the active one now this script doesn't
actually<00:01:28.679> restore<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
actually restore the you know the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.870 
actually restore the you know the
applications<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:32.039> was<00:01:32.580> minimized<00:01:33.740> but

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
applications that was minimized but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.040 
applications that was minimized but
hopefully<00:01:35.880> someone<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.690> good<00:01:36.899> at

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
hopefully someone that that's good at

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.399 
hopefully someone that that's good at
Python<00:01:37.350> scripts<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.610> actually<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.420> but

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
Python scripts can actually do that but

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
Python scripts can actually do that but
you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.740> see<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> use<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.880> high

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you can see that you can use the high

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.180 
you can see that you can use the high
corners<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.569> I<00:01:42.659> did<00:01:42.810> before<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.039> use

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
corners like I did before or you can use

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.620 
corners like I did before or you can use
the<00:01:44.369> high<00:01:44.520> key<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:45.090> there's<00:01:45.270> an<00:01:45.450> example<00:01:45.869> here

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the high key so there's an example here

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.380 
the high key so there's an example here
right<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> it'll<00:01:49.289> do<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> it's

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
right and it'll do that so it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.300 
right and it'll do that so it's
basically<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.050> script<00:01:52.319> you<00:01:52.590> need<00:01:52.740> Python

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
basically just a script you need Python

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
basically just a script you need Python
install<00:01:53.929> you<00:01:54.929> know<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.259> should<00:01:55.380> come<00:01:55.560> by

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
install you know it should come by

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.370 
install you know it should come by
default<00:01:56.220> on<00:01:56.369> either<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.330> Linux<00:01:57.659> distribution

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
default on either the Linux distribution

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.330 
default on either the Linux distribution
if<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.280> go<00:01:59.549> ahead<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.909> install<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.360> your

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
if not just go ahead and install in your

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.820 
if not just go ahead and install in your
repositories<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.000> anyways<00:02:03.330> let<00:02:03.509> me<00:02:03.569> show<00:02:03.750> you

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
repositories so anyways let me show you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.320 
repositories so anyways let me show you
what<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:04.979> need<00:02:05.129> to<00:02:05.160> do<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.989> script<00:02:07.349> is

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
what you need to do so the script is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.980 
what you need to do so the script is
oops<00:02:09.330> let<00:02:09.569> me<00:02:09.599> do

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.410 

okay<00:02:13.990> there<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.200> go

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.010 

basically<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.380> want<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.510> know<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.810> copy

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
corner and everything else would be

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.280 
corner and everything else would be
minimized<00:03:44.380> except<00:03:45.160> for<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.490> active<00:03:45.910> window

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
