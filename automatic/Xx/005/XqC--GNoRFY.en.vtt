00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
kind of limits system as the 65 be that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.109 
kind of limits system as the 65 be that
I<00:00:24.660> showed<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.460> except<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.730> does<00:00:26.939> have

the two gray on it very quiet unit

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.749 
the two gray on it very quiet unit
comparison<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.560> aviator<00:00:31.980> yeah<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> don't

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
comparison to an aviator yeah I don't

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
comparison to an aviator yeah I don't
know<00:00:32.910> they're<00:00:33.300> they're<00:00:33.780> real<00:00:33.930> close<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.380> in

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
know they're they're real close to be in

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
know they're they're real close to be in
the<00:00:34.530> same<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.579> tripped<00:00:35.790> over<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> safety

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the same I just tripped over the safety

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.490 
the same I just tripped over the safety
sensors<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:38.010> didn't<00:00:38.820> wear<00:00:39.660> these<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.050> put

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
sensors here I didn't wear these in put

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.450 
sensors here I didn't wear these in put
them<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> door<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> way<00:00:41.309> they're

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
them on the door like the way they're

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180 
them on the door like the way they're
supposed<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> sensors

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
supposed to be but these are the sensors

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.330 
supposed to be but these are the sensors
this<00:00:44.340> unit<00:00:44.640> would<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:45.000> run<00:00:45.649> either<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:47.100> or

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
this unit would not run either up or

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.330 
this unit would not run either up or
down<00:00:47.480> without<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.780> sensors<00:00:49.140> connected<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
down without the sensors connected the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
down without the sensors connected the
light<00:00:50.489> would<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.670> blink<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:52.110> sensors

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
light would just blink so these sensors

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.439 
light would just blink so these sensors
had<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.890> connected<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.520> will<00:00:54.090> also<00:00:54.329> be

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
had to be connected I will also be

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
had to be connected I will also be
showing<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.930> original<00:00:55.620> remote<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
showing the original remote and this is

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
showing the original remote and this is
what<00:00:56.640> we'll<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.789> using<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.149> run<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> today<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
what we'll be using to run it today this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.830 
what we'll be using to run it today this
is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> model<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.930> zero<00:01:00.930> nine<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:02.160> three<00:01:02.489> zero

know<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> 2001<00:01:17.759> remote<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.270> not

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
know if this is a 2001 remote or not

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.249 
know if this is a 2001 remote or not
seems<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> unit<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.520> maybe

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
seems like a unit like this is maybe

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.800

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.470 

there's<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.100> limit<00:01:39.430> right<00:01:39.580> there

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:58.440 

right<00:01:44.480> down

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.410 

and<00:01:59.450> there<00:01:59.870> we<00:01:59.960> have<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:01.670> unit<00:02:02.180> does<00:02:02.390> have

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
and there we have it this unit does have

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.200 
and there we have it this unit does have
a<00:02:03.080> learn<00:02:03.560> button<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.070> by<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.220> way<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.640> don't

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
a learn button on it by the way I don't

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.480 
a learn button on it by the way I don't
believe<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:06.020> anything<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:06.740> tutela<00:02:07.159> cold

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490

or anything like that I don't think any
of<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.530> genie<00:02:09.979> remotes<00:02:10.340> program<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:11.060> it

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
of the genie remotes program to it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.390 
of the genie remotes program to it
this<00:02:11.750> one<00:02:11.930> has<00:02:12.080> dip<00:02:12.410> switches<00:02:12.709> but<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.250> got

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
this one has dip switches but it's got

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.830 
this one has dip switches but it's got
that<00:02:13.550> little<00:02:13.700> learn<00:02:13.970> button<00:02:14.300> inside<00:02:14.600> there

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
that little learn button inside there

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.870 
that little learn button inside there
too<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.860> there<00:02:16.520> we<00:02:16.610> have<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:17.500> check<00:02:18.500> back<00:02:18.680> soon

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
too so there we have it check back soon
