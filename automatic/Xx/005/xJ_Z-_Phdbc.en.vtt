keep<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> Inferno<00:01:19.320> tower<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
keep up with the Inferno tower it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
keep up with the Inferno tower it
actually<00:01:20.250> can't<00:01:20.520> keep<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.150> healing

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
actually can't keep up with the healing

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
actually can't keep up with the healing
the<00:01:21.900> balloons<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> Inferno<00:01:22.710> tower<00:01:22.890> but

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the balloons from the Inferno tower but

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.149 
the balloons from the Inferno tower but
it<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.880> almost<00:01:24.570> mitigate<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> damage<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
it can almost mitigate the damage so you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.469 
it can almost mitigate the damage so you
have<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> little<00:01:26.549> bit<00:01:26.729> extra<00:01:26.939> time<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.360> those

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
have a little bit extra time for those

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
have a little bit extra time for those
balloons<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> eat<00:01:28.020> those<00:01:28.200> rage<00:01:28.500> now<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.100> you're

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
balloons to eat those rage now if you're

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.679 
balloons to eat those rage now if you're
gonna<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.520> try<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> three<00:01:30.210> start<00:01:30.479> attack

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
gonna go try for the three start attack

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.240 
gonna go try for the three start attack
I<00:01:30.840> highly<00:01:31.079> recommend<00:01:31.470> holding<00:01:31.829> off<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
I highly recommend holding off the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.700 
I highly recommend holding off the
heroes<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.180> lava<00:01:33.360> l'union<00:01:33.810> attacking<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
heroes in a lava l'union attacking and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
heroes in a lava l'union attacking and
bringing<00:01:34.979> them<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> opposite

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
bringing them in from the opposite

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630 
bringing them in from the opposite
direction<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.229> idea<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.799> hopefully<00:01:38.250> they'll

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
direction the idea is hopefully they'll

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.310 
direction the idea is hopefully they'll
get<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.180> those<00:01:39.270> air<00:01:39.540> defenses<00:01:39.570> after

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
get down one of those air defenses after

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.249 
get down one of those air defenses after
