00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.000
 whole Germany 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 Hartmut Kollektiv on the energy concept of the future Austria Dr 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.240
 Our Minister of Economic Affairs was completely enthusiastic about the result 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.049
 therefore from pupils of cooperation it will do war 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.299
 still good results 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.029
 Third is all over optimistic because these guys a lot better than from 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.779
 many experts had expected 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 the acutely worse is not synonymous yes 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.849
 the real power, that's what the big power companies do 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.120
 give what is possible to these people what does that mean 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.589
 maybe she wrote down 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:37.710
 who money 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.380
 the and also the Chancellor is with the so-called nuclear compromise on whole 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.069
 modest way satisfied 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.530
 that is not no less than one 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.760
 for the nation, the area of ​​energy supply in Japan almost exactly 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.079
 almost not on the markets 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.760
 in their old sed and manual they can read 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.010
 this is not more about a profit maximization revolution 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.719
 Main thing revolution 4 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.059
 what are the energy giants saying about that? 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.370
 that they are now virtually licensed to print money - the ground is falling 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.140
 the energy concept under with clear contours 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 Not everybody could have imagined from the case 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 he will be able to live with the decision 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.920
 the ship 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.450
 somehow it will be possible to live with all the extra billions 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 that the DAX burden our environment 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.830
 Eon's price is an important pillar just now 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.909
 Of course, he only did so whiny 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.909
 in fact, you never felt that way 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:10.700
 Kapeller 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.239
 what he did, yes, she realized there was a strengthening in the cooling water Beckenbauer 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.270
 if now the most beautiful dress of the evening by far this 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.129
 Energy concept is part of the gigantic 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.719
 Austerity packages of the government 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:27.750
 properly heard the loot is austerity new he from black and yellow 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.580
 born in great pain 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.260
 the part is already plucked a lot now hardly a number seems then 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.760
 also sure question why a package expert Christian Ehring Christian what 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.799
 is left over from this great package 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.200
 yes and what can I a bloody line as always with building blocks vividly 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.840
 to explain 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.779
 in the quarterly report there Bauklötze so a the austerity package 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:51.359
 later, it consists of many individual components which are exactly on top of each other 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.189
 Voted 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.930
 a stable fairest all day actions are there to the song of 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.530
 Embassy 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.480
 Which component do they mean here, for example, the percent 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.040
 Fuels tax paid by the nuclear industry Luzi is not 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.939
 Newspaper the Times for just 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.190
 Chiara after that, the electricity bombers should give something as voluntarily as possible 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.770
 Stromombosse voluntarily and deliver that are ever three mistakes use yes 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.140
 Since we did not even see the pitbull try the treat again 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.670
 Take a muzzle a lot of fun a year at the IAA so yes this role very much 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.319
 we must unfortunately 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.900
 do not remove everything you can dream of is feasible so politics but that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.939
 Austerity packages Peter despite and what should that be a Bundeswehr are where they know 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.820
 the finish already clearly stated » 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.420
 There will be no radical savings in the troupe 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.450
 in the end, only three soldiers have to wear a shirt Islanders all there 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.450
 What happens to the garbage Sea ice will probably not matter 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.020
 The same applies here for the construction support and Brüderle 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.760
 is against to fail ecotax at large corporation can get it all out yes yes yes yes 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.600
 It's a good moment you can talk such a nice few days broken 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.120
 Consumer Health still ran so that we both the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.769
 Financial transaction tax to be Europe-wide experts say practically not 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.149
 enforceable 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:08.649
 we give in the monsoon Word processing could get worse too 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.449
 Israel 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.449
 Raase Moscow 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:20.829
 but for that she needs solid base are clearly apart from fidelity and 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.499
 Flight tickets is the fourth place to save parental allowance and heating subsidy 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.330
 That's about fair in the BMX 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.930
 but that also shows the federal government and therefore 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.900
 be for 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.699
 all additionally the health insurance contributions drastically increased 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.930
 Theiner 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.260
 none of the big corporations 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.430
 then he is almost an avatar shorter
