00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.120
 desserts let's start then we have here the 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.940
 green mango cut into julienne paprika 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.600
 red in strips also in julienne the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.940

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.379
 Green part of the scallion all cut in 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.200

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.670
 cilantro see how we are going to do the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.979
 press nothing 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.320
 we have our goal and we are mixing 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.530
 all our ingredients here we have 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.570
 the green mango cut into strips has 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.540
 to be very green because when it happens 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.460
 pintón is already sweet we put the 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.610
 strips of red paprika 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.540
 we put then also the scallion 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.460
 minced in julienne or in strips and 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.810
 we put to give it more color also 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.280
 the green part of the onion 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.960
 we mix the oriental touch they give it 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.450
 the combination of the flavors that I'm going to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.930
 do now in my dressing 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.159
 Here we have fish fish sauce 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.819
 shows 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.270
 is achieved in the markets because it 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:03.670
 we put a little salt 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.670
 we put olive oil 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.950
 we put you then 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.030
 to brown sugar 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.660
 to give it a sweet touch 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.750
 and a spicy touch to your liking is 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.170
 say we have the salt combination 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.400
 of sugar and spicy very thai 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.400
 we mix it well 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.850
 and let's season our salad to 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.560
 time to serve the season and not with 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.030
 much anticipation so that all 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.140
 vegetables are all hard as 10 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.630
 minutes before serving 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.320
 the reason is when we have our 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.140
 salads already seasoned that we're going to 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.360
 put a green touch that gives it the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.520
