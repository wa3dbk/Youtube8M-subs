and rename it to cloth for example we've
got<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.900> set<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> weight<00:02:19.410> 20<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.680> then<00:02:22.680> we're

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
got to set the weight 20 and then we're

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.040 
got to set the weight 20 and then we're
going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.129> assign<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> those<00:02:25.950> vertexes

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
going to assign that to those vertexes

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.900 
going to assign that to those vertexes
now<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.530> do<00:02:28.650> something<00:02:28.890> new<00:02:29.519> called

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
now we have to do something new called

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.530 
now we have to do something new called
weight<00:02:30.330> painting<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.799> we're<00:02:31.950> going<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.430> go<00:02:32.540> up

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
weight painting so we're going to go up

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.309 
weight painting so we're going to go up
to<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.799> drop-down<00:02:35.099> box<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.760> click<00:02:36.720> wait

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
to this drop-down box and click wait

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.220 
to this drop-down box and click wait
paint<00:02:38.120> we're<00:02:39.120> going<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.360> come<00:02:39.569> down<00:02:39.750> into<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
paint we're going to come down into the

paint we're going to come down into the
paint<00:02:40.530> tool<00:02:40.950> box<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.489> make<00:02:42.120> sure<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.810> weight

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
paint tool box and make sure the weight

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.870 
paint tool box and make sure the weight
is<00:02:43.290> one<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.030> set<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.599> one<00:02:45.989> as<00:02:46.110> well

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
is one and set this one to one as well

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.809 
is one and set this one to one as well
we're<00:02:47.880> also<00:02:48.060> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.569> make<00:02:49.349> up<00:02:49.530> brush<00:02:49.829> a<00:02:50.099> bit

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
we're also going to make up brush a bit

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.800 
we're also going to make up brush a bit
smaller<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.420> about<00:02:51.799> nine<00:02:52.799> nine<00:02:53.549> or<00:02:53.730> ten<00:02:53.940> and
