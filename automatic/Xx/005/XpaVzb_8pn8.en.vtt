people<00:00:55.470> don't<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.160> an<00:00:56.280> easy<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> get<00:00:56.910> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
people don't have an easy way to get it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.940 
people don't have an easy way to get it
out<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.330> a<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:57.600> persistent<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.620> algae

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
out it's a very persistent kind of algae

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.920 
out it's a very persistent kind of algae
so<00:00:59.460> whenever<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.150> get<00:01:00.390> any<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.780> out

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
so whenever you do get any of that out

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
so whenever you do get any of that out
is<00:01:01.320> very<00:01:01.560> noticeable<00:01:01.830> is<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.940> best<00:01:03.120> time<00:01:03.360> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
is very noticeable is the best time to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.960 
is very noticeable is the best time to
use<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:04.800> chemical<00:01:05.190> in<00:01:05.250> product<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.700> order<00:01:05.880> to

use the chemical in product in order to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.719 
use the chemical in product in order to
treat<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.390> condition<00:01:10.280> because<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> fact

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
treat that condition because of the fact

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
treat that condition because of the fact
that<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.150> other<00:01:12.560> treatments<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that all other treatments for this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.940 
that all other treatments for this
particular<00:01:14.670> condition<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.119> your<00:01:15.150> tank<00:01:15.479> are

remaining compounds which are dangerous

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
remaining compounds which are dangerous
for<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.360> nitrifying<00:01:21.900> bacteria<00:01:22.220> which<00:01:23.220> help

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
for your nitrifying bacteria which help

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
for your nitrifying bacteria which help
keep<00:01:23.760> your<00:01:23.940> tank<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> begin<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.680> we

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
keep your tank going to begin with so we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
keep your tank going to begin with so we
wanted<00:01:26.190> an<00:01:26.340> alternative<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.360> worked<00:01:27.600> just

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
wanted an alternative that worked just

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.230 
wanted an alternative that worked just
as<00:01:28.140> well<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.710> better<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.940> when<00:01:30.119> we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
as well if not better and that's when we

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.400 
as well if not better and that's when we
came<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> chemically

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.500 

it's<00:01:35.410> very<00:01:35.740> simple<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.430> easy-to-use<00:01:36.970> product

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
it's very simple and easy-to-use product

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.300 
it's very simple and easy-to-use product
you'd<00:01:38.230> simply<00:01:38.560> take<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.770> little<00:01:39.070> bit<00:01:39.190> of

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
you'd simply take a little bit of

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.310 
you'd simply take a little bit of
aquarium<00:01:39.790> water<00:01:40.030> or<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.450> little<00:01:40.630> bit<00:01:41.020> of

aquarium water or a little bit of
filtered<00:01:42.010> fresh<00:01:42.220> water<00:01:42.490> put<00:01:43.360> out<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.720> correct

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
filtered fresh water put out the correct

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.260 
filtered fresh water put out the correct
amount<00:01:44.410> of<00:01:44.470> dosage<00:01:44.890> per<00:01:45.130> your<00:01:45.370> aquarium<00:01:45.670> and

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
amount of dosage per your aquarium and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.150 
amount of dosage per your aquarium and
then<00:01:46.870> put<00:01:47.080> it<00:01:47.170> into<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.440> tank<00:01:47.710> however

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
then put it into the tank however

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.530 
then put it into the tank however
there's<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.520> few<00:01:48.580> steps<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.270> would<00:01:49.420> do

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
there's a few steps you would do

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.210 
there's a few steps you would do
beforehand<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.380> would<00:01:50.530> remove<00:01:50.740> any<00:01:50.980> type<00:01:51.190> of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
beforehand you would remove any type of

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.070 
beforehand you would remove any type of
carbon<00:01:51.730> or<00:01:51.790> chemin<00:01:52.120> peer<00:01:52.300> filtration<00:01:52.960> media

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
turn off your protein skimmer and

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.290 
turn off your protein skimmer and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
because it uses an oxygen you also need

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.090

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.280 
available which was for tanks up to 300
gallons<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.150> 2<00:02:19.360> grams<00:02:19.540> worth<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
gallons so it's 2 grams worth the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.220 
gallons so it's 2 grams worth the
formula<00:02:20.830> here<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:21.910> nowadays<00:02:22.840> most

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
