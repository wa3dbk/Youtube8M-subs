this<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.700> group<00:02:18.060> we're<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> group<00:02:18.750> these

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
this a group we're going to group these

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.990 
this a group we're going to group these
together<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.980> group<00:02:20.250> make<00:02:20.730> group

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
together with the group make group

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.700 
together with the group make group
option<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.900> we're<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.080> going<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.470> say

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
option here and we're just going to say

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:31.250 
option here and we're just going to say
this<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:26.120> flag<00:02:27.120> edges<00:02:28.490> flag<00:02:29.490> edge<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.360> we

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
this is a flag edges flag edge and we

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.600 
this is a flag edges flag edge and we
know<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.770> will<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.950> attached<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
know that that will be attached to the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.060 
know that that will be attached to the
pole<00:02:32.940> or<00:02:33.720> only<00:02:33.900> we're<00:02:34.050> doing<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.800> we

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
pole or only we're doing that so that we

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.220 
pole or only we're doing that so that we
can<00:02:35.310> attach<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.450> pole<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:36.780> now<00:02:37.170> we

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
can attach this to this pole so now we

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.590 
can attach this to this pole so now we
need<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> go<00:02:37.770> over<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.190> into<00:02:38.340> sim<00:02:38.760> node<00:02:39.240> under

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
need to go over here into sim node under

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.380 
need to go over here into sim node under
group<00:02:40.380> again<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:41.850> need<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.120> select

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
group again and we just need to select

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.630 
group again and we just need to select
our<00:02:42.570> five<00:02:42.810> pole<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.530> once<00:02:43.710> it's<00:02:43.890> selected<00:02:46.640> we

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
our five pole so once it's selected we

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.810 
our five pole so once it's selected we
need<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.820> go<00:02:47.910> ahead<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.300> make<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.750> force<00:02:49.820> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
need to go ahead and make a force the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.880 
need to go ahead and make a force the
force<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.240> we<00:02:51.330> need<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.690> wind<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.380> we<00:02:52.590> need<00:02:52.800> to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
force that we need is wind so we need to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.410 
force that we need is wind so we need to
go<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.100> create<00:02:54.260> space<00:02:55.260> warps<00:02:55.620> forces<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.760> wind

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
go to create space warps forces and wind

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.740 
go to create space warps forces and wind
I<00:02:59.900> go<00:03:00.900> into<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.140> top<00:03:01.380> modifier<00:03:01.890> here<00:03:02.540> drag<00:03:03.540> it

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
I go into a top modifier here drag it

going to need at least 30 for the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.310 
going to need at least 30 for the
strength<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.870> let's<00:03:41.209> go<00:03:42.209> into<00:03:42.420> our<00:03:42.600> cloth

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
strength and let's go into our cloth

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.500 
strength and let's go into our cloth
here<00:03:43.709> click<00:03:44.100> on<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.900> we're<00:03:46.440> going<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.510> add

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
here click on it and we're going to add

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.199 
here click on it and we're going to add
the<00:03:48.959> wind<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.160> cloth<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.730> we<00:03:50.850> need<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.090> go

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
the wind to the cloth so we need to go

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.199 
the wind to the cloth so we need to go
to<00:03:51.270> car<00:03:51.570> forces<00:03:52.110> right<00:03:52.410> here<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:54.000> wind

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
to car forces right here and the wind

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.210 
to car forces right here and the wind
needs<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.990> be<00:03:55.140> brought<00:03:55.380> over<00:03:55.620> into<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
needs to be brought over into the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.520 
needs to be brought over into the
simulation<00:03:56.959> just<00:03:57.959> press<00:03:58.200> ok<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.750> now<00:04:01.020> once<00:04:01.380> we

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
simulation just press ok so now once we

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.800 
simulation just press ok so now once we
simulate<00:04:02.070> this<00:04:02.310> we<00:04:02.520> will<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.940> Boeing<00:04:03.480> flag

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
simulate this we will have a Boeing flag

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.370 
simulate this we will have a Boeing flag
in<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.200> wind<00:04:05.300> if<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.480> simulate<00:04:06.720> local<00:04:07.230> it's

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
in the wind if you simulate local it's

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.199 
in the wind if you simulate local it's
not<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.890> simulate<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.520> entire<00:04:08.640> thing

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
not going to simulate the entire thing

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.770 
not going to simulate the entire thing
if<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.900> simulate<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:11.030> simulate<00:04:12.030> everything

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
if you simulate just simulate everything

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.090 
if you simulate just simulate everything
it'll<00:04:13.560> do<00:04:13.890> as<00:04:14.160> many<00:04:14.490> frames<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.209> here

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
it'll do as many frames you have here

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.410 
it'll do as many frames you have here
and<00:04:17.100> we<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:17.250> hundreds<00:04:17.730> so<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.030> might<00:04:18.150> take<00:04:18.390> a

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
and we have hundreds so it might take a

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.240 
and we have hundreds so it might take a
while<00:04:18.570> so<00:04:18.750> we're<00:04:18.900> just<00:04:18.930> going<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.260> simulate

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
while so we're just going to simulate

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.390 
while so we're just going to simulate
local<00:04:20.850> just<00:04:21.090> show<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.359> what<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.690> looks<00:04:21.750> like

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.320 

it<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.670> moving<00:04:28.090> but<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:28.630> doing<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:30.330> little

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
it is moving but it's doing a little

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.170 
it is moving but it's doing a little
strong<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.580> we'll<00:04:33.880> go<00:04:34.000> back<00:04:34.210> into<00:04:34.480> our<00:04:36.180> wind

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
strong so we'll go back into our wind

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.910 
strong so we'll go back into our wind
here<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:37.990> we're<00:04:38.110> gonna<00:04:38.200> bring<00:04:38.350> our<00:04:38.500> wind<00:04:38.710> down

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
here and we're gonna bring our wind down

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.850 
here and we're gonna bring our wind down
to<00:04:39.220> about<00:04:40.380> 20<00:04:42.030> go<00:04:43.030> back<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.360> our<00:04:43.480> cloth

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
to about 20 go back to our cloth

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.790 
to about 20 go back to our cloth
simulate<00:04:45.150> see<00:04:46.150> what<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.480> does<00:04:48.660> it's<00:04:49.800> blowing

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
simulate see what that does it's blowing

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.410 
simulate see what that does it's blowing
but<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:52.800> still<00:04:53.800> blowing<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.460> little<00:04:54.610> little

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
but it's still blowing a little little

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.220 
but it's still blowing a little little
too<00:04:55.660> hard

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
too hard

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:05.280 
too hard
well<00:04:57.010> maybe<00:04:57.220> it's<00:04:58.090> coming<00:04:58.450> down<00:05:01.470> mm-hmm<00:05:04.290> now

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
well maybe it's coming down mm-hmm now

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.520 
well maybe it's coming down mm-hmm now
if<00:05:05.470> we<00:05:05.650> just<00:05:05.680> undo<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.170> turn<00:05:08.170> off<00:05:08.320> our

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530

it<00:05:10.180> might<00:05:10.810> work<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.770> little<00:05:11.890> bit<00:05:12.190> better<00:05:12.520> just

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
it might work a little bit better just

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.180 
it might work a little bit better just
control<00:05:13.570> Z<00:05:13.750> twice<00:05:14.170> to<00:05:14.440> get<00:05:14.560> it<00:05:14.680> back<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:15.010> where

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
control Z twice to get it back to where

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.830 
control Z twice to get it back to where
it<00:05:15.250> was<00:05:15.419> go<00:05:16.419> ahead<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.660> simulate<00:05:16.900> local<00:05:17.530> again

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.710 

you<00:05:22.840> have<00:05:22.960> to<00:05:23.080> play<00:05:23.260> round<00:05:23.500> piece<00:05:23.710> settings<00:05:24.720> go

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
you have to play round piece settings go

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.120 
you have to play round piece settings go
back<00:05:25.900> into<00:05:26.140> your<00:05:26.290> wind<00:05:26.620> we're<00:05:26.770> going<00:05:26.890> to<00:05:26.950> bring

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
back into your wind we're going to bring

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.380 
back into your wind we're going to bring
this<00:05:27.310> down<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.640> ten<00:05:30.330> go<00:05:31.330> back<00:05:31.510> to<00:05:31.720> our<00:05:31.810> cloth<00:05:32.340> um

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
this down to ten go back to our cloth um

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.290 
this down to ten go back to our cloth um
I'm<00:05:34.390> going<00:05:34.540> to<00:05:34.630> leave<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.870> gravity<00:05:35.290> on

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
I'm going to leave the gravity on

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:47.520 
I'm going to leave the gravity on
simulate<00:05:37.300> local<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:42.280> should<00:05:42.700> be<00:05:46.530> dropping

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
simulate local it should be dropping

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.870 
simulate local it should be dropping
anytime<00:05:48.220> soon<00:05:48.990> it's<00:05:50.340> probably<00:05:51.340> because<00:05:51.729> we

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
anytime soon it's probably because we

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.540 
anytime soon it's probably because we
have<00:05:52.090> all<00:05:52.390> of<00:05:52.419> these<00:05:52.720> um<00:05:54.660> extra<00:05:56.040> pieces<00:05:57.040> and

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
have all of these um extra pieces and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.640 
have all of these um extra pieces and
extra<00:05:57.970> faces<00:05:58.450> in<00:05:58.600> here<00:05:58.870> it's<00:05:59.080> taking<00:05:59.290> it<00:05:59.560> a

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
extra faces in here it's taking it a

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.659 
extra faces in here it's taking it a
little<00:05:59.830> longer<00:06:00.070> to<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:01.840> simulate<00:06:02.080> so<00:06:02.640> what<00:06:03.640> I

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
little longer to to simulate so what I

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.190 
little longer to to simulate so what I
can<00:06:03.790> do<00:06:04.030> to<00:06:04.150> fix<00:06:04.360> that<00:06:04.479> real<00:06:04.810> quick<00:06:06.990> let's<00:06:07.990> go

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
can do to fix that real quick let's go

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.550 
can do to fix that real quick let's go
into<00:06:08.500> our<00:06:08.669> garment<00:06:09.669> maker<00:06:10.140> let's<00:06:11.140> just<00:06:11.320> bring

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
into our garment maker let's just bring

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.700 
into our garment maker let's just bring
this<00:06:11.740> down<00:06:14.580> just<00:06:15.580> for<00:06:15.790> reference<00:06:15.970> here<00:06:16.710> go

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
this down just for reference here go

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.520 
this down just for reference here go
back<00:06:17.860> into<00:06:18.130> our<00:06:18.220> cloth<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:19.169> simulate<00:06:20.169> local

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
back into our cloth and simulate local

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.600 
back into our cloth and simulate local
again<00:06:20.860> there<00:06:21.190> we<00:06:21.310> go<00:06:21.340> I<00:06:22.050> had<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.080> lot<00:06:23.350> of<00:06:23.610> faces

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
again there we go I had a lot of faces

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.780 
again there we go I had a lot of faces
on<00:06:24.760> there<00:06:25.710> so<00:06:26.710> now<00:06:26.830> you<00:06:26.890> got<00:06:27.070> a<00:06:27.100> flag<00:06:27.400> blowing

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
on there so now you got a flag blowing

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.460 
on there so now you got a flag blowing
in<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.210> wind<00:06:29.640> it<00:06:30.640> looks<00:06:30.910> fairly<00:06:31.210> good

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
in the wind it looks fairly good

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.650 
in the wind it looks fairly good
but<00:06:32.920> I<00:06:32.950> think<00:06:33.250> we<00:06:33.370> can<00:06:33.580> make<00:06:33.730> it<00:06:33.760> look<00:06:34.030> a<00:06:34.300> little

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
but I think we can make it look a little

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.290 
but I think we can make it look a little
bit<00:06:34.930> better<00:06:36.330> stop<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.510> simulation<00:06:38.190> control-z

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
bit better stop the simulation control-z

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.010 
bit better stop the simulation control-z
grab<00:06:40.300> your<00:06:40.480> wind

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
grab your wind

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.750 
grab your wind
let's<00:06:41.170> bring<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.590> strength<00:06:41.860> back<00:06:42.130> up<00:06:42.430> to<00:06:43.420> 20

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
let's bring the strength back up to 20

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:54.090 
let's bring the strength back up to 20
see<00:06:45.760> what<00:06:45.910> that<00:06:46.060> does<00:06:46.300> to<00:06:46.360> the<00:06:47.020> flag<00:06:52.890> it's<00:06:53.890> kind

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
see what that does to the flag it's kind

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.360 
see what that does to the flag it's kind
of<00:06:54.160> blowing<00:06:54.520> all<00:06:54.640> over<00:06:54.670> the<00:06:54.940> place<00:06:59.160> well<00:07:00.160> I

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
of blowing all over the place well I

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.910 
of blowing all over the place well I
think<00:07:00.520> that<00:07:00.880> about<00:07:01.090> does<00:07:01.150> it<00:07:01.540> guys<00:07:02.110> if<00:07:02.770> you

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:02.920 
think that about does it guys if you

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.610 
think that about does it guys if you
want<00:07:03.070> to<00:07:03.160> simulate<00:07:03.400> this<00:07:03.820> out<00:07:04.120> just<00:07:04.420> press<00:07:05.350> the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
want to simulate this out just press the

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.910 
want to simulate this out just press the
simulation<00:07:06.310> button<00:07:06.760> here<00:07:07.030> now<00:07:07.840> this<00:07:08.650> flag

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
simulation button here now this flag

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.980 
simulation button here now this flag
seems<00:07:09.280> a<00:07:09.370> little<00:07:09.430> bit<00:07:09.640> baked<00:07:10.000> so<00:07:10.510> it's<00:07:10.840> going

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
seems a little bit baked so it's going

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.450 
seems a little bit baked so it's going
to<00:07:11.050> be<00:07:11.230> flopping<00:07:11.770> all<00:07:11.920> over<00:07:12.040> the<00:07:12.190> place<00:07:12.510> but

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
to be flopping all over the place but

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.890 
to be flopping all over the place but
let's<00:07:15.460> get<00:07:15.670> a<00:07:15.730> quick<00:07:15.940> render<00:07:16.690> on<00:07:16.930> it<00:07:18.870> see<00:07:19.870> what

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
let's get a quick render on it see what

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.460 
let's get a quick render on it see what
it<00:07:20.020> looks<00:07:20.290> like<00:07:20.760> if<00:07:21.760> the<00:07:22.450> more<00:07:22.660> Poly's<00:07:23.230> you

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
it looks like if the more Poly's you

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.380 
it looks like if the more Poly's you
have<00:07:23.680> the<00:07:23.919> more<00:07:24.100> faces<00:07:24.550> you<00:07:24.669> have<00:07:24.700> better<00:07:25.180> the

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.390 
have the more faces you have better the

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.740 
have the more faces you have better the
cloth<00:07:25.630> is<00:07:25.840> going<00:07:26.140> to<00:07:26.200> look<00:07:26.440> so<00:07:27.510> just<00:07:28.510> play

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
cloth is going to look so just play

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.370 
cloth is going to look so just play
around<00:07:28.870> with<00:07:29.020> the<00:07:29.140> settings<00:07:29.470> um<00:07:31.230> you<00:07:32.230> guys

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380 
around with the settings um you guys

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.490 
around with the settings um you guys
aren't<00:07:32.620> a<00:07:32.740> question<00:07:33.100> just<00:07:33.400> give<00:07:33.580> me<00:07:33.640> an<00:07:33.760> email
