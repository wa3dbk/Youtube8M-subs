just<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> name<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> few<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.220> let's<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.150> right

just to name a few and let's get right

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.429 
just to name a few and let's get right
into<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.600> clips<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.080> think<00:00:22.289> that's

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
into the clips because I think that's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.170 
into the clips because I think that's
the<00:00:22.560> most<00:00:22.769> important<00:00:23.310> thing<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.820> class

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
the most important thing with this class

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.839 
the most important thing with this class
is<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.720> kind<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.080> show<00:00:25.350> what's<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.490> so

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
is to kind of show what's going on so

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
is to kind of show what's going on so
basically<00:00:27.779> when<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.019> kill<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.410> player<00:00:28.920> they

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
basically when you kill a player they

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
basically when you kill a player they
drop<00:00:29.640> their<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.119> their<00:00:30.390> items<00:00:30.779> into<00:00:31.019> HS<00:00:31.619> where

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
drop their all their items into HS where

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
drop their all their items into HS where
they<00:00:32.040> died<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> very<00:00:32.940> convenient

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
they died it's that's a very convenient

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.690 
they died it's that's a very convenient
because<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.710> think<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.520> those

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
because you can think about it all those

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
because you can think about it all those
times<00:00:35.969> where<00:00:36.239> you've<00:00:36.329> kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> had<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> cycle

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
times where you've kind of had to cycle

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
times where you've kind of had to cycle
through<00:00:37.890> stuff<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.090> need<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
through stuff that you don't need and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209 
through stuff that you don't need and
stuff<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.500> want<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.010> stuff

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
stuff that you know you want and stuff

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
stuff that you know you want and stuff
like<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.570> goes<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> chest

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
like that but it just goes into a chest

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
like that but it just goes into a chest
and<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.190> shift<00:00:44.550> click<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.120> items

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
and you can shift click all the items

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450 
and you can shift click all the items
that's<00:00:45.780> kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.860> very<00:00:47.129> important

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that's kind of a very very important

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.770 
that's kind of a very very important
thing<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:47.940> learning<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> shift

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
thing with that is learning how to shift

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.180 
thing with that is learning how to shift
click<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.170> think<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> lot<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> people<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:50.010> how

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
click I think a lot of people know how

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.369 
click I think a lot of people know how
to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> your

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to do that but you're just going to your

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.170 
to do that but you're just going to your
chest<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.070> shift<00:00:53.340> click<00:00:53.579> all<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.789> items

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
chest and just shift click all the items

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.299 
chest and just shift click all the items
just<00:00:54.870> take<00:00:55.050> everything<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.739> need<00:00:55.949> kind

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
just take everything that you need kind

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.619 
just take everything that you need kind
of<00:00:56.370> leave<00:00:56.489> everything<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.000> don't<00:00:57.210> need<00:00:57.360> there

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of leave everything you don't need there

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.970 
of leave everything you don't need there
and<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> pick<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.289> stuff<00:00:58.500> along<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> way

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and if you pick up stuff along the way

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979 
and if you pick up stuff along the way
that<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.370> don't<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.539> put<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.870> into

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that you don't need you can put it into

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
that you don't need you can put it into
the<00:01:01.050> chest<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.469> well<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.100> important

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the chest as well so it's very important

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.609 
the chest as well so it's very important
but<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:04.229> good<00:01:04.470> because

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
but I think this is really good because

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
but I think this is really good because
all<00:01:05.159> those<00:01:05.309> times<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.060> need<00:01:06.540> like

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
all those times where you just need like

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
all those times where you just need like
something<00:01:07.110> such<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.740> chest<00:01:08.010> plate<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
something such as a chest plate or you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.820 
something such as a chest plate or you
know<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.360> sword<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:09.750> something<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.650> can

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
know just a sword or something you can

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.800 
know just a sword or something you can
just<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.280> into<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> chest<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.180> take<00:01:12.600> those

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
just go into the chest and take those

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.929 
just go into the chest and take those
items<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.439> leave<00:01:13.560> everything<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.250> pointless

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
items and leave everything the pointless

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.300 
items and leave everything the pointless
items<00:01:15.240> behind<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.960> something<00:01:16.830> i<00:01:16.920> should<00:01:17.159> add

items behind and something i should add

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010 
items behind and something i should add
is<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> isn't<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> very<00:01:18.360> good<00:01:18.540> like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
is this isn't a very good like

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.499 
is this isn't a very good like
team-oriented<00:01:19.590> class<00:01:20.009> because<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.270> do

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
team-oriented class because if you do

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.240 
team-oriented class because if you do
not<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> kill<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.560> teammate<00:01:22.950> gets<00:01:23.130> the

killed and diam's get dispersed like

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.109 
killed and diam's get dispersed like
normal<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.159> kind<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.970> go

normal they kind of you know you can go
everywhere<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> cycle<00:01:28.619> through

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
everywhere and get the cycle through

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
everywhere and get the cycle through
items<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.220> normal<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
items like normal but if you do get to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.719 
items like normal but if you do get to
kill<00:01:30.960> than<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> could<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.619> useful

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
kill than it could be very useful

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
kill than it could be very useful
another<00:01:32.729> two<00:01:33.000> things<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> add<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
another two things to add is that if you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
another two things to add is that if you
do<00:01:35.070> kill<00:01:35.280> someone<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.790> MVP<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.500> do

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
do kill someone with MVP then they do

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.130 
do kill someone with MVP then they do
respawn<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.579> their<00:01:39.030> items<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.810> actually

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
respawn and their items don't actually

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
respawn and their items don't actually
go<00:01:40.259> into<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> chest<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.159> kind<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> get

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
go into the chest that just kind of get

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
go into the chest that just kind of get
dispersed<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.570> normal<00:01:42.960> also<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.979> kill

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
dispersed like normal also if you kill

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
dispersed like normal also if you kill
someone<00:01:44.520> where<00:01:45.180> an<00:01:45.479> Ender<00:01:45.869> mage<00:01:46.049> puts<00:01:46.590> their

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
someone where an Ender mage puts their

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
someone where an Ender mage puts their
portal<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> block<00:01:48.180> forms<00:01:48.689> again

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
portal and then the block forms again

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.830 
portal and then the block forms again
their<00:01:49.770> items<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:50.640> dispersed<00:01:51.060> once<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
their items will get dispersed once the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
their items will get dispersed once the
block<00:01:52.049> goes<00:01:52.259> back<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.070> something

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
block goes back so that's something

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
block goes back so that's something
important<00:01:53.850> add<00:01:53.970> also<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.290> I'd

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
important add also I like to do is I'd

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.100 
important add also I like to do is I'd
like<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.950> use<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.159> chest<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.909> bait<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.479> kind<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
like to use my chest as bait so kind of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.590 
like to use my chest as bait so kind of
think<00:01:58.290> about<00:01:58.380> where<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.950> chests<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.850> if

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
think about where your chests are and if

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
think about where your chests are and if
you<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.170> hear<00:02:01.469> someone<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.040> open<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> chest

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you if you hear someone you open a chest

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
you if you hear someone you open a chest
you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.450> run<00:02:03.659> over<00:02:03.689> there<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.049> kill

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you can just run over there and kill

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.450 
you can just run over there and kill
them<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.740> they're<00:02:04.920> looking<00:02:05.189> through<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
them as they're looking through the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
them as they're looking through the
items<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.909> right<00:02:06.479> there<00:02:06.689> there's<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> very

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
items and right there there's a very

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.380 
items and right there there's a very
important<00:02:07.649> thing<00:02:07.860> why<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
important thing why I think the this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.029 
important thing why I think the this
class<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.929> good<00:02:10.110> because<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:11.009> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
class is good because you can see that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.059 
class is good because you can see that
person<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.730> kind<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
person was kind of

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.949 
person was kind of
looking<00:02:12.310> through<00:02:12.519> their<00:02:12.670> inventory<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
looking through their inventory and I

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.009 
looking through their inventory and I
got<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.200> very<00:02:14.620> easy<00:02:14.829> kill<00:02:15.219> so<00:02:15.640> that's<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.389> also

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
got a very easy kill so that's that also

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.289 
got a very easy kill so that's that also
let's<00:02:17.379> get<00:02:17.530> into<00:02:17.709> tach<00:02:17.980> 1421<00:02:18.790> scale<00:02:19.150> I

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
let's get into tach 1421 scale I

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.869 
let's get into tach 1421 scale I
performed<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.989> scale<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.379> 1<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.950> 10<00:02:20.980> first

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
performed on a scale of 1 to 10 first

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.069 
performed on a scale of 1 to 10 first
off<00:02:22.060> start<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.420> game<00:02:22.569> I'm<00:02:22.749> going<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.930> give<00:02:23.049> a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
off start the game I'm going to give a

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.679 
off start the game I'm going to give a
six<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.799> that's<00:02:24.249> because<00:02:24.459> people<00:02:25.389> in<00:02:25.569> the

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
six and that's because people in the

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.000 
six and that's because people in the
begin<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.049> game<00:02:26.200> don't<00:02:26.409> really<00:02:26.650> have<00:02:26.799> too

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
begin of the game don't really have too

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.379 
begin of the game don't really have too
many<00:02:27.069> items<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.639> it's<00:02:27.760> not<00:02:27.849> going<00:02:27.969> to<00:02:28.060> be<00:02:28.209> that

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
many items so it's not going to be that

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.940 
many items so it's not going to be that
important<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.530> cycle<00:02:29.769> through

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
important but you can cycle through

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.349 
important but you can cycle through
those<00:02:30.189> items<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.790> don't<00:02:31.030> need<00:02:31.180> which

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
those items that you don't need which

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.330 
those items that you don't need which
can<00:02:31.510> be<00:02:31.629> helpful<00:02:31.900> such<00:02:32.260> as<00:02:32.409> like<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:33.250> know

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
can be helpful such as like the you know

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.220 
can be helpful such as like the you know
seeds<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.909> stuff<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.239> on<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:35.019> long

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
seeds and stuff like that on the long

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.809 
seeds and stuff like that on the long
run<00:02:35.409> I'm<00:02:35.530> going<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.709> give<00:02:35.799> it<00:02:35.889> a<00:02:35.980> seven<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.639> can

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
run I'm going to give it a seven it can

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.339 
run I'm going to give it a seven it can
be<00:02:36.969> kind<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.359> useful<00:02:37.540> during<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.109> end<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.140 
be kind of useful during the end of the
game<00:02:38.379> because<00:02:38.829> people<00:02:39.340> have<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.549> lot<00:02:39.849> of<00:02:39.879> items

the chest that you don't need stuff like

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.830 
the chest that you don't need stuff like
that<00:02:47.349> on<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:48.340> team<00:02:48.639> support<00:02:49.060> as<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.599> said<00:02:49.810> before

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
that on to team support as I said before

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.050 
that on to team support as I said before
this<00:02:50.349> isn't<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.799> best<00:02:51.040> team<00:02:51.310> oriented<00:02:51.790> class

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
this isn't the best team oriented class

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.270 
this isn't the best team oriented class
so<00:02:52.299> I'm<00:02:52.359> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.510> give<00:02:52.629> it<00:02:52.659> a<00:02:52.780> five<00:02:53.109> and<00:02:53.469> I
