00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
that's actually like from 300 the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.360 
that's actually like from 300 the
soldier<00:02:38.990> helmets<00:02:39.350> like<00:02:39.440> these<00:02:39.770> guys<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.250> is

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
soldier helmets like these guys this is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.160 
soldier helmets like these guys this is
metal<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.480> they<00:02:41.540> do<00:02:41.600> make<00:02:41.780> them<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.020> plastic

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
metal and they do make them in plastic

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.470 
metal and they do make them in plastic
we<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.770> plastic<00:02:42.950> ones<00:02:43.400> too<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.420> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
we have the plastic ones too this is a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.110 
we have the plastic ones too this is a
metal<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:45.550> sometimes<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:46.670> think<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
metal one sometimes I think that the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.790 
metal one sometimes I think that the
plaster<00:02:47.510> go<00:02:47.630> easy<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.020> deal<00:02:48.170> with<00:02:48.410> because<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
plaster go easy to deal with because the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.070 
plaster go easy to deal with because the
metal<00:02:48.980> it's<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> little<00:02:49.340> heavy<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.600> that's

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
metal it's a little heavy but that's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.990 
metal it's a little heavy but that's
sort<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.260> what<00:02:51.380> these<00:02:51.500> guys<00:02:51.710> are<00:02:52.000> and

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
sort of what these guys are and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.470 
sort of what these guys are and
currently<00:02:53.450> we<00:02:53.600> actually<00:02:53.900> have<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.820> brass<00:02:55.820> one<00:02:55.850> a
