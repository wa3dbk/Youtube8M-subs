but<00:01:16.799> make<00:01:17.100> sure<00:01:17.130> those<00:01:17.460> EXO<00:01:17.820> abilities<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.330> in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
but make sure those EXO abilities are in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
but make sure those EXO abilities are in
the<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.689> order<00:01:18.990> otherwise<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.860> not

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the right order otherwise it will not

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
the right order otherwise it will not
work<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.869> walk

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
work so all you have to do now is walk

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
work so all you have to do now is walk
on<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.159> flag<00:01:23.610> stand<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.299> top<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.689> it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080 
on over to the flag stand on top of it
and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.049> jump<00:01:25.380> up<00:01:25.560> activate<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.430> XO<00:01:26.790> hover

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and then jump up activate your XO hover

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.210 
and then jump up activate your XO hover
finish<00:01:27.720> capturing<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> flag<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
finish capturing the flag and then you

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.609 
finish capturing the flag and then you
will<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.520> XO<00:01:29.909> hover<00:01:30.150> forever<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.229> having

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
will have XO hover forever now having

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.289 
will have XO hover forever now having
the<00:01:31.650> unlimited<00:01:32.040> XO<00:01:32.490> hover<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.820> pretty<00:01:33.060> cool

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the unlimited XO hover is pretty cool

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
the unlimited XO hover is pretty cool
because<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.659> fly<00:01:34.110> outside<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> level

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
because you can fly outside the level

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.590 
because you can fly outside the level
and<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.759> minute<00:01:35.939> you're<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.479> that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and in a minute you're going to see that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.359 
and in a minute you're going to see that
I<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.200> railing<00:01:37.560> over<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.130> big

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
I go over the railing over this big

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.340 
I go over the railing over this big
volcano<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.450> fly<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.990> into<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
volcano and I kind of fly out into the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
volcano and I kind of fly out into the
middle<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> usually<00:01:41.520> there's<00:01:41.729> no<00:01:41.939> way<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
middle of it usually there's no way to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.090 
middle of it usually there's no way to
get<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.780> even<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.229> other<00:01:43.470> mods<00:01:43.860> like

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
get out there even with other mods like

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980 
get out there even with other mods like
the<00:01:44.250> knock-back<00:01:44.490> mod<00:01:45.000> there's<00:01:45.240> no<00:01:45.450> way<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> get

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
the knock-back mod there's no way to get

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.480 
the knock-back mod there's no way to get
out<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.130> cool<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> get

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
out there so it is really cool to get

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.280 
out there so it is really cool to get
out<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.820> especially<00:01:48.210> when<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.930> starts<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
out there especially when it starts to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.899 
out there especially when it starts to
erupt<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.860> start<00:01:50.040> shooting<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> big
