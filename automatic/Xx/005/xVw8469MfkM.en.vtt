00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.910 
come on after a cold start stay on I
don't<00:00:15.509> know<00:00:15.660> 5<00:00:15.960> 10<00:00:16.230> minutes<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.800> then

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
don't know 5 10 minutes and then

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.580 
don't know 5 10 minutes and then
eventually<00:00:17.550> shut<00:00:18.000> itself<00:00:18.270> back<00:00:18.510> off<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.439> I'll

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
eventually shut itself back off so I'll

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.900 
eventually shut itself back off so I'll
show<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:19.980> battery<00:00:20.369> light<00:00:20.580> looks

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
show you what that battery light looks

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.040 
show you what that battery light looks
like<00:00:21.410> so<00:00:22.410> when<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.619> turn<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> car<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.189> without

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
like so when you turn the car on without

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.410 
like so when you turn the car on without
any<00:00:25.050> power<00:00:25.730> see<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.029> see<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:29.420> may

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
any power see if we can see it there may

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.440 
any power see if we can see it there may
be<00:00:30.480> difficult<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.500> camera<00:00:31.980> but

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
be difficult to see on this camera but

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
be difficult to see on this camera but
there<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.960> top<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.410> light<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there it is the top right light that you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.639 
there it is the top right light that you
see<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.579> battery<00:00:35.880> light<00:00:36.149> stays<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.440> course

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
see the battery light stays on of course

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
see the battery light stays on of course
when<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> engines<00:00:38.100> off<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.149> were

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
when the engines off but then if we were

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.330 
when the engines off but then if we were
to<00:00:39.420> turn<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> engine<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.739> should<00:00:40.950> go<00:00:41.129> off

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
to turn the engine on it should go off

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.580 
to turn the engine on it should go off
and<00:00:41.670> normal<00:00:42.000> operation<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.989> wasn't<00:00:43.379> doing

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and normal operation it wasn't doing

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380 
and normal operation it wasn't doing
that<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:44.040> cold<00:00:44.399> starts<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.059> anyway

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
that on cold starts and so anyway

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
that on cold starts and so anyway
started<00:00:46.289> reading<00:00:46.500> about<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.860> sounds<00:00:47.730> like

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
started reading about it sounds like

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.229 
started reading about it sounds like
what<00:00:48.420> causes<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.410> problem<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.879> voltage

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
what causes the problem is the voltage

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.700 
what causes the problem is the voltage
regulator<00:00:51.750> that's<00:00:52.079> built<00:00:52.320> into<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
regulator that's built into the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.220 
regulator that's built into the
alternator<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:54.000> I've<00:00:54.270> decided<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.870> test<00:00:55.079> this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
alternator so I've decided to test this

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
alternator so I've decided to test this
know<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.770> did<00:00:55.829> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
know the way that I did it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.099 
know the way that I did it
looking<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> battery<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.780> I've<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
looking at the battery here I've got the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
looking at the battery here I've got the
battery<00:00:58.350> cover<00:00:58.559> removed<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.550> remove<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
battery cover removed if you remove the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.189 
battery cover removed if you remove the
positive<00:01:00.899> terminal<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.280> battery<00:01:03.199> while

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
positive terminal from the battery while

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
positive terminal from the battery while
the<00:01:04.379> car<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.619> running<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.549> car<00:01:05.729> should

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the car is running the car should

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
the car is running the car should
continue<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> run<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.229> alternator

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
continue to run because the alternator

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.469 
continue to run because the alternator
will<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.890> providing<00:01:08.310> power<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.299> car

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
will be providing power for the car

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
will be providing power for the car
however<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> alternator<00:01:10.950> isn't<00:01:11.369> working

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
however if the alternator isn't working

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.109 
however if the alternator isn't working
and<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.270> were<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> remove<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.909> car

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
and you were to remove that then the car

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.990 
and you were to remove that then the car
should<00:01:15.270> die<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:16.530> means<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.100> while<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
should die that means that while the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
should die that means that while the
alternator<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.750> working<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.350> battery<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
alternator is not working the battery is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.990 
alternator is not working the battery is
the<00:01:19.830> only<00:01:20.070> thing<00:01:20.280> supplying<00:01:20.729> power

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the only thing supplying power

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.890 
the only thing supplying power
electrical<00:01:21.720> power<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> vehicle<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.689> car

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
electrical power for the vehicle the car

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
electrical power for the vehicle the car
will<00:01:25.140> run<00:01:25.439> without<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> alternator<00:01:26.520> working

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
will run without the alternator working

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.819 
will run without the alternator working
for<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.150> short<00:01:27.330> period<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.570> time<00:01:27.630> say<00:01:28.110> maybe<00:01:28.320> 15

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
for a short period of time say maybe 15

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.399 
for a short period of time say maybe 15
between<00:01:29.280> 15<00:01:29.640> 30<00:01:29.939> minutes

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
between 15 30 minutes

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.270 
between 15 30 minutes
eventually<00:01:31.409> what<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.619> happen<00:01:31.680> though<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
eventually what will happen though is it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
eventually what will happen though is it
will<00:01:32.369> suck<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.729> charge<00:01:33.509> out<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
will suck all the charge out of the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.899 
will suck all the charge out of the
battery<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:35.070> battery<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.640> we'll<00:01:35.790> probably

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
battery the battery then we'll probably

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.010 
battery the battery then we'll probably
be<00:01:36.299> ruined

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
be ruined

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.390 
be ruined
because<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.710> only<00:01:37.770> stand<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> be

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
because they can only stand to be

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
because they can only stand to be
completely<00:01:39.030> drained<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.570> recharged<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
completely drained and recharged for a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.539 
completely drained and recharged for a
certain<00:01:40.470> number<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.770> times<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.100> anyway<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
certain number of times so anyway I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.940 
certain number of times so anyway I
narrowed<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.420> down<00:01:42.590> determined<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.649> was<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
narrowed it down determined it was the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.179 
narrowed it down determined it was the
alternator<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> decided<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
alternator so I decided to do the

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
alternator so I decided to do the
replacement<00:01:47.189> myself<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.360> alternator<00:01:48.780> on

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
replacement myself now the alternator on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.240 
replacement myself now the alternator on
this<00:01:49.020> car<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.799> easy<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this car is actually really easy to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.870 
this car is actually really easy to
replace<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:52.409> hardest<00:01:52.770> part<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.220> removing<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
replace the hardest part is removing the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.209 
replace the hardest part is removing the
cowling<00:01:54.329> from<00:01:54.570> underneath<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> engine<00:01:55.219> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
cowling from underneath the engine the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
cowling from underneath the engine the
air<00:01:56.520> dam<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.090> all<00:01:57.180> those<00:01:57.329> things<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.659> anyway

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
air dam and all those things so anyway

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560 
air dam and all those things so anyway
here's<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> alternator<00:01:59.790> way<00:02:00.030> down<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> there

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
here's the alternator way down in there

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
here's the alternator way down in there
that<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:02.369> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.579> dark<00:02:02.790> but

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
that you can see it's kind of dark but

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.660 
that you can see it's kind of dark but
pretty<00:02:04.590> simple<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> remove<00:02:05.250> there's<00:02:05.520> only

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
pretty simple to remove there's only

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.109 
pretty simple to remove there's only
four<00:02:05.969> bolts<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.530> order<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.550> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
four bolts now in order to get to it you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.250 
four bolts now in order to get to it you
have<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.679> take<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.890> piece<00:02:11.129> here

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
have to take this piece here

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.399 
have to take this piece here
and<00:02:13.000> grad<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.030> believe<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.659> was<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> 14

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
and grad I believe it was a 14

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.369 
and grad I believe it was a 14
millimeter<00:02:15.890> wrench<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.940> wrench<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.840> towards

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
millimeter wrench and wrench it towards

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:19.960 
millimeter wrench and wrench it towards
the<00:02:18.500> firewall<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:18.980> if<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.400> take<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> wrench

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the firewall so if you take the wrench

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.899 
the firewall so if you take the wrench
and<00:02:20.239> push<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.200> direction<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:22.519> releases

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
and push it this direction that releases

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.369 
and push it this direction that releases
the<00:02:23.030> tension<00:02:23.150> on<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.480> serpentine<00:02:23.930> belt<00:02:23.989> and

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
the tension on a serpentine belt and

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.449 
the tension on a serpentine belt and
then<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.709> allows<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.129> take<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
then that allows you to take the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.119 
then that allows you to take the
serpentine<00:02:25.909> belt<00:02:25.940> down<00:02:26.780> here<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.980> just

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
serpentine belt down here and just

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.710 
serpentine belt down here and just
remove<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.489> from<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.730> alternator<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.599> can

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
remove it from the alternator you can

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.259 
remove it from the alternator you can
also<00:02:29.810> see<00:02:30.140> right<00:02:30.319> there<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.769> top<00:02:31.519> bolt<00:02:31.849> that

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
also see right there that top bolt that

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.460 
also see right there that top bolt that
your<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.930> right<00:02:33.080> in<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.200> middle<00:02:33.319> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
your that is right in the middle the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.119 
your that is right in the middle the
frame<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:33.950> that's<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.180> very<00:02:35.620> top<00:02:36.620> bolt<00:02:36.920> that

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
frame now that's the very top bolt that

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.569 
frame now that's the very top bolt that
holds<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.519> alternator<00:02:37.970> onto<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.870> vehicle

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
holds the alternator onto the vehicle

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.309 
holds the alternator onto the vehicle
there's<00:02:40.579> another<00:02:40.819> one<00:02:41.060> towards<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.079> middle

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
there's another one towards the middle

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.839 
there's another one towards the middle
of<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.409> car<00:02:42.680> from<00:02:43.069> here<00:02:43.250> but<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.519> can't<00:02:43.700> reach

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
of the car from here but you can't reach

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.160 
of the car from here but you can't reach
it<00:02:44.000> from<00:02:44.180> above<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.540> engine<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.049> get

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
it from above the engine you have to get

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.199 
it from above the engine you have to get
it<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.349> down<00:02:45.500> below<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.860> engine<00:02:46.099> so<00:02:46.910> anyway

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
it from down below the engine so anyway

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.610 
it from down below the engine so anyway
that's<00:02:47.480> how<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.750> access<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.230> alternator

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
that's how you access the alternator

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.339 
that's how you access the alternator
from<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.860> top<00:02:49.099> I<00:02:49.370> would<00:02:49.790> definitely<00:02:50.349> undo

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
from the top I would definitely undo

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.229 
from the top I would definitely undo
that<00:02:51.500> top<00:02:51.769> bolt<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.310> undo<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.790> serpentine

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
that top bolt and undo the serpentine

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.960 
that top bolt and undo the serpentine
belt<00:02:53.269> before<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> got<00:02:53.930> underneath<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.410> car

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
belt before I got underneath the car

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.449 
belt before I got underneath the car
looking<00:02:55.970> underneath<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.390> car<00:02:57.099> we<00:02:58.099> move<00:02:58.310> down

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
looking underneath the car we move down

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.119 
looking underneath the car we move down
here<00:02:58.489> maybe<00:02:59.359> a<00:02:59.510> little<00:02:59.750> dark<00:02:59.959> but<00:03:00.859> there<00:03:01.010> are

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
here maybe a little dark but there are

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.430 
here maybe a little dark but there are
bolts<00:03:01.549> all<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.510> way<00:03:02.599> around<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.989> front<00:03:03.200> edge

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
bolts all the way around the front edge

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.140 
bolts all the way around the front edge
so<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.190> see<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:04.459> go<00:03:04.579> all<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.000> from

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
so you can see they go all the way from

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.569 
so you can see they go all the way from
tire<00:03:05.690> around<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.379> front<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.769> bumper<00:03:07.099> all

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
tire around the front of the bumper all

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.210 
tire around the front of the bumper all
the<00:03:07.970> way<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.420> other<00:03:08.540> tire<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.890> are

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
the way to the other tire there are

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.640 
the way to the other tire there are
Phillips<00:03:10.910> head<00:03:11.120> screw<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:13.190> if<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:13.970> a

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
Phillips head screw and so if you have a

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.129 
Phillips head screw and so if you have a
drill<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.980> drill<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.239> remove<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.720> or<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:17.989> can

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
drill of drill to remove it or you can

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.170 
drill of drill to remove it or you can
just<00:03:18.230> use<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.380> screw<00:03:18.650> driver<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.980> remove<00:03:19.040> it<00:03:19.370> you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
just use a screw driver to remove it you

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.440 
just use a screw driver to remove it you
have<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.599> remove<00:03:20.780> all<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.109> those<00:03:21.319> there<00:03:22.310> also<00:03:22.519> I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
have to remove all of those there also I

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.020 
have to remove all of those there also I
believe<00:03:24.260> six<00:03:24.590> hex<00:03:24.889> nuts<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.519> think<00:03:25.880> they're

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
believe six hex nuts I think they're

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.479 
believe six hex nuts I think they're
twelve<00:03:26.329> millimeter<00:03:26.750> hex<00:03:27.590> nuts<00:03:27.889> maybe<00:03:28.160> ten<00:03:28.459> I

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
twelve millimeter hex nuts maybe ten I

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.659 
twelve millimeter hex nuts maybe ten I
can't<00:03:28.849> remember<00:03:29.000> right<00:03:29.919> along<00:03:30.919> underneath

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
can't remember right along underneath

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.000 
can't remember right along underneath
here<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.299> then<00:03:32.959> there's<00:03:33.200> two<00:03:33.410> just<00:03:33.709> inside

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
here and then there's two just inside

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.789 
here and then there's two just inside
each<00:03:34.160> wheel<00:03:34.370> arch<00:03:34.579> and<00:03:35.049> there's<00:03:36.049> one<00:03:36.290> there's

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
each wheel arch and there's one there's

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.710 
each wheel arch and there's one there's
two<00:03:36.829> over<00:03:37.190> here<00:03:37.220> on<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.519> side<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.060> then<00:03:38.599> the

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
two over here on this side and then the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.909 
two over here on this side and then the
same<00:03:38.900> thing<00:03:39.079> on<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.260> other<00:03:39.290> side<00:03:39.440> those<00:03:39.739> have

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
same thing on the other side those have

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.220 
same thing on the other side those have
to<00:03:39.950> be<00:03:40.099> removed<00:03:40.310> as<00:03:40.459> well<00:03:40.609> when<00:03:41.569> you<00:03:41.660> pull<00:03:42.079> all

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
to be removed as well when you pull all

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.039 
to be removed as well when you pull all
those<00:03:42.470> out<00:03:42.739> all<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.579> that<00:03:43.730> cowling<00:03:44.209> will<00:03:44.810> come

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
those out all of that cowling will come

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.339 
those out all of that cowling will come
off<00:03:45.169> of<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.410> car<00:03:45.560> pretty<00:03:45.769> easily

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
off of the car pretty easily

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.909 
off of the car pretty easily
unfortunately<00:03:48.349> I've<00:03:48.410> already<00:03:48.470> put<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.829> back

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
unfortunately I've already put it back

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.379 
unfortunately I've already put it back
on<00:03:49.099> there<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.609> I'm<00:03:49.730> not<00:03:49.819> going<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.030> pull<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.239> off

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
on there so I'm not going to pull it off

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.220 
on there so I'm not going to pull it off
again<00:03:50.829> because<00:03:51.829> that<00:03:52.010> was<00:03:52.690> oddly<00:03:53.690> honestly

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
again because that was oddly honestly

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.830 
again because that was oddly honestly
the<00:03:54.349> most<00:03:54.440> annoying<00:03:54.799> part<00:03:55.129> of<00:03:55.370> this

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
the most annoying part of this

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.559 
the most annoying part of this
replacement<00:03:56.950> here's<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.099> old<00:03:58.250> alternator<00:03:58.569> it

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
replacement here's the old alternator it

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.050 
replacement here's the old alternator it
fits<00:03:59.780> in<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.989> car<00:04:00.169> just<00:04:00.319> like<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:01.459> you

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
fits in the car just like this so you

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.390 
fits in the car just like this so you
can<00:04:02.239> see<00:04:02.419> this<00:04:03.019> side<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.560> fits<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.250> car

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
can see this side of it fits in the car

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.900 
can see this side of it fits in the car
this<00:04:04.549> direction<00:04:06.400> we're<00:04:07.400> looking<00:04:07.669> at<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.819> from

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
this direction we're looking at it from

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.460 
this direction we're looking at it from
the<00:04:08.000> top<00:04:08.030> view<00:04:08.209> now<00:04:08.569> so<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.959> bolt<00:04:09.199> that<00:04:09.349> we

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
the top view now so the bolt that we

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.080 
the top view now so the bolt that we
just<00:04:09.620> mentioned<00:04:10.010> earlier<00:04:10.310> goes<00:04:10.760> in<00:04:10.940> right

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
just mentioned earlier goes in right

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.150 
just mentioned earlier goes in right
here<00:04:11.419> you<00:04:12.379> can<00:04:12.500> see<00:04:12.590> where<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.769> serpentine

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
here you can see where the serpentine

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.770 
here you can see where the serpentine
belt<00:04:13.190> attaches<00:04:13.790> now<00:04:14.389> when<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.629> get

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
belt attaches now when you get

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.479 
belt attaches now when you get
underneath<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.199> car<00:04:15.230> you'll<00:04:15.590> see<00:04:15.829> that<00:04:16.280> there

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
underneath the car you'll see that there

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.250 
underneath the car you'll see that there
is<00:04:16.519> some<00:04:17.060> electrical<00:04:17.510> stuff<00:04:17.750> attached<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.169> the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
is some electrical stuff attached to the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.810 
is some electrical stuff attached to the
front<00:04:18.410> of<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.590> alternator<00:04:18.889> so<00:04:19.459> if<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.669> look

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
front of the alternator so if you look

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.659 
front of the alternator so if you look
right<00:04:19.970> here<00:04:20.289> on<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.769> very<00:04:21.950> front<00:04:22.190> you'll<00:04:22.520> see

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
right here on the very front you'll see

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.790 
right here on the very front you'll see
that<00:04:22.760> little<00:04:23.030> stud<00:04:23.270> sticking<00:04:23.659> out<00:04:23.810> there's<00:04:24.740> a

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
that little stud sticking out there's a

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.270 
that little stud sticking out there's a
nut

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
nut

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.830 
nut
it<00:04:25.490> screws<00:04:25.670> on<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.030> stun<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.300> hold<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.600> wire

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
it screws on to that stun to hold a wire

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.270 
it screws on to that stun to hold a wire
onto<00:04:27.410> there<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:27.860> it's<00:04:28.010> got<00:04:28.130> this<00:04:28.220> little

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
onto there and it's got this little

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.670 
onto there and it's got this little
plastic<00:04:28.880> cover<00:04:29.090> piece<00:04:29.360> on<00:04:29.570> top<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.470> or

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
plastic cover piece on top of it or

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.010 
plastic cover piece on top of it or
covering<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.280> you'll<00:04:31.400> have<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.550> remove

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
covering it that you'll have to remove

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.870 
covering it that you'll have to remove
believe<00:04:33.020> it's<00:04:33.139> a<00:04:33.170> 12<00:04:33.410> millimeter<00:04:33.620> nut<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.700> so

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
believe it's a 12 millimeter nut and so

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.000 
believe it's a 12 millimeter nut and so
you<00:04:35.419> have<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:35.630> remove<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.290> then<00:04:36.350> there's

there above it that you have to remove
as<00:04:40.790> well<00:04:40.820> pretty<00:04:41.570> easy<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.080> remove<00:04:42.320> both<00:04:42.680> of

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
as well pretty easy to remove both of

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.390 
as well pretty easy to remove both of
those<00:04:42.950> things

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400

here that's the one that's kind of up

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.460 
here that's the one that's kind of up
beside<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.610> radiator<00:05:02.169> you've<00:05:03.169> got<00:05:03.350> the
