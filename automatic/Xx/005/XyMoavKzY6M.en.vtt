00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.100
 everyone will talk about confessed kickboxing 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.110
 it took place several fights three 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.110
 fights of which two had 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.460
 Peruvian triumphs are first worth final 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.259
 the goal and a kick away from valentina 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.419
 really she looks a very person 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.869
 sweet very fragile but when it's over 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.720
 of a ring is transformed and it was very 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.640
 hit 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.489
 in the fight let's say in the background the fight 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.090
 principal and the sarria achieved its title 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.190
 world 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.460
 he had already achieved the title of 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.950
 superwelter not and this time in front of 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.490
 francisco dÃ­az in the category returned from 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.000
 lightweight won him tight fights out there 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.829
 the fight a comment that had been 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.840
 a fight a bit complicated for 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.579
 give it complicated and at least recognize 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.260
 I did not expect the Mexican to hit 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.600
 so hard and that goes both attack 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.730
 consult the statements just 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 terms of institute d euros 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.150
 they did not really tell me it was hard 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.590
 but I did not think it was so hard not a 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.510
 very strong fighter hit him and now 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.180
 it seemed that it did not make him side but less 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.710
 badly I was cutting it in the legs but 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.570
 it was a good hard fight comes too 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.400
 height with good physique no and that's 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.500
 allowed if you did not say 'other forces 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.880
 night to me to my son and all the peru not 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.110
 to come to be always pending 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.180
 this sport that is now resurging 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.400
 since now we have a new directive 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.170
 of the federation where the lord here the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.570
 veiled sir who is now presiding 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.640
 the federation I want to stop and I do not 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.740
 I consider the best for nothing but yes 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.790
 I work very hard to do better every 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.150
 day 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.460
 let's say maximum of my way of thinking and 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.170
 good thanks to god for the Lord for 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 everything he has given me and for making me 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.100
 again champion today my phrase is 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.660
 who believes in himself does not need that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.920
 also carabineros is my phrase of 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.190
 always with that I started and with that I 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.190
 I stay up Peru peru 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.280
 but not only is the sovereign in a 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.030
 category but in don mariano imagine 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.859
 All an achievement obtained by Miguel Sarria 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.920
 the possibilities for you among anyone 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.569
 imagine a world champion train me to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.920
 me until you take care do not mess with me 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.920
 because I'm good at getting nothing 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.290
 I'm afraid of valentina transforms 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.180
 within a record was we would arrive 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.859
