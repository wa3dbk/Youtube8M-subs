00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello friends and well now we are 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.160
 with a big surprise that we can not 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.230
 play gta 5 for ps 4 and then turn on 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 the console we put the game if you have it 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.920
 in digital, simply what 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.800
 they select and apparently everything runs 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.289
 normally here the let's say 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.789
 that the kinematics in which the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.130
 start of the game and it's a matter of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.740
 seconds for us to see an error 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.090
 well here we already see the error and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.740
 Well let's see what code is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.599
 an error occurred in the next 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.269
 application and the error code is the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.089
 very famous one was given a 34 87 80 and two 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.920
 recommended actions let's say that the 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.069
 first is the first action 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.100
 advisable gives us two other options and 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:47.850
 one is to update the application 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.499
 update the application 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.479
 it's practically something totally 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:54.449
 unnecessary because we have the 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.999
 updated update go the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.559
 problem is not going around now tells us 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.170
 also the next update the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.350
 system software also the problem 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.000
 do not go around however do it 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 update also the game update 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 what 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 the system and then at the end notify 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 of the problem and notify of the problem and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 so let's do a test to see 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 if the software is damaged to check 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.880
 if it really is a problem with the disk 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.500
 it's a problem with the digital copy and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.410
 for that we are going to remove the cable 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.410
 we remove the internet cable and then 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.570
 really what happens is that it's going to 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.570
 run into story mode and we're going to 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.130
 check if there is any problem if there 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.990
 some problem with programming and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.900
 really what we are going to check is from 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.840
 it usually runs we go 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.820
 that this game takes an eternity in 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.260
 get to the story mode but then 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.080
 let's do a little patient nothing more 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.330
 to do this test by removing the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.850
 eternal cable taking away the connection 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.890
 to the internet and let's see what load 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.800
 normally this game does not have any 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.229
 problem with software stability 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.229
 go then do not have any problem 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.390
 least in my case and it was then 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.790
 we already discard the two options that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.120
 it was not updated 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.970
 game we do not have it 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.489
 Well, it was not updated 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.890
 ts system 4 is also already made 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.360
 a test can not be done here but 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.310
 they can also update the system and 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.530
 they're going to see that it's not going around then 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.209
 right now we are doing like a 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.579
 test to see the stability of the game 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.140
 if really the problem is with the copy 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.319
 digital that we have or with the copy of 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.629
 disk that we have go and then we're going to 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.370
 expect this to be 100% complete and 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.319
 we appear in this case I think that I 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.319
 I have michael does not have to appear 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.980
 michael whom in this image but already 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.480
 we are missing less and less and then we are going to 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.510
 see where you are michael michael michael 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.920
 appears here we already have michael 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.780
 then we clearly see that, well, not 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.700
 it is a problem in the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.829
 stability of the game which is what 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.359
 we can do right now I already connect the 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.260
 cable wire to see what they say 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.049
 is 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.879
 the problem with I connect the cable the 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.040
 ethernet and clearly 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.769
 is going to take me out of this part point is going 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.780
 to take out and it's going to be the operation for 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.209
 get into history mode again and there 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.010
 the code is going to appear, which is what 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.290
 because really we can do this 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.049
 problem is from servers then what 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.280
 What we can do is simply wait 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.459
 it's a problem we're having 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.370
 many users of ps 4 then you have to 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.069
 wait for the rockstar with your hand 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.140
 also from ps 4 give solution to this 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.569
 error this error is not from your copy 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.849
 digital is not your copy of the game is 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.549
 an error of the rockstar servers and 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.000
 dts 4 well good friends this was all 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.000
 goodbye 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.670
 yes
