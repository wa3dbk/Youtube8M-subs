00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 with the spray oil 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.910
 to a container that is hot I'm going to 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 start putting the chick here I already have 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.650
 my little bit I go for my tweezers that I have 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.650
 back here 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.520
 the chick remember that the chicken can 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.890
 or can not have salmonella but I 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.160
 I prefer not to grab it, not taking 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.930
 hands today I'm going to start putting 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.000
 Salt 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.000
 how about putting so much pepper 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 put enough pepper we are going to 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.899
 flavor the day 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 I'm starting to make my tomatoes with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.690
 my jalapeÃ±o chiles very rich and for 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
 Of course I have some and I'll start 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.469
 combine this so that everything is 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.480
 impregnated with salt and pepper recipes 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.440
 easy simple that you and I can 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.570
 prepare at home 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.119
 It is very important that when we have a 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.369
 recipient like this lady let's put 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.020
 the time certain chicken strips because 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.610
 I want them using I want them cooked 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.119
 and that what happens when suddenly 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.190
 we have many ingredients together and not 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.790
 they finish cooking well and begin to 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.440
 cause a little bit of steam and this 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.060
 steam is another type of cooking of the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.060
 I want fries I want them fried 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.670
 we are ready and now we put 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.340
 now 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.080
 I'm going to put in another pan to fry the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.080
 onion the onion I have it a little 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.110
 then as the playbook did not have it 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.320
 the pique a lot that I want to have those 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.990
 small trips 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.229
 of onion I want my onion between 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.229
 works 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 we clean and I of course already have a 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.730
 sauce some tomatoes are small 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.730
 roasted when I'm going to be I like that 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.470
 I want to eat hot and that's when 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.970
 I start to put the ingredients for 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.100
 that when they are kicking they are 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.539
 perfectly well here we can see how 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.670
 already begin to be topics 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.070
 this is the terno tate is very bad 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.150
 Mexican is very much of us and it seems to me 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.660
 which is the term we should use 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.610
 we can also put up in 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.080
 a comal is very valid but to me 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.940
 like to say how is subject is the one that 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.770
 we really use when we were here 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.300
 I send the peppers when we are going to take out 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.190
 those flavors that everyone has in 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.709
 these ingredients my chick was 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.590
 thinking about cooking I can see it look 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.599
 nothing more than fast 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.480
 has salt and pepper for a taste 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.739
 my onion is going to be ready how 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.739
 little duck stirred and once 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.120

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.290

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 opportunity I also have to go washing 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.640

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.680

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.840
 chicken is finishing cooking because 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.840

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.080

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:10.160
 doradito doradito I do not want it cooked 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.640
