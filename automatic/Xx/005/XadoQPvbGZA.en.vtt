00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 most open television chain that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.269
 I never know someone who has not 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.179
 fallen suddenly because he's in the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.370
 mirror and you start to see something and those 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.440
 you want to press that you do not get 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.020
 I hope you have already had breakfast 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.270
 but the black dots the little bars 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 buried all these things are very 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.260
 common and we never can not think of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.359
 the damage we cause to the skin when 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.529
 we all press to indicate what 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.820
 what happens on the skin when this happens 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.160
 is with us mari carmen de la 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.879
 professional dermatologist and they tower 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.649
 marÃ­a good morning is today is that of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.570
 suddenly it's delicious I know it's that I 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.629
 they pass everything is very well but I in 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.239
 account for the performance of the increase 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.950
 there yes because you see everything then I thought 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.190
 open tightens but it's a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.190
 seduction you do not see yourself and you say I squeeze you 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.970
 fat because not because 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.860
 it is convenient to squeeze in any 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.510
 black point or pimples and 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.460
 little bars because to start all 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.350
 we have bacteria on the skin and also 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.390
 inside the sebaceous gland that is the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.710
 that produces the cebit or the fat that does not 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.720
 only the skin there are also others 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.340
 types of bacteria that without taking in 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.650
 mind that always in our hands we have 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.680
 more bugs that we are going to take us to the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.600
 face then when squeezing while doing it with 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.060
 force or even with fingers or yesterday 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.700
 with some cotton he cited the piece of paper or something 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.650
 that injures both the skin even 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.250
 break it or parts of the hair follicle 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.590
 that's going to generate more inflammation 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.119
 at the surface level as at the level of 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.479
 dermis that is the second layer of the skin 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.670
 and that generates that the injury 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.440
 much more in taking off than you can 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.060
 get a scar much more 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.100
 deep what that would have left 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.930
 simple injury and we also have a 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.630
 high risk of infections we are not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.040
 she says that she is a doctor, that is, how 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.170
 we can apply it because for example to 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.030
 all has happened to us and suddenly today 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.450
 is the typical cry of your grandmother or 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.190
 your aunt of your mom 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.780
 you know , and you say as if maybe I 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.880
 I leave the scar but it looks less ugly 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 that the white grain x nothing good 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 really the ideal is to go with the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.250
 specialists in the skin that we are the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.290
 dermatologists because what we do is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.030
 leave topical treatments that helps 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.910
 to remove all that keratin that goes 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.410
 accumulating and removing that plug that goes 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.510
 covering the forum that is the exit 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.820
 then those creams are helping 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.820
 make the skin as softer as it 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.160
 destroy and to us with materials 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.050
 that are sterile with gloves with the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.060
 adequate asepsis 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.890
 we managed to extract those open dining rooms 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.330
 which is what we know as the points 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.570
 blacks and who also put the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.620
 granites we know that I know what is 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:50.360
 pretty and see what we're seeing 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.120
 the good granites are covered 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.830
 to the bulls and there it is formed but they are 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840
 different from black dots the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.000
 black spots because they are born good 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.220
 actually the whole mechanism is the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.290
 same or what happens is that the pore 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.510
 which is the mouth of the gland 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.520
 sebaceous is obstructed by a plug of 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.500
 Keratin is the first step that 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.600
 it is obviously given by inheritance or 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.710
 in other hormonal factors and a 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.230
 bacteria that we all have in the 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.510
 sebaceous gland by simply covering is then 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.520
 is accumulating all that bait all the 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.160
 Keratin dead cells and bacteria 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.470
 back and it's going to be a big stopper 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.560
 causes the follicle to expand further and the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.840
 black dot looks like it fills up with fat 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.520
 accumulated is part is fat but it is a 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.350
 grease that oxidizes in contact 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.510
 with air and also with melanin 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.400
 which is the pigment of the skin and cells 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.190
 dead is what gives the color black 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.870
 as that goes forward or is and arrive 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.940
 more bacteria more cells that help us 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.980
 against inflammation and infections 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.290
 that is generating what we study 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.450
 postulates and that looks like pimple 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.480
 a thing doctor or is there a great 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.220
 amount of beauty institutions of 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.920
 beauty culture where they call you 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.730
 do 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.010
 for example some cleaning in the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.310
 bone skin and this kind of thing come out 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.110
 there will be some possibility 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.030
 domestic to do an exact cleaning 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.500
 here it will be somewhat more relaxed because 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.300
 truth is that what I most wanted but 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.920
 one does not have two thousand pesos every fortnight 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.049
 you can make michael sheen clear good 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.060
 The important thing is to teach the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.650
 people how to take care of the skin then if 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.570
 It is advised in those who have a skin 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.370
 more oily or suffering from acne or that 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.139
 they have black dots because they have a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.210
 face wash morning and night 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.740
 It is usually with soaps that help 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.840
 decrease that fat production but 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.580
 that are not so aggressive that's going to 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.380
 help not to accumulate so many cells 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.570
 dead and that the dots are not formed 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.979
 blacks squeezing them if it's not 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.540
 convenient to do it is not a good idea 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.940
 something that you are recommended to put 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.010
 example the face in steam that stops 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.389
 excite the pores times is already all 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.490
 leave more easily 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.710
 if it's good or if it makes the forum 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.410
 dilate before and can leave with greater 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.840
 ease but what follows is what does not 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.249
 it's so good or because with what I know with 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.769
 what antiseptic they are going to clean the face 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:01.629
 we have like sterile gloves or 

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:03.159
 even the clamp with which we extract in 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.649
 the office is a clamp that the 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.959
 We put the autoclave before 

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:09.669
 it has to work right on the site in 

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.289
 where is the hole because first 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.539
 we work with a needle that is also 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.219
 sterile and then we press not just what 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.049
 we do on injuries that are infected 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:19.449
 or that are inflamed then that to 

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:21.459
 Sometimes it is difficult for a person to know 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.529
 there is this wrong or I could squeeze not this 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:25.239
 not the truth is that it is not advisable 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.629
 do it so they have an adequate 

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:31.389
 cleaning so go before then with 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.459
 a skin professional that is the 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.079
 dermatologist and we already explain them 

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:37.209
 how to take care of it but do not lie 

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.069
 until not done to prevent 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.649
 pimples black pimples and those things 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.709
 what to do to favor that not 

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:47.110
 come out if good as I said the most 

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.999
 important is to have good hygiene in 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.759
 the skin that is to wash the morning and night 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:53.739
 water on board and soap with soap and water 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.329
 with soap and water and hand is super 

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:57.399
 important not to carve the skin with nothing 

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:59.139
 so we usually carve with a 

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:01.269
 Take off or sponge for the soft 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.440
 that to look like or even in a 

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:04.990
 brush to expose 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.580
 that is damaging the skin puts it still 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.860
 drier 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.080
 It is common for patients with acne to 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.670
 more seborreic good more greasy than it is 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.440
 the skin are very sensitive 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.090
 so if you carvings make 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.830
 other bacteria that can 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.600
 generate also then comes the myth of 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.820
 the creams as they are coming out 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.950
 granites and I have the skin in development 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.410
 teenager or me who am a teenager 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.720
 late I bring great scala 810 or this 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.670
 very late to what I'm going is that the 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.620
 creams are suddenly so they tell you 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.320
 it's not that if you washed your face and you 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.260
 you put a lotion this I do not know how to 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.910
 called putting creams worked no yes 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.710
 good for example depends on what kind of 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.230
 skin be for a oily skin if 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.300
 moisturizing lotion should a whole 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.520
 cream that is very emollient also by 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.950
 single occlusion will generate lesions 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.440
 acne then always leave a lotion 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.020
 that hydrate 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.110
 it's very interesting now they have the 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.480
 page and the clinic dotcom and can 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.230
 have more details on the subject 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.230
