vibrant<00:02:16.340> color<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:17.300> what<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.720> about<00:02:17.900> these

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
vibrant color so what I like about these

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.230 
vibrant color so what I like about these
is<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.410> they're<00:02:18.800> buildable<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.850> color<00:02:20.060> is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
is that they're buildable the color is

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.330 
is that they're buildable the color is
buildable<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.960> actually<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.250> a

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
buildable I actually like that it's a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.370 
buildable I actually like that it's a
kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.700> sheer<00:02:23.000> because<00:02:23.540> sometimes<00:02:24.050> when<00:02:24.260> I'm

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
kind of sheer because sometimes when I'm

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.260 
kind of sheer because sometimes when I'm
putting<00:02:24.740> like<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> brighter<00:02:25.400> color<00:02:25.730> on<00:02:26.060> like

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
putting like a brighter color on like

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.710 
putting like a brighter color on like
this<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:27.620> easier<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.400> kind<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.940> mess<00:02:29.180> up<00:02:29.210> if

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
this it's easier to kind of mess up if

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.750 
this it's easier to kind of mess up if
you<00:02:30.410> don't<00:02:30.650> if<00:02:30.980> you're<00:02:31.220> not<00:02:31.400> like<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.730> the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you don't if you're not like in the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.540 
you don't if you're not like in the
mirror<00:02:32.090> actually<00:02:32.720> applying<00:02:33.020> also<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.010> really

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
mirror actually applying also I really

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.050 
mirror actually applying also I really
like<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.090> balm<00:02:35.360> quality<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.770> very

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
like the balm quality of this it's very

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.710 
like the balm quality of this it's very
smooth<00:02:38.060> kind<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.870> silky<00:02:39.320> feeling<00:02:40.090> um<00:02:41.090> maybe

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
smooth kind of silky feeling um maybe

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.110 
smooth kind of silky feeling um maybe
even<00:02:42.440> more<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.710> than<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.190> Revlon<00:02:43.610> lip<00:02:43.640> butters

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
even more so than the Revlon lip butters

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.540 
even more so than the Revlon lip butters
however<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.990> do<00:02:45.410> find<00:02:45.770> that<00:02:45.950> these<00:02:46.160> are<00:02:46.190> less

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
however I do find that these are less

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.250 
however I do find that these are less
pigmented<00:02:46.940> than<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.390> Revlon<00:02:47.750> lip<00:02:47.780> butters

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
pigmented than the Revlon lip butters

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.220 
pigmented than the Revlon lip butters
and<00:02:48.500> they<00:02:48.710> don't<00:02:49.100> really<00:02:49.730> last<00:02:50.120> super<00:02:50.660> long<00:02:50.900> I

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
and they don't really last super long I

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.370 
and they don't really last super long I
do<00:02:51.620> have<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.040> reapply<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.550> after<00:02:53.270> like<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.750> say

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
do have to reapply this after like I say

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.260 
do have to reapply this after like I say
maybe<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:55.610> two<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.510> three<00:02:56.720> hours<00:02:57.050> they<00:02:57.290> last

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
maybe to two to three hours they last

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.460 
maybe to two to three hours they last
but<00:02:59.270> that's<00:02:59.420> fine<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.900> me<00:03:00.020> because<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.350> really

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
but that's fine to me because I really

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.620 
but that's fine to me because I really
do<00:03:00.980> like<00:03:01.190> reapplying<00:03:01.880> lipsticks<00:03:02.450> especially

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
do like reapplying lipsticks especially

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.570 
do like reapplying lipsticks especially
when<00:03:03.110> they<00:03:03.230> have<00:03:03.350> like<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> balm<00:03:03.800> quality<00:03:04.400> like

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
when they have like a balm quality like

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.660 
when they have like a balm quality like
this<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.720> if<00:03:06.020> that's<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.440> concern<00:03:06.710> a<00:03:07.040> concern<00:03:07.100> to

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
this so if that's a concern a concern to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.800 
this so if that's a concern a concern to
you<00:03:07.760> when<00:03:07.880> you're<00:03:08.000> out<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.180> something<00:03:08.630> that's

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
you when you're out of something that's

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.510 
you when you're out of something that's
really<00:03:08.930> long-lasting<00:03:09.410> then<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.130> probably

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
really long-lasting then I probably

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.850 
really long-lasting then I probably
wouldn't<00:03:11.030> recommend<00:03:11.270> this<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.840> but<00:03:12.709> if

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
wouldn't recommend this to you but if

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.350 
wouldn't recommend this to you but if
you're<00:03:13.010> looking<00:03:13.040> for<00:03:13.459> something<00:03:13.790> with<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:14.120> fun

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
you're looking for something with a fun

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.350 
you're looking for something with a fun
color<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.080> having<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.040> balm<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.640> lip<00:03:17.150> balm

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
color and having a balm like lip balm

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.000 
color and having a balm like lip balm
property<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.410> then<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.680> would<00:03:18.920> definitely

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
property to it then I would definitely

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.250 
property to it then I would definitely
go<00:03:19.400> with<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.970> would<00:03:20.780> say<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.110> they're

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
go with this I would say that they're

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.120 
go with this I would say that they're
moisturizing<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:23.680> like<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.709> said<00:03:24.950> since

review on the Revlon lip stain lip balms

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.090 
review on the Revlon lip stain lip balms
that<00:06:31.330> just<00:06:31.540> recently<00:06:31.870> came<00:06:32.080> out<00:06:32.260> as<00:06:32.440> well<00:06:32.740> and

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
that just recently came out as well and

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.490 
that just recently came out as well and
I<00:06:33.250> really<00:06:33.520> like<00:06:33.820> those<00:06:34.030> still<00:06:34.420> but<00:06:34.960> I<00:06:35.200> have

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
I really like those still but I have

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.830 
I really like those still but I have
noticed<00:06:36.010> that<00:06:36.100> as<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.730> reapply<00:06:37.270> those<00:06:37.540> during

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
noticed that as I reapply those during

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.950 
noticed that as I reapply those during
the<00:06:37.960> day<00:06:38.140> they<00:06:38.380> can<00:06:38.410> be<00:06:38.800> a<00:06:38.830> bit<00:06:39.040> drying

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
the day they can be a bit drying

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.150 
the day they can be a bit drying
initially<00:06:40.960> they're<00:06:41.140> very<00:06:41.350> minty<00:06:41.620> and<00:06:41.800> cool

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
initially they're very minty and cool

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.520 
initially they're very minty and cool
feeling<00:06:42.670> and<00:06:42.880> they<00:06:42.970> feel<00:06:43.270> really<00:06:43.510> great<00:06:43.870> but

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
feeling and they feel really great but

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.260 
feeling and they feel really great but
as<00:06:44.710> the<00:06:44.890> day<00:06:45.040> progresses<00:06:45.520> there<00:06:45.820> a<00:06:45.850> little<00:06:46.060> bit

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
as the day progresses there a little bit

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.610 
as the day progresses there a little bit
drying<00:06:46.540> I<00:06:46.810> still<00:06:47.080> wear<00:06:47.260> them<00:06:47.440> though<00:06:47.590> because

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
drying I still wear them though because

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.140 
drying I still wear them though because
I<00:06:47.980> think<00:06:48.130> they're<00:06:48.430> awesome<00:06:48.610> and<00:06:49.060> I<00:06:49.120> just

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
I think they're awesome and I just

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.530 
I think they're awesome and I just
really<00:06:49.810> like<00:06:49.990> the<00:06:50.920> quality<00:06:51.280> of<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.640> color<00:06:51.880> the

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
really like the quality of the color the

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.590 
really like the quality of the color the
staying<00:06:52.900> power<00:06:53.640> how<00:06:54.640> it<00:06:54.790> feels<00:06:55.000> initially

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
staying power how it feels initially

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.120 
staying power how it feels initially
when<00:06:55.750> I<00:06:55.780> put<00:06:55.990> it<00:06:56.080> on<00:06:56.140> my<00:06:56.260> lips<00:06:56.440> and<00:06:56.650> like<00:06:56.920> I<00:06:57.070> said

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130 
when I put it on my lips and like I said

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.370
