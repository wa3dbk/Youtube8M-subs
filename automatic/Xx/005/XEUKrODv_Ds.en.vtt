years<00:00:03.330> ago<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.899> BMW<00:00:04.529> group<00:00:04.799> started

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
years ago the BMW group started

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.190 
years ago the BMW group started
developing<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.940> idea<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.720> megacity

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
developing the idea of a megacity

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.320 
developing the idea of a megacity
vehicle<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.429> next<00:00:08.700> three<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.150> half

vehicle in the next three and a half

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.759 
vehicle in the next three and a half
minutes<00:00:09.750> we'll<00:00:10.050> take<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> look<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
minutes we'll take a look at the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.180 
minutes we'll take a look at the
development<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.519> BMW<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.389> at<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.740> beginning

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
development of BMW I at the beginning

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.670 
development of BMW I at the beginning
BMW<00:00:14.790> collected<00:00:15.269> information<00:00:16.049> from<00:00:16.260> urban

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
BMW collected information from urban

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.070 
BMW collected information from urban
planners<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.369> around<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.000> globe<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.510> asked

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
planners all around the globe and asked

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.290 
planners all around the globe and asked
thousands<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.890> customers<00:00:22.640> we<00:00:23.640> then<00:00:23.850> took<00:00:24.090> all

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
thousands of customers we then took all

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.240 
thousands of customers we then took all
these<00:00:24.570> impressions<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.410> sat<00:00:25.590> down<00:00:25.619> together

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
these impressions and sat down together

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.490 
these impressions and sat down together
in<00:00:26.550> our<00:00:26.699> small<00:00:27.029> team<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.570> our<00:00:27.750> designers<00:00:28.320> in

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
in our small team with our designers in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980 
in our small team with our designers in
particular<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.820> said<00:00:30.060> how<00:00:30.630> could<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
particular and we said how could you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.229 
particular and we said how could you
scale<00:00:31.380> all<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.830> down<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> few<00:00:32.610> points<00:00:33.120> so

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
scale all this down to a few points so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
scale all this down to a few points so
that<00:00:33.270> everybody<00:00:33.870> understands<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that everybody understands what a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.850 
that everybody understands what a
megacity<00:00:35.399> vehicle<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.180> then<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.870> mega<00:00:37.410> city

council after researching the designers
began<00:00:41.610> their<00:00:42.000> work<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.450> project<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.170> BMW<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
began their work a project like BMW I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.100 
began their work a project like BMW I
provides<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> lot<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> possibilities<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.840> also

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
provides a lot of possibilities but also

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.160 
provides a lot of possibilities but also
challenges<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.910> course<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.570> define

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
challenges one was of course to define

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.650 
challenges one was of course to define
the<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> feel<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.129> BMW<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.820> because<00:00:51.449> as

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
the look and feel of BMW I because as

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.779

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
being a sovereign on one side you will

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.229 
being a sovereign on one side you will
recognize<00:00:54.329> BMW<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:56.010> also

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
recognize BMW but you will also

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
recognize BMW but you will also
recognize<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.690> let's<00:00:58.140> say<00:00:58.260> specific<00:00:58.800> icons

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
recognize some let's say specific icons

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
department is the sound design here the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.780 
department is the sound design here the
car<00:01:06.990> gets<00:01:07.260> its<00:01:07.470> unique<00:01:07.860> interior<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
car gets its unique interior and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.740 
car gets its unique interior and
exterior<00:01:09.240> sound<00:01:14.330> particularly<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
exterior sound particularly the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.749 
exterior sound particularly the
development<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> outside<00:01:17.100> sound<00:01:17.460> was

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
development of the outside sound was

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.660 
development of the outside sound was
very<00:01:18.030> special<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> designers<00:01:19.670> because

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
very special for the designers because

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.899 
very special for the designers because
that<00:01:21.390> allows<00:01:21.750> us<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.500> shape<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.220> soundscape

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that allows us to shape the soundscape

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.690 
that allows us to shape the soundscape
of<00:01:24.150> traffic<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.080> future<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
of traffic in the future so this is a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060 
of traffic in the future so this is a
totally<00:01:27.270> different<00:01:27.299> area<00:01:27.990> where<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.950> can

totally different area where we can

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.219 
totally different area where we can
actually<00:01:29.490> decide<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.630> want<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually decide what do we want the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.250 
actually decide what do we want the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
streets to sound like

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.680 
streets to sound like
