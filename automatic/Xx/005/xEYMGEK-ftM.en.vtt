00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:16.430 
as you can see I'm pushing the button a
lot<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.629> it<00:03:03.750> only<00:03:03.870> takes<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.439> few<00:03:04.469> pictures

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
you have to bear in mind that this is

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.479 
you have to bear in mind that this is
still<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.599> fun<00:03:23.900> camera<00:03:24.409> so<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.739> actually<00:03:25.099> is

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:34.249 
pretty good next we're taking a look at

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:39.190 
pretty good next we're taking a look at
the<00:03:34.400> performance<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:38.209> runs<00:03:38.480> stock<00:03:38.780> Android

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.500 
the performance it runs stock Android
perfectly<00:03:39.859> fine<00:03:40.099> although<00:03:40.459> sometimes<00:03:41.000> it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
perfectly fine although sometimes it

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.880 
perfectly fine although sometimes it
skips<00:03:41.750> afraid

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
skips afraid

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.620

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
as you can see the processor handles a

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:56.909 
as you can see the processor handles a
game<00:04:39.870> perfectly<00:04:40.440> low

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.580

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.950 
red and green not a big problem for me
and<00:05:43.060> then<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.180> all<00:05:44.300> comes<00:05:44.479> down<00:05:44.659> to<00:05:44.810> this

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
and then it all comes down to this

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.170 
and then it all comes down to this
question<00:05:45.319> should<00:05:46.159> you<00:05:46.190> buy<00:05:46.460> this<00:05:46.520> phone<00:05:46.909> I

for a phone at this price point but it

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.740 
for a phone at this price point but it
depends<00:05:51.919> on<00:05:52.159> your<00:05:52.280> personal<00:05:52.759> preference<00:05:53.030> if
