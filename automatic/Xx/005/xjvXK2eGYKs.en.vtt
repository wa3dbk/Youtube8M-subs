of<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.160> sea<00:03:04.370> normally<00:03:04.970> goes<00:03:05.150> into<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.900> tank

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
of the sea normally goes into the tank

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.560 
of the sea normally goes into the tank
slightly<00:03:06.740> because<00:03:06.920> it's<00:03:07.040> got<00:03:07.190> cutaway<00:03:07.760> lock

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
slightly because it's got cutaway lock

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.630 
slightly because it's got cutaway lock
that<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.080> tank<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:12.620> bike<00:03:13.220> then<00:03:13.490> it's

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
that in the tank so this bike then it's

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.460 
that in the tank so this bike then it's
going<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:13.880> have<00:03:14.000> like<00:03:14.180> fat-bob<00:03:14.870> tanks<00:03:14.900> but

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
going to have like fat-bob tanks but

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.930 
going to have like fat-bob tanks but
only<00:03:15.560> small<00:03:15.950> three<00:03:16.760> gallon<00:03:17.210> and<00:03:18.700> we<00:03:19.700> make<00:03:19.910> one

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
only small three gallon and we make one

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.180 
only small three gallon and we make one
our<00:03:20.360> feet<00:03:20.690> sides<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:21.440> there's<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.650> gap<00:03:21.770> down<00:03:22.040> in

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
our feet sides so there's a gap down in

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.850 
our feet sides so there's a gap down in
the<00:03:22.250> middle<00:03:22.490> so<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.180> can<00:03:23.450> weld<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:24.140> thesis

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
the middle so that can weld a thesis

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.120 
the middle so that can weld a thesis
feeling<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:26.840> keeping<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.800> shape

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
feeling in keeping that you shape

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.640 
feeling in keeping that you shape
therefore<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.760> seat<00:03:29.060> just<00:03:29.210> to<00:03:29.420> go<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.660> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
therefore the seat just to go in the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.370 
therefore the seat just to go in the
middle<00:03:30.800> of<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.070> tank<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:32.450> also<00:03:32.720> I'll<00:03:33.110> be<00:03:33.140> able

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
middle of the tank and also I'll be able

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.610 
middle of the tank and also I'll be able
to<00:03:33.500> leave<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> gap<00:03:34.010> our<00:03:34.670> way<00:03:35.090> up<00:03:35.270> because<00:03:36.230> what<00:03:36.590> I

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
to leave a gap our way up because what I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.660 
to leave a gap our way up because what I
want<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.920> do<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.340> want<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.210> make<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.990> ignition

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
want to do I want to make the ignition

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.270 
want to do I want to make the ignition
and<00:03:40.670> also<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.120> little<00:03:41.420> voltmeter<00:03:42.020> in<00:03:42.860> like<00:03:43.070> an

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
and also a little voltmeter in like an

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.480 
and also a little voltmeter in like an
oval<00:03:43.820> shape<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.570> -<00:03:44.900> now<00:03:45.830> that's<00:03:45.980> what<00:03:46.220> some<00:03:46.460> of

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
oval shape and - now that's what some of

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.460 
oval shape and - now that's what some of
the<00:03:46.640> older<00:03:47.030> Joe<00:03:47.240> has<00:03:47.390> had<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.170> want<00:03:48.380> to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the older Joe has had so I want to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.270 
the older Joe has had so I want to
replicate<00:03:48.620> that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
replicate that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.270 
replicate that
so<00:03:49.820> these<00:03:49.910> fat<00:03:50.180> bulbs<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.350> this<00:03:51.590> seat<00:03:51.830> and

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
so these fat bulbs and this seat and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.870 
so these fat bulbs and this seat and
I'll<00:03:52.400> do<00:03:52.550> those<00:03:52.760> together<00:03:54.250> right<00:03:55.250> but<00:03:55.520> for<00:03:55.700> now

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
I'll do those together right but for now

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.110 
I'll do those together right but for now
like<00:03:56.510> I<00:03:56.540> said<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:58.070> strong<00:03:58.400> enough<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.910> try

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
like I said it is strong enough to try

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.260 
like I said it is strong enough to try
it<00:03:59.150> out<00:03:59.450> so<00:04:00.260> I'll<00:04:00.530> put<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.890> camera<00:04:01.100> on<00:04:01.580> a

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
it out so I'll put the camera on a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.290 
it out so I'll put the camera on a
tripod<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:03.320> I'll<00:04:04.220> sign<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.880> best<00:04:05.090> way<00:04:05.270> I

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
tripod and I'll sign it the best way I

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.360 
tripod and I'll sign it the best way I
can<00:04:05.660> we'll<00:04:06.140> try<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.380> out<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:07.540> little<00:04:08.540> bit<00:04:08.750> so

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.130 

obviously<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.430> bit<00:04:13.640> awkward<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:14.120> see<00:04:14.420> smile<00:04:14.690> but

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
obviously a bit awkward to see smile but

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.020 
obviously a bit awkward to see smile but
or<00:04:15.320> you<00:04:15.620> don't<00:04:15.740> just<00:04:16.010> put<00:04:16.250> someone<00:04:16.520> it's<00:04:16.880> on

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
or you don't just put someone it's on

00:04:17.030 --> 00:05:00.480 
or you don't just put someone it's on
the<00:04:17.120> back<00:04:17.299> there<00:04:20.590> higher<00:04:21.590> feels<00:04:22.280> alright

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.689 

there's<00:05:01.490> no<00:05:01.639> box<00:05:02.469> well<00:05:03.469> I<00:05:03.500> saw<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:03.919> shock

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
there's no box well I saw the shock
