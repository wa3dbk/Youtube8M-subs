00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:08.870
 Right now 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.870
 Now 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.200
 Uzan 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.490
 The influence is 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.680
 Huh 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.860
 Well part in the I think that it is familiar by now you have done in the past in this report 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.640
 Chrysler 300 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.690
 Based on 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.970
 I would be saying high-performance version 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.329
 srt 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:39.010
 Get the srtt name to Well of the past 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.760
 There was a Chrysler model 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 Well not so far 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.899
 And say Well either 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.350
 The grade is given to the grade of the festival 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.079
 Well I went subname though 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.050
 Well from this time 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.870
 As one brand 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 When we go independent 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 It is the engine that is the most important thing after all 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.580
 6.4 liters of v8 is pressed down 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 And 500 stitches key near power enough or 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.620
 2 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:21.070
 Nearly 750 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.970
 Efforts are out, but this large displacement engine and the power feel of the critically 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.160
 It's sound in 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.160
 I prefer Akore is American 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.830
 If you think so well Shakon's European premiere brand v8 mother 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:42.030
 The same seasoning is also used 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.030
 I 'll put on it after all, just a minute with a sense of unity to the car 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:54.250
 Then setting of foot circumference is after all 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.250
 You can feel the power specs directly only as it becomes a European car style 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.960
 When deceleration 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:09.039
 Braking ability The rider of the braking performance and it feels well of the body well 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:13.230
 As the unbearable thing of the chassis supports it in a trinity 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:21.270
 Rather than feeling that say something heavy car stops hard 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:25.440
 It's quite as fast as the fun of acceleration 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:29.580
 Well around here , including the sound accuracy of handling 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:36.400
 I think that 's the attraction of srt 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:40.069
 Well already standing on that chassis platform 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.050
 Well ripe that it has been finished 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.740
 Extreme 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.800
 Because it feels like 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:54.610
 Well there is a high performance on the way 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.610
 Maa Kore represents a current American car in Kore 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.310
 I think I 'm finished in the configuration sedan 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.450
 Hmm 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.490
 Well already overwhelmingly before 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.040
 Respiratory ye 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.920
 300 c 4 including srt 8 is a driver's car 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.580
 That's why 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:21.130
 Based on the Chrysler 300 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.130
 It was srd 8 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.650
 me 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.020
 wh
