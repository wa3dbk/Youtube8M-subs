00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
charges that was cashed out yeah we have

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
charges that was cashed out yeah we have
some<00:00:36.210> pressure<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.719> our<00:00:36.930> sales<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.280> are

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
some pressure on our sales and there are

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
some pressure on our sales and there are
two<00:00:38.460> reason<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> currency

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
two reason for it one is the currency

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.200 
two reason for it one is the currency
that<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.590> where<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> headwind<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that is where the headwind of the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
that is where the headwind of the
currency<00:00:42.480> second<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.430> North

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
currency second is that in the North

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.240 
currency second is that in the North
America<00:00:45.300> where<00:00:45.899> two<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.410> large<00:00:46.680> coverage

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
America where two of the large coverage

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.130 
America where two of the large coverage
projects<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.940> actually<00:00:48.329> peaked<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.899> talked

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
projects that actually peaked we talked

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.990 
projects that actually peaked we talked
about<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> second<00:00:49.920> quarter<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.820> see

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
about in a second quarter and we see

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
about in a second quarter and we see
that<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.329> course<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.770> also<00:00:52.949> have

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that of course now and then we also have

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.910 
that of course now and then we also have
one<00:00:53.820> project<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.360> Japan<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.289> also<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
one project in Japan that's also is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
one project in Japan that's also is
coming<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.640> an<00:00:56.850> activity<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.600> of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
coming down an activity and this of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.599 
coming down an activity and this of
course<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:58.170> three<00:00:58.559> large<00:00:58.800> projects<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.579> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
course are three large projects so that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
course are three large projects so that
is<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.120> coming<00:01:00.930> down<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.410> that's<00:01:01.559> why

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
is actually coming down and that's why

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.930 
is actually coming down and that's why
we<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.190> pressure<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.579> our<00:01:02.730> sales

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
we have some pressure on our sales

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
we have some pressure on our sales
figures<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.870> look<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.439> rule<00:01:04.710> on

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
figures I think if you look over rule on

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.950 
figures I think if you look over rule on
the<00:01:05.040> result<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.489> quarter<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> step

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the result this quarter it was to step

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.080 
the result this quarter it was to step
forward<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.470> we've<00:01:07.619> talked<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:08.100> for

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
forward that we've talked about for

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
forward that we've talked about for
quite<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.360> long<00:01:09.479> time<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:10.080> now<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:11.220> are

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
quite a long time right now we are

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.149 
quite a long time right now we are
gradually<00:01:12.060> improving<00:01:12.630> our<00:01:12.840> profitability<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
gradually improving our profitability it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.590 
gradually improving our profitability it
was<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> step<00:01:14.700> change<00:01:14.729> from<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> second

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
was a step change from the second

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.140 
was a step change from the second
quarter<00:01:15.810> where<00:01:16.619> continuous<00:01:17.150> formation

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
quarter where continuous formation

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
quarter where continuous formation
executing<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> big<00:01:19.439> projects<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.460> think

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
executing on the big projects so i think

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.359 
executing on the big projects so i think
it<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.360> step<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.080> direction

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
it was in a step in the right direction

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.820 
it was in a step in the right direction
the<00:01:23.369> pace<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.640> picking<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.479> europe<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.930> 4g

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the pace is picking up in europe and 4g

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.460 
the pace is picking up in europe and 4g

tenders in china are ongoing if you look

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.100 
tenders in china are ongoing if you look
at<00:01:28.650> europe<00:01:29.040> from<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.270> macro<00:01:30.600> level<00:01:30.900> we

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
at europe from a from the macro level we

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.010 
at europe from a from the macro level we
see<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.740> small<00:01:32.520> positive<00:01:32.820> signs<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
see some small positive signs in the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.280 
see some small positive signs in the
oecd<00:01:34.500> countries<00:01:34.759> at<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> same<00:01:36.090> time<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
oecd countries at the same time we as a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.870 
oecd countries at the same time we as a
company<00:01:37.590> we're<00:01:37.979> growing<00:01:38.159> twenty-one<00:01:38.729> percent

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
company we're growing twenty-one percent

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
company we're growing twenty-one percent
in<00:01:39.240> Western<00:01:39.540> Europe<00:01:39.570> right<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.409> course

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
in Western Europe right now so of course

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830 
in Western Europe right now so of course
we<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.360> positive

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
we see a little bit more that positive

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.649 
we see a little bit more that positive
signs<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.350> maybe<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> macroeconomics<00:01:44.820> if

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
signs then maybe the macroeconomics if

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020 
signs then maybe the macroeconomics if
you<00:01:45.869> look<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> Chinese<00:01:46.590> market<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you look at the Chinese market and we

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.730 
you look at the Chinese market and we
