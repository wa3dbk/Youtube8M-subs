house prices go through the roof but if

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069

they make too many loans the debt burden

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.590 
they make too many loans the debt burden
becomes<00:01:40.439> too<00:01:40.860> large<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.490> people<00:01:42.240> can't<00:01:42.479> afford

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
becomes too large so people can't afford

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to pay them back so then the banks stop

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.020 
to pay them back so then the banks stop
lending<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.500> suddenly<00:01:47.430> there's<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.820> enough

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

their jobs and houses are repossessed

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.569 
their jobs and houses are repossessed
this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.079> caused<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.619> financial<00:01:55.799> crisis

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
this is what caused the financial crisis

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.389 
this is what caused the financial crisis
and<00:01:57.079> fundamentally<00:01:58.079> nothing<00:01:58.770> has<00:01:58.950> changed

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and fundamentally nothing has changed

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.660 
and fundamentally nothing has changed
since<00:01:59.549> then<00:02:00.500> money<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.770> still<00:02:02.040> conjured<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.610> by

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
since then money is still conjured up by

since then money is still conjured up by
the<00:02:02.880> banks<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:04.140> still<00:02:04.500> disappears<00:02:05.310> when

debt is repaid until we change this will

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.290 
debt is repaid until we change this will
never<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> stable<00:02:11.849> economy<00:02:12.450> safe
