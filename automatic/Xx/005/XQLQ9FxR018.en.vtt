00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.499
 get more changes plus changes in the in 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.770
 sevilla and perotti will leave but 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:09.770
 you 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.580
 approval of ramón sanchez pizjuán 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.160
 about or for the Argentine player diego 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.210
 perotti who has left a great first 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.279
 part if what he did punished with the 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.250
 versions in this season then 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.690
 now that he starts to pick up the pace he has 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.550
 that take care of the service a lot because it is 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.830
 a player that grows very important to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.809
 perotti perote and perotti after 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.379
 match that he did we already have it here with 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.900
 we 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.080
 diego good night as he finds you 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.640
 man had already seen the images you see 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.590
 the summary and a little bit of that moment was 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.770
 very nice to see him again and what 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.969
 happened louis I think it should happen to us 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:59.480
 everyone at that time I had long 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.000
 I was not lucky enough to leave a match 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.059
 well, I had not cheered for a long time 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.700
 I could enjoy playing without discomfort and 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.990
 injuries and that people recognize it from 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.780
 that way and that greater received from that 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.430
 way is something very nice I think they are from 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.360
 those things when you do not get tired I think that 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.550
 they can pass 20 games and they shout at you 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.190
 man I think it's not over 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.370
 accustom and that you like and is a 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 immense joy the truth that I the other 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.250
 day when I entered against the bilbao that 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.440
 I also had a great knowledge that 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.710
 I did not expect it for everything 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.030
 but it had happened but when 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.830
 in a situation like that when the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.050
 party maybe it was practically 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.950
 finished with the 3 to 0 we had 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.690
 done we had managed to do the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.490
 I work well and beat Espanyol 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.250
 came from a direct rival and leave like this 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.950
 with people shouting the name to one 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.110
 more or less 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.750
 then nodding it is giving a bit of 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.439
 account above all good when it was learned 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.240
 that jose was not going to arrive later when 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.850
 in training he also had this 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.710
 injury and van 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.509
 even though it was not good if I knew 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.030
 to play or not my chances 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.470
 they increased because I had played against 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.540
 the valladolid and inside then it was 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.700
 like I had more chances but 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.810
 peronas so that the mister did not give the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.450
 I chatted the day before at the hotel that gave 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.280
 gave the equipment I did not know for sure 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.709
 but good one more or less entirely to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.630
 the week then it's palpating what you're going 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.910
 feeling but I tell you until he does not 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.130
 gave the team no I do not know because I 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.020
 now what I had most anxiety had 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.319
 wanting to get the party had 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.130
 desire to play came less way the 7 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.110
 they take it from many, they told them that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.090
 people could take advantage to go 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.610
 we come when every day at 9 a 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.590
 10 o'clock on Mondays a Sunday at 7 o'clock 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.220
 that people can enjoy it but 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.520
 nothing was more that anxiety you want that 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.320
 start as I said was a match 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.840
 fundamental for us they came 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.510
 with the same amount of points also 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.400
 with the hopeful ones 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.950
 enter Europe and it was a tough match 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.840
 I think we got good work we could 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.130
 to do more quiet I did not get used to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.530
 really to play both inside 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.690
 always since I started 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.970
 and started playing on the left I tend to 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.420
 open I will play open always I 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.780
 like that way and it was the teaching 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.340
 it was always more play on the outside too 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.540
 the team always used to Jesus 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.689
 It was always a very game 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.700
 of two very open bands and the coach 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.950
 he gave me freedom and asked me to 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.260
 start to put a little more and the day the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
 Valladolid directly in to play 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.920
 more than half a cent more 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.020
 advanced 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.630
 and now that I feel good, it gives me more 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.790
 possibilities not only to play open 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.800
 sometimes you put two men already 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.120
 determines you can not do much but 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.310
 when in the middle I have more 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.310
 possibilities and he gives me freedom that 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.160
 yes it seems to me that that is the goal the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.130
 only goal that we have that we have 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.770
 tax within the locker room from the 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.600
 beginning of season our goal 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.720
 it was always the champions and good and 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.609
 mathematically this one is practically 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.820
 impossible so the only thing that remains 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.020
 It is to win all four remaining games 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.630
 Away win again also 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.070
 is a fundamental objective to be able 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.770
 get to europe 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.680
 but if the uefa has to be we have 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.960
 to play next year if we 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.050
 do outside what we are doing 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.350
 at home and win the matches with with 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.750
 so much clarity with as early as impetus 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.919
 it seems to me that we would have had many 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.800
 better results 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.710
 we lack maybe that intensity outside 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.240
 that aggressiveness that 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.210
 that luckily we still have the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.100
 opportunity to achieve the objectives 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.680
 despite not having made a season 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.750
 very regular and we have to start the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.650
 Sunday with Malaga because if not this 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.650
 we are dropped because
