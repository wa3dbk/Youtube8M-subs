have to do this you have to do that but

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.930 
have to do this you have to do that but
as<00:00:10.800> much<00:00:10.950> as<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.250> been<00:00:11.309> changing<00:00:11.759> all<00:00:11.880> of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
as much as it's been changing all of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.730 
as much as it's been changing all of
those<00:00:12.269> different<00:00:12.450> trends<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:13.530> been

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
those different trends have been

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.620 
those different trends have been
supporting<00:00:14.190> each<00:00:14.280> other<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.179> love<00:00:15.599> about

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
supporting each other what I love about

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.000 
supporting each other what I love about
this<00:00:15.929> console<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.619> think<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
this console is that I think it's the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.140 
this console is that I think it's the
first<00:00:17.250> time<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.430> these<00:00:17.609> trends<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.000> going

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
first time that these trends are going

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.700 
first time that these trends are going
to<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.420> brought<00:00:18.720> together<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.560> is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
to really be brought together this is

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
to really be brought together this is
where<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> promise<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.850> we<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.119> do<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
where the promise of what we can do is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.980 
where the promise of what we can do is
bigger<00:00:21.779> than<00:00:21.990> just<00:00:22.199> one<00:00:22.470> drop

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
this time sony came around to us and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.159 
this time sony came around to us and
they<00:00:31.300> came<00:00:31.450> to<00:00:31.539> our<00:00:31.570> office<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:32.050> they<00:00:32.140> said

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
they came to our office and they said

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.540 
they came to our office and they said
here's<00:00:32.500> what<00:00:32.680> we're<00:00:32.800> thinking<00:00:32.980> what<00:00:33.400> are<00:00:33.430> you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
here's what we're thinking what are you

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.010 
here's what we're thinking what are you
guys<00:00:33.700> thinking<00:00:33.760> what<00:00:34.329> have<00:00:34.570> you<00:00:34.690> been<00:00:34.809> held

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
guys thinking what have you been held

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.260 
guys thinking what have you been held
back<00:00:35.200> by<00:00:35.440> and<00:00:35.710> what<00:00:36.010> would<00:00:36.579> you<00:00:36.610> do<00:00:36.940> if<00:00:37.150> you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
back by and what would you do if you

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.729 
back by and what would you do if you
didn't<00:00:37.510> have<00:00:37.600> any<00:00:37.690> technical<00:00:38.140> limitations

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
didn't have any technical limitations

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.410 
didn't have any technical limitations
that<00:00:39.100> they<00:00:39.250> gave<00:00:39.580> us<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.879> possibility<00:00:40.030> to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
that they gave us the possibility to

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.660 
that they gave us the possibility to
provide<00:00:40.720> feedback<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.860> adapt<00:00:42.190> based<00:00:42.460> on

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
provide feedback and to adapt based on

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.650 
provide feedback and to adapt based on
the<00:00:42.760> feedback<00:00:42.879> they<00:00:43.210> received<00:00:43.540> from

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
the feedback they received from

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.030 
the feedback they received from
developers<00:00:44.140> Vera<00:00:44.350> was<00:00:44.559> for<00:00:44.829> me<00:00:44.950> a<00:00:44.980> very

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
developers Vera was for me a very

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.160 
developers Vera was for me a very
important<00:00:45.580> message<00:00:45.699> all<00:00:46.239> these<00:00:46.629> developers

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
important message all these developers

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.070 
important message all these developers
had<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.500> hand<00:00:47.920> in<00:00:48.190> actually<00:00:49.059> helping<00:00:49.480> form<00:00:49.809> what

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
had a hand in actually helping form what

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.930 
had a hand in actually helping form what
the<00:00:50.260> PlayStation<00:00:50.860> 4<00:00:51.100> would<00:00:51.309> eventually<00:00:51.699> turn

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
the PlayStation 4 would eventually turn

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.390 
the PlayStation 4 would eventually turn
out<00:00:52.150> to<00:00:52.300> be<00:00:52.449> we<00:00:52.960> took<00:00:53.170> all<00:00:53.410> that<00:00:53.769> into

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
out to be we took all that into

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.960 
out to be we took all that into
consideration<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.860> create<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.220> system<00:00:57.640> that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
consideration to create the system that

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.410 
consideration to create the system that
just<00:00:58.660> walks<00:00:59.019> when<00:00:59.890> we<00:01:00.070> think<00:01:00.339> about<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:01.030> word

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
just walks when we think about the word

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.780 
just walks when we think about the word
simple<00:01:01.870> we've<00:01:02.559> chosen<00:01:02.949> to<00:01:03.129> interpret<00:01:03.640> that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
simple we've chosen to interpret that

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.050 
simple we've chosen to interpret that
with<00:01:04.360> a<00:01:04.390> comparable<00:01:05.080> word<00:01:05.370> elegance<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.610> to

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
with a comparable word elegance and to

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.289 
with a comparable word elegance and to
us<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.510> means<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:08.530> balance<00:01:09.220> between<00:01:09.430> how

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299
