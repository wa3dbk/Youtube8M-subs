colors of the vegetables and stuff have
different<00:04:43.410> nutrients<00:04:43.889> in<00:04:44.010> them<00:04:44.160> that<00:04:44.430> you

greens almost all have some healthy fats

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.980 
greens almost all have some healthy fats
and<00:05:05.820> proteins<00:05:06.210> that<00:05:06.300> are<00:05:06.419> we<00:05:06.510> gonna<00:05:06.750> be<00:05:06.870> going

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
and proteins that are we gonna be going

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.120 
and proteins that are we gonna be going
into<00:05:07.260> this<00:05:07.350> we're<00:05:07.500> starting<00:05:07.740> out<00:05:07.830> with<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:08.010> nice

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
into this we're starting out with a nice

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.590 
into this we're starting out with a nice
bed<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.580> greens<00:05:08.820> this<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.180> like<00:05:09.330> your<00:05:09.480> typical

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
bed of greens this is like your typical

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.620 
bed of greens this is like your typical
spring<00:05:10.140> mix<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.560> believe<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:10.950> this<00:05:11.100> is<00:05:11.280> mostly

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
spring mix I believe that this is mostly

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.050 
spring mix I believe that this is mostly
spinach<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.930> some<00:05:13.440> chard<00:05:13.919> some<00:05:14.430> red<00:05:14.580> chard

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
spinach and some chard some red chard

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.480 
spinach and some chard some red chard
and<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.440> I'm<00:05:16.560> adding<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.919> tablespoon<00:05:17.250> of

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
and to that I'm adding a tablespoon of

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.380 
and to that I'm adding a tablespoon of
sunflower<00:05:17.700> seeds

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
sunflower seeds

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.240 
sunflower seeds
so<00:05:18.870> for<00:05:19.050> cucumber<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.680> like<00:05:19.890> the<00:05:20.070> English

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
so for cucumber I like the English

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.980 
so for cucumber I like the English
cucumber<00:05:20.970> so<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.210> can<00:05:21.330> eat<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.630> skin<00:05:21.660> on

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
cucumber so you can eat the skin on

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.150 
cucumber so you can eat the skin on
these<00:05:22.169> ones<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.590> don't<00:05:22.740> have<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.950> peel

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
these ones so you don't have to peel

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.290 
these ones so you don't have to peel
them<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.550> get<00:05:23.639> a<00:05:23.669> little<00:05:23.880> bit<00:05:23.940> more<00:05:24.090> of<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
them so you get a little bit more of the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.840 
them so you get a little bit more of the
nutrients<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:26.280> little<00:05:26.460> bit<00:05:26.550> more<00:05:26.669> of<00:05:26.729> that

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
nutrients and a little bit more of that

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.630 
nutrients and a little bit more of that
bite<00:05:27.229> four<00:05:28.229> tablespoons<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.870> cucumber<00:05:31.640> now

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
bite four tablespoons of cucumber now

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.000 
bite four tablespoons of cucumber now
I'm<00:05:32.790> adding<00:05:33.180> in<00:05:33.300> some<00:05:33.540> red<00:05:33.810> cabbage<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.530> really

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
I'm adding in some red cabbage I really

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.190 
I'm adding in some red cabbage I really
like<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.340> red<00:05:35.490> as<00:05:35.700> opposed<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.630> green<00:05:37.080> I

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
like the red as opposed to the green I

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.690 
like the red as opposed to the green I
just<00:05:37.380> think<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.590> has<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.740> better<00:05:37.830> flavor<00:05:38.220> a

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
just think it has a better flavor a

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.340 
just think it has a better flavor a
little<00:05:39.090> bit<00:05:39.210> sweeter<00:05:39.600> today<00:05:40.050> I'm<00:05:40.110> gonna<00:05:40.229> be

part of the whole salad of course you

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.640 
part of the whole salad of course you
could<00:05:45.720> always<00:05:45.840> just<00:05:46.080> use<00:05:46.229> your<00:05:46.380> kind<00:05:46.590> of

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
could always just use your kind of

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.490 
could always just use your kind of
garden-variety<00:05:47.039> orange<00:05:47.760> carrots<00:05:48.630> but<00:05:48.900> the

different colors of carrots have

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.130 
different colors of carrots have
different<00:05:51.120> nutrients<00:05:51.660> in<00:05:51.780> them<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.050> they're

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
different nutrients in them and they're

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
really beautiful and they add a little

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.029 
really beautiful and they add a little
something<00:05:53.910> special<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.510> the<00:05:54.539> salad<00:05:55.080> I<00:05:55.289> know

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
something special to the salad I know

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.010 
something special to the salad I know
that<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.460> can<00:05:56.760> just<00:05:57.270> wash<00:05:57.479> and<00:05:57.510> eat<00:05:57.900> the

that you can just wash and eat the

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.690 
that you can just wash and eat the
outside<00:05:58.140> of<00:05:58.440> carrots<00:05:58.740> but<00:05:58.860> I<00:05:59.010> don't<00:05:59.250> like<00:05:59.430> it

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
outside of carrots but I don't like it

outside of carrots but I don't like it
for<00:05:59.940> some<00:06:00.000> reason<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:00.450> just<00:06:00.479> feels<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:00.810> little

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
for some reason it just feels a little

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.450 
for some reason it just feels a little
