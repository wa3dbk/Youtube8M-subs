00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.600
 consecutive issues of the week

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.810
 on the evolution of the ispor in 2015 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.090
 then we'll talk a little hip hop 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.450
 horns point i sport with waves 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.250
 ban news in brief with pokemon if 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.539
 you thought 2014 was the year of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.490
 the ispor was waiting to see what you 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.690
 reserve 2015 I think the year 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.280
 last made us out of the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.770
 prehistory videogame and that this 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.329
 year will bring heavy in France on 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.640
 a media way that has freshly redeemed 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.410
 millenium and who is ready to come these 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.540
 millions of euros to create their own 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.370
 advertising agency the malaysia of his 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.860
 side makes the ispor a real sport 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.630
 with south korea as an example in korea 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.670
 by the way its beats by dre who enters 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.770
 in the game by sponsoring cjm tuche 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.940
 the North American Seine is not 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.440
 abandoned and it's htc who 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.020
 would disembark to sponsor 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.000
 teams on the circuit lcs even in japan 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.469
 between two nuclear disasters we 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.149
 launches league of legend with 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.829
 tournaments and especially the first gaming 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.299
 Japanese house for a country that 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.259
 traditionally does not play on pc 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.840
 it's really class 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.459
 and the icing on the cake disney poses 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.659
 the basics and offers us a guide for 

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:14.179
 gamer on more or less everything 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.289
 materialize via a TV series that will be 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.850
 broadcast on disney channel and yeah 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.049
 yeah that's a lot of information 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.279
 at once, but you have to take that from the good 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.869
 side is heavy 

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:26.240
 contrary to what can be read about at 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.459
 malaysia it's not a dragon it's a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.529
 tiger of asia but that we do not care 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.359
 important point is that the state believes 

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:33.469
 in the running port because they use that 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.299
 from an economic point of view for 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.759
 push the Malaysians to the consumer 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.770
 especially in a country where only tamar 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.280
 it shows a little bit how much the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.229
 France is late on the issue 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.390
 unlike disney who are rather 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.979
 in advance of their time well, of course, the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.690
 system is intended for children but 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.740
 will come with its lot of stereotypes about 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.840
 the subject of the video game 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.490
 but he still puts forward an ex 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.440
 pro player who following an injury is going 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.330
 have to go back to school and use 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.550
 his superpowers of pro gamer for 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.830
 overcome the vagaries of life the big 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.909
 htc sponsors and beats by dre it's 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.229
 interesting that goes into sports 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.970
 because it's big fat 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.110
 financial powers and beyond that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.670
 are not people who are addressing 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.850
 geeks in general they would have more 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.930
 tendency to position oneself as fashion 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.720
 damn it's the loose one became to the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.310
 fashion it's actually the market grows up to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.900
 a pretty surreal speed and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.600
 it inevitably creates economic stakes 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.800
 in 2014 it was the battle of the plate 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.390
 form and I think we're all 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.480
 agree that twitchell won 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.370
 deep is it and art a study cabinet 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.810
 in the video game released through 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.330
 of gamers industry a report of 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.250
 twitch hearing we learn that 61% 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.989
 of the content being watched focuses on 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.850
 five games in order league of legends 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.330
 the dota 2 hours stone cs go and world of 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.459
 warcraft 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.480
 four games out of five sports but 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.190
 frankly when we see the stats 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.110
 alexa of the site it's really not the 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.070
 small audience 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.780
 and now that the basics are laid 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.610
 it is for a new challenge that the blood 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.170
 will sink after the platform this is the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.579
 battle for the ad network that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.170
 will tear the world of esport 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.549
 it's a bit long to develop it will be 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.299
 one of my next topics on my 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.299
 gaming blog worried it turns nickel 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.630
 greeted his guitar ya you enjoy that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.989
 the other one went in with calvillo for 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.790
 talk to you about safe rock fishing beds 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.890
 that europe is not the guy eclyps y 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.660
 in republic was a game of 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.320
 real life simulation on browser 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.269
 Internet 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.040
 it allows you to be a citizen who will 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.459
 attack almost same occupation as 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.260
 in real life 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.209
 I had a style of play it's like 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.100
 to redo his life but in a better way 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.600
 is that the ruthless street rck has come 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.100
 that his boys fans to conquer the say 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.440
 I he managed to become 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.329
 President of France and stole the 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.280
 crates of the state of the blow that's not it 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.040
 very very nice what but what is 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.290
 what are you crazy you finished the organic gfk 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.650
 three seconds is a stole my show 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.209
 to talk about street 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.129
 in addition I said I did not want 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.290
 talk about this drama it's not even a 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.510
 drama we understood that ruy he was 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.010
 wicked and in addition these democratic countries 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.280
 of which he was president he does what he 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.379
 wants 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.000
 good you want the subject a bit like 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.540
 because I have a real subject to 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.359
 pop corn 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.980
 the drama of 69 cases as I like 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.950
 call him last week a 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.629
 french sweatshirt yes switcher know 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.120
 which blog that coined the term was 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.769
 saw to offer not less than 69 thousand euros of 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.140
 donations for the most part from a 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.569
 little urban legend of the web at my 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.019
 Qatari donor I did not really have 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.519
 heard about liberto the sweatshirt 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.620
 but his reaction in live made me rather 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.090
 pleasure for him he was years away 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.380
 to imagine that all this was not 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.580
 that a wholesale conspiracy several 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.470
 skeptics began to put back into 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.210
 question the legitimacy of donations and have 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.949
 accused the gamerz liberty streamer 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.780
 to have orchestrated everything to win 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.220
 the iframe it must be said that the stream is 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.720
 still gone from 2 caps viewer to 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.280
 almost 10 cases in less than 30 minutes 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.770
 rather not bad the buzz 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.030
 good other more realistic skeptics 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.710
 are aware that to default which 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.750
 on twitch is far from unfeasible 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.910
 and offers an article a little less 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.470
 hateful to mx is thin creamer concerned 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.360
 by the sphere will announce on tweets that 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.949
 fifty six thousand euros of donations received 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.380
 by that same to mag was actually 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.000
 good pictures it's clear that liberty 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.220
 gamer will not have the 70 thousand and 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.419
 a few euros offered by led but good 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.250
 side of the thing is that they are 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.110
 winner winner because the buzz generated 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.580
 allowed them to have lots of people who 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.020
 had never heard of them 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.889
 that they arrived on the chain that 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.180
 came shady fun for me I 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.370
 think that nice is a creation of 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.349
 twitch for a conspiracy purpose for 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.419
 motivate nouveaus come river 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.099
 stream and at home there is no other 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.169
 solution 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.539
 isport now the challenger wcs or 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.729
 mark the return of the naniwa king who is 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.420
 will be imposed rather pose facing nerchio 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.280
 on the body of three 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.450
 I wanted to say this dog has neither 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.740
 myself from state ria told me he 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.920
 I had to keep a little tone 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:43.140
 more offbeat so this dog naniwa 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.150
 another victory for the player 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.670
 de rose has become a cabu top league 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.410
 face again val masters this 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.330
 European competition organized by 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.010
 live gaming will have offered us a top 3 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.050
 French thanks to the victory of gaga not 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.970
 on ryan side art league of legend the 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.830
 first week of the year ends and 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.080
 number of results with lpl gpm 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.960
 stuff we'll keep until 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.400
 europe tullow star was sacred mvp you 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.170
 to say that he sent damn heavy 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.120
 and gaming has published an article that 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.280
 returns to sting balls in 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.500
 our American friends the real news is 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.030
 find at thunder boots the team role 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.590
 had to do without their top line hours 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.630
 at the millennium we never really know 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.310
 too alex ich during the challenger series 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.870
 our busy street still had some 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.370
 problems and could not be in time and 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.650
 in time for the competition to the states 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.990
 united it's a pity big win 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.090
 French on cs go and ldlc were 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.040
 imposed once again face honey 2 to 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.140
 1 at the mlg x games 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.720
 it's official the French line up is 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.570
 the best of the world 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.850
 therefore it is affecting ldlc cs 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.980
 always go and so vague ban always 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.600
 the excesses bp that soaked in the
