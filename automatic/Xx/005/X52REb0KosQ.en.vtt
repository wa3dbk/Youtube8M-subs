00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
pliers they exert pressure so kids

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.250 
pliers they exert pressure so kids
shouldn't<00:01:08.780> be<00:01:10.510> putting<00:01:11.510> their<00:01:11.630> thumb<00:01:12.050> over

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
the the neck like this they shouldn't be

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.330 
the the neck like this they shouldn't be
laying<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.940> down<00:01:17.470> along<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.680> neck<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:19.130> should

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
laying it down along the neck it should

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.730 
laying it down along the neck it should
be<00:01:19.549> pretty<00:01:20.150> much<00:01:20.420> pointed<00:01:20.960> straight<00:01:21.350> up<00:01:21.470> in

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
be pretty much pointed straight up in

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.040 
be pretty much pointed straight up in
the<00:01:21.770> air<00:01:23.050> now<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.440> can<00:01:24.650> move<00:01:24.860> around<00:01:25.040> but

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
the air now it can move around but

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.990 
the air now it can move around but
that's<00:01:27.050> where<00:01:27.830> I'd<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.160> them<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.400> think<00:01:28.550> of

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
that's where I'd like them to think of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.760 
that's where I'd like them to think of
starting<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:32.210> right<00:01:32.720> hand<00:01:32.960> fingers<00:01:33.200> have

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
starting the right hand fingers have

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.030 
starting the right hand fingers have
letters<00:01:34.700> but<00:01:35.180> that's<00:01:35.810> for<00:01:36.140> classical<00:01:36.680> guitar

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
letters but that's for classical guitar

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.930 
letters but that's for classical guitar
I'll<00:01:37.370> get<00:01:37.670> into<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.000> as<00:01:38.480> the<00:01:38.930> lessons<00:01:39.350> go<00:01:39.530> on

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
I'll get into that as the lessons go on

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.510 
I'll get into that as the lessons go on
so<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.120> next<00:01:41.270> thing<00:01:41.390> anyway<00:01:41.870> we<00:01:42.520> introduced

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
so the next thing anyway we introduced

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.490 
so the next thing anyway we introduced
was<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.940> frets<00:01:44.350> going<00:01:45.350> across<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:46.010> neck<00:01:46.250> and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
was the frets going across the neck and

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.000 
was the frets going across the neck and
they're<00:01:48.500> numbered<00:01:49.070> on<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.990> guitar<00:01:51.590> like<00:01:51.980> this
