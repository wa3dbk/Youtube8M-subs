00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
now there was some confusion about what

now there was some confusion about what
that<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.420> means<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.469> means<00:00:46.680> inside

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
operation Metro 2014 some people thought

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.979 
operation Metro 2014 some people thought
you<00:00:50.280> need<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.789> downstairs<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> Metro

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you need to be downstairs in the Metro

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479 
you need to be downstairs in the Metro
itself<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> case<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.370> could

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
itself that is not the case you could

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
itself that is not the case you could
just<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.730> upstairs<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.360> well<00:00:54.390> ten<00:00:55.289> kills<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
just be upstairs as well ten kills and I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
just be upstairs as well ten kills and I
found<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.000> kill<00:00:57.239> assist

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
found that actually the kill assist

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
found that actually the kill assist
ribbons<00:00:57.840> were<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.170> hardest<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> get<00:00:58.920> because

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
ribbons were the hardest to get because

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
ribbons were the hardest to get because
you<00:00:59.850> tend<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.359> shoot<00:01:00.570> people<00:01:00.930> not<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.289> for

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you tend to just shoot people not go for

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
you tend to just shoot people not go for
it<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.129> recommendation<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it so my recommendation for this is to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.660 
it so my recommendation for this is to
go<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.840> 64<00:01:04.470> men's<00:01:04.650> servers<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
go on 64 men's servers and use the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
go on 64 men's servers and use the
incendiary<00:01:06.030> grenade<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> lot<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.560> often<00:01:07.799> keeps

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
incendiary grenade a lot it often keeps

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
incendiary grenade a lot it often keeps
people<00:01:08.400> alive<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:09.090> necessarily<00:01:09.659> kill<00:01:09.869> them

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
people alive not necessarily kill them

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
people alive not necessarily kill them
which<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.380> perfect<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.130> assists<00:01:11.549> now

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
which is perfect to get assists now

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.730 
which is perfect to get assists now
let's<00:01:12.330> talk<00:01:12.450> about<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.840> stats<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.560> weapon

which<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.549> only<00:01:50.820> used<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.899> gun<00:01:52.110> that's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
which is only used for that gun that's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.219 
which is only used for that gun that's
one<00:01:53.009> point<00:01:53.310> six<00:01:53.549> times<00:01:53.909> zoom<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.049> actually

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
one point six times zoom and it actually

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
one point six times zoom and it actually
seemed<00:01:55.710> very<00:01:55.920> effective<00:01:56.579> though<00:01:56.939> I'd<00:01:57.030> would

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
seemed very effective though I'd would

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.590 
seemed very effective though I'd would
not<00:01:57.570> recommend<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> over<00:01:58.740> iron<00:01:58.979> sights<00:01:59.369> or

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
not recommend it over iron sights or

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
not recommend it over iron sights or
reflex<00:02:00.600> sight<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:01.020> let's<00:02:01.229> say<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> coyote<00:02:01.799> side

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
reflex sight or let's say a coyote side

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.789 
reflex sight or let's say a coyote side
but<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.450> cool<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> mix<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
but it is cool to mix it up and see the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.469 
but it is cool to mix it up and see the
original<00:02:05.009> sites<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.850> belong<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.360> this

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
original sites that belong with this

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.210 
original sites that belong with this
weapon<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.990> an<00:02:07.350> accessory<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:07.950> go<00:02:08.069> with

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
weapon as an accessory I would go with

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.830 
weapon as an accessory I would go with
the<00:02:08.310> laser<00:02:08.489> sight<00:02:08.789> especially<00:02:09.149> because<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the laser sight especially because this

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.199 
the laser sight especially because this
weapon<00:02:10.200> has<00:02:10.229> very<00:02:10.649> high<00:02:10.709> fire<00:02:11.250> rate<00:02:11.520> i<00:02:11.790> found

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
weapon has very high fire rate i found

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
weapon has very high fire rate i found
out<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.360> hipfire<00:02:12.870> actually<00:02:13.290> helped<00:02:13.500> me<00:02:13.590> out

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
out that hipfire actually helped me out

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740 
out that hipfire actually helped me out
a<00:02:13.770> lot<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.280> small<00:02:14.580> corridors<00:02:15.090> using<00:02:15.510> laser

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a lot in small corridors using laser

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.750 
a lot in small corridors using laser
sight<00:02:16.110> will<00:02:16.410> definitely<00:02:16.980> benefit<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.640> in

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
sight will definitely benefit you in

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.550 
sight will definitely benefit you in
those<00:02:17.880> situations<00:02:18.540> now<00:02:18.960> as<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> barrel

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
those situations now as a barrel

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.380 
those situations now as a barrel
attachment<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:20.280> would<00:02:20.490> go<00:02:20.670> with<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.000> muzzle

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
attachment I would go with the muzzle

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.300 
attachment I would go with the muzzle
brake<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:21.960> also<00:02:22.290> using<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> compensator

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
brake I was also using the compensator

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.550 
brake I was also using the compensator
to<00:02:23.400> see<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.210> could<00:02:24.270> negate<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.140> site<00:02:25.410> to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
to see if I could negate this site to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.530 
to see if I could negate this site to
site<00:02:25.740> we<00:02:26.010> call<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.760> found<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.150> using<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
site we call but I found that using the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.450 
site we call but I found that using the
muzzle<00:02:27.840> brake<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:28.230> vertical<00:02:28.740> recoil<00:02:28.920> seemed

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
muzzle brake for vertical recoil seemed

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.220 
muzzle brake for vertical recoil seemed
to<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.730> more<00:02:29.910> effective<00:02:30.420> especially<00:02:30.780> because

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
to be more effective especially because

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.660 
to be more effective especially because
of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> high<00:02:31.530> fire<00:02:31.800> rate<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.130> this<00:02:32.220> weapon<00:02:32.430> you

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
of the high fire rate on this weapon you

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.370 
of the high fire rate on this weapon you
really<00:02:32.970> need<00:02:33.120> something<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.570> counter<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.110> as

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
really need something to counter that as

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.140 
really need something to counter that as
another<00:02:34.920> barrel<00:02:35.250> attachment<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.790> would<00:02:35.970> go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
another barrel attachment I would go

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.360 
another barrel attachment I would go
with<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> angled<00:02:36.870> grip<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.620> significantly

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
with the angled grip this significantly

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.220 
with the angled grip this significantly
reduces<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:39.060> first<00:02:39.300> shot<00:02:39.510> recoil<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
reduces the first shot recoil of the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.350 
reduces the first shot recoil of the
f2000<00:02:41.130> especially<00:02:41.880> combined<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:42.210> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
f2000 especially combined with the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.640 
f2000 especially combined with the
muzzle<00:02:42.600> brake<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> found<00:02:43.080> out<00:02:43.170> that's<00:02:43.260> really

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
muzzle brake I found out that's really

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.200 
muzzle brake I found out that's really
easy<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.130> shoot<00:02:44.280> an<00:02:44.400> accurate<00:02:44.850> stream<00:02:45.030> of

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
easy to shoot an accurate stream of

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.420 
easy to shoot an accurate stream of
bullets<00:02:45.330> down<00:02:45.780> even<00:02:46.080> further<00:02:46.290> ranges<00:02:46.890> however

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
bullets down even further ranges however

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.770 
bullets down even further ranges however
I<00:02:47.520> found<00:02:47.850> out<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> stubby<00:02:48.390> grip<00:02:48.480> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
I found out that the stubby grip and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.300 
I found out that the stubby grip and
potato<00:02:49.110> grip<00:02:49.350> were<00:02:49.500> really<00:02:49.800> effective<00:02:50.190> as

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
potato grip were really effective as

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.920 
potato grip were really effective as
well<00:02:50.550> when<00:02:50.790> shooting<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.270> large<00:02:51.540> stream<00:02:51.810> of

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
well when shooting a large stream of

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.840 
well when shooting a large stream of
bullets<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.350> full<00:02:52.530> auto<00:02:52.650> now<00:02:53.490> back<00:02:53.700> in

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
bullets in full auto now back in

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.910 
bullets in full auto now back in
battlefield<00:02:54.240> 3<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.690> f2000<00:02:55.410> was<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.800> my

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
battlefield 3 the f2000 was one of my

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.620 
battlefield 3 the f2000 was one of my
favorite<00:02:56.340> weapons<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:56.970> gonna<00:02:57.150> have<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.420> say

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
favorite weapons but I gonna have to say

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.450 
favorite weapons but I gonna have to say
that<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:57.990> battlefield<00:02:58.380> 4<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.070> my

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
that in battlefield 4 this is my

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.400 
that in battlefield 4 this is my
favorite<00:02:59.760> assault<00:03:00.150> rifle<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.960> reminds<00:03:01.230> me<00:03:01.320> a

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
favorite assault rifle it reminds me a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.710 
favorite assault rifle it reminds me a
lot<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.820> aek-971<00:03:02.820> but<00:03:03.180> then<00:03:03.330> with<00:03:03.480> better

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
lot of the aek-971 but then with better

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.540 
lot of the aek-971 but then with better
range<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.890> found<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.310> dropping

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
range and I found that a dropping

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.890 
range and I found that a dropping
enemies<00:03:05.940> had<00:03:06.060> longer<00:03:06.330> race<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.660> really

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
enemies had longer race was really

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.420 
enemies had longer race was really
effective<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.560> weapon<00:03:07.710> as<00:03:07.980> well<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
effective with this weapon as well and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.100 
effective with this weapon as well and
the<00:03:08.850> good<00:03:08.970> thing<00:03:09.000> about<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.510> high<00:03:09.690> fire<00:03:09.960> rate

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
the good thing about this high fire rate

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.690 
the good thing about this high fire rate
is<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.470> you're<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.920> drop<00:03:11.100> people<00:03:11.490> very

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
is that you're going to drop people very

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.360 
is that you're going to drop people very
fast<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.120> close<00:03:12.360> quarters<00:03:12.810> too<00:03:13.050> so<00:03:13.770> my<00:03:13.980> opinion

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
fast on close quarters too so my opinion

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.920 
fast on close quarters too so my opinion
the<00:03:14.490> best<00:03:14.640> way<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> use<00:03:15.210> his<00:03:15.360> weapons<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.810> be

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
the best way to use his weapons to be

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.990 
the best way to use his weapons to be
really<00:03:16.260> aggressive<00:03:16.530> don't<00:03:17.340> be<00:03:17.460> scared<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.880> run

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
really aggressive don't be scared to run
