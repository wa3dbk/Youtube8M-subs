00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.430
 Well, as I already told you already 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.680
 we have the white part ready and now 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.290
 we have to get it done right 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.720
 opposite the yellow part as we are going to 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.309
 do this good in the same way that 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.510
 we have made the white the only 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.520
 difference is that now we have to 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 be careful because they have displaced 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.230
 the rows the pieces towards the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 part that interests us we will lose 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 always do that we have already aware 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.930
 always do well movements 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.270
 to be able to recover what we already have 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.190
 for example here we have a very well 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.610
 placed this would be very easy you see 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.740
 we have three three blow 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.900
 Nothing, we have to upload it here 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.150
 up you see now when doing this 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.880
 move and upload them up here 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.190
 I have displaced 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.560
 this white row of how I do it for 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.640
 to be able to recover them without losing this then 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.420
 as we explained before 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.420
 we turn 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.930
 to put him on this side and so to do 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.100
 recover back to the white part we 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.390
 we lose nothing good we keep looking 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.850
 yellow parts for example 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 here we have two tips 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.579
 we take advantage 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.240
 to raise 2 alves and how we do it 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:23.990
 Well, in this case, 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.869
 we raise this peace that part up 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.159
 we recover we keep on this side 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.710
 so that when recovering again 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.630
 both the white and the yellow part 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.630
 that we have displaced do not lose anything 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.890
 well we continue now because of what he saw no 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.150
 there are two pieces that are together then 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.080
 we follow the same method as 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.930
 we used previously piece 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.409
 yellow for example we want to place it 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.050
 here is just the middle one because nothing 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 we climb 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.000
 we turn to allow to keep the line 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.100
 yellow we turn the opposite to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.659
 recover both the yellow and place 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.340
 the bands in place 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.950
 and turn again 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.950
 to recover the part 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.360
 yellow 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.590
 and we have observed the white one and we have 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.810
 preserved the little hand well 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.860
 Well, look here, here we have the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.710
 two last ones that luckily we have 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.200
 Market Stall 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.440
 like this we could do it from two of 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.480
 two forms 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.830
 What I usually do or what I can do 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.260
 to teach is to place them one at a time 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.349
 when we do not match the position 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.480
 so that you remember and repeat what is the 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.420
 method more simple then though 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.140
 by stretching this part of here now we 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.360
 place two we're just going to save one 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.540
 I repeat and ways of doing both of 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.180
 Once I teach you to put them in a 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.090
 moon that does not have all three in rows and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.760
 so I think you'll remember them more 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.519
 you will remember better 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.790
 upload which we want to recover this line 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.980
 d 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.769
 we turn 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.989
 the salva tour has given us against in the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.540
 top we recover the yellow 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.930
 that we had, we turn again and 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.879
 we recover we miss the target and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.580
 we got the yellow and we just 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.030
 is now here we have it we follow the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.030
 same movement 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.720
 we put it in its place we turn to 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.950
 save what we just got 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.569
 we turn the top part again 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.530
 setback to recover what we had 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.390
 removed we turn and go up again 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.640
 that we have achieved we would have the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.500
 yellow center and the technological well 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.209
 then we would have both sides 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.150
 opposite and at the same time we have to continue 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.340
 by any of the four that we 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.120
 we are missing this we will see now in the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.120
 next video
