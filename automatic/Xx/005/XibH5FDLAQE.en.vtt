purchased I'll say more expensive knives
that<00:00:27.929> I<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:30.500> you<00:00:31.500> know<00:00:31.560> now<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.369> maybe

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
that I got so you know now that I maybe

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
that I got so you know now that I maybe
know<00:00:33.269> it<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> more<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.920> wouldn't

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
know it was it more I wouldn't

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.250 
know it was it more I wouldn't
necessarily<00:00:35.129> say<00:00:35.550> would<00:00:35.879> have<00:00:36.629> got<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.019> one

necessarily say would have got this one
right<00:00:37.440> away<00:00:37.790> but<00:00:39.799> so<00:00:40.799> here<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.100> reasoning<00:00:41.760> was

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
right away but so here my reasoning was

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.289 
right away but so here my reasoning was
I<00:00:42.330> had<00:00:42.690> another<00:00:42.989> fixed<00:00:43.379> blade<00:00:43.619> that<00:00:44.430> I'll

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:45.299 
I had another fixed blade that I'll

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:49.240 
I had another fixed blade that I'll
review<00:00:45.720> later<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.460> was<00:00:47.460> almost<00:00:47.729> two<00:00:47.970> pounds

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
review later it was almost two pounds

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.040 
review later it was almost two pounds
used<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.339> take<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> hiking<00:00:50.869> outdoors

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
used to take it hiking outdoors

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.990 
used to take it hiking outdoors
it's<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.680> beast<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.190> an<00:00:54.340> item<00:00:54.550> to<00:00:54.579> carry<00:00:54.850> around

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
it's a beast of an item to carry around

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.810 
it's a beast of an item to carry around
it<00:00:55.629> it<00:00:56.350> wasn't<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:56.829> tractable<00:00:59.280> now<00:01:00.280> for<00:01:00.550> I'm

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
it it wasn't that tractable now for I'm

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.450 
it it wasn't that tractable now for I'm
in<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.270> don't<00:01:01.690> do<00:01:01.809> any<00:01:01.989> extreme<00:01:02.649> outdoor<00:01:02.980> ring

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
in I don't do any extreme outdoor ring

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.570 
in I don't do any extreme outdoor ring
anything<00:01:04.150> like<00:01:04.269> that<00:01:04.300> but<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.830> was<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> break<00:01:06.460> to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
anything like that but it was a break to

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.880 
anything like that but it was a break to
carry<00:01:06.790> around<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:07.360> my<00:01:07.630> reasoning<00:01:08.020> was<00:01:08.229> let's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
carry around so my reasoning was let's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.140 
carry around so my reasoning was let's
get<00:01:09.070> another<00:01:09.670> fixed<00:01:10.060> blade<00:01:10.300> that<00:01:10.540> was<00:01:10.690> lighter

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
get another fixed blade that was lighter

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.950 
get another fixed blade that was lighter
sharper<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:14.200> don't<00:01:14.680> do<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:14.830> lot<00:01:14.920> of<00:01:15.040> no<00:01:16.030> spine

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
sharper I don't do a lot of no spine

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.810 
sharper I don't do a lot of no spine
whacking<00:01:17.409> hanging<00:01:17.619> like<00:01:17.770> that<00:01:17.800> not<00:01:18.729> as

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
whacking hanging like that not as

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.389 
whacking hanging like that not as
expiring<00:01:19.210> like<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.540> but<00:01:19.780> played<00:01:20.740> whacking<00:01:21.159> to

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
expiring like you but played whacking to

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.420 
expiring like you but played whacking to
chopping<00:01:22.149> logs<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.720> like<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.080> it's<00:01:23.340> more<00:01:24.340> of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
chopping logs and like that it's more of

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.920 
chopping logs and like that it's more of
a<00:01:24.490> fixed<00:01:24.759> blade<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.060> lug<00:01:25.240> around<00:01:25.270> with<00:01:25.750> so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
a fixed blade to lug around with so

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.340 
a fixed blade to lug around with so
slider<00:01:26.910> handle<00:01:27.910> feels<00:01:28.240> better<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:29.050> i'm<00:01:29.200> not

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.980 
slider handle feels better and i'm not
sure<00:01:29.410> what<00:01:29.649> this<00:01:29.800> material<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.880> heals<00:01:31.509> like

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990

key 10 not sure about that have to look

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
key 10 not sure about that have to look
that<00:01:34.390> one<00:01:34.509> up<00:01:36.660> again<00:01:37.660> it's<00:01:37.840> duratec<00:01:38.560> steel<00:01:39.899> 20

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that one up again it's duratec steel 20

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.389 
that one up again it's duratec steel 20
CBRC<00:01:42.280> 60<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:43.210> have<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.990> say<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.740> know<00:01:45.250> a

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
CBRC 60 I have to say that I know a

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.650 
CBRC 60 I have to say that I know a
little<00:01:45.610> bit<00:01:45.789> more<00:01:45.910> about<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.270> steel<00:01:46.479> out

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
little bit more about the steel out

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.150 
little bit more about the steel out
there<00:01:46.840> now<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.440> don't<00:01:47.500> know<00:01:47.830> anything

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
there now and I don't know anything

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.990 
there now and I don't know anything
about<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:49.090> at<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.780> sog<00:01:50.560> line<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.310> seemed

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
about that at the sog line it seemed

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.469 
about that at the sog line it seemed
like<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.390> was<00:01:52.630> more<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.320> higher-end<00:01:54.479> steel

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
like it was more of a higher-end steel

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.800 
like it was more of a higher-end steel
but<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:57.700> sure<00:01:57.940> about<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.390> don't<00:01:58.599> know<00:01:58.720> what

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
but not sure about that don't know what

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.770 
but not sure about that don't know what
the<00:01:58.899> quality<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.380> there<00:01:59.410> batter<00:01:59.800> off<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.099> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the quality is there batter off to that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.279 
the quality is there batter off to that
so<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.920> blade<00:02:03.160> blade<00:02:03.819> is<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.360> good<00:02:04.810> shape<00:02:05.050> I

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
so the blade blade is a good shape I

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.020 
so the blade blade is a good shape I
think<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:05.649> think<00:02:06.640> it's<00:02:07.020> 67<00:02:08.020> inches<00:02:09.030> maybe

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
think it's think it's 67 inches maybe

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.059 
think it's think it's 67 inches maybe
not<00:02:10.209> quite<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:11.830> shorter<00:02:12.099> than<00:02:12.160> that

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
not quite a little shorter than that

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.520 
not quite a little shorter than that
very<00:02:15.069> sharp

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
very sharp

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.570 
very sharp
point<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> certainly<00:02:19.069> couldn't<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.310> doesn't

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
point it certainly couldn't it doesn't

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.860 
point it certainly couldn't it doesn't
weigh<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.760> much<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.330> can't<00:02:21.569> do<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> lot<00:02:21.840> of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
weigh that much you can't do a lot of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.949 
weigh that much you can't do a lot of
hacking<00:02:22.350> with<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.150> anymore<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.540> detailed

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
out never did anything with it sliced a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.729 
out never did anything with it sliced a
little<00:02:58.590> paper<00:02:58.769> maybe<00:02:59.600> i<00:03:00.600> have<00:03:01.050> read<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
little paper maybe i have read that the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.699 
little paper maybe i have read that the
steel<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.610> rust<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.180> little<00:03:03.390> bit<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.680> i

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
steel can rust a little bit so i

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.020 
steel can rust a little bit so i

is kind of lower on my list I'd like to

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.369 
is kind of lower on my list I'd like to
look<00:04:08.390> at<00:04:08.660> will<00:04:09.530> not<00:04:09.680> go<00:04:09.860> cold<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:11.049> play<00:04:12.049> with<00:04:12.230> I

guess<00:04:12.590> but<00:04:14.410> for<00:04:15.410> me<00:04:15.560> at<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:15.920> just<00:04:16.250> not<00:04:16.519> as

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
guess but for me at it's just not as

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.759 
guess but for me at it's just not as
practical<00:04:17.389> anymore<00:04:17.810> so<00:04:18.169> maybe<00:04:18.350> six<00:04:18.620> out<00:04:18.739> of

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
practical anymore so maybe six out of

just thinking fixed blades a little
lower<00:04:31.789> now<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:33.139> that's<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.889> knife<00:04:34.100> six<00:04:34.880> out
