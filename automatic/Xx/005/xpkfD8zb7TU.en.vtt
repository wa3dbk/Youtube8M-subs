lighting this bike wheel that would be

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.459 
lighting this bike wheel that would be
like<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.069> Revo<00:00:49.399> light<00:00:49.609> system<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:51.260> is

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
like the Revo light system this is

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.729 
like the Revo light system this is
simulating<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:52.749> in<00:00:53.749> a<00:00:53.899> very<00:00:54.109> similar<00:00:54.409> way<00:00:54.710> to

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
simulating it in a very similar way to

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.299 
simulating it in a very similar way to
get<00:00:55.069> the<00:00:55.219> same<00:00:55.429> physical<00:00:56.469> output<00:00:57.469> basically

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
get the same physical output basically

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.790 
get the same physical output basically
there's<00:00:58.789> 12<00:00:59.120> LEDs<00:00:59.749> around<00:00:59.929> this<00:01:00.260> wheel<00:01:00.530> and

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
there's 12 LEDs around this wheel and

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.600 
there's 12 LEDs around this wheel and
they<00:01:01.729> sequentially<00:01:02.569> light<00:01:02.839> up<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.220> that<00:01:04.400> only

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
they sequentially light up so that only

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.940 
they sequentially light up so that only
this<00:01:05.030> 120<00:01:05.750> degree<00:01:06.020> arc<00:01:06.290> around<00:01:06.469> the<00:01:06.740> wheels

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950

rear wheel back here it's lit red while
you're<00:01:22.070> riding<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:23.450> can<00:01:23.479> program<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.289> do

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
you're riding you can program it to do

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.709 
you're riding you can program it to do
whatever<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.009> want<00:01:25.219> when<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.490> stop<00:01:25.759> but<00:01:26.479> it's

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
whatever you want when you stop but it's

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.020 
whatever you want when you stop but it's
really<00:01:26.899> cool<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:27.289> maintains<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.860> light<00:01:28.070> bar<00:01:28.310> so

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
really cool it maintains a light bar so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.060 
really cool it maintains a light bar so
on<00:01:29.450> I'll<00:01:30.020> show<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.380> what<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.619> looks<00:01:30.890> like

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
on I'll show you what that looks like

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.319 
on I'll show you what that looks like
let<00:01:31.250> me<00:01:31.340> just<00:01:31.369> flick<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.700> lights<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.149> can<00:01:32.299> see

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
let me just flick the lights you can see

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.389 
let me just flick the lights you can see
really<00:01:32.689> good<00:01:33.820> um<00:01:35.439> I<00:01:36.439> designed<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:37.189> system

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
really good um I designed this system

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.120 
really good um I designed this system
because<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:38.659> sounded<00:01:39.350> like<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.469> cool<00:01:39.859> fun

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
because it sounded like a cool fun

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.919 
because it sounded like a cool fun
project<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.969> guy<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.549> 2011<00:01:43.549> was<00:01:43.700> trying<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.240> open

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
project a guy in 2011 was trying to open

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.990 
project a guy in 2011 was trying to open
source<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.619> or<00:01:45.890> make<00:01:46.100> his<00:01:46.280> own<00:01:46.429> Reba<00:01:46.759> light

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
source this or make his own Reba light

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.889 
source this or make his own Reba light
like<00:01:47.659> system<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:48.880> just<00:01:49.880> YouTube<00:01:50.299> Reba<00:01:50.689> lights

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
like system and just YouTube Reba lights

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.080 
like system and just YouTube Reba lights
are<00:01:51.079> really<00:01:51.200> cool<00:01:51.530> um<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:52.759> they're<00:01:52.909> really

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
are really cool um but they're really

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.450 
are really cool um but they're really
expensive<00:01:53.479> they're<00:01:53.780> like<00:01:53.929> I<00:01:54.140> think<00:01:54.320> 230<00:01:55.189> bucks

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
expensive they're like I think 230 bucks

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.279 
expensive they're like I think 230 bucks
for<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.820> system<00:01:56.270> for<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.509> front<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.869> back<00:01:56.960> wheel

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
for a system for a front and back wheel

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.789 
for a system for a front and back wheel
and<00:01:57.590> most<00:01:58.429> people<00:01:58.729> can't<00:01:58.909> afford<00:01:58.939> that<00:01:59.240> and

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
and most people can't afford that and

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.020 
and most people can't afford that and
bicycle<00:02:00.799> safety<00:02:01.039> is<00:02:01.249> pretty<00:02:01.490> important<00:02:01.969> so

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
bicycle safety is pretty important so

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.399 
bicycle safety is pretty important so
put<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.600> out<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:02.960> open<00:02:03.020> source

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
put this out in the open source

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.200 
put this out in the open source
community<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:04.009> ER<00:02:04.460> wires<00:02:04.700> can<00:02:05.060> make

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
community and ER wires can make

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.619 
community and ER wires can make
themselves<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.649> but<00:02:06.950> anyways<00:02:07.310> um<00:02:07.579> as<00:02:08.149> you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
themselves so but anyways um as you

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.359 
themselves so but anyways um as you
start<00:02:08.899> spinning<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.470> wheel<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:10.009> takes<00:02:10.250> a

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
start spinning the wheel it takes a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.690 
start spinning the wheel it takes a
minute

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
minute

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.020 
minute
to<00:02:10.849> adjust<00:02:11.480> but<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.530> white<00:02:12.739> art<00:02:13.040> bar<00:02:13.700> will

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
to adjust but the white art bar will

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.860 
to adjust but the white art bar will
develop<00:02:14.599> on<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.840> back<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:17.420> maintained

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
develop on the back and it's maintained

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.259 
develop on the back and it's maintained
there<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.890> basically<00:02:19.220> what<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.670> program<00:02:20.060> is

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
there so basically what the program is

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.509 
there so basically what the program is
doing<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:20.870> calculating<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> RPM<00:02:22.129> and

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
doing is it's calculating the RPM and

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.360 
doing is it's calculating the RPM and
then<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.269> breaking<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.900> wheel<00:02:24.080> up<00:02:24.410> into

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.600 

timespans

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
timespans

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.870 
timespans
that<00:02:29.150> equal<00:02:29.630> like<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.959> 12<00:02:30.230> leds<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.040> it's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
that equal like the 12 leds so it's

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.710 
that equal like the 12 leds so it's
calculating<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.540> revolution<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:33.680> it's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
calculating the revolution and then it's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.289 
calculating the revolution and then it's
determining<00:02:36.340> basically<00:02:37.340> off<00:02:37.549> of<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:38.000> time

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
determining basically off of that time

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.990 
determining basically off of that time
it<00:02:38.510> takes<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.959> revolve<00:02:39.310> when<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.730> should

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
it takes to revolve when it should

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.900 
it takes to revolve when it should
sequentially<00:02:41.780> turn<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:42.590> off<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.130> 12<00:02:43.400> LEDs

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
sequentially turn on and off the 12 LEDs

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.000 
sequentially turn on and off the 12 LEDs
that<00:02:43.940> are<00:02:44.150> evenly<00:02:44.480> spaced<00:02:44.840> around<00:02:45.049> it<00:02:45.410> to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
that are evenly spaced around it to

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.789 
that are evenly spaced around it to
maintain<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:46.640> white<00:02:46.849> bar<00:02:47.060> um<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.470> wheels

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
maintain this white bar um the wheels

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.130 
maintain this white bar um the wheels
turning<00:02:49.160> counterclockwise<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.450> at<00:02:50.930> the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
turning counterclockwise and at the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.830 
turning counterclockwise and at the
bottom<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.220> arc<00:02:52.579> there's<00:02:53.360> an<00:02:53.540> LED

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
bottom of this arc there's an LED

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.839 
bottom of this arc there's an LED
spinning<00:02:54.650> counterclockwise<00:02:54.829> around<00:02:55.760> this

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
spinning counterclockwise around this

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.600 
spinning counterclockwise around this
wheel<00:02:56.120> when<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.840> gets<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.590> end<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.400> lit

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
wheel when it gets to the end of the lit

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.720 
wheel when it gets to the end of the lit
bar<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.720> turns<00:03:00.079> off<00:03:00.340> when<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.430> one<00:03:01.579> at<00:03:01.670> the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
bar it turns off when the one at the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.050 
bar it turns off when the one at the
path<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.329> going<00:03:02.750> into<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.260> section<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.459> turns

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
path is going into that section it turns

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.490 
path is going into that section it turns
on<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.989> they<00:03:06.140> turn<00:03:06.349> on<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.739> off<00:03:06.829> sequentially

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
on so they turn on and off sequentially

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.050 
on so they turn on and off sequentially
it<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:09.709> awesome<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.310> think<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.670> really<00:03:10.819> cool

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
it just awesome I think it's really cool

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.020 
it just awesome I think it's really cool
that<00:03:11.319> someone<00:03:12.319> designed<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.819> guy<00:03:13.970> in

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.059 
the forum couldn't get his to work and I
just<00:03:17.000> borrowed<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.930> code<00:03:18.139> is<00:03:18.530> from<00:03:18.920> an

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
least the first couple revisions this

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.629 
least the first couple revisions this
one<00:04:40.509> works<00:04:40.720> pretty<00:04:40.840> good<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:42.340> would<00:04:42.520> look

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
one works pretty good it would look

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.240 
one works pretty good it would look
better<00:04:42.880> if<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.360> probably<00:04:44.139> evenly<00:04:44.770> spaced<00:04:45.039> the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
better if I probably evenly spaced the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.390 
better if I probably evenly spaced the
LEDs<00:04:45.669> out<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:46.180> little<00:04:46.389> bit<00:04:46.599> better<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:47.620> like<00:04:48.250> I

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
LEDs out a little bit better but like I

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.969 
LEDs out a little bit better but like I
said<00:04:48.460> this<00:04:48.729> is<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:48.940> crude<00:04:49.180> mock-up<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:50.650> I'm

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
said this is a crude mock-up so I'm

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.740 
said this is a crude mock-up so I'm
going<00:04:51.449> pretty<00:04:52.449> slow<00:04:53.169> and<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:55.240> white<00:04:55.419> bar<00:04:55.630> is

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
going pretty slow and the white bar is

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.430 
going pretty slow and the white bar is
maintaining<00:04:56.319> and<00:04:56.729> then<00:04:57.729> I'm<00:04:58.060> going<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.440> really

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
maintaining and then I'm going to really

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.149 
maintaining and then I'm going to really
speed<00:04:59.710> up<00:04:59.770> really<00:05:00.130> fast<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:01.470> I'm<00:05:02.470> going<00:05:02.979> like

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
speed up really fast and I'm going like

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.510 
speed up really fast and I'm going like
bobbing<00:05:03.580> down<00:05:03.729> a<00:05:03.759> hill<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:05.159> one<00:05:06.159> time<00:05:06.370> at<00:05:06.490> a

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
bobbing down a hill and one time at a

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.890 
bobbing down a hill and one time at a
steady<00:05:06.819> speed<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.449> light<00:05:07.659> bar<00:05:07.870> is

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
steady speed that light bar is

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.740 
steady speed that light bar is
maintained<00:05:08.380> again<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:09.759> actual<00:05:09.940> Revo<00:05:10.539> light

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
maintained again the actual Revo light

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.640 
maintained again the actual Revo light
system<00:05:11.229> doesn't<00:05:11.560> have<00:05:11.710> 12<00:05:12.099> LEDs<00:05:12.639> it<00:05:13.479> has<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:14.050> 24

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
system doesn't have 12 LEDs it has a 24

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.370 
system doesn't have 12 LEDs it has a 24
but<00:05:15.490> there's<00:05:15.759> 12<00:05:16.270> on<00:05:16.509> either<00:05:16.690> side<00:05:17.080> of<00:05:17.110> the

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
but there's 12 on either side of the

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.670 
but there's 12 on either side of the
wheel<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:18.509> there's<00:05:19.509> one<00:05:19.840> on<00:05:20.050> one<00:05:20.289> side<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.530> it

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
wheel and there's one on one side of it

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.469 
wheel and there's one on one side of it
for<00:05:20.979> every<00:05:21.220> LED<00:05:21.639> on<00:05:21.729> one<00:05:21.970> side<00:05:22.180> of<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.330> wheel

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
for every LED on one side of the wheel

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.839 
for every LED on one side of the wheel
there's<00:05:22.810> one<00:05:23.020> neared<00:05:23.520> exactly<00:05:24.520> on<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.729> other

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
there's one neared exactly on the other

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.790 
there's one neared exactly on the other
side<00:05:25.120> of<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.270> rim<00:05:25.449> so<00:05:26.169> they're<00:05:26.349> hooked<00:05:26.530> up<00:05:26.680> in

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
side of the rim so they're hooked up in

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.040 
side of the rim so they're hooked up in
parallel<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.580> they're<00:05:27.669> hooked<00:05:27.759> up<00:05:28.000> full<00:05:28.750> to

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
parallel and they're hooked up full to

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.040 
parallel and they're hooked up full to
one<00:05:29.199> output<00:05:29.409> of<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:30.509> microcontroller<00:05:31.509> so<00:05:31.930> they

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
one output of a microcontroller so they

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.740 
one output of a microcontroller so they
trip<00:05:32.259> on<00:05:32.409> at<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.650> same<00:05:32.830> time<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:34.330> LEDs

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
trip on at the same time and the LEDs

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.570 
trip on at the same time and the LEDs
kind<00:05:34.990> of<00:05:35.080> aim<00:05:35.259> out<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:35.740> down<00:05:35.949> so<00:05:36.250> they<00:05:36.370> aim<00:05:36.550> at

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
kind of aim out and down so they aim at

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.480 
kind of aim out and down so they aim at
the<00:05:36.849> cars<00:05:37.090> behind<00:05:37.389> you<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.080> at<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:39.130> cars

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
the cars behind you and at the cars

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.550 
the cars behind you and at the cars
jacent<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.270> you<00:05:40.360> at<00:05:40.509> the<00:05:40.630> intersections<00:05:41.320> where

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
jacent to you at the intersections where

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.450 
jacent to you at the intersections where
most<00:05:42.130> bicycle<00:05:42.580> accidents<00:05:43.030> Kurt<00:05:43.240> um<00:05:44.009> so<00:05:45.009> the

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
most bicycle accidents Kurt um so the

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.300 
most bicycle accidents Kurt um so the
front<00:05:45.820> white<00:05:46.479> bar<00:05:46.960> would<00:05:47.199> be<00:05:47.259> on<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.680> opposite

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
front white bar would be on the opposite

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.649 
front white bar would be on the opposite
side<00:05:48.550> of<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.820> rim<00:05:49.530> 180<00:05:50.530> degrees<00:05:50.889> over<00:05:51.069> and

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
side of the rim 180 degrees over and

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.390 
side of the rim 180 degrees over and
like<00:05:52.659> I<00:05:52.690> cited<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.139> front<00:05:53.469> one<00:05:53.620> is<00:05:53.740> white<00:05:54.130> on

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
like I cited the front one is white on

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.089 
like I cited the front one is white on
the<00:05:54.610> repo<00:05:54.909> light<00:05:55.120> system<00:05:55.630> and<00:05:55.900> red<00:05:56.830> on<00:05:57.009> the

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
the repo light system and red on the

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.230 
the repo light system and red on the
back<00:05:57.310> so<00:05:57.610> yeah<00:05:58.080> I<00:05:59.340> kind<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.430> think<00:06:00.669> of<00:06:00.789> this<00:06:00.969> if

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
back so yeah I kind of think of this if

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.390 
back so yeah I kind of think of this if
you're<00:06:01.389> trying<00:06:01.719> to<00:06:01.780> conceptualize<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.710> as<00:06:02.860> a

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
you're trying to conceptualize it as a

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.719 
you're trying to conceptualize it as a
hamster<00:06:03.849> wheel<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:05.219> bicycle<00:06:06.219> wheel<00:06:06.430> right

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
hamster wheel the bicycle wheel right

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.790 
hamster wheel the bicycle wheel right
now<00:06:06.909> is<00:06:07.090> spinning<00:06:07.479> counterclockwise<00:06:07.800> and

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
now is spinning counterclockwise and

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.390 
now is spinning counterclockwise and
that<00:06:09.789> white<00:06:10.389> bar<00:06:10.719> is<00:06:11.050> spinning<00:06:11.560> clockwise<00:06:11.800> at

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
that white bar is spinning clockwise at

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.439 
that white bar is spinning clockwise at
the<00:06:12.550> exact<00:06:12.969> same<00:06:13.180> speed<00:06:13.659> so<00:06:14.440> um<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:16.060> white<00:06:16.240> bar

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
the exact same speed so um the white bar

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.450 
the exact same speed so um the white bar
is<00:06:16.599> staying<00:06:16.840> stationary<00:06:17.139> it's<00:06:17.889> kind<00:06:18.159> of<00:06:18.219> like

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
is staying stationary it's kind of like

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.939 
is staying stationary it's kind of like
a<00:06:18.490> white<00:06:18.880> hamster<00:06:19.509> um<00:06:22.020> so<00:06:23.020> yeah<00:06:23.530> just<00:06:23.800> like<00:06:23.889> a

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
a white hamster um so yeah just like a

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.920 
a white hamster um so yeah just like a
treadmill<00:06:24.219> this<00:06:24.880> white<00:06:25.270> bar<00:06:25.509> is<00:06:25.690> on<00:06:25.870> a

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
treadmill this white bar is on a

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.149 
treadmill this white bar is on a
circular<00:06:26.650> treadmill<00:06:27.250> and<00:06:28.469> you<00:06:29.469> know<00:06:29.589> like<00:06:30.010> if

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
circular treadmill and you know like if

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:31.709 
circular treadmill and you know like if
you're<00:06:30.310> on<00:06:30.339> a<00:06:30.520> treadmill<00:06:30.820> and<00:06:31.210> you're<00:06:31.570> walking

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
you're on a treadmill and you're walking

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.830 
you're on a treadmill and you're walking
if<00:06:32.650> you're<00:06:32.830> walking<00:06:33.070> at<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:33.430> same

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
if you're walking at the same

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.080 
if you're walking at the same
velocity<00:06:34.230> that<00:06:34.500> the<00:06:34.650> treadmills<00:06:35.100> going<00:06:35.940> the

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
velocity that the treadmills going the

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.520 
velocity that the treadmills going the
opposite<00:06:36.419> direction<00:06:36.480> then<00:06:37.199> you'll<00:06:37.320> stay

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
opposite direction then you'll stay

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.920 
opposite direction then you'll stay
stationary<00:06:37.800> if<00:06:38.639> you<00:06:38.880> run<00:06:39.090> faster<00:06:39.630> than<00:06:39.660> it's

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
stationary if you run faster than it's

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.450 
stationary if you run faster than it's
going<00:06:40.230> you'll<00:06:40.380> run<00:06:40.560> off<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.889> front<00:06:41.100> of<00:06:41.190> it<00:06:41.340> and

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
going you'll run off the front of it and

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.800 
going you'll run off the front of it and
if<00:06:41.820> you<00:06:41.970> go<00:06:42.120> slower<00:06:42.449> because<00:06:42.690> you're<00:06:42.930> tired<00:06:43.139> or

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
if you go slower because you're tired or

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.140 
if you go slower because you're tired or
spaced<00:06:45.810> out<00:06:46.050> you'll<00:06:46.560> fall<00:06:46.770> off<00:06:46.800> the<00:06:47.130> back<00:06:47.250> so

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
spaced out you'll fall off the back so

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.270 
spaced out you'll fall off the back so
um<00:06:48.540> yeah<00:06:49.169> that's<00:06:49.290> pretty<00:06:49.590> much<00:06:49.770> what's<00:06:50.010> going

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
um yeah that's pretty much what's going

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.939 
um yeah that's pretty much what's going
on<00:06:50.400> here<00:06:50.699> so<00:06:51.270> what's<00:06:51.990> a<00:06:52.169> pretty<00:06:52.590> cool<00:06:52.800> effect

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
on here so what's a pretty cool effect

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.920 
on here so what's a pretty cool effect
for<00:06:53.430> you<00:06:53.490> to<00:06:53.580> see<00:06:53.790> it<00:06:54.210> is<00:06:55.880> if<00:06:56.880> I<00:06:57.479> immediately

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
for you to see it is if I immediately

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.760 
for you to see it is if I immediately
stop<00:06:58.620> this<00:06:58.889> thing<00:06:59.419> then<00:07:00.419> the<00:07:00.930> light<00:07:01.229> bar<00:07:01.500> will

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
stop this thing then the light bar will

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.890 
stop this thing then the light bar will
spin<00:07:02.250> clockwise<00:07:02.760> the<00:07:03.419> way<00:07:03.540> that<00:07:03.750> it's

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
spin clockwise the way that it's

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.570 
spin clockwise the way that it's
creeping<00:07:04.320> up<00:07:04.470> and<00:07:04.770> spinning<00:07:05.130> around<00:07:05.280> and

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
creeping up and spinning around and

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.879 
creeping up and spinning around and
maintaining<00:07:06.000> words<00:07:06.150> that<00:07:06.419> if<00:07:06.720> I<00:07:07.229> stop<00:07:07.590> this

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
maintaining words that if I stop this

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.500 
maintaining words that if I stop this
saying<00:07:08.160> the<00:07:08.370> wheel<00:07:08.550> stops<00:07:09.030> turning

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
saying the wheel stops turning

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.440 
saying the wheel stops turning
counterclockwise<00:07:09.840> and<00:07:10.729> the<00:07:11.729> white<00:07:11.970> bar<00:07:12.210> will

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
counterclockwise and the white bar will

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.320 
counterclockwise and the white bar will
turn<00:07:12.600> clockwise<00:07:12.930> at<00:07:13.440> the<00:07:13.530> same<00:07:13.830> speed<00:07:14.430> for<00:07:15.300> a

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
turn clockwise at the same speed for a

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.480 
turn clockwise at the same speed for a
couple<00:07:15.690> seconds<00:07:16.110> that<00:07:16.500> the<00:07:16.650> wheel<00:07:16.800> was<00:07:17.100> just

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
couple seconds that the wheel was just

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.700 
couple seconds that the wheel was just
turning<00:07:17.729> so<00:07:18.000> check<00:07:18.180> it<00:07:18.300> out<00:07:20.780> I'm<00:07:21.780> programmed

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
turning so check it out I'm programmed

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.440 
turning so check it out I'm programmed
to<00:07:22.830> go<00:07:22.979> into<00:07:23.190> standby<00:07:23.520> mode<00:07:23.639> it<00:07:24.030> just<00:07:24.060> turns

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.450 
to go into standby mode it just turns

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.659 
to go into standby mode it just turns
off<00:07:24.750> all<00:07:24.960> the<00:07:25.139> LEDs<00:07:25.530> I'll<00:07:25.830> do<00:07:26.039> something<00:07:26.280> cool

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669 
off all the LEDs I'll do something cool

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:28.969 
off all the LEDs I'll do something cool
like<00:07:26.940> I'm<00:07:27.780> going<00:07:27.930> to<00:07:27.990> make<00:07:28.110> a<00:07:28.169> cool<00:07:28.440> pattern<00:07:28.650> or

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 
like I'm going to make a cool pattern or

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:31.190 
like I'm going to make a cool pattern or
something<00:07:29.310> the<00:07:29.400> star<00:07:29.610> pattern<00:07:30.030> at<00:07:30.600> some<00:07:30.900> point

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
something the star pattern at some point

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.960 
something the star pattern at some point
in<00:07:31.260> time<00:07:31.550> yeah<00:07:32.550> that's<00:07:32.820> basically<00:07:33.360> it<00:07:33.900> um<00:07:34.970> the

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
in time yeah that's basically it um the

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.300 
in time yeah that's basically it um the
description<00:07:36.690> in<00:07:36.960> the<00:07:37.380> description<00:07:37.410> for<00:07:38.190> the

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
description in the description for the

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.190 
description in the description for the
code<00:07:38.520> I<00:07:38.550> have<00:07:38.940> far<00:07:39.180> for<00:07:39.450> the<00:07:39.570> video<00:07:39.810> I<00:07:39.870> have<00:07:40.080> all

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.200 
code I have far for the video I have all

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.440 
code I have far for the video I have all
the<00:07:40.320> code<00:07:40.580> like<00:07:41.580> I<00:07:41.700> said<00:07:41.910> there's<00:07:42.090> a<00:07:42.150> front

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:42.450 
the code like I said there's a front

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.110 
the code like I said there's a front
wheel<00:07:42.600> covered<00:07:43.020> in<00:07:43.110> the<00:07:43.169> back<00:07:43.350> wheel<00:07:43.590> code

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 
wheel covered in the back wheel code

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.240 
wheel covered in the back wheel code
