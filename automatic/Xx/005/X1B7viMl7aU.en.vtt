00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.260 
your hair better so that's what I do
because<00:03:53.050> olive<00:03:53.470> oil<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:54.250> penetrating<00:03:55.120> oil

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
because olive oil is a penetrating oil

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:11.270 
because olive oil is a penetrating oil
so<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:56.050> add<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.770> my<00:03:56.950> deep<00:03:57.160> conditioners

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.800 

so<00:04:12.280> that's<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.760> for<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.090> deep<00:04:13.239> conditioning

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
so that's that for the deep conditioning

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.289 
so that's that for the deep conditioning
