00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
of one I got that really short so then I

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.100 
of one I got that really short so then I
prefer<00:06:40.840> the<00:06:41.170> two<00:06:41.380> um<00:06:42.210> the<00:06:43.210> one<00:06:43.450> I<00:06:43.480> really<00:06:43.960> just

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
prefer the two um the one I really just

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.380 
prefer the two um the one I really just
used<00:06:44.410> for<00:06:44.500> the<00:06:44.650> edges<00:06:45.010> but<00:06:45.220> I<00:06:45.460> messed<00:06:45.760> up<00:06:45.970> I<00:06:46.180> got

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:46.390 
used for the edges but I messed up I got

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.590 
used for the edges but I messed up I got
too<00:06:46.540> excited<00:06:47.760> so<00:06:48.760> because<00:06:49.030> of<00:06:49.150> that<00:06:49.180> I<00:06:49.300> knew

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
too excited so because of that I knew

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.500 
too excited so because of that I knew
that<00:06:50.640> formula<00:06:51.640> like<00:06:51.730> the<00:06:51.850> rest<00:06:52.000> of<00:06:52.090> them<00:06:52.210> I<00:06:52.300> had

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
that formula like the rest of them I had

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.480 
that formula like the rest of them I had
to<00:06:52.540> match<00:06:52.960> so<00:06:53.770> it's<00:06:53.890> much<00:06:54.040> shorter<00:06:54.070> than

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
to match so it's much shorter than

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.150 
to match so it's much shorter than
normally<00:06:55.090> but<00:06:55.360> um<00:06:55.600> like<00:06:56.590> if<00:06:56.740> you<00:06:56.800> see<00:06:56.920> my<00:06:57.010> other

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
normally but um like if you see my other

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.030
