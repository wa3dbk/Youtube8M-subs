alright today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:03.380> take<00:00:04.380> one<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.890> green<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.580> Bell<00:00:05.910> motors

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
to take one of the green and Bell motors

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.990 
to take one of the green and Bell motors
and<00:00:07.340> fit<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.460> into<00:00:09.019> pro<00:00:10.019> slot<00:00:10.320> chassis<00:00:11.000> from

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
and fit it into pro slot chassis from

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.450 
and fit it into pro slot chassis from
with<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> crow<00:00:12.480> slot<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.590> when<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.130> put

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
with the crow slot is that when you put

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.390 
with the crow slot is that when you put
in<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.820> motor<00:00:15.470> there's<00:00:16.470> such<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> tight

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
in this motor there's such a tight

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.960 
in this motor there's such a tight
tolerance<00:00:18.439> from<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> motor<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.640> rear

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
tolerance from the motor to the rear

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
tolerance from the motor to the rear
axle<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.840> you'll<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.500> little<00:00:23.130> bit<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
axle that you'll get a little bit of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.740 
axle that you'll get a little bit of
rubbing<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:25.830> green<00:00:26.070> n<00:00:26.250> del<00:00:26.460> motor<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.570> if

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
rubbing on the green n del motor and if

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.890 
rubbing on the green n del motor and if
you<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.880> can't<00:00:29.880> spend<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.179> wheels<00:00:30.359> freely

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you see I can't spend the wheels freely

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.400 
you see I can't spend the wheels freely
because<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.759> part<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.149> here<00:00:33.420> we're

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
because in this part right here we're

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
because in this part right here we're
getting<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.489> rub<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.960> think

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
getting a little bit of rub and I think

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.709 
getting a little bit of rub and I think
it's<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.469> probably<00:00:38.280> because<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.059> motor<00:00:39.510> is

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it's just probably because the motor is

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.430 
it's just probably because the motor is
made<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.140> cheaply<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.390> when<00:00:43.350> they

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
made so cheaply that you get when they

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
made so cheaply that you get when they
form<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.950> eat<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.700> bit<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.149> edge

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
form this eat a little bit of a edge

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.010 
form this eat a little bit of a edge
here<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:47.280> rubs<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.390> we'll<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
here and it rubs on so what we'll do is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
here and it rubs on so what we'll do is
we'll<00:00:49.440> grab<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:49.890> dremel<00:00:50.370> tool<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:52.230> any<00:00:53.129> kind

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
we'll grab our dremel tool and any kind

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.900 
we'll grab our dremel tool and any kind
of<00:00:53.430> round<00:00:53.699> grinding<00:00:54.570> blade<00:00:55.199> will<00:00:55.410> do<00:00:55.640> now<00:00:56.640> what

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
of round grinding blade will do now what

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.049 
of round grinding blade will do now what
you<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.090> also<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.039> depends<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.309> picky

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you can also do and depends on how picky

this<00:02:22.860> edge<00:02:23.250> right<00:02:23.610> along<00:02:24.239> here<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.900> maybe

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
this edge right along here and maybe

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.970 
this edge right along here and maybe
along<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:27.209> part<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:27.900> where<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.349> metal

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
along this part here where the metal

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.000 
along this part here where the metal
comes<00:02:29.340> out<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.980> ahead<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.239> copies<00:02:33.239> tape

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
comes out so go ahead and copies tape

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.440 
comes out so go ahead and copies tape
now<00:02:35.010> you're<00:02:35.220> bringing<00:02:35.519> on<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:35.850> backside<00:02:36.060> so

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
now you're bringing on this backside so

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.360 
now you're bringing on this backside so
you<00:02:36.510> don't<00:02:36.660> want<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> lot<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.200> excess<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.130> tape

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you don't want a lot of excess of tape

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.400 
you don't want a lot of excess of tape
on<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.760> side<00:02:39.620> take<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.860> cover<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:42.410> just

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
on that side take it cover it up just

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.640 
on that side take it cover it up just
kind<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.830> brush<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:44.580> against<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.650> again

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
kind of brush up against it again

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.770 
kind of brush up against it again
depending<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.489> how<00:02:48.000> technical<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.600> want<00:02:48.720> to

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
depending on how technical you want to

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.539 
depending on how technical you want to
get<00:02:48.930> how<00:02:49.200> much<00:02:49.260> what<00:02:50.100> you're<00:02:50.280> worried<00:02:50.519> about

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
get how much what you're worried about

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.670 
get how much what you're worried about
this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:07.699 

and<00:02:57.799> prepare<00:02:58.799> for<00:02:58.829> grinding<00:03:06.469> we're<00:03:07.469> going<00:03:07.650> to

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
and prepare for grinding we're going to

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.709 
and prepare for grinding we're going to
do<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:09.329> grind<00:03:09.659> straight<00:03:10.140> across<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:10.799> back<00:03:11.719> and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
do is grind straight across the back and

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.920 
do is grind straight across the back and
then<00:03:13.170> maybe<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.219> edge<00:03:14.400> around<00:03:14.900> where<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
then maybe on the edge around where the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.240 
then maybe on the edge around where the
metal<00:03:16.230> gets<00:03:16.519> banged<00:03:18.439> and<00:03:19.439> you'll<00:03:19.799> get<00:03:20.010> what

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
metal gets banged and you'll get what

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.740 
metal gets banged and you'll get what
looks<00:03:20.489> like<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.269> can<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:21.599> this<00:03:22.430> here's<00:03:23.430> a

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
looks like if you can see this here's a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.819 
looks like if you can see this here's a
brand-new<00:03:24.750> motor<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.680> here<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.579> ground

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
brand-new motor and here is a ground

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.050 
brand-new motor and here is a ground
motor<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:29.280> see<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.579> little<00:03:29.760> line<00:03:30.030> right

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
motor you see that little line right

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.559 
motor you see that little line right
across<00:03:30.659> there<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:32.489> along<00:03:33.239> that

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
across there and then along that

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.800 
across there and then along that
backside<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.879> takes<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.299> down<00:03:36.419> just

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
backside there and it takes it down just

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.099 
backside there and it takes it down just
enough<00:03:38.359> what<00:03:39.359> we'll<00:03:39.480> do<00:03:39.629> is<00:03:39.810> we'll<00:03:39.900> take<00:03:39.959> a

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
enough what we'll do is we'll take a

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.899 
enough what we'll do is we'll take a
look<00:03:40.319> here<00:03:42.260> put<00:03:43.260> my<00:03:43.349> axle<00:03:43.829> back<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.280> put<00:03:44.700> my

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
look here put my axle back in put my

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.530 
look here put my axle back in put my
ground<00:03:45.419> motor<00:03:45.780> down<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.829> here<00:03:47.310> sit<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.329> in<00:03:48.419> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
ground motor down in here sit it in the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.920 
ground motor down in here sit it in the
pod<00:03:48.889> and<00:03:49.889> my<00:03:50.040> seam<00:03:50.430> axles<00:03:50.939> out<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.450> we'll<00:03:51.689> see

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
pod and my seam axles out and we'll see

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.009 
pod and my seam axles out and we'll see
what<00:03:52.139> happens<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.730> there<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.989> got

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
what happens and there you go you got

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.659 
what happens and there you go you got
enough<00:03:55.379> play<00:03:57.260> maybe<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.379> get<00:03:58.709> even<00:03:59.069> more<00:03:59.459> you

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
enough play maybe I get even more you

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.649 
enough play maybe I get even more you
can<00:03:59.760> probably<00:03:59.940> grind<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.269> little<00:04:00.299> more<00:04:00.510> but

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
can probably grind a little more but

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.000 
can probably grind a little more but
remember<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.139> don't<00:04:01.169> look<00:04:01.319> at<00:04:01.409> these<00:04:01.500> two<00:04:01.739> hot

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
remember you don't look at these two hot

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
remember you don't look at these two hot
if<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.280> didn't<00:04:02.459> too<00:04:02.549> hot<00:04:02.729> you're<00:04:02.849> going<00:04:02.970> to

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
if you didn't too hot you're going to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.199 
if you didn't too hot you're going to
ruin<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.329> magnet<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.979> motor<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.790> just

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
ruin the magnet in the motor so just

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.899 
ruin the magnet in the motor so just
enough<00:04:06.449> to<00:04:06.569> take<00:04:06.750> off<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:08.010> little<00:04:08.310> lip<00:04:08.669> right

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
enough to take off that little lip right

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.979 
enough to take off that little lip right
there<00:04:09.470> on<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.949> corner<00:04:11.479> should<00:04:12.479> be<00:04:12.659> enough

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
there on that corner should be enough

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.140 
there on that corner should be enough
and<00:04:13.349> if<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.620> look<00:04:13.829> closely<00:04:14.099> at<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.430> you'll<00:04:14.970> see

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
and if you look closely at it you'll see

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.810 
and if you look closely at it you'll see
that<00:04:15.269> it's<00:04:15.449> got<00:04:15.510> dents<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.289> where<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.489> I

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
that it's got dents in it where the I

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.460 
that it's got dents in it where the I
guess<00:04:18.269> when<00:04:18.419> they<00:04:18.510> form<00:04:18.810> they<00:04:19.199> push<00:04:19.440> it

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
guess when they form they push it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.000 
guess when they form they push it
through<00:04:19.859> it's<00:04:20.669> not<00:04:20.789> very<00:04:21.440> very<00:04:22.440> good<00:04:22.620> for

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
through it's not very very good for

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.540 
through it's not very very good for
these<00:04:23.159> tight<00:04:24.150> tolerances<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.960> pro<00:04:25.169> slot

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
these tight tolerances on the pro slot

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.320 
these tight tolerances on the pro slot
that's<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.669> only<00:04:26.849> 1i<00:04:27.210> for<00:04:27.419> today<00:04:29.210> thank<00:04:30.210> you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
that's the only 1i for today thank you

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.780 
that's the only 1i for today thank you
to<00:04:30.659> you
