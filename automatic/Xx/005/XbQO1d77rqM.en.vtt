00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
doing the tutorial on the monorail so

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.070 
doing the tutorial on the monorail so
this<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.240> video<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:13.019> uploaded<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.830> while<00:00:14.190> ago<00:00:14.519> and

quite a few people actually asked me to
do<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> tutorial<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.369> so<00:00:20.369> let's<00:00:21.000> get

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
do a tutorial on this so let's get

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.150 
do a tutorial on this so let's get
started<00:00:21.439> what<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.590> want<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> start<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.130> with

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
started what you want to start out with

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.839 
started what you want to start out with
is<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:24.140> normal<00:00:25.140> piston<00:00:25.590> facing<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.699> direction

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
is a normal piston facing the direction

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.599 
is a normal piston facing the direction
you<00:00:27.599> want<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> go<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> monorail<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
you want to go with the monorail and a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.880 
you want to go with the monorail and a
sticky<00:00:29.880> piston<00:00:30.090> facing<00:00:30.480> back<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.140> towards<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
sticky piston facing back in towards it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.389 
sticky piston facing back in towards it
like<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.140> normal<00:00:34.140> block<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.070> front

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
like that a normal block right in front

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.869 
like that a normal block right in front
and<00:00:35.670> then<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:36.090> power<00:00:36.390> block<00:00:36.750> there<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.879> will

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and then your power block there I will

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.420 
and then your power block there I will
remove<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.360> power<00:00:39.570> block<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
remove the power block for now because I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.600 
remove the power block for now because I
don't<00:00:42.000> really<00:00:42.800> want<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.890> interfering<00:00:44.460> with

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
don't really want it interfering with

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.560 
don't really want it interfering with
anything<00:00:45.200> then<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.260> want<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:47.570> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
anything then you want to go out of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.750 
anything then you want to go out of
where<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.140> power<00:00:49.350> block<00:00:49.620> will<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
where the power block will be so this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.920 
where the power block will be so this
can<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.829> one<00:00:52.829> block<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.690> build

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
can be there one block up and then build

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
can be there one block up and then build
a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.230> platform<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:57.379> redstone<00:00:58.850> one

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
a little platform like this redstone one

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.200 
a little platform like this redstone one

on three tix of the line we place your
power<00:01:08.549> block<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.439> you'll<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.920> already

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
power block now you'll see that already

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
power block now you'll see that already
skips<00:01:11.909> two<00:01:12.390> blocks<00:01:12.750> ahead<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.420> then<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.869> last

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
skips two blocks ahead and then one last

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.890 
skips two blocks ahead and then one last
thing<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.470> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> module<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
thing we want to do with this module is

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.999 
thing we want to do with this module is
have<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.619> pulse<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.020> let's<00:01:22.320> reset<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
have that pulse back so let's reset it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.050 
have that pulse back so let's reset it
real<00:01:23.220> quick<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.180> normal<00:01:25.049> pissing<00:01:25.380> their

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
real quick so normal pissing their

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.789 
real quick so normal pissing their
normal<00:01:27.060> block<00:01:27.299> their<00:01:27.659> sticky<00:01:28.350> piston<00:01:28.650> facing

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
normal block their sticky piston facing

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.710 
normal block their sticky piston facing
in<00:01:29.130> towards<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> power<00:01:30.390> block

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
in towards it and then the power block

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.929 
in towards it and then the power block
will<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> won't<00:01:32.640> put<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
will be right there but I won't put that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.210 
will be right there but I won't put that
in<00:01:33.060> yet<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> want<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
in yet so what you want to do is have a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.410 
in yet so what you want to do is have a
torch<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:37.220> another<00:01:38.220> torch<00:01:38.640> then

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
torch there go up another torch then

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.249 
torch there go up another torch then
over<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> side<00:01:40.259> repeater<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.220> four<00:01:41.490> tix

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
over to the side repeater all four tix

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
over to the side repeater all four tix
block<00:01:43.259> their<00:01:43.530> slab<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> looks

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
block their slab there so that it looks

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.399 
block their slab there so that it looks
just<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.630> redstone

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
just like that and then your redstone

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
just like that and then your redstone
dust<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.329> place<00:01:51.570> power<00:01:51.869> block<00:01:53.270> there

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
dust then if you place power block there

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
dust then if you place power block there
goes<00:01:54.540> works<00:01:55.320> perfectly<00:01:55.860> fine<00:01:57.049> now<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.469> make

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
goes works perfectly fine now to make

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.569 
goes works perfectly fine now to make
this<00:01:59.689> go<00:02:00.689> further<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.799> stack<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.460> on

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
this go further you want to stack it on

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.620 
this go further you want to stack it on
the<00:02:02.909> other<00:02:03.119> side<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.820> means<00:02:06.119> we'll<00:02:06.360> take

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the other side so that means we'll take

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.850 
the other side so that means we'll take
our<00:02:06.750> power<00:02:07.020> from<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.979> time<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.440> like

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
our power from here this time go up like

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.900 
our power from here this time go up like
that<00:02:11.099> build<00:02:11.940> platform<00:02:12.680> one<00:02:13.680> tick<00:02:13.950> for<00:02:14.580> ticks

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
that build platform one tick for ticks

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.930 
that build platform one tick for ticks

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
redstone dust when we place a repeater

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.270 
redstone dust when we place a repeater
hair<00:02:29.250> should<00:02:29.790> skip<00:02:30.150> ahead<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:31.069> blocks<00:02:32.069> again

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
hair should skip ahead to blocks again

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.600 
hair should skip ahead to blocks again
