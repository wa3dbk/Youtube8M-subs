00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
the hairs on an eyebrows look out of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.630 
the hairs on an eyebrows look out of
focus<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.350> then<00:03:13.560> once<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.950> get<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.340> together

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
focus and then once you get in together

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.430 
focus and then once you get in together
and<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.330> right<00:03:15.540> thought<00:03:15.870> they<00:03:16.020> look<00:03:16.260> like

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and the right thought they look like

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.010 
and the right thought they look like
they<00:03:17.130> know<00:03:17.790> not<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.180> fuzzy<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.750> they're<00:03:18.870> in

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
they know not it's fuzzy and they're in

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.090 
they know not it's fuzzy and they're in
better<00:03:19.680> focus<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> let's<00:03:22.620> go<00:03:22.740> ahead<00:03:22.860> and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
better focus so let's go ahead and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.089 
better focus so let's go ahead and
double<00:03:23.490> check<00:03:24.410> what<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.560> looks<00:03:25.740> like

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.580 

that<00:03:29.670> looks<00:03:29.909> good<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.420> now<00:03:30.480> what<00:03:31.260> we're<00:03:31.439> going

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that looks good and now what we're going

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.170 
that looks good and now what we're going
to<00:03:31.680> do<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.769> can<00:03:34.859> see<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.129> moving<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:35.849> don't

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
to do so you can see it moving but don't

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.479 
to do so you can see it moving but don't
worry<00:03:36.299> about<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.659> you<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.290> go<00:03:37.709> ahead<00:03:38.370> and

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
worry about that you can go ahead and

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.780 
worry about that you can go ahead and
make<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.760> new<00:03:38.999> layer<00:03:39.209> mask<00:03:39.599> which<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:41.340> box

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
make a new layer mask which is the box

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.500 
make a new layer mask which is the box
with<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> white<00:03:42.329> circle<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:44.239> it's<00:03:45.239> going

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
with a white circle on it and it's going

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.740 
with a white circle on it and it's going
to<00:03:45.569> be<00:03:46.200> white<00:03:46.500> which<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:47.010> good<00:03:47.569> you're<00:03:48.569> going
