from what I have seen honestly like I

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.949 
from what I have seen honestly like I
said<00:03:04.130> if<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.760> like<00:03:04.970> harems<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.690> want<00:03:05.870> to

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
said if you like harems and you want to

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.180 
said if you like harems and you want to
watch<00:03:06.080> a<00:03:06.200> harem<00:03:06.500> you'll<00:03:06.650> definitely<00:03:07.070> like

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
watch a harem you'll definitely like

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.380 
watch a harem you'll definitely like
this<00:03:07.400> but<00:03:07.610> if<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.790> want<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.000> watch<00:03:08.090> something

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
this but if you want to watch something

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.970 
this but if you want to watch something
new<00:03:08.660> that's<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> standard<00:03:09.440> copy<00:03:09.770> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
new that's not the standard copy and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.710 
new that's not the standard copy and
paste<00:03:10.190> arrow<00:03:10.520> most<00:03:10.850> likely<00:03:11.209> you<00:03:11.330> should<00:03:11.510> avoid

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
paste arrow most likely you should avoid

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.810 
paste arrow most likely you should avoid
this<00:03:11.959> series<00:03:12.320> because<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.980> feels<00:03:13.459> pretty<00:03:13.700> much

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
this series because it feels pretty much
