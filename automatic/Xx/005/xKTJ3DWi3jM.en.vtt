00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
don't think so I think the this is the
high-res<00:01:37.140> named<00:01:37.350> totals<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.909> we're

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
high-res named totals here but we're

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.810 
high-res named totals here but we're
looking<00:01:39.720> at<00:01:39.900> some<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.500> very<00:01:40.829> high<00:01:41.130> ratios<00:01:41.610> as

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
looking at some very very high ratios as

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.770 
looking at some very very high ratios as
you<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.119> into<00:01:42.590> say<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.829> area<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.369> here

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
you get into say this area right here

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
you get into say this area right here
especially<00:01:45.780> north<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.409> i-70<00:01:46.860> 6th<00:01:47.159> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
especially north of i-70 6th and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.510 
especially north of i-70 6th and
northwest<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.270> i-95<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:49.649> areas<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.340> will

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
northwest of i-95 these areas here will

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.510 
northwest of i-95 these areas here will
be<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.000> 15<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.810> 20<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.380> 1<00:01:52.560> ratio<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.310> these

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
be in a 15 to 20 to 1 ratio so these

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.209 
be in a 15 to 20 to 1 ratio so these
amounts<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.299> put<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> map<00:01:54.869> here

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
amounts that are put on the map here

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.530 
amounts that are put on the map here
that<00:01:56.219> look<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.640> they're<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.390> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that look like they're at it's not that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.300 
that look like they're at it's not that
big<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.810> deal<00:01:57.960> we'll<00:01:58.170> wait<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> minute<00:01:58.500> they

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
big of a deal we'll wait a minute they

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.120 
big of a deal we'll wait a minute they
are<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.600> actually<00:02:01.130> multiply

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
are because you can actually multiply

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.560 
are because you can actually multiply
these<00:02:02.310> numbers<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.820> by<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.390> half

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
these numbers here by one and a half

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.289 
these numbers here by one and a half
maybe<00:02:04.290> even<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:04.860> much<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.040> two<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.790> some<00:02:06.030> cases

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
maybe even as much as two in some cases

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.479 
maybe even as much as two in some cases
so<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.320> double<00:02:07.680> these<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.069> some<00:02:08.250> cases

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so you can double these in some cases

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.609 
so you can double these in some cases
and<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.940> could<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:09.929> scary<00:02:10.349> if<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
and that could be pretty scary if that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.650 
and that could be pretty scary if that
ends<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.009> being<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> case<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:12.330> National

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
ends up being the case the National

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.280 
ends up being the case the National
Weather<00:02:12.750> Service<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
Weather Service and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.190 
Weather Service and
Holley<00:02:13.590> has<00:02:13.739> put<00:02:14.099> out<00:02:14.189> a<00:02:14.219> statement<00:02:14.310> that

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
Holley has put out a statement that

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.660 
Holley has put out a statement that
ratios<00:02:16.200> across<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.739> entire<00:02:17.099> area<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.609> is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
ratios across this entire area this is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.479 
ratios across this entire area this is
their<00:02:17.849> coverage<00:02:18.120> area<00:02:18.420> down<00:02:18.599> here<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:19.489> they

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
their coverage area down here and they

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.670 
their coverage area down here and they
said<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.420> they<00:02:21.900> put<00:02:22.049> out<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> statement<00:02:22.379> that

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
said that they put out a statement that

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.589 
said that they put out a statement that
the<00:02:22.799> ratios<00:02:23.129> could<00:02:23.310> be<00:02:23.430> somewhere<00:02:23.790> between<00:02:23.939> 20

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
the ratios could be somewhere between 20

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.809 
the ratios could be somewhere between 20
and<00:02:24.629> 30<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.500> 1<00:02:25.709> at<00:02:25.859> times<00:02:26.099> overnight<00:02:26.489> on

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
and 30 to 1 at times overnight on

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.849 
and 30 to 1 at times overnight on
Thursday<00:02:27.209> night<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:28.319> we're<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.680> with<00:02:28.829> a

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
Thursday night but we're going with a

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.369 
Thursday night but we're going with a
general<00:02:29.390> conservative<00:02:30.390> probably<00:02:30.989> good<00:02:31.349> that

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
general conservative probably good that

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.479 
general conservative probably good that
they<00:02:31.560> do<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.859> is<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.129> they<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.459> that

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
they do that is that they have that

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.940 
they do that is that they have that
conservative<00:02:33.390> approach<00:02:33.689> of<00:02:33.870> 15<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.349> 1<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.739> you

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
conservative approach of 15 to 1 but you

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.759 
conservative approach of 15 to 1 but you
could<00:02:35.489> Bank<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.790> 15<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.299> 20<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.750> 1<00:02:36.959> up<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.620> these

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
could Bank on 15 to 20 to 1 up in these

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:38.990 
could Bank on 15 to 20 to 1 up in these
areas<00:02:38.099> here<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.430> these<00:02:38.519> numbers<00:02:38.849> are<00:02:38.970> very

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
areas here so these numbers are very

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.720 
areas here so these numbers are very
underdone<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:41.069> even<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.370> throw<00:02:41.549> in<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
underdone so even if you throw in the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.050 
underdone so even if you throw in the
names<00:02:41.970> bias<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.629> over<00:02:43.409> it<00:02:43.500> over<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.889> the<00:02:44.060> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
names bias to over it over do the the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.809 
names bias to over it over do the the
total<00:02:45.389> precipitation<00:02:45.720> amounts<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.950> think

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
total precipitation amounts here I think

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.220 
total precipitation amounts here I think
that<00:02:47.909> at<00:02:48.000> least<00:02:48.030> balance<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.689> out<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.049> then

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that at least balance is out and then

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.479 
that at least balance is out and then
some<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.769> you're<00:02:49.889> probably<00:02:49.980> getting<00:02:50.250> higher

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
some so you're probably getting higher

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.920 
some so you're probably getting higher
totals<00:02:50.909> that<00:02:51.000> what's<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.480> kitty<00:02:51.659> here<00:02:51.840> on

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
totals that what's in the kitty here on

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.330 
totals that what's in the kitty here on
the<00:02:52.019> map<00:02:52.169> here<00:02:52.409> now<00:02:52.859> we're<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.099> go<00:02:53.189> to<00:02:53.250> the

morning our GM totals this is that same

again<00:03:38.720> very<00:03:39.720> aggressive<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.379> these<00:03:40.470> totals

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
again very aggressive of these totals

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.009 
again very aggressive of these totals
and<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.609> area<00:03:42.000> right<00:03:42.180> up<00:03:42.329> in<00:03:42.449> here<00:03:42.659> is<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
15 to 20 while it probably extends up

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.119 
15 to 20 while it probably extends up
further<00:03:46.229> than<00:03:46.409> this<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.889> just<00:03:47.040> our

further than this but this is just our

ratios<00:03:49.739> here<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.069> if<00:03:50.159> it's<00:03:50.310> putting<00:03:50.489> out

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
ratios here so if it's putting out

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.240 
ratios here so if it's putting out

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
second call at 4:00 p.m. I can see this

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.170 
second call at 4:00 p.m. I can see this
area<00:04:02.129> being<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.359> higher<00:04:04.069> outperforming<00:04:05.180> some

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
totals here but we're not really to go

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.949

just<00:04:08.220> ready<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.669> go<00:04:08.790> all<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.299> those<00:04:09.479> really

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
just ready to go all in on those really

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.659 
just ready to go all in on those really
high<00:04:10.139> aggressive<00:04:10.560> totals<00:04:10.859> over<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.099> foot<00:04:11.459> yet

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
high aggressive totals over a foot yet

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.390 
high aggressive totals over a foot yet
but<00:04:11.939> that<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.209> possible<00:04:13.009> that<00:04:14.009> some<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.340> these

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
but that is possible that some of these

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.149 
but that is possible that some of these
areas<00:04:14.609> get<00:04:14.819> over<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> foot<00:04:15.449> here<00:04:15.659> if<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.949> is

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
areas get over a foot here if this is

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.800 
areas get over a foot here if this is
correct<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.759> then<00:04:17.940> some<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.449> other<00:04:18.479> short

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.180 
correct and then some of the other short
range<00:04:18.989> models<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.440> do<00:04:19.500> want<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.769> take<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:19.949> look<00:04:20.130> at

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
range models I do want to take a look at

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.790 
range models I do want to take a look at
the<00:04:20.250> GFS<00:04:20.669> though<00:04:20.900> GFS<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:21.930> showing<00:04:22.349> less<00:04:22.500> snow

amounts now this this here again same
deal<00:04:24.599> with<00:04:24.870> ratios<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:25.620> even<00:04:26.219> though<00:04:26.279> it's

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
deal with ratios so even though it's

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.990 
deal with ratios so even though it's
showing<00:04:26.610> less<00:04:26.789> you

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
showing less you

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.820 
showing less you
this<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.240> only<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.630> 2<00:04:27.780> 2<00:04:27.900> 4<00:04:28.080> 2<00:04:28.260> 2<00:04:28.380> 5<00:04:28.530> type

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.110 
this is only like a 2 2 4 2 2 5 type
thing<00:04:29.040> here<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.460> add<00:04:29.580> in<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.760> ratios

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.490 
thing here but you add in the ratios
you're<00:04:30.270> still<00:04:30.480> getting<00:04:30.570> above<00:04:30.900> 6<00:04:31.140> inches<00:04:31.350> in

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
you're still getting above 6 inches in

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.780 
you're still getting above 6 inches in
this<00:04:31.590> area<00:04:31.920> even<00:04:32.130> if<00:04:33.170> you<00:04:34.170> know<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.790> gfs

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
this area even if you know that the gfs

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.180 
this area even if you know that the gfs
pans<00:04:36.090> out<00:04:36.330> however<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:37.200> don't<00:04:37.740> think<00:04:37.950> it<00:04:38.040> will

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
pans out however I don't think it will

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.550 
pans out however I don't think it will
and<00:04:38.520> that's<00:04:38.670> why<00:04:38.960> this<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.140> reason<00:04:40.440> why

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
and that's why this is the reason why

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.050 
and that's why this is the reason why
this<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.100> upper<00:04:41.280> level<00:04:41.430> pattern<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:42.000> is

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
this is the upper level pattern this is

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.720 
this is the upper level pattern this is
the<00:04:42.210> 500<00:04:42.840> millibar<00:04:43.170> relative<00:04:43.950> vorticity<00:04:44.130> this

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
the 500 millibar relative vorticity this

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.680 
the 500 millibar relative vorticity this
is<00:04:44.850> what's<00:04:44.970> going<00:04:45.120> on<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> upper<00:04:45.570> atmosphere

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
is what's going on the upper atmosphere

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.220 
is what's going on the upper atmosphere
look<00:04:46.680> at<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.860> trough<00:04:47.160> here<00:04:47.510> it's<00:04:48.510> big<00:04:48.750> digging

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
look at the trough here it's big digging

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.440 
look at the trough here it's big digging
of<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.380> trough<00:04:49.650> here<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.820> would<00:04:50.970> indicate<00:04:51.090> to

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
of a trough here this would indicate to

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.910 
of a trough here this would indicate to
me<00:04:51.570> that<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.900> low<00:04:52.050> would<00:04:52.200> be<00:04:52.290> stronger<00:04:52.770> and

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
me that the low would be stronger and

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.680 
me that the low would be stronger and
closer<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.340> coast<00:04:53.580> somewhere<00:04:53.850> out<00:04:54.090> here<00:04:54.120> not

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
closer the coast somewhere out here not

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.750 
closer the coast somewhere out here not
further<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.350> not<00:04:55.530> elongated<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.340> sitting<00:04:56.640> out

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
further a not elongated and sitting out

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.940 
further a not elongated and sitting out
here<00:04:56.900> that's<00:04:57.900> where<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.080> GFS<00:04:58.410> at<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.620> surface

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
here that's where the GFS at the surface

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.170 
here that's where the GFS at the surface
is<00:04:59.100> showing<00:04:59.370> last<00:04:59.550> couple<00:04:59.850> days<00:04:59.970> has<00:05:00.150> been

above<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.490> surface<00:05:05.640> is<00:05:05.970> what<00:05:06.210> drives

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
above the surface is what drives

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.990 
above the surface is what drives
everything<00:05:07.230> at<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.650> surface<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.580> because<00:05:08.880> of

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
everything at the surface so because of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.940 
everything at the surface so because of
this<00:05:09.090> big<00:05:09.270> trough<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:09.840> I'm<00:05:10.470> expecting<00:05:10.890> the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
this big trough here I'm expecting the

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.610 
this big trough here I'm expecting the
GFS<00:05:11.340> should<00:05:11.550> be<00:05:11.700> more<00:05:11.910> in<00:05:12.000> line<00:05:12.240> with<00:05:12.270> if<00:05:13.230> it

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
GFS should be more in line with if it

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.200 
GFS should be more in line with if it

was accurately depicted on the surface
maps<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.410> would<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.980> much<00:05:17.580> stronger

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
maps that would be a much stronger

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.220

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
models that ran today so going back to

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.720 
models that ran today so going back to
we<00:05:22.050> go<00:05:22.200> back<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.620> our<00:05:22.770> GM<00:05:23.130> real<00:05:23.340> quick<00:05:23.520> I

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
we go back to the our GM real quick I

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.090 
we go back to the our GM real quick I
don't<00:05:24.060> think<00:05:24.540> this<00:05:24.660> is<00:05:24.840> far-fetched<00:05:25.080> at<00:05:25.440> all

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
don't think this is far-fetched at all

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.159 
don't think this is far-fetched at all
and<00:05:26.760> there<00:05:26.940> is<00:05:27.060> an<00:05:27.210> opportunity<00:05:27.450> for<00:05:27.960> this<00:05:28.110> to

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
and there is an opportunity for this to

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.800 
and there is an opportunity for this to
increase<00:05:28.650> because<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.310> ratios<00:05:29.730> so<00:05:30.360> we'll

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
increase because of the ratios so we'll

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.080 
increase because of the ratios so we'll
have<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:31.020> first<00:05:31.260> our<00:05:31.740> second<00:05:32.250> call<00:05:32.430> map<00:05:32.640> out<00:05:32.850> at

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
have a first our second call map out at

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.020 
have a first our second call map out at
4:00<00:05:33.450> 4:00<00:05:34.260> p.m.<00:05:34.380> this<00:05:34.590> afternoon<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.340> until
