little experiment here I want to share

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.040 
little experiment here I want to share
with<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:06.029> guys<00:00:07.309> for<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:08.490> layout<00:00:08.940> I've<00:00:09.570> heard<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
with you guys for my layout I've heard a

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.839 
with you guys for my layout I've heard a
lot<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.849> cork<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.120> foam<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.679> which<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.759> is

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
lot about cork and foam and which one is

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.379 
lot about cork and foam and which one is
better

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
better

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.450 
better
most<00:00:16.170> people<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.560> their<00:00:16.710> own<00:00:16.859> opinions<00:00:17.310> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
most people have their own opinions of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.320 
most people have their own opinions of
it<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> thought<00:00:18.449> I'd<00:00:18.600> build<00:00:18.840> two<00:00:19.050> little

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
it so I thought I'd build two little

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
it so I thought I'd build two little
display<00:00:21.330> stands<00:00:21.859> one<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.010> cork<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.609> one

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
display stands one with cork and one

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.179 
display stands one with cork and one
with<00:00:23.880> foam<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.470> myself<00:00:25.619> what

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
with foam and just see for myself what

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.099 
with foam and just see for myself what
the<00:00:26.220> difference<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the difference is so this one here I

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.750 
the difference is so this one here I
balanced<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> already<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.130> should've<00:00:29.429> left<00:00:29.609> it

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
balanced it already I should've left it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.690 
balanced it already I should've left it
but<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> little<00:00:30.470> overzealous<00:00:31.700> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
but I got a little overzealous and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.569 
but I got a little overzealous and
balanced<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.809> cork<00:00:34.579> can't

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
balanced that one this one is cork can't

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.200 
balanced that one this one is cork can't
really<00:00:35.820> tell<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.350> cork<00:00:37.739> trust<00:00:38.100> me<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
really tell but it is cork trust me and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.560 
really tell but it is cork trust me and
this<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.719> glued<00:00:40.649> down<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.250> foam

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
this one I just glued down and it's foam

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.610 
this one I just glued down and it's foam
so<00:00:42.570> I'm<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.750> balance<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.500> well

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
so I'm gonna balance this one as well

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.010 
so I'm gonna balance this one as well
but<00:00:43.890> I'd<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:44.969> video<00:00:45.300> before<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> just

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:47.190 

quark<00:01:36.090> again

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.330 

so<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.259> don't<00:01:48.409> know<00:01:48.469> how<00:01:48.590> good<00:01:48.799> that's<00:01:49.070> picking

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
so I don't know how good that's picking

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.410 
so I don't know how good that's picking
up<00:01:49.549> on<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:50.210> camera<00:01:50.659> but<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:52.310> my<00:01:52.460> ears<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.119> cork

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
up on the camera but to my ears the cork

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.139 
up on the camera but to my ears the cork
is<00:01:53.630> maybe<00:01:54.350> just<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.679> little<00:01:54.710> bit<00:01:55.009> louder<00:01:55.189> kind

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
is maybe just a little bit louder kind

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.910 
is maybe just a little bit louder kind
of<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.329> height<00:01:56.509> more<00:01:56.810> high-pitched<00:01:57.289> sound<00:01:57.649> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
of a height more high-pitched sound and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.980 
of a height more high-pitched sound and
the<00:01:58.729> foam<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.210> just<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.479> little<00:01:59.719> bit<00:01:59.810> more

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
the foam is just a little bit more

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.949 
the foam is just a little bit more
muffled<00:02:00.549> so<00:02:01.549> as<00:02:01.610> far<00:02:01.759> as<00:02:01.819> sound<00:02:02.090> goes<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.750> my

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
muffled so as far as sound goes in my

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.399 
muffled so as far as sound goes in my
opinion<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:05.119> foam<00:02:05.329> roller<00:02:05.869> bed<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.229> a

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
opinion the the foam roller bed is a

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.219 
opinion the the foam roller bed is a
little<00:02:06.679> bit<00:02:06.799> quieter<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:07.969> it<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.209> like<00:02:09.019> they

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
little bit quieter so it is like they

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.729 
little bit quieter so it is like they
say<00:02:09.819> now<00:02:10.819> as<00:02:10.940> far<00:02:11.090> as<00:02:11.349> straightness<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.560> stuff

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
say now as far as straightness and stuff

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.199 
say now as far as straightness and stuff
I've<00:02:12.890> seen<00:02:12.920> some<00:02:13.310> guys<00:02:13.489> talking<00:02:13.910> about<00:02:13.940> on

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
pretty solid but in the prototype I mean

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.550 
pretty solid but in the prototype I mean
they're<00:02:31.700> not<00:02:31.819> rock-solid<00:02:32.390> either<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.410> there

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
they're not rock-solid either so there

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.589 
they're not rock-solid either so there
is<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:34.220> does<00:02:34.400> give<00:02:34.610> quite<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> bit<00:02:35.150> if<00:02:35.239> you

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
is it does give quite a bit if you

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.620 
is it does give quite a bit if you
I<00:02:35.630> mean<00:02:35.989> I'm<00:02:36.079> pushing<00:02:36.349> on<00:02:36.410> pretty<00:02:36.709> hard<00:02:36.920> but

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
I mean I'm pushing on pretty hard but

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.479 
I mean I'm pushing on pretty hard but
the<00:02:38.630> weight<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.349> weight<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:40.099> choke

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
the weight of the weight of a choke

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.509 
the weight of the weight of a choke
scale<00:02:40.760> train<00:02:41.209> isn't<00:02:41.480> gonna<00:02:41.750> move<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.769> and

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
scale train isn't gonna move that and

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.970 
scale train isn't gonna move that and
then<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:43.940> push<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.959> cork<00:02:45.680> here

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
then if you push on the on the cork here

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.280 
then if you push on the on the cork here
but<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.030> rock-solid

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
but it is rock-solid

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.970 
but it is rock-solid
like<00:02:48.769> there<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.700> no<00:02:49.880> give<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.299> all<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:50.980> it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
like there is no give it all there it's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.400 
like there is no give it all there it's
permanent

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
permanent

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.379 
permanent
so<00:02:55.180> foam<00:02:56.180> has<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> little<00:02:56.780> bit<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.019> give<00:02:58.389> you

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
so foam has a little bit of give you

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.030 
so foam has a little bit of give you
press<00:02:59.600> on<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.840> bounces<00:03:00.410> right<00:03:00.440> back<00:03:00.620> though

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
press on it bounces right back though

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.199 
press on it bounces right back though
it's<00:03:01.220> pretty<00:03:01.340> elastic<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.170> cork<00:03:03.470> is

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
it's pretty elastic and the the cork is

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.470 
it's pretty elastic and the the cork is
nothing<00:03:05.209> no<00:03:05.660> give<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.049> all<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:08.150> other<00:03:08.329> than

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
nothing no give it all and other than

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.150 
nothing no give it all and other than
that<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:09.139> mean<00:03:09.410> they're<00:03:09.739> both<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:10.130> same

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
that I mean they're both the same

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.819 
that I mean they're both the same
dimensions<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.180> stuff<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:12.079> don't<00:03:12.590> really

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
dimensions and stuff so I don't really

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.099 
dimensions and stuff so I don't really
see<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.069> difference<00:03:13.519> as<00:03:14.269> far<00:03:14.389> as<00:03:14.569> price<00:03:14.900> is

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
see a difference as far as price is

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.900 
see a difference as far as price is
concerned<00:03:15.139> I'm<00:03:15.739> not<00:03:15.920> really<00:03:16.099> sure<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.430> didn't<00:03:16.790> I

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
concerned I'm not really sure I didn't I

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.120 
concerned I'm not really sure I didn't I
only<00:03:17.180> bought<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.720> foam<00:03:18.470> I'm<00:03:18.680> gonna<00:03:18.889> do<00:03:18.980> my

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
only bought the foam I'm gonna do my

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.449 
only bought the foam I'm gonna do my
layout<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.730> foam<00:03:19.940> because<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:21.109> as<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.160> can<00:03:22.280> see

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
layout and foam because I as you can see

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.330 
layout and foam because I as you can see
there<00:03:22.609> I<00:03:22.639> already<00:03:23.000> got<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.450> whole<00:03:23.660> bunch<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.829> I

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
there I already got a whole bunch but I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.789 
there I already got a whole bunch but I
mean<00:03:25.849> as<00:03:25.970> far<00:03:26.120> as<00:03:26.180> if<00:03:26.750> it's<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.200> lot<00:03:27.440> more<00:03:27.620> money

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
mean as far as if it's a lot more money

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.379 
mean as far as if it's a lot more money
maybe<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.280> is<00:03:28.370> better<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.669> go<00:03:28.819> with<00:03:28.849> cork<00:03:29.209> I

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
maybe it is better to go with cork I

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.539 
maybe it is better to go with cork I
don't<00:03:29.569> know<00:03:29.660> like<00:03:30.650> huh<00:03:30.859> I<00:03:31.099> don't<00:03:31.370> know<00:03:31.459> if

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
don't know like huh I don't know if

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.229 
don't know like huh I don't know if
you're<00:03:31.669> gonna<00:03:31.790> notice<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.389> little<00:03:32.660> bit<00:03:32.810> uh

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
you're gonna notice that a little bit uh

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.819 
you're gonna notice that a little bit uh
it<00:03:35.239> could<00:03:35.480> be<00:03:35.630> two<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.139> got<00:03:36.290> 30<00:03:36.500> cars

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
it could be two and you got 30 cars

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.319 
it could be two and you got 30 cars
hooked<00:03:37.130> up<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.549> couple<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.819> units<00:03:38.150> that

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
hooked up in a couple of units that

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.890 
hooked up in a couple of units that
maybe<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.870> larger<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:41.060> yeah<00:03:41.209> that's<00:03:41.599> my

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
maybe it is larger but so yeah that's my

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.809 
maybe it is larger but so yeah that's my
that's<00:03:42.709> my<00:03:42.889> spiel<00:03:43.340> on<00:03:43.370> cork<00:03:44.269> versus<00:03:44.989> foam<00:03:45.819> hope

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
that's my spiel on cork versus foam hope

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.359 
that's my spiel on cork versus foam hope
you<00:03:46.940> guys<00:03:47.060> enjoyed
