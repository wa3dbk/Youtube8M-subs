Lightyear<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.309> looks<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.579> bit

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
Lightyear it just looks a little bit

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880 
Lightyear it just looks a little bit
more<00:00:45.030> effective<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> base<00:00:46.500> it's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
more effective and if it's a base it's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250 
more effective and if it's a base it's
actually<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> waste<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.879> icing<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.930> don't

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
actually a waste of icing so you don't

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually a waste of icing so you don't
necessarily<00:00:49.649> need<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.820> don't

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
necessarily need to do it that you don't

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
necessarily need to do it that you don't
want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:52.110> once<00:00:52.590> again<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

want to but once again it's all for the
look<00:00:53.730> from<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> aesthetic<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.559> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
revisited this and cut it a little bit

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460 
revisited this and cut it a little bit
straighter<00:01:17.240> because<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.630> learning<00:01:18.900> too<00:01:19.229> as

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
straighter because I'm learning too as

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.210 
straighter because I'm learning too as
we<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.360> this<00:01:21.360> cake<00:01:21.869> filling<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:23.009> some

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
we go this cake filling is actually some

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.940 
we go this cake filling is actually some
Philly<00:01:23.580> cheese<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.390> strawberry<00:01:24.810> jam<00:01:25.049> it's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
Philly cheese with strawberry jam it's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
Philly cheese with strawberry jam it's
really<00:01:26.280> nice<00:01:26.430> because<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.150> too<00:01:27.450> sweet

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
really nice because it's not too sweet

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.039 
really nice because it's not too sweet
and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.729> contrast<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> white

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and I think in contrast with the white

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.830 
and I think in contrast with the white
icing<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.520> provides<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.060> nice<00:01:33.299> young

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
icing it just provides a nice young

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.469 
icing it just provides a nice young
feeling<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.860> everyone<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.579> enjoy<00:01:35.610> unless

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
feeling that everyone can enjoy unless

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.020 
feeling that everyone can enjoy unless
you<00:01:36.570> don't<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.810> Philly<00:01:36.990> cheese<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.970> we

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you don't like Philly cheese now we

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.410 
you don't like Philly cheese now we

I've used for I would recommend five but
I've<00:01:46.439> only<00:01:46.619> used<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> four<00:01:47.159> layers<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.610> time

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
I've only used the four layers this time

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
I've only used the four layers this time

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.640 
paper I ripped out in front of the cake
itself<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.600> knew<00:03:43.810> how<00:03:44.020> beat<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.440> face

itself so I knew how beat the face
needed<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.190> be<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.610> didn't<00:03:46.180> want<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:46.390> make<00:03:46.540> it

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
needed to be I didn't want to make it

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.590 
needed to be I didn't want to make it
too<00:03:47.080> big<00:03:47.110> or<00:03:47.530> too<00:03:47.740> small<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:49.090> gave<00:03:49.330> me<00:03:49.390> the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
too big or too small so that gave me the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.290 
too big or too small so that gave me the
right<00:03:49.750> proportions<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.680> made<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> little<00:03:51.910> sort

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
right proportions I made a little sort

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.080 
right proportions I made a little sort
of<00:03:52.330> shark<00:03:52.660> fin<00:03:52.960> shaped<00:03:53.290> triangle<00:03:54.130> added<00:03:55.000> that

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
of shark fin shaped triangle added that

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.850 
of shark fin shaped triangle added that
to<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.330> front<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.780> addressed<00:03:56.410> all<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.590> noise

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
to the front and addressed all the noise

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.210 
to the front and addressed all the noise
I<00:03:58.230> think<00:03:59.230> it's<00:03:59.470> very<00:03:59.560> important<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.040> you

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
I think it's very important that you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.360 
I think it's very important that you
score<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.690> hold<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.530> not<00:04:03.040> add<00:04:03.220> as

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
score this to hold it on and not add as

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.190 
score this to hold it on and not add as
much<00:04:03.520> water<00:04:03.850> as<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.150> did<00:04:04.330> because<00:04:04.660> as<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:04.990> see

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
much water as I did because as you see

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.530 
much water as I did because as you see
here<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.920> started<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.460> drop<00:04:06.760> really<00:04:07.210> badly

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
here this started to drop really badly

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.990 
here this started to drop really badly
which<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.380> where<00:04:08.770> this<00:04:09.100> whole<00:04:09.160> cake<00:04:09.760> went

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
which is where this whole cake went

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.900 
which is where this whole cake went
downhill<00:04:10.240> I<00:04:10.690> had<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.470> constantly<00:04:12.310> push<00:04:12.760> it

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
downhill I had to constantly push it

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.790 
downhill I had to constantly push it
back<00:04:13.060> up<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.540> try<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.780> keep<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.200> shape<00:04:14.440> and

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
back up and try and keep the shape and

it<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.760> think<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:16.120> really<00:04:16.480> ruined<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
it just I think it really ruined the

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.849 
it just I think it really ruined the
look<00:04:17.140> of<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:18.970> kept<00:04:19.270> on<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:20.440> never<00:04:20.680> know

using<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:48.000> gel<00:05:48.480> food<00:05:49.290> coloring<00:05:49.880> I've<00:05:50.880> painted

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
using the gel food coloring I've painted

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.390 
using the gel food coloring I've painted
on<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.480> details<00:05:51.870> of<00:05:52.020> his<00:05:52.200> eyebrow<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:53.010> his

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
happy with it I am going to attempt it

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.100
