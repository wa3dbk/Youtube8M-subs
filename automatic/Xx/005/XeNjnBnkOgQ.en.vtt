00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
notice that those went with the more

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.819 
notice that those went with the more
minimalist<00:01:33.210> design<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.619> no

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and this is what helps with portability

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.020 
and this is what helps with portability
they're<00:01:39.659> very<00:01:40.140> small<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> compact<00:01:41.030> although

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
they're very small and compact although

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600 
they're very small and compact although
they<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.509> bend<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.259> headband<00:01:43.680> area<00:01:44.159> but

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
they don't bend in the headband area but

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399 
they don't bend in the headband area but
I<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.850> find<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.689> okay<00:01:46.110> since

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I actually find that that's okay since

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.770 
I actually find that that's okay since
it<00:01:46.560> does<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.310> flat<00:01:47.670> design<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it does have a very flat design and it

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.270 
it does have a very flat design and it
doesn't<00:01:49.049> take<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.200> much<00:01:49.350> space<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
doesn't take up much space when it is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.030 
doesn't take up much space when it is
flat<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.450> what's<00:01:51.750> also<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.470> great<00:01:52.799> about

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
flat but what's also really great about

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.670 
flat but what's also really great about
these<00:01:53.220> headphones<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> comfort<00:01:54.689> honestly

my<00:02:23.760> entire<00:02:24.120> thumb<00:02:24.540> inside<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.189> how

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
my entire thumb inside and that's how

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.369 
my entire thumb inside and that's how
your<00:02:26.549> ear<00:02:26.700> fits<00:02:26.969> inside<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.629> won't<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:28.049> any

your ear fits inside it won't have any
issues<00:02:28.950> touching<00:02:29.909> up<00:02:30.030> against<00:02:30.420> anything

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
issues touching up against anything

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.289 
issues touching up against anything
these<00:02:30.989> are<00:02:31.049> definitely<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.310> prime<00:02:32.670> example

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
these are definitely the prime example

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.259 
these are definitely the prime example
of<00:02:33.389> over<00:02:33.810> ear<00:02:34.049> headphones<00:02:34.079> and<00:02:34.920> now<00:02:35.909> to<00:02:35.969> go

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
of over ear headphones and now to go

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.240 
of over ear headphones and now to go
into<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.019> think<00:02:37.109> is<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.739> number<00:02:38.099> one

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
into what I think is the number one

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.190 
into what I think is the number one
feature<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.730> these<00:02:39.090> headphones<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.900> that's

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
feature of these headphones and that's

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.559 
feature of these headphones and that's
the<00:02:40.469> active<00:02:40.889> noise-cancelling<00:02:41.450> when<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
the active noise-cancelling when you

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.660 
the active noise-cancelling when you
turn<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.109> on<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.500> right<00:02:43.709> ear<00:02:43.920> cup<00:02:44.189> you'll

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
turn it on on the right ear cup you'll

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.399 
turn it on on the right ear cup you'll
notice<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.120> little<00:02:45.299> green<00:02:45.629> light<00:02:45.840> show<00:02:46.109> up<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
notice a little green light show up to

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.099 
notice a little green light show up to
indicate<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.549> noise<00:02:47.879> canceling<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.810> on

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
indicate that the noise canceling is on

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.649 
indicate that the noise canceling is on
and<00:02:49.439> what's<00:02:49.980> great<00:02:50.189> about<00:02:50.310> these<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.209> the

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
and what's great about these is that the

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.149 
and what's great about these is that the
active<00:02:52.079> noise-cancelling<00:02:52.379> you<00:02:52.799> won't<00:02:53.010> be

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
active noise-cancelling you won't be

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.039 
active noise-cancelling you won't be
able<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.340> hear<00:02:53.639> anything<00:02:53.879> at<00:02:54.510> all<00:02:54.810> that's

about<00:03:22.290> these<00:03:22.590> headphones<00:03:22.859> is<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.430> they<00:03:23.549> do

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
about these headphones is that they do

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.699 
about these headphones is that they do
need<00:03:24.030> batteries<00:03:24.479> in<00:03:24.629> order<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.989> operate<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
need batteries in order to operate and

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.830 
need batteries in order to operate and
I'm<00:03:26.370> really<00:03:26.639> not<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.909> fan<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.209> headphones<00:03:27.690> that

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
I'm really not a fan of headphones that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.659 
I'm really not a fan of headphones that
forced<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:28.440> use<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.769> battery<00:03:29.069> with<00:03:29.459> noise

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
forced you to use a battery with noise

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.390 
forced you to use a battery with noise
canceling<00:03:30.329> because<00:03:30.620> once<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.799> battery<00:03:32.099> dies

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
canceling because once the battery dies

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.939 
canceling because once the battery dies
you<00:03:32.790> no<00:03:32.909> longer<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.510> usable<00:03:34.079> headphones<00:03:34.620> and

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
you no longer have usable headphones and

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.759 
you no longer have usable headphones and
I'm<00:03:35.129> really<00:03:35.489> not<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.699> fan<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.680> taking<00:03:37.680> a

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
I'm really not a fan of that taking a

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.140 
I'm really not a fan of that taking a
look<00:03:37.919> at<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.159> cable<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.609> comes<00:03:38.879> with<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
look at the cable that comes with the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.610 
look at the cable that comes with the
headphones<00:03:39.510> you'll<00:03:39.750> notice<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.199> it<00:03:40.349> has<00:03:40.379> an

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
headphones you'll notice that it has an

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.890 
headphones you'll notice that it has an
output<00:03:40.859> level<00:03:41.250> switch<00:03:41.699> that<00:03:42.269> has<00:03:42.419> high<00:03:42.659> and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
output level switch that has high and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.740 
output level switch that has high and
low<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.489> one<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.699> cables<00:03:45.090> actually<00:03:45.540> has

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
low and one of the cables actually has

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.170 
low and one of the cables actually has
an<00:03:45.900> inline<00:03:46.319> remote<00:03:46.739> for<00:03:47.009> Apple<00:03:47.340> devices<00:03:47.669> and

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
an inline remote for Apple devices and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.240 
an inline remote for Apple devices and
play<00:03:48.419> and<00:03:48.569> pause<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:49.049> Android<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.709> there's

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
play and pause for Android and there's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.969 
play and pause for Android and there's
another<00:03:50.519> one<00:03:50.759> without<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.359> remote<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:52.079> you

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
another one without the remote and you

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.309 
another one without the remote and you
can<00:03:53.129> put<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.519> output<00:03:54.000> level<00:03:54.299> switch<00:03:54.599> right

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
can put that output level switch right

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.740 
can put that output level switch right
inside<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.829> ear<00:03:55.979> cup<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:57.120> pretty<00:03:57.599> much

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
inside the ear cup and it pretty much

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.780 
inside the ear cup and it pretty much
goes<00:03:57.989> away<00:03:58.379> it<00:03:58.620> kind<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:58.949> disappears<00:03:59.459> into<00:03:59.669> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
goes away it kind of disappears into the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.969 
goes away it kind of disappears into the
headphones<00:04:00.530> unfortunately<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.709> doesn't

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
headphones unfortunately this doesn't

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.920 
headphones unfortunately this doesn't
come<00:04:02.280> with<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.489> tangle<00:04:02.879> free<00:04:02.909> cable<00:04:03.509> so<00:04:03.689> yours

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
come with a tangle free cable so yours

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.599 
come with a tangle free cable so yours
may<00:04:04.169> end<00:04:04.379> up<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.799> this<00:04:05.009> if<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.340> aren't

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
may end up like this if you aren't

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.670 
may end up like this if you aren't
careful<00:04:05.849> but<00:04:06.659> I'm<00:04:06.750> very<00:04:06.959> happy<00:04:07.229> that<00:04:07.560> this

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
careful but I'm very happy that this

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.530 
careful but I'm very happy that this
comes<00:04:07.949> with<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.189> raised<00:04:08.489> input<00:04:09.030> for<00:04:09.209> headphone

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
comes with a raised input for headphone

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.509 
comes with a raised input for headphone
jacks<00:04:09.900> because<00:04:10.409> this<00:04:10.739> means<00:04:10.949> that<00:04:11.159> mobile

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
jacks because this means that mobile

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.939 
jacks because this means that mobile
devices<00:04:12.030> with<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.449> bulky<00:04:12.900> case<00:04:13.169> can<00:04:13.470> have<00:04:13.680> no

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
devices with a bulky case can have no

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.219 
devices with a bulky case can have no
trouble<00:04:14.340> here<00:04:14.579> when<00:04:14.790> using<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.509> now<00:04:16.079> of

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
trouble here when using it and now of

trouble here when using it and now of
course<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.620> talk<00:04:16.769> about<00:04:17.009> sound<00:04:17.280> quality<00:04:17.539> the

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
course to talk about sound quality the

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.640 
course to talk about sound quality the
sound<00:04:18.750> quality<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.199> these<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.500> actually

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
sound quality on these is actually

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.860 
sound quality on these is actually
pretty<00:04:20.130> nice<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.639> did<00:04:21.000> enjoy<00:04:21.150> listening<00:04:21.750> to

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
pretty nice I did enjoy listening to

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.110 
pretty nice I did enjoy listening to
these<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.289> did<00:04:22.919> notice<00:04:23.190> however<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
these I did notice however that the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.959 
these I did notice however that the
volume<00:04:24.930> wasn't<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.500> loud<00:04:25.800> even<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:26.729> put

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:26.969 
volume wasn't that loud even if I put

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:27.230 
volume wasn't that loud even if I put
the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.800 
the
output<00:04:27.630> switch<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.349> the<00:04:28.919> cable<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.550> high<00:04:29.910> so

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
output switch on the cable to high so

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.120 
output switch on the cable to high so
that<00:04:31.139> was<00:04:31.259> one<00:04:31.470> thing<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.680> was<00:04:31.860> really<00:04:32.099> a

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
that was one thing that was really a

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.589 
that was one thing that was really a
little<00:04:32.340> concerning<00:04:32.759> to<00:04:32.970> me<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:33.210> if<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.389> really

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
little concerning to me so if you really

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.809 
little concerning to me so if you really
like<00:04:33.810> loud<00:04:34.080> music<00:04:34.349> these<00:04:34.860> probably<00:04:35.370> won't<00:04:35.669> be

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
like loud music these probably won't be

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.180 
like loud music these probably won't be
the<00:04:35.940> best<00:04:35.970> bet<00:04:36.330> for<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.630> but<00:04:37.620> overall<00:04:37.889> with

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
the best bet for you but overall with

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.800 
the best bet for you but overall with
sound<00:04:38.400> quality<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:38.880> did<00:04:39.240> find<00:04:39.449> that<00:04:39.599> it<00:04:39.720> was

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
sound quality I did find that it was

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.320 
sound quality I did find that it was
very<00:04:40.080> very<00:04:40.500> clear<00:04:40.979> you<00:04:41.460> can<00:04:41.610> hear<00:04:41.819> instruments

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
very very clear you can hear instruments

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.080 
very very clear you can hear instruments
pretty<00:04:42.599> nicely<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.740> bass<00:04:43.979> wasn't<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.729> heavy

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
pretty nicely the bass wasn't that heavy

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.420 
pretty nicely the bass wasn't that heavy
although<00:04:45.660> if<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.020> like<00:04:46.199> a<00:04:46.440> flatter<00:04:46.889> sound

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
although if you like a flatter sound

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.180 
although if you like a flatter sound
meaning<00:04:48.060> if<00:04:48.449> you<00:04:48.660> don't<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.289> any<00:04:49.590> emphasis

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
meaning if you don't like any emphasis

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.059 
meaning if you don't like any emphasis
on<00:04:50.400> any<00:04:50.669> particular<00:04:51.240> part<00:04:51.479> of<00:04:51.599> sound<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:52.740> will

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
on any particular part of sound you will

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.159 
on any particular part of sound you will
find<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.759> bass<00:04:53.940> probably<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.660> little<00:04:54.990> more

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
find the bass probably a little more

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.710 
find the bass probably a little more
than<00:04:55.349> you<00:04:55.500> want<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.669> wasn't<00:04:57.030> enough<00:04:57.389> for<00:04:57.660> a

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
than you want but it wasn't enough for a

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.809 
than you want but it wasn't enough for a
bass<00:04:58.139> head<00:04:58.410> or<00:04:58.500> anything<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:58.919> myself<00:04:59.460> but

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
bass head or anything like myself but

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.120 
bass head or anything like myself but
the<00:05:00.000> sound<00:05:00.270> quality<00:05:00.389> is<00:05:00.780> very<00:05:00.990> clear<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.770> did

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
the sound quality is very clear I did

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.010 
the sound quality is very clear I did

definitely<00:05:04.289> one<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.979> clearest<00:05:05.580> sounding

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
definitely one of the clearest sounding

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.999 
definitely one of the clearest sounding
headphones<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.509> I've<00:05:06.659> tried<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.199> date<00:05:07.380> so

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
very good there I wouldn't have any

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.960 
very good there I wouldn't have any

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
me um when outside I did find myself

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.719 
me um when outside I did find myself
trying<00:06:19.289> to<00:06:19.500> pump<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.830> volume<00:06:19.949> of<00:06:20.250> even<00:06:20.520> louder

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
trying to pump the volume of even louder

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.480 
trying to pump the volume of even louder
than<00:06:20.969> 100%<00:06:21.479> I<00:06:21.870> just<00:06:21.900> couldn't<00:06:22.469> so<00:06:22.979> I'm<00:06:23.159> not<00:06:23.340> too

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
than 100% I just couldn't so I'm not too

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.240 
than 100% I just couldn't so I'm not too
happy<00:06:23.639> about<00:06:23.819> that<00:06:24.240> but<00:06:25.229> overall<00:06:25.680> it<00:06:25.919> did<00:06:26.099> have

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
happy about that but overall it did have

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.649 
happy about that but overall it did have
a<00:06:26.280> clear<00:06:26.490> sound<00:06:26.759> though<00:06:27.090> and<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.419> noise

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
a clear sound though and the noise

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.450 
a clear sound though and the noise
cancelling<00:06:28.199> is<00:06:28.380> what<00:06:28.680> you<00:06:28.800> would<00:06:28.889> expect<00:06:28.949> of

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
cancelling is what you would expect of

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.270 
cancelling is what you would expect of
it<00:06:29.610> I<00:06:29.900> didn't<00:06:30.900> pass<00:06:31.409> the<00:06:31.440> girlfriend<00:06:32.039> test

that well but I can say that in other

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.290 
that well but I can say that in other
situations<00:06:35.039> just<00:06:35.279> being<00:06:35.550> outside<00:06:35.729> it<00:06:36.120> did

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
overall very impressed by the noise

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.490 
overall very impressed by the noise
cancellation<00:06:43.640> here<00:06:44.000> and<00:06:44.260> that<00:06:45.260> about<00:06:45.440> wraps
