00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
note 3 which we thought was a pretty

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.690 
note 3 which we thought was a pretty
good<00:00:31.050> design<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.470> begin<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.520> see

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
good design to begin with you can see

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
good design to begin with you can see
here<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> metal<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.050> sides<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.860> also

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
here the metal on the sides and we also

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.590 
here the metal on the sides and we also
have<00:00:35.190> quite<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> bit<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> top<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.450> bottom

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
have quite a bit on the top and bottom

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600 
have quite a bit on the top and bottom
where<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> different<00:00:38.219> ports<00:00:38.489> are

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
where all of the different ports are

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
where all of the different ports are
going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> be<00:00:38.969> held<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.809> essentially<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
going to be held it is essentially the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.780 
going to be held it is essentially the
same<00:00:40.620> design<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.219> remember<00:00:41.520> from<00:00:41.670> before

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
same design as you remember from before

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.639 
same design as you remember from before
except<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.420> metal<00:00:42.690> frame<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.110> enhances

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
except this metal frame really enhances

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.380 
except this metal frame really enhances
the<00:00:43.800> feel<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> back<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.969> still<00:00:45.210> get

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the feel but on the back you still get

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
the feel but on the back you still get
that<00:00:45.420> faux<00:00:45.780> leather<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> textured

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:23.469 
comes to the note device but probably

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:24.899 
comes to the note device but probably
the<00:04:23.650> biggest<00:04:23.830> enhancement<00:04:24.370> here<00:04:24.520> has<00:04:24.700> been

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
the biggest enhancement here has been

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:25.930 
the biggest enhancement here has been
the<00:04:25.060> snap<00:04:25.330> mode<00:04:25.539> it<00:04:25.719> is

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
the snap mode it is

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.310 
the snap mode it is
addition<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.450> allows<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.870> snap<00:04:27.290> a

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
addition that allows you to snap a

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.320 
addition that allows you to snap a
picture<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.890> any<00:04:28.100> surface<00:04:28.760> i<00:04:28.850> has<00:04:28.970> let's<00:04:29.240> say

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
picture of any surface i has let's say

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.090 
picture of any surface i has let's say
handwriting<00:04:29.900> on<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.680> will<00:04:30.740> be<00:04:30.920> able<00:04:30.980> to

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
handwriting on it and it will be able to

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.560 
handwriting on it and it will be able to
recognize<00:04:31.460> what<00:04:31.760> is<00:04:31.850> handwriting<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.450> what

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
recognize what is handwriting and what

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.150 
recognize what is handwriting and what
can<00:04:32.720> be<00:04:32.750> used<00:04:32.990> as<00:04:33.110> images<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.770> I'm<00:04:33.860> doing<00:04:33.980> that

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
can be used as images and I'm doing that

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.280 
can be used as images and I'm doing that
exactly<00:04:34.310> here<00:04:34.760> with<00:04:34.970> my<00:04:35.090> notes<00:04:35.360> in<00:04:35.570> which<00:04:36.050> the

application I will be able to select the

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.130 
application I will be able to select the
entire<00:04:43.400> block<00:04:43.850> by<00:04:44.150> holding<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.690> button<00:04:44.900> down

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
entire block by holding the button down

with<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.500> S<00:04:45.650> Pen<00:04:45.920> and<00:04:46.190> then<00:04:46.400> dragging<00:04:46.850> down

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
with the S Pen and then dragging down

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.730 
with the S Pen and then dragging down
much<00:04:47.450> like<00:04:47.660> you<00:04:47.780> would<00:04:47.810> with<00:04:48.080> a<00:04:48.110> mouse<00:04:48.410> and

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
much like you would with a mouse and

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.500 
much like you would with a mouse and
then<00:04:49.160> from<00:04:49.370> there<00:04:49.580> I'll<00:04:49.700> be<00:04:49.820> able<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.120> take<00:04:50.330> all

then from there I'll be able to take all

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.790 
then from there I'll be able to take all
the<00:04:50.630> information<00:04:51.200> and<00:04:51.320> paste<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.770> somewhere

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
the information and paste it somewhere

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.370 
the information and paste it somewhere
else<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.970> also<00:04:53.150> editable<00:04:53.810> in<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.050> way<00:04:54.170> that

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
else it is also editable in the way that

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.200 
else it is also editable in the way that
you<00:04:54.530> are<00:04:54.560> able<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:55.100> edit<00:04:55.250> handwriting<00:04:56.060> and

you are able to edit handwriting and

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.060 
you are able to edit handwriting and
within<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:56.660> can<00:04:56.960> erase<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.560> writing<00:04:57.920> and

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
within that I can erase the writing and

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.460 
within that I can erase the writing and
add<00:04:58.370> more<00:04:58.640> to<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.630> selection<00:05:00.080> that

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
add more to it that selection that

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.170 
add more to it that selection that
you're<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:00.920> you<00:05:01.010> saw<00:05:01.190> already<00:05:01.400> with<00:05:01.940> the

mouse and you will be able to select a

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.730 
mouse and you will be able to select a
lot<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.690> different<00:05:08.960> elements<00:05:09.050> at<00:05:09.380> once<00:05:09.560> by

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
lot of different elements at once by

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.140 
lot of different elements at once by
holding<00:05:10.100> down<00:05:10.130> that<00:05:10.280> button<00:05:10.700> and<00:05:10.850> dragging

are<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.610> many<00:05:16.700> enhancements<00:05:17.030> across<00:05:17.540> the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
are so many enhancements across the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.180 
are so many enhancements across the
board<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.080> we<00:05:18.200> really<00:05:18.470> like<00:05:18.650> what<00:05:18.830> we<00:05:18.950> see

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
board and we really like what we see

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.130 
board and we really like what we see
that<00:05:19.670> even<00:05:19.850> this<00:05:20.120> video<00:05:20.450> that<00:05:20.630> I've<00:05:20.720> given<00:05:20.990> you

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
that even this video that I've given you

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.630 
that even this video that I've given you
it<00:05:21.560> doesn't<00:05:21.740> really<00:05:21.950> feel<00:05:22.040> like<00:05:22.190> it's<00:05:22.430> even

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
it doesn't really feel like it's even

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.190 
it doesn't really feel like it's even
scratching<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.060> surface<00:05:23.300> for<00:05:23.720> example<00:05:24.080> the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
scratching the surface for example the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.420 
scratching the surface for example the
heart<00:05:24.380> rate<00:05:24.470> monitor<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.010> back<00:05:25.160> can<00:05:25.340> now

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
heart rate monitor on the back can now

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.830 
heart rate monitor on the back can now
be<00:05:25.580> tapped<00:05:25.910> while<00:05:26.180> using<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.480> front-facing

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
be tapped while using the front-facing

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.930 
be tapped while using the front-facing
camera<00:05:27.290> to<00:05:27.410> easily<00:05:27.710> take<00:05:27.890> selfies<00:05:28.370> but<00:05:28.820> that's

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
camera to easily take selfies but that's

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.190 
camera to easily take selfies but that's
only<00:05:29.060> another<00:05:29.330> example<00:05:29.690> of<00:05:29.930> further

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
only another example of further

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.540 
only another example of further
enhancements<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:30.830> Samsung<00:05:31.280> has<00:05:31.400> been

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
enhancements that Samsung has been

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.010 
enhancements that Samsung has been
putting<00:05:31.790> into<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.060> note<00:05:32.210> line<00:05:32.450> and<00:05:32.690> in<00:05:32.810> this

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
putting into the note line and in this

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.750 
putting into the note line and in this
particular<00:05:33.230> version<00:05:33.800> we<00:05:34.130> do<00:05:34.280> feel<00:05:34.490> like<00:05:34.610> the

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
particular version we do feel like the

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.370 
particular version we do feel like the
note<00:05:34.910> line<00:05:35.120> has<00:05:35.300> matured<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.840> what<00:05:36.020> we<00:05:36.140> feel

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
note line has matured to what we feel

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.990 
note line has matured to what we feel
like<00:05:36.410> it<00:05:36.680> should<00:05:36.919> have<00:05:37.130> been<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.490> whole<00:05:37.730> time

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
like it should have been this whole time

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.420 
like it should have been this whole time

the metal frame around allows it have a

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.970 
the metal frame around allows it have a
very<00:05:41.000> great<00:05:41.270> feel<00:05:41.600> in<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.870> hand<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.560> software

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
very great feel in the hand the software

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.930 
very great feel in the hand the software
enhancements<00:05:43.070> especially<00:05:43.790> with
