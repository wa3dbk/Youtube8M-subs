 make a world free and the truth is that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 I'm glad it was with this 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.240
 game because far cry 3 for all 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.720
 you're going to like it because it's basically the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.840
 mechanics is the same the philosophy of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 game is the same but they have added 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 some things and it develops in the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.739
 himalayas as you all know 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.380
 Look at what sights look at what a sensation of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.629
 amplitude of grandeur which colors more 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.710
 pretty that is a very nice game of 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.930
 watch 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.969
 I'm going to put the game in situation 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.000
 start here in vana pour I have already done 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.649
 some missions he had forgotten to give 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
 to record and was doing the asshole 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.149
 talking the camera just a good time 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.159

 Who does this guy have to tell me but 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 Sometimes I wonder what it is worth to ask under 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.940
 the look of a goddess if her help is not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.940
 extends to the entire valley 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.040
 that will intervene when I have to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.320
 do it but if it was only given up 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.870

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.550
 survive as we can but balls 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.110

 on the other hand I take this moment to 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.680
 say that in this particular case we 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.289
 does not give equal is not the same as a 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.870
 director want my voice to be 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.759
 impose is not my resemblance although I have 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.080
 done other things where a director 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.599
 have imposed on my voice and neither has 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.340
