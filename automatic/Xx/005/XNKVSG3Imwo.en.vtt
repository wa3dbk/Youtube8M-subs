00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.480
 very good to all guys and welcome 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.009
 once again to the channel we go with another guide 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 and today we go with good jeans I'm going to 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.970
 comment 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.859
 first of all jeans is one of the three 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.870
 lanes that are being played more than 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.750
 they have more power right now together 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.610
 with luciano and he gets very well I'm going to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.519
 try to explain as quickly and briefly 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.739
 possible although it means the same but 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.010
 well you understand me the build for 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.839
 get the best out of this champion 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.629
 ok we'll start with doran sword 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.280
 potion of life and the yellow ratchet and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.659
 The objects that we are not going to buy are 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.449
 the following and in this order 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.869
 we will start with avaricious sword since 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 gives us gold per minute and for each subject 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:06.299
 we kill we're going to leave the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 static dagger to take advantage of 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.049
 passive that has then we 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 we will buy the speed boots of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.140
 attack 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 and we will buy a bloodthirsty 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 starting with the state when 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.070
 let's finish the bloodthirsty 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.350
 we will buy another broadsword and we 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.060
 We buy the infinity edged as 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 our rockets those that are of the q 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.210
 they become critical in area we will already have 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.690
 our 25% critical of the infinite edge 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 plus 30% of the static dagger plus the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.210
 passive of the static dagger plus the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 passive of the infinite edge that a lot of people 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.060
 he does not know but the stat dagger does 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.690
 100 magical year point but if you 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.930
 you buy the infinite end 200 years ago 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.570
 additional magic damage every time 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.619
 you have loaded to go finishing us 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.990
 we will buy some last words and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.030
 defense mode as I always say a 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.340
 angel or guard 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.060
 There are many people who say that I prefer 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.810
 buy me a reign sheet 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 I would not buy it because the cv in 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.110
 machine gun mode has accumulations and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.020
 those accumulations 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.260
 they make us have more speed very well 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.170
 we go with the wheel of the masters the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.270
 runes let's use the runes 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.250
 standard of the carrivale as 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.570
 I always say are two quintessence of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.970
 life theft one of damage damage marks 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.160
 and one of critic who give us 1% of 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.120
 critical as I always say in all 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.540
 guides if you go with a champion that will hit 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.700
 many basic ones a 1% critical 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.519
 in the runes that although it seems a 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.310
 foolishness can save life or can 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.670
 help kill the opponent in the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.170
 we wear armor and in the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.000
 blue magic resistance you can carry 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.220
 the flat or by level I personally 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.409
 I take them flat because right now I think 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.280
 that the masters support too much 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:14.110
 that we will use are a 21 90 trying 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 maximize our damage in critical you can 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.400
 stop the video and you see it 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.500
 very good as advice I can tell you that 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.450
 the rockets as I said hit 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.010
 critical in area that is we can clean - 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.510
 very easily even if we give it 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.640
 aluminum that is next to the champion 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.310
 enemy the enemy champion will receive 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.730
 the damage 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.250
 and if it hits the critic 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.560
 the passive of the stadium also affects in 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.330
 areas I explain to you this hits what is the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.879
 passive of the static aluminum in serious 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.030
 been to all and then extends to the 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.709
 from the sides is worth one to one 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.769
 as long as the enemy is not running away 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.379
 it is better to put the uv in the form of 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.200
 submachine gun since you'll have a lot 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.019
 attack speed even if you have to 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.480
 sacrifice a little the range and damage in 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.190
 area but if you only go against an enemy 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.590
 so you want the damage in area when 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.780
 I'm pulling a turret and it's left 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.250
 little life those who are always hitting 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.019
 throw the turret since the passive 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.370
 links when you have a turret you go to 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.010
 run much more and the champion 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.449
 enemy makes it impossible for me to catch you very 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.160
 Well, this has been all about this 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.269
