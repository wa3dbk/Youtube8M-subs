00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.410
 hello very good to all the guys and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.930
 girls I love you in another blog on Monday 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.910
 and I wanted to bring you a somewhat 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.570
 upset what happened to me the other day 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.330
 as you know this week leaves the colostrum 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.210
 ticos the new let's say the new title 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.770
 of the beech is ink infinity ward that 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.990
 reformed again and such 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.660
 after that disappointment we saw of 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.460
 modern warfare 3 targets 2 more or less 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 it was half good not being a product 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.660
 it was a really bad product is not 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.760
 that remains a rehash but still 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 entertained, I 'm not going to tell you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.379
 little story that I have had with this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.390
 title I have told you many times that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.489
 I have a colleague who works in warehouses 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 and many times you can get me the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.770
 games before it comes out not a few days 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.470
 before he leaves to avoid me issues 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.800
 of spoiler and such others I get them 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.210
 because Spain leaked such depends on 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.170
 He that always get ground game 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.780
 a few days before 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.030
 and well my colleague this is not a fan in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.070
 other video games he likes it 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.409
 I bought the call of duty except gta 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.810
 a fifa gta but let's say the typical ones 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.850
 typical that today 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.070
 and let's say call of duty cost already 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.590
 I was in storage from this 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.060
 Friday that is, this is coming 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 buy what can be pre emprego 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.980
 Prosas was physically stored in 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.160
 Spain 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.180
 and he got it out and such because I do not 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.460
 I 'm not going to buy it at first 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.080
 it catches my attention is more I think the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.130
 white 2 is the only one that I bought 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.189
 single launch call of duty 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.549
 and nothing I went to his house to try it not 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.899
 We were watching it and such and well I 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.000
 I really did not know much about this title 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.130
 but we have sold as a title 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.380
 in that one that is supposed to have 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.789
 take advantage of let's say the new ones 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.770
 features does not have to be a 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.229
 title that we say that supposes a little 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.429
 of change as it was modern warfare with 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.429
 with respect to the 33 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.479
 and what was my surprise when we 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.820
 we played a multiplayer game 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.180
 and it gave me the feeling of being playing 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.790
 at the med to the phones of 2010 and in that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.460
 moment I started let's say to turn it around 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.200
 I even imagined that now the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.660
 employees of infinity ward through 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 the screen laughing at us for 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.670
 have bought that bad product 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.420
 because let's say the feeling of being 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.440
 still playing a product that we say 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.300
 what a deception 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.370
 the feeling of being playing a 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.450
 cheating of the game I only had it in 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.640
 modern warfare 3 and is that this title does not 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.830
 I know if the saga of uti is a 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.740
 sociological experiment for let's say 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.080
 measure the degree of human stupidity to the 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.900
 time to consume a product that always 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.360
 the same not and let's say from having 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.160
 retained the mass of not removing them from one of 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.260
 same one of the same rehash what 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.659
 we talked the other day the refritos 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.819
 and the truth is that it annoyed me a lot 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.129
 see see what they have done in the 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.860
 next-gen because already infinity 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.430
 world at its time the extinct infinity 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.319
 ward was reformed and such and it is normal that 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.000
 modern warfare 3 went wrong and the same 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.700
 that the case of duke nukem forever 'that 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.909
 game could not come out good of any 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.680
 way but not to try for example 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.120
 compare it with faithful battle that I've 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.790
 been commented also initially 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.500
 weekend compare it with this title 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.890
 that is supposed to compete with him and 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.470
 that surely sells more than him 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.080
 and see be a product of such poor 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.260
 quality of so much rehash I had the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.200
 it has truly left me stunned apart from 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.060
 that every time he puts more capital into 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.650
 online plan that if planes that 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.209
 They look like a mosquito that kill you 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.190
 dogs what I want is like in 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.650
 battersea or simply a piece of land 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.630
 where I can combine more kill them to 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.600
 the other people but do not fill me 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.190
 shit the land and can not I can not 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.950
 almost do nothing not because it's always 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.800
 with the low gusts and the whole roll and 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.350
 the truth that I do this blog I very mode 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.820
 discontent because let's say that I never 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.980
 I bought the heat you useful output 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.420
 I've always had it from me 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.400
 bought later for the simple fact of 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.109
 that when people come home we say 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.419
 which is the fastest game to play is 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.919
 say when people come to dinner at 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.570
 some party or something because always the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.710
 a social game that I play the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.660
 call of duty I do not take them seriously 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.580
 because it's not a game for a company 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.160
 for me to take seriously the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.350
 players does not give me the feeling is a lot 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.100
 that are laughing at you not loved 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.930
 player 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.080
 that's why I do not take it as games 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.610
 social as if it were a game and everything 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.530
 this the games these are direct 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.330
 that can play with anyone and 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.810
 I have bought it practically for that 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.330
 because apart is not no when they go out with 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.520
 you have a time you can get it 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.470
 let's say reduced and such 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.030
 and I have like social games that is 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.039
 like a game that is there for when 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.889
 people come and maybe you miss a 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.319
 laughs because it is true that the product 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.080
 entertains even if it's bad but that 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.460
 I have it there but it is that this the truth 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.610
 is that I do not know is supposed to be a 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.370
 bet not of activision a company 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.229
 multimillionaire of a game that 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.210
 It assumes that it will sell many copies and 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.460
 that must have a minimum respect for 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.830
 at least a respect towards his players 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.530
 die hard and to me is that the latter 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.520
 delivery is going to be a Danish that has 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.199
 looked like a huge whiplash or 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.880
 surely I'll get the armored edition 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.530
 for the matter of having the metal box 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.120
 same as the white help package 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.949
 those who caught it just because 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.419
 have the help package and saw it the 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.099
 game really did not matter 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.569
 besides having played them, the 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.389
 campaign and open the game a couple of hours 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.529
 more but let's go 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.110
 would be broadcast on this blog my 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.729
 unhappy to report a bit about what 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.559
 what impresses me most is the black the 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:58.599
 cost of the new of the new let's say 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:06:00.639
 infinity blade incursion of infinity 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.999
 world castle infinity blade better something 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:07.809
 of infinity war within the next time 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:09.729
 and nothing to tell you that 's the tickets 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:12.519
 when the armored edition is down 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.009
 since I do not think they are going to end and 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:16.929
 comment that if you want to catch 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.959
 to me the game has given me the feeling of 

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:21.939
 that looked like the 2010 bond means and not 

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:23.769
 it was a game precisely good is more 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:26.319
 I thought the phones watches 2010 

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:29.349
 but with a quality still 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:32.289
 reduced or I do not know I do not know the truth 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.599
 good and with more cache without supported than 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.329
 let's say they hinder a bit in what 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.919
 is the multiplayer and well I know that 

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:40.899
 you have seen many blogs of these from 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.490
 people complaining about call of duty but I 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.229
 I also had to talk wanted to say my 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.179
 opinion about the saga of what I 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.600
 it seems like an entertainment product 

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:51.450
 as a social product 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.910
 and that I hope people in infinity 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.560
 ward in a moment and activision that 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.880
 take the games a little seriously with the 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.800
 batch star what trias also what 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.840
 get in the bag take a little 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.330
 games in the call of duty games the 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.090
 serious and let's say they respect a little 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.110
 player and do not stay with say with 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.540
 leave them with the face of a fool for the poor 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.760
 and well nothing kids I hope that I have 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.670
