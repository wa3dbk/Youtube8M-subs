00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
since well as far as i know since the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.990 
since well as far as i know since the
d700<00:01:12.409> is<00:01:13.409> definitely<00:01:13.770> present<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> d7000

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
d700 is definitely present in the d7000

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.800 
d700 is definitely present in the d7000
the<00:01:15.360> d3s<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> d800<00:01:16.860> has<00:01:17.640> been<00:01:17.939> changed<00:01:18.450> for

the d3s the d800 has been changed for

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.280 
the d3s the d800 has been changed for
some<00:01:18.990> bizarre<00:01:19.320> reason<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> d750<00:01:21.290> so

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
some bizarre reason with the d750 so

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440 
some bizarre reason with the d750 so
traditionally<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.100> would<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.390> if<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
traditionally all you would do if you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
traditionally all you would do if you
wanted<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> switch<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.140> rear<00:01:25.320> curtain<00:01:25.500> flash

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
which press and hold the flash button

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
which press and hold the flash button
here<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> side<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.340> camera<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:30.270> right

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
here on the side of the camera all right

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.289 
here on the side of the camera all right
and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:31.500> turn<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> back<00:01:32.280> dial<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and then turn the back dial and that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.670 
and then turn the back dial and that
would<00:01:33.420> scroll<00:01:33.780> through<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> different<00:01:34.259> menu

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
would scroll through the different menu

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.039 
would scroll through the different menu
settings<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.130> had<00:01:35.310> available<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
settings that you had available to you

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.950 
settings that you had available to you
now<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.770> some<00:01:37.950> reason<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> decided

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
now for some reason it kind of decided

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.920 
now for some reason it kind of decided
that<00:01:40.430> perfectly<00:01:41.430> good<00:01:41.640> system<00:01:42.060> needs<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> be

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that perfectly good system needs to be

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.840 
that perfectly good system needs to be
changed<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.520> they've<00:01:44.700> gone

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
changed but it's not that they've gone

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
changed but it's not that they've gone
and<00:01:45.030> changed<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.720> way<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:48.380> like

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and changed it in a way that was like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.770 
and changed it in a way that was like
taking<00:01:50.130> away<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> button<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> putting<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
taking away the button and putting it in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.270 
taking away the button and putting it in
a<00:01:51.869> menu<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.229> something<00:01:52.710> completely<00:01:53.130> different

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
a menu or something completely different

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
a menu or something completely different
the<00:01:53.909> functionality<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> control<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the functionality the control that you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.010 
the functionality the control that you
use<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.360> through<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> menu<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
use to to go through that menu is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
use to to go through that menu is
exactly<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.590> same<00:01:58.829> all<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.610> they've<00:01:59.729> gone

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
exactly the same all that they've gone

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
exactly the same all that they've gone
and<00:02:00.090> done<00:02:00.180> now<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.649> turning<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.979> back

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and done now so I'm just turning my back

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.740 
and done now so I'm just turning my back
to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> window<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.880> I'd<00:02:03.030> reduce<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> wind

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to the window if I'd reduce the wind

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.090 
to the window if I'd reduce the wind
noise<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.710> although<00:02:04.890> they've

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
noise a little bit but although they've

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969 
noise a little bit but although they've
done<00:02:05.250> now<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.610> made<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.469> order<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
done now is made it so that in order to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.940 
done now is made it so that in order to
access<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.819> menu<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:10.020> pop-up<00:02:10.349> flash<00:02:10.530> has<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
access that menu the pop-up flash has to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.380 
access that menu the pop-up flash has to
fully<00:02:11.190> deploy

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
fully deploy

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
fully deploy
now<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:13.200> never<00:02:13.380> necessary<00:02:13.830> before<00:02:14.250> but

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
now that was never necessary before but

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.740 
now that was never necessary before but
now<00:02:14.610> it's<00:02:14.790> completely<00:02:15.120> necessary<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:15.600> if<00:02:15.690> you

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
now it's completely necessary so if you

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.390 
now it's completely necessary so if you
want<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.930> reach<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.260> menu<00:02:16.500> function<00:02:16.950> your

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
want to reach that menu function your

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.010 
want to reach that menu function your
pop-up<00:02:17.700> flash<00:02:17.970> has<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.510> deployed

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
pop-up flash has to be deployed

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.050 
pop-up flash has to be deployed
completely<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.160> where<00:02:20.310> their<00:02:20.459> falls<00:02:20.730> into<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
completely and where their falls into a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.880 
completely and where their falls into a
bit<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.300> problem<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.050> shoot<00:02:22.500> off<00:02:22.650> camera

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
bit of a problem is I shoot off camera

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.830 
bit of a problem is I shoot off camera
flash<00:02:22.980> most<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.940> times<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:24.360> do<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.600> lot<00:02:24.810> of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
flash most of the times as do a lot of

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.820 
flash most of the times as do a lot of
people<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.440> when<00:02:26.370> you've<00:02:26.490> got<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.850> UH<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.800> like<00:02:28.800> a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
people and when you've got a UH a like a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.380 
people and when you've got a UH a like a
trigger<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.220> tank<00:02:29.490> mounted<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.910> your<00:02:29.940> hot<00:02:30.180> shoe

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
trigger a tank mounted to your hot shoe

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.590 
trigger a tank mounted to your hot shoe
here<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.680> flash<00:02:32.220> can't<00:02:32.520> fully<00:02:32.700> deploy<00:02:33.060> so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
here the flash can't fully deploy so

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.840 
here the flash can't fully deploy so
essentially<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.530> access<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.580> menu

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
essentially you can access that menu

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.770 
essentially you can access that menu
that<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.990> would<00:02:37.110> normally<00:02:37.230> use<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:38.780> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
that you would normally use to just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.479 
that you would normally use to just
switch<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.959> rear<00:02:40.290> curtain<00:02:40.440> flash<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.980> that's

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
switch to rear curtain flash and that's

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.830 
switch to rear curtain flash and that's
all<00:02:41.790> they've<00:02:41.970> done<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.690> made

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
all they've done is that just made

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.270 
all they've done is that just made
something<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.319> was<00:02:43.410> incredibly<00:02:43.800> simple<00:02:44.160> and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
something that was incredibly simple and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.370 
something that was incredibly simple and
useful<00:02:44.370> completely<00:02:45.239> useless<00:02:45.420> anyway<00:02:46.320> so

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
useful completely useless anyway so

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.020 
useful completely useless anyway so
that's<00:02:46.560> my<00:02:46.709> take<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.340> that's<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.820> first

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
that's my take on that that's the first

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.250 
that's my take on that that's the first
section<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.600> dumb<00:02:48.959> stuff<00:02:49.290> hope<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.980> enjoy
