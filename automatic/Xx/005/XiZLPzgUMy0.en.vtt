that text it'll get underlined and you
can<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.310> stuff<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.119> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
can just this stuff like that and you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
can just this stuff like that and you
could<00:01:21.390> also<00:01:21.509> use<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.470> normal<00:01:22.770> images

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
could also use it for just normal images

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
could also use it for just normal images
like<00:01:23.580> let's<00:01:24.060> say<00:01:24.180> they<00:01:24.509> roll<00:01:25.170> over<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> i'll

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
like let's say they roll over and i'll

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
like let's say they roll over and i'll
say<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.369> click<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.240> something<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
say like click me or something like that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
say like click me or something like that
and<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> could<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.229> linked<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.710> somewhere<00:01:29.040> but

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and it could be linked to somewhere but

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
and it could be linked to somewhere but
again<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.060> mainly<00:01:30.900> used<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.439> navigation

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
again this is mainly used for navigation

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460 
again this is mainly used for navigation
