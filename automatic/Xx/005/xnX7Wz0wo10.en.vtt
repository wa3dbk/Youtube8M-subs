video for a overworld Enderman farm now
the<00:00:08.760> way<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.030> figured<00:00:09.360> out<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.719> could<00:00:09.750> do

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
the way I figured out that you could do

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.230 
the way I figured out that you could do
this<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.349> really<00:00:10.679> simple<00:00:11.040> actually<00:00:11.490> see

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
this is really simple actually see

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.990 
this is really simple actually see
Enderman<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.870> twice<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.349> much<00:00:13.500> health<00:00:13.769> as

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
Enderman have twice as much health as

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.580 
Enderman have twice as much health as
any<00:00:15.000> normal<00:00:15.360> mob<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.870> they<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.379> survive

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
any normal mob so they can survive

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.710 
any normal mob so they can survive
Christ<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> fall<00:00:17.160> damage<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.090> take<00:00:18.390> any

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
Christ the fall damage so take any

generic<00:00:19.500> mob<00:00:20.340> farm<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> simple

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
generic mob farm this one is a simple

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.790 
generic mob farm this one is a simple
string<00:00:22.380> system<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> set<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.990> Boop

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
string system that I set up so Boop

zombie<00:00:26.340> baby<00:00:26.670> zombies<00:00:27.029> don't<00:00:27.119> trip<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
zombie baby zombies don't trip it but I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
zombie baby zombies don't trip it but I
have<00:00:27.779> string<00:00:28.019> here<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.099> mob

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
have string here so I'm going to mob

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
have string here so I'm going to mob
enters<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> string<00:00:30.000> piston<00:00:30.779> squawks<00:00:30.990> tin

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
enters the string piston squawks tin

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.310 
enters the string piston squawks tin
that<00:00:31.320> glass<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> push<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> mobs<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:33.320> right

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that glass and push the mobs all right

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200 
that glass and push the mobs all right
so<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.309> vines<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:35.880> sure<00:00:36.030> all

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
so then the vines there make sure all

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
so then the vines there make sure all
the<00:00:36.329> mobs<00:00:36.480> fall<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> same<00:00:37.500> height<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the mobs fall from the same height and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
the mobs fall from the same height and
then<00:00:38.250> only<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.850> Enderman<00:00:39.149> are<00:00:39.270> strong<00:00:39.480> enough

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
then only the Enderman are strong enough

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
then only the Enderman are strong enough
to<00:00:39.809> survive<00:00:40.309> then<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> reason<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.940> that

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
to survive then the reason you do that

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
to survive then the reason you do that
do<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.530> could<00:00:43.710> hit<00:00:43.829> them

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
do this is that so you could hit them

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.740 
do this is that so you could hit them
with<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> looting<00:00:44.700> sword<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
with a looting sword of some kind and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
with a looting sword of some kind and
then<00:00:46.590> get<00:00:46.770> more<00:00:46.890> Interpol's<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.329> would

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
then get more Interpol's so this would

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.389 
then get more Interpol's so this would
be<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> ready<00:00:49.530> source<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.890> ender<00:00:50.160> pearls

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
be just a ready source of ender pearls

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.049 
be just a ready source of ender pearls
in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> overworld<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:52.110> don't<00:00:52.620> feel<00:00:52.800> like

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
in the overworld if you don't feel like

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.760 
in the overworld if you don't feel like
going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> end<00:00:54.449> before<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> make

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
going to the end before you want to make

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.010 
going to the end before you want to make
some<00:00:55.949> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> Enderman<00:00:56.640> farm<00:00:56.879> or<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
some kind of Enderman farm or if you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.220 
some kind of Enderman farm or if you
just<00:00:58.260> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.160> ender<00:00:59.399> pearl<00:00:59.670> arm

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
just want to have an ender pearl arm

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.020 
just want to have an ender pearl arm
closer<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.920> your<00:01:02.039> base<00:01:02.190> or<00:01:02.430> something<00:01:02.820> like

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
closer to your base or something like

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.780 
closer to your base or something like
that<00:01:03.619> there<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> few<00:01:04.830> problems<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.460> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that there are a few problems with it so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.340 
that there are a few problems with it so
I<00:01:06.119> want<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> work<00:01:06.540> those<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.900> before<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.200> make

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I want to work those out before I make

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
I want to work those out before I make
the<00:01:07.470> full<00:01:07.650> tutorial<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.820> was<00:01:09.270> planning<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the full tutorial I was planning on

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
the full tutorial I was planning on
making<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.049> full<00:01:10.229> tutorial<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.010> why<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
making a full tutorial which is why it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.899 
making a full tutorial which is why it
looks<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.000> nice<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.540> uh<00:01:13.430> one<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> problems

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
looks so nice but uh one of the problems

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
looks so nice but uh one of the problems
is<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> fact<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.439> all

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
is that I don't like the fact that all

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.649 
is that I don't like the fact that all
the<00:01:16.860> other<00:01:16.890> mobs<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.520> falling<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.060> top<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the other mobs are falling on top of you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.300 
the other mobs are falling on top of you
when<00:01:18.930> you'd<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.409> farming<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> Enderman

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
when you'd be farming the Enderman

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.780 
when you'd be farming the Enderman
because<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.689> rare<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.110> skeleton

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
because a it's really rare but skeleton

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.920 
because a it's really rare but skeleton
skeletons<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.970> actually<00:01:24.299> shoot<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.720> as

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
skeletons can actually shoot you as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
skeletons can actually shoot you as
they're<00:01:25.140> falling<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.830> um<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.509> try<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
they're falling so um I want to try to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.350 
they're falling so um I want to try to
sort<00:01:28.110> them<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.350> somehow<00:01:28.740> err<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.210> find<00:01:30.210> some

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
sort them out somehow err just find some

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
sort them out somehow err just find some
kind<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> solution<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.049> secondly<00:01:31.740> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
kind of solution to that secondly this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.200 
kind of solution to that secondly this
particular<00:01:32.790> farm<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.720> inconsistent

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
particular farm is inconsistent

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
particular farm is inconsistent
sometimes<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> Enderman<00:01:36.659> take<00:01:37.380> too<00:01:37.680> much

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
sometimes the Enderman take too much

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.710 
sometimes the Enderman take too much
damage<00:01:37.860> while<00:01:38.369> they're<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.360> don't

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
damage while they're in there or don't

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
damage while they're in there or don't
take<00:01:39.900> enough<00:01:40.170> damage<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> take<00:01:40.860> two<00:01:41.040> hits<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
take enough damage and take two hits to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
damage of course they die when they hit

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.800 
damage of course they die when they hit
the<00:01:45.840> platform<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.759> then<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.689> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the platform and then you don't get to

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
while which is why there's so much in it

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.249 
while which is why there's so much in it

Enderman<00:02:07.920> farms<00:02:08.220> already<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.910> YouTube<00:02:09.869> but

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
Enderman farms already on YouTube but

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
Enderman farms already on YouTube but
most<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> ones<00:02:11.069> I've<00:02:11.220> seen<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.730> fact<00:02:11.970> all

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
most of the ones I've seen in fact all

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.980 
most of the ones I've seen in fact all
the<00:02:12.270> ones<00:02:12.420> I've<00:02:12.569> managed

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
the ones I've managed

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.590 
the ones I've managed
I'm<00:02:13.140> use<00:02:14.040> water<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.550> filter<00:02:15.000> out<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.180> Enderman

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
I'm use water to filter out the Enderman

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.810 
I'm use water to filter out the Enderman
so<00:02:15.870> it's<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.770> really<00:02:16.980> complex<00:02:17.400> system

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
so it's like a really complex system

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.880 
so it's like a really complex system
where<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.210> room<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.840> dark<00:02:19.290> room<00:02:19.410> fills<00:02:19.710> up<00:02:19.860> with

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
where a room a dark room fills up with

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.740 
where a room a dark room fills up with
water<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.550> pushes<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> normal<00:02:21.390> mobs<00:02:21.570> out

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
water it pushes all the normal mobs out

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870 
water it pushes all the normal mobs out
the<00:02:22.320> Enderman<00:02:22.680> take<00:02:22.920> damage<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.430> teleport

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
the Enderman take damage and teleport

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.580 
the Enderman take damage and teleport
out<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.300> then<00:02:24.780> there's<00:02:25.020> some<00:02:25.200> other<00:02:25.290> nearby

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
out and then there's some other nearby

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.350 
out and then there's some other nearby
platform<00:02:26.160> which<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> only<00:02:26.790> spot<00:02:27.180> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
platform which is the only spot the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.760 
platform which is the only spot the
Enderman<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.810> teleport<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:28.620> from

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
Enderman can teleport to and then from

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.100 
Enderman can teleport to and then from
there<00:02:28.950> they're<00:02:29.160> dropped<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.750> seems<00:02:30.930> way

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
there they're dropped it just seems way

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.600 
there they're dropped it just seems way
too<00:02:31.140> complex<00:02:31.710> when<00:02:31.890> all<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.400> do<00:02:32.490> is

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
too complex when all you have to do is

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.670 
too complex when all you have to do is
drop<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> mobs<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:34.410> want<00:02:34.590> to
