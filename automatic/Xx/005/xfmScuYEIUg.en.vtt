00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.320

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.080

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.660
 I'm for this and why the hell to take 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.110

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.070
 that fits me pretty well I like it 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.990
 because earlier that I had was like a helmet 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.110
 to have roll headphones 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:45.470

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.900

 put the wands and shits and his whore 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.360
 mother but what interests me is that this 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.970
 space someone that you will see where I am going to 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.810
 can put a hook to carry it or 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.010
 pro just here then basically it will be 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.790
 this see in the first person 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.040
 supposedly everything so now after 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.569
 from this one boxing I will take 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.950
 in time to condition everything to 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.950
 see then also with glasses how 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.069
 I would like to see me 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.470
 william trip well well this would be the 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.239
 final painting that would have without counting what 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.050
 what is the protection of all this 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.790
 section with this helmet I'm pretty cool 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.319
 and I love black for this kind of 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.810
 cake roll of things for the roll of 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.910
 things like that military and his fucking mother 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.290
 still missing one thing to put by 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.560
 example we are apart from that they get 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.410
 right behind here but that's good 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.980
 will be thing to adjust does not have much 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.840
 mystery is good or good here and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.549
 then they told me I did not buy it hey uncle 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.980
 that has a Velcro drawer I do not know if 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.590
 they have balls around here so o paste 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.190
 or shit for sure I will not have any 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.290
 problem so good yes I think this 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.060
 they are already some of my last purchases 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.209
 Apart from this I do not know if I still have to buy 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.190
 a new tripod and a torch 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.940
 led torch to be able to record by the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.650
 night with my good camera team and 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.810
 such that yesterday I was in Madrid I want 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.030
 that you see the video of enjoying 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.730
 madrid I think it's called that 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.320
 Let's see let's enjoy Madrid 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.960
 it's a demo video of how 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.810
 recorded with the 600 canon of and with africa 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.750
 in 5000 and it seems like not and so 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.900
 still not like that but take this with the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.360
 above weights and above the 600 canon 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.240
 that is not exactly light during 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.100
 six hours without harness people end 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.660
 killing I ended up igniting all 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.120
 the fingers of the hand the person say 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.340
 with my typical gloves that now 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.150
 will make even more sense the subject of 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.490
 take them 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.820
 and fuck I'm going to think about the long 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.950
 theme of catching me a network as you see a 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.590
 lots of little things now I can finally 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.910
 record with the go pro well I remember you 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.030
 that I already recorded an airsoft game 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.580
 but I recorded it very well 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.020
 taking the camera this same one that 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.620
 is recording that it is a normal camera and 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.390
 current you are a tourist handicap 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.580
 Let's say sealed to what has been 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.610
 myths or from here then clear the 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.710
 point of view was a bit was a bit 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.690
 rare is wrong it was not bad because as 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.420
 I am tall that is known a little but 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.980
 I was fucked up by that very subject like that 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.750
 I do not expect anything that you liked here 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.950
 the castillito that is going to be quite useful 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.780
 then I hope that you go all the 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.670
 videos that I just uploaded recently 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.040
 and those that are to come and that you wait 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.720
 is this new section of airsoft 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.530
 paintball and etcetera that is going to be called 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.760
 at the end greater act war zone to whom 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.170
 greater fingers so nothing has been 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.520
 planted that they take you like and yes sir 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.520

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.870
 In return
