00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the bottom now where I'm thinking okay

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
got my component cables and you can just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.690 
got my component cables and you can just
about<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.760> game<00:01:09.030> mode<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.350> left

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.490 
difference and ivory from the same test
over<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.210> over<00:01:45.329> again<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.960> realized<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
over and over again and I realized that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.469 
over and over again and I realized that
that<00:01:46.710> brings<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.250> down<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.880> same<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.329> bad

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that brings it down to the same as bad

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.810 
that brings it down to the same as bad
company<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.590> even<00:01:49.829> though<00:01:49.860> every<00:01:50.340> single<00:01:50.369> game

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
company so even though every single game

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.999 
company so even though every single game
out<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:51.060> suffers<00:01:51.689> from<00:01:51.869> import<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.409> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
out there suffers from import like it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710 
out there suffers from import like it
just<00:01:53.220> depends<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:53.700> much<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.149> mean<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.540> bad

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
just depends how much I mean in bad

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
just depends how much I mean in bad
company<00:01:54.960> 2<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> can't<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.920> remember<00:01:56.070> people

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
slightly faster than everything I mean I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.500 
slightly faster than everything I mean I
know<00:03:00.740> you're<00:03:01.100> not<00:03:01.190> gaining<00:03:01.490> a<00:03:01.940> couple<00:03:02.450> of

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
know you're not gaining a couple of

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.150 
know you're not gaining a couple of
seconds<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:03.050> your<00:03:03.170> opponents<00:03:03.680> or<00:03:03.770> anything

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
seconds on your opponents or anything

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.010 
seconds on your opponents or anything
but<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.430> gaining<00:03:04.880> point<00:03:05.360> two<00:03:05.660> six

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
but you gaining point two six

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.870 
but you gaining point two six
milliseconds<00:03:06.560> or<00:03:07.070> something<00:03:07.340> like<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.490> so

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
milliseconds or something like that so

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.870 
milliseconds or something like that so
it's<00:03:08.570> still<00:03:08.870> an<00:03:09.530> improvement<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.550> way<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.730> see

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
it's still an improvement the way I see

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.820 
it's still an improvement the way I see
it<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.720> still<00:03:12.080> makes<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.440> little<00:03:12.590> bit

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
it and they still makes you a little bit

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.930 
it and they still makes you a little bit
faster<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.280> could<00:03:13.430> turn<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.640> little<00:03:13.760> bit

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
faster you could turn a little bit

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.840 
faster you could turn a little bit
faster<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.450> name<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.720> come<00:03:14.930> faster<00:03:15.410> and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
faster you can name you come faster and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.110 
faster you can name you come faster and
the<00:03:16.850> easiest<00:03:17.150> way<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:17.750> me<00:03:17.960> to<00:03:18.050> find<00:03:18.470> out<00:03:18.680> is

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
the easiest way for me to find out is

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.490 
the easiest way for me to find out is
moving<00:03:20.120> your<00:03:20.240> camera<00:03:20.570> around<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.050> jumping

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
moving your camera around and jumping

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.840 
moving your camera around and jumping
and<00:03:21.650> shooting<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.250> same<00:03:22.430> time<00:03:22.670> because
