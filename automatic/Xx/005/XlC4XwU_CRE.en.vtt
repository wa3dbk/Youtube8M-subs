00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello then today on wednesday 27 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.350
 August a few days that I returned 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.679
 and therefore at the request of several 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.710
 of you I'm doing this little video 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:22.050
 to actually make a balance sheet of the material 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.279
 and things that I could experience 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.660
 to be confirmed or confirmed 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.050
 besides what I said about 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 previous videos to just do 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 better and lighter again the next 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.320
 times since despite everything I still 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.800
 still wear things things in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.770
 too much not the slogan of the thing that 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.840
 I carried for nothing so there was 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.420
 here I present you these two dishes 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 freeze-dried here they did the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 500 market markers 23 so who are 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.370
 left of the old camper in paris who have 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.120
 does half of the gr10 and who are 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 mounted in paris 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 so friends are still good until 2016 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.559
 froze the animals in the closet for the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.680
 next time 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.540
 but finally here and good beaches 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.040
 phillies and actually I do not like it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.920
 everything I do not like it's not very good 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.299
 it's really I'm leaving security that I 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.340
 I have to consider it as 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.420
 really survival equipment it's not 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.890
 at all something of how 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.140
 I would say in my diet 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.270
 usual to give false the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.619
 others so somewhere if they 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.250
 come back is that I'm not too 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.159
 badly demerder finally here are others 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.900
 palm down the chestnut cream 1 lo 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:43.049
 so game like I wore them during 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.610
 these five weeks for nothing because I 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.210
 not go frozen not finally used 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.240
 now the material of which I am 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.170
 separated en route 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.240
 so there is but in the covered range 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520
 always around the food the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.980
 fork then the fork finally 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.630
 I just 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.850
 a spoon and an opinel actually for 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.090
 to eat the fork is not helpful 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.630
 so 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.190
 same for some of the cards 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.380
 like that I told you it's all the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.330
 documentation I need 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.480
 obviously I did not wear it all 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.900
 I wore a portion of two 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.330
 marches and sometimes play them ship in 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.130
 poste restante sometimes what I did not have 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.320
 I do not need to send it back to the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.980
 house so actually managed to ship some 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:39.140
 cards plus my super fork of 17 g 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.780
 and more a few odd good pair of 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.770
 socks t-shirt I had too much so 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.850
 I sacrificed 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:51.050
 I sacrificed some clothes 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.980
 so that's things that got me 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.130
 left on the way something else 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.960
 well that's the same I do not have 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.960
 used but that's always to keep 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.970
 about yourself desert repair kit 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.480
 seal of the tent so I did not have to 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.130
 use it all went well so 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.670
 the other thing or do I put them 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.400
 to death so that's it that's the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.740
 pharmacy so the pharmacy I used 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.760
 if not two of our five pure water 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.270
 weeks which is not bad 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.910
 and then I used no dressings 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.190
 no disinfectant so we can say that 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.750
 everything went well the tick pulls I 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.280
 use them and go back to paris because 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.060
 that actually I had a little on 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.660
 leg but that's not served me anymore 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.550
 that's not good sunscreen 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.180
 I have not put a single time must say 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.380
 that he did not do super nice and then 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.940
 that I said to myself good anyway 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.510
 that I take a little bit with them 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.880
 a few set small radius that had so 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.500
 the tube of sunscreen comes back in tac 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.520
 then in the things that I modified 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.989
 during the course of years I had to do 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.290
 acquiring a pair of this mail 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:10.569
 specific for porting actually 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.980
 cushion the walk since I had 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.180
 really experience pain here at 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:20.190
 foot level so I replaced the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.030
 original soles by insoles 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.750
 shock absorbing and then it turned out 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.680
 really very well very effective I had 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.020
 no more burns or sensations of 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.669
 too much weight on the feet good I have 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.310
 still a little bad knee 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.720
 as of today but it should be 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.270
 put back in place 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.539
 the big change in fact that I did 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.860
 midway it is that finally I am 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.259
 am separated 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.590
 I reshiped so my 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.889
 mattress so I actually replaced the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.410
 self-inflating mattress with its carpet of 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.599
 ground finally so walking with the other gg 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:07.690
 to turn that and put it by a carpet 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:09.460
 unique which is so this carpet there that is 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.199
 in fact that is not really a mattress 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.270
 well here it is still a little bit 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.840
 I not if we see it is a little bit 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.860
 textures and that's it for a little bit 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.900
 cushion the weight of the body on the floor 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.409
 but in any case it is rather an insulator 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.139
 thermal 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.630
 so I have after three weeks I 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.639
 finally managed to sleep directly at 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.220
 even the floor 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.260
 the survival blanket so that serves 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.840
 obviously for emergencies 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.820
 it also serves to isolate cold and 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.150
 moisture between the floor mat and the 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.039
 ground 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.639
 so I used it twice 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.900
 when I slept on the web and we 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.590
 went below zero anyway 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.330
 I had to live 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.220
 so that was good because I did not 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.080
 I suffered too much 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.060
 cold thanks to that 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.620
 fold the survival blanket I think 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.449
 we can do a practical episode 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.830
 just for that it's not pie 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:04.750
 here and finally when we finish his 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.160
 trek and bah what are we doing 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.240
 take care of a little bit of his 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.930
 backpack that still has not hurt 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.640
 morfler so in fact it's for just 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.250
 to show you that a backpack to 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.720
 sedan cares and that's okay so 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.490
 rather not in the washing machine when 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.230
 even it's still pretty fragile and 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.930
 then even when some tissues 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.350
 treatments I would say treatments 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.030
 waterproofing etc 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.360
 so you should wash with cold water 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.100
 and by hand and in fact what it takes 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.130
 do I take a step back 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.290
 what to do is this kind of 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.130
 bag anyway disassemble so here is 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.870
 I had to remove the straps finally that that 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.190
 it shows 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:56.050
 completely so when we remove all 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:59.790
 the fasteners we remove the bars from 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.450
 maintenance for the rigidity of the back 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.680
 what happens 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.740
 and if that's not better when 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.740
 even 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.500
 and then in fact all demonstrate all and 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:23.710
 full rise to so after water 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:25.780
 cold with a sponge or laundry 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.330
 what and above all must do everything 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.280
 well it's at his parents' house so 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.550
 dismantle or at most 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.100
 and especially win we have it too 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.850
 cushioning cushions and if 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:44.530
 since it saw the perspiration 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:46.960
 anyway and especially in summer here and 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:50.820
 well I thank you all in any case 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:55.860
 for for your messages for 

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:58.230
 your questions too and then we'll see the 

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.960
 following episodes according to the 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.180
 questions can do one of the chapters 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.410
 just on the clothes the food finally 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.540
 Here you need to look 

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.650
 on this I wish you all a very 

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.950
 good comeback good luck 

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.540
 and despite despite the bad weather 

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.440
 that every gp and then soon 

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.440
 chalon
