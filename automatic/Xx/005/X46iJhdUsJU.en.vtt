00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
eye off it it looks like it's hit up

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.110 
eye off it it looks like it's hit up
under<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.860> peak<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> helmet<00:02:51.880> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
under the the peak of the helmet I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.780 
under the the peak of the helmet I
thought<00:02:53.110> for<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.320> moment<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.710> hit<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.610> ear

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
thought for a moment it hit the the ear

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.220 
thought for a moment it hit the the ear
piece<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:57.520> missed<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.240> ear<00:02:58.390> piece<00:02:58.630> hit

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
piece but it's missed the ear piece hit

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.220 
piece but it's missed the ear piece hit
up<00:02:59.500> under<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.270> peak<00:03:01.270> of<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.480> helmet<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.110> it's

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
up under the peak of the helmet so it's

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.650 
up under the peak of the helmet so it's
probably<00:03:02.680> got<00:03:02.950> him<00:03:03.330> round<00:03:04.330> about<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
probably got him round about the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.140 
probably got him round about the
eyebrows<00:03:05.140> somewhere<00:03:05.710> there<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.730> splits

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
eyebrows somewhere there and that splits
