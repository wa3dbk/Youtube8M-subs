00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.039
 we are here but on a holy ground 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.959
 We are visiting Ferrari and it is behind me 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.220
 it is the phyra performing the ppe stretch where are all the formula and cars and also 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.990
 own car that comes on the road is first walked away 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.740
 We are going to take a look here because they now also have the lunchtime process 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.590
 and those are 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.609
 rich people who actually want 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.100
 have parked one car but you don't hear me say it 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.830
 but i need my sunglasses little hope more than a day but the 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.830
 marathon 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.390
 4 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.390
 q 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.620
 the 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.830
 a little off the ground is this generation and now the fxx and 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.130
 in other words, having built the fastest and saucisse they are actually only meant 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.590
 for the circuit fer only 30 of built and all those rich clients who after it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.490
 actually their legs are out of place for maintenance you can also choose to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.730
 Not many people take that home with most 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.800
 car that actually always for maintenance the agenda is ok reason for 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.060
 they have recently had that decree in the program 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.900
 Paid in the back of it is now 68 they have improved the brakes and the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.390
 traction control still improved and this kind of adjustment katie suits this one 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.850
 car back also this is the expression 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.290
 they actually made it a bit better and this is a detention that said 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 the baker's site and because they don't have those on the side 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.270

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.130
 I say no 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.380
 Because the area you can do that you can also choose another one 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.180
 color to be left outside after he did this owner in short 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.240

 the 9 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.049
 The Dutchman plays in this, because there really is a good old box and that 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.129
 at least from rich customers 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.169
 It is simply to have purchased the cars on auction site to wake up from 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.209
 jeroen berkhof of mass saving just one paria because the rest that stands

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.230
 look at the phone and television great 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.259

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:21.069
 the 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.289
 and did you happen to ask new questions 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.879

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:52.679
 wanted to have 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.479
 the silver one red 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.179
 Ferraris three most popular colors in one 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:00.479
 not really surprisingly big 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.509
 on two it is gray I found surprising and animal is black 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.939

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.919
 just abolish it 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.919
 very nice figure 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.620

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 ready-to-use dashboard, which is an attack at school 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.620
 but they only have to sit another 10,000 and 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.699
 we are going to release the current form of maranello but not just that 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.929
 we do in style with these three ferrari's that are set up here 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.500
 the four horses patrol cars and the five weeks I know better

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.960
 the sixteen kilometers away so that is only going to get better 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.839
