00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.480
 hello everyone we try to you 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.640
 find today in this whole 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.690
 new video so I continue in the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.029
 series the basics 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.790
 I had made the first videos so 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.500
 infections a cosmetic at home 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.230
 the second I made a base 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.910
 the front so shampoos shower gels for 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.160
 smooth hands you can do 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.300
 a purifying for the face forward one 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.370
 can do a lot of things and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.379
 today I'm going to make a cream so 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.890
 the base of a neutral cream we will say that 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.530
 like that 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.970
 very simple but it's true that there are 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.250
 a lot of things you can change 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.020
 so today I'm going to use the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.660
 heart of crem so the new 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.440
 emulsifiers from as roma area that has 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.090
 seem to be not bad 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.950
 the texture is a little weird 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.089
 because it's wet inside 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.440
 I do not like the texture 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.180
 but it's debt an emulsifier when 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.990
 not bad so I 'll put 5 g 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.479
 Then I will put an oil 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.440
 vegetable so I chose the oil of his 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.190
 of rice so here I am going to put 12.5 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.799
 grams of this oil of water so 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.540
 how to say filter and forgiveness or 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.580
 bottles a directly purchased in 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.040
 shop of which 12.5 g 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.240
 and to finish so the conservative me 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.549
 I have the war coz but of course 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.590
 you can put another natural 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.869
 so for the co this guy i'm going to put 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.070
 10 drops or 0.3 g I know that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.110
 some people do not like coz 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.920
 yesterday even at the level of smell 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.049
 personally in the prepas I do not 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 will not be at all - but others a 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.280
 think it's a little smell 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.930
 chemical inside so I redeemed 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.000
 a great talker 200000 unique but 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.070
 after I think I'll try another 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.900
 more natural so as you can the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.600
 see you need to make a base of 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.180
 oil cream then an emulsifier 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.640
 of water is a conservative of which you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.840
 and it's very simple so we'll stay 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.390
 on that basis if because that's 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.069
 really the basis of home made cream 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.709
 neutral but otherwise you can change 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.840
 oils vegetable oil or you 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.540
 can put 2 3 as you want 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.280
 the must-see lovers in the heart of crem 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.230
 today but there is a lot 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.060
 for those who know a little bit 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.800
 and hiding in as roma zone he in 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.980
 there really is a lot of wax number 1 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.230
 2 3 and mulsanne olivennes thousand so there 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.110
 heart of crem there is a lot 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.489
 it's true that sometimes we do not know too much 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.080
 what to learn but you have to try everything 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.270
 me it's true that I still 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.980
 not bad at home but my favorite 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.140
 it's emulsifying wax number 3 I 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.090
 find it easy to use 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.220
 yet to some people who 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.510
 find that it did not work for 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.070
 them but I find it really very 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.790
 very well this wax so for the 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.550
 first phase 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.820
 so I'm going to put the five grams of 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.930
 good crem heart that is already set to 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.760
 inside and I will add but 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.769
 12.5 g vegetable oils of rice bran 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.590
 so for the water I said 12.5 but 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.130
 it's 32.2 in so I want to rectify so 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.110
 I put so but all 5 grams 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.150
 of rice bran oil with multi 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.820
 so trusting this one this is the first 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.350
 phase and I have the second of water so I 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.630
 I'm going to put all this in the bath Marie 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.360
 and I come back when fight everything is ready 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.070
 at once so the two phases 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.140
 are well melted so now I'm going 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.299
 incorporate the aqueous phase in the face 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.060
 vis leuze so attention of posts 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.340
 burn your hands off then we 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.930
 can do one pals I still have 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.940
 never tried other than I start there 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.290
 in because it would have avoided in 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.870
 to do that we would put directly 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.530
 water oil and multi trusting 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.090
 and matour stress would play what so I 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.090
 think I'll be quick to try 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.569
 that bleached I do not know if you see and 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.569
 it's normal 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.659
 so here's what I'm going to do 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.150
 now I'm going to put in a bowl 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.670
 of hot water to be able to cold 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:33.220
 forgiveness to be able to cool everything 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:35.380
 so there right after the mix 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.949
 that's what gives it a good 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.780
 cream was not going thick 1 but that's 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.729
 a good cream for the face or for 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.280
 the body or as we wanted 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.020
 a lot the texture to finish i'm going 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:54.360
 put the conservative so I was ten 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.360
 10 drops and I'm going to mix 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.639
 this is a creamy base you see it's 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.960
 very very simple after as I you 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.160
 said it's a base from which you can 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.260
 put oils fragrances 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.830
 essential liquid assets or in 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.840
 powder 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.889
 after must be goodbye it's true that 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.630
 sometimes it can be a bit complicated 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.479
 it is necessary to review at the level of 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.160
 low percentages of the batch cream of 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.380
 minutes so fond of all of them 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.570
 ingredients to put them in I 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.330
 how to say I would do it I think a 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.740
 otan cream with how there is another 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.750
 and mystifying it can be nice for 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.539
 other people I think like that 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.500
 can give you a little bit of ideas 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.240
 about the cream you want to do 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.430
 it's true because the stuff is so 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.099
 well detailed inside their 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.260
 descriptive sheets so that's for the 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.120
 cream I hope my video will have you 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.510
 rained and then bah I say to you very 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.810
 soon 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.810
 bye
