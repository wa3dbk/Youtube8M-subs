00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello, friend, web surfer 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.010
 good afternoon good morning or good night to be right 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.700
 there the time you are seeing this 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 kiss my name is muriel spider and me 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.750
 I'm here to teach you how. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.150
 configure your iphone so that it 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.150
 operate your remote control 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.769
 television set or smart tv from the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.779
 lg brand 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.910
 so the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 to have this combination work 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.930
 well it 's a makeover in my case an iphone 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.840
 3g still because it is old but it is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.300
 working perfectly still then 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.000
 you have an iPhone you access 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.280
 normal programming is that itunes is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 this guy here and this one, everybody you go 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 download the applications you come here in 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.420
 application searches and type l 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 gtv remote will show some options 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.600
 lines 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.020
 I recommend these two options first 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.579
 Your TV set was made in the year 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.030
 2011 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.650
 You lower that if your football was to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.400
 factory of the year from 2012 to low this 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.990
 right there that happens in both options 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.909
 if you will have the application description 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.430
 right and for which models of 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.210
 TVs that this application will 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.460
 function with greater credibility then 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.909
 Do you look for the make and model of your 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.549
 TV and down according to model 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.860
 once downloaded and installed on your 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.649
 phone it will ask you to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.420
 type a a a numeric string 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.149
 buy communication from the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.509
 your phone's application with your 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.840
 lg and that's what I'm going to show you 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.070
 or these options and running the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.950
 the resource itself is not 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.290
 iphone mobile phone as remote control 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.110
 that 's a hand on the wheel so let's go 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.989
 So let's see how this works. 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.400
 hello continuing the presentation to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.830
 first thing you have to have one 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.000
 animal are 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.680
 the phone with the iphone hands you go there 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.910
 of course is to leave the TV on 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.460
 in the right lg brand goes after having 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.030
 downloaded the application installed itself 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.490
 iphone your run your application 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.990
 in this case he is here already being 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.320
 running in the background 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.110
 and you will see that as you tighten the 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.360
 button for more volume and less volume it 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.640
 will appear on the screen 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.160
 Hi, how are you? 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.220
 button that he is appearing in the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:58.459
 screen down the volume was finding 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.290
 right name my channel change and not 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.630
 it will work fine to change channels because 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.209
 he has a special box 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.580
 I change the channel of my device 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.400
 Clear TV, right? 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.230
 but with the option for example of home 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.720
 home grip he goes there for rone's option 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:22.519
 I'm going to spend my time here. 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.300
 finger it will drive the cursor on the 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.630
 device so that it can be 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.590
 make it easier for me to navigate my 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.769
 navigation on the TV number here 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.070
 between us is a hand on the wheel, right? 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:43.730
 I'm here I'm going to tighten up 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.980
 it will load carried the here I go 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.010

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.120
 known for the weather weather for example 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.190
