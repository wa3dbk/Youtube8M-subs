00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:05.500
 so I get high school percent 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.570
 you will be closer and closer 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.209
 how long are you going to 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:33.820
 get in shape 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:35.530
 to me is to see in the first part 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.600
 yes because both friends have a lot 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:48.539
 of things to say an essential role and 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:48.539
 good luck then when you see versa 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.940
 I think we have things with 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.350
 which will have to be yes I was going to 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.969
 please it's true I would really 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.760
 applied cost of leaving to type the 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.820
 door at that moment that's what I 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.030
 wanted to tell you is that yes we are 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.890
 not even seems it happens to me very often 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.930
 it's something that I feel 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.610
 I wanted you to know this when 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.409
 sings or when we have a seem I stop 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.850
 not to feel had a very strong connection between 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.300
 we agree you see what I want 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.100
 to say yes I see today as you 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.750
 we're going to watch the video I'm 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.690
 felt close to you finally the 10% the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.520
 sides what I mean yes it's 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.050
 exactly what I came by 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.300
 example when we watched this video 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:37.630
 I wanted you to embrace is ok 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:41.200
 This is not to excuse the better you 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.770
 had to know school site then is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.280
 that you think we should be growing 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.750
 then to feel better the reflections 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 see well this February 8 at the moment when es 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.870
 you're right is what we see goal on 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.700
 bullets 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:06.370
 I want to beat lose no I believe when 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.160
 not even of course that granny yes I believe 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.950
 that my opinion maybe that with time 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.660
 it's going to end with it going to pass 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.920
 with time if you are not sometimes 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.480
 it did not say anything else in front 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.670
 usual appear then did it 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.410
 motivated there is hardly any more waiting 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.180
 she will not deny what we feel because 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.100
 it's about almost all we 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.230
 will not make a decision with 22 jan of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.650
 to tend to be one wants less to be done 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.650
 this next 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.349
 finally c 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:40.470
 I 'm leaving but far from being either 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:43.140
 will always be ben ali but it will be good 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.560
 to say that we managed to find the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.550
 solution 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:02.970
 we will remain a nice star to this rule 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:03:06.019
 and back on his shares and yes who 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.019
 romantic comedy
