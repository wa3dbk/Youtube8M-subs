you guys but I always thought that the 5
octa<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.750> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.050> lte-capable<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
octa was not going to be lte-capable and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
octa was not going to be lte-capable and

the Snapdragon 600 here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.170 
the Snapdragon 600 here
this<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:13.980> lte-capable<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
this is going to be lte-capable and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.490 
this is going to be lte-capable and
that's<00:02:15.330> why<00:02:15.540> there<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.900> two<00:02:16.170> different

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
that's why there is two different

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.460 
that's why there is two different
versions<00:02:16.920> well<00:02:17.480> samsung<00:02:18.480> confirmed<00:02:18.930> through

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
versions well samsung confirmed through

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.800 
versions well samsung confirmed through
twitter<00:02:19.830> stating<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.819> their<00:02:21.090> five<00:02:21.420> off<00:02:21.629> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
twitter stating that their five off the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.380 
twitter stating that their five off the
chip<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:23.250> handle<00:02:23.819> LTE<00:02:24.209> bins<00:02:24.959> which<00:02:26.390> means

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
chip can handle LTE bins which means

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.589 
chip can handle LTE bins which means
that<00:02:27.840> there's<00:02:28.080> another<00:02:28.440> reason<00:02:28.769> for<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:30.390> two

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
that there's another reason for the two

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.110 
that there's another reason for the two
different<00:02:30.720> smartphones<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.800> guess<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.940> has<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
different smartphones I guess it has to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.400 
different smartphones I guess it has to
do<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.800> about<00:02:34.800> their<00:02:35.099> supply<00:02:36.080> there<00:02:37.080> they

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
do with about their supply there they

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.440 
do with about their supply there they
were<00:02:37.470> saying<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.519> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.120> hard

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
were saying that it was going to be hard

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.400 
were saying that it was going to be hard
to<00:02:39.780> keep<00:02:40.049> up<00:02:40.230> with<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.620> man<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.250> one

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
to keep up with the man with one

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.780 
to keep up with the man with one
processor<00:02:43.410> alone<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:44.129> they<00:02:44.160> have<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.640> two

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
processor alone so they have the two

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.520 
processor alone so they have the two
different<00:02:45.150> processor<00:02:45.690> versions<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.319> guess

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
different processor versions I guess

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.699 
different processor versions I guess
that<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:46.769> make<00:02:46.830> sense<00:02:47.150> considering<00:02:48.150> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
that would make sense considering that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.860 
that would make sense considering that
they're<00:02:49.709> thinking<00:02:50.099> about<00:02:50.370> selling<00:02:51.209> record

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
they're thinking about selling record

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.400 
they're thinking about selling record
amounts<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.860> smartphones<00:02:53.810> as<00:02:54.810> soon<00:02:55.110> as<00:02:55.260> this

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
amounts of smartphones as soon as this

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.850 
amounts of smartphones as soon as this

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
the possibility that it just being an

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.390 
the possibility that it just being an
application<00:05:26.410> could<00:05:27.410> actually<00:05:27.620> be<00:05:27.950> up<00:05:28.130> there<00:05:28.370> I

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
application could actually be up there I

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.330 
application could actually be up there I
mean<00:05:28.670> remember<00:05:29.030> Facebook<00:05:29.780> did<00:05:29.990> go<00:05:30.200> public<00:05:30.980> on

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
mean remember Facebook did go public on

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.340 
mean remember Facebook did go public on
the<00:05:31.610> stock<00:05:31.850> market<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.540> did<00:05:32.780> not<00:05:32.900> do<00:05:33.140> as<00:05:33.320> well

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
the stock market and did not do as well

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.580 
the stock market and did not do as well
as<00:05:33.590> they<00:05:33.770> expected<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:35.380> introducing<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.560> new

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
as they expected so introducing a new

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.620 
as they expected so introducing a new
facebook<00:05:37.220> application<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:38.000> is<00:05:38.120> much<00:05:38.330> better

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
facebook application that is much better

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.500 
facebook application that is much better
will<00:05:39.440> probably<00:05:39.860> help<00:05:40.040> them<00:05:40.220> out<00:05:40.510> introducing

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
will probably help them out introducing

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
will probably help them out introducing
a<00:05:41.600> new<00:05:41.630> smartphone<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.980> is<00:05:43.490> Facebook

a new smartphone that is Facebook

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.290 
a new smartphone that is Facebook
oriented<00:05:45.530> then<00:05:45.950> that<00:05:46.520> might<00:05:46.760> actually<00:05:46.970> be<00:05:47.270> a

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
oriented then that might actually be a

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.370 
oriented then that might actually be a
very<00:05:47.800> like<00:05:49.000> big<00:05:50.000> risk<00:05:50.330> for<00:05:50.480> them<00:05:50.780> especially

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
very like big risk for them especially

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.320 
very like big risk for them especially
