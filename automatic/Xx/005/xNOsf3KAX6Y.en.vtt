00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
chief concern is so that we can approach

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.499 
chief concern is so that we can approach
this<00:01:13.039> diagnostically<00:01:13.999> as<00:01:14.210> well<00:01:14.390> as

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
this diagnostically as well as

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.999 
this diagnostically as well as
therapeutically<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:15.560> know<00:01:15.649> whether<00:01:15.859> it

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
therapeutically you know whether it

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.469 
therapeutically you know whether it
might<00:01:16.189> mean<00:01:16.429> a<00:01:16.460> procedure<00:01:16.880> whether<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.359> might

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
might mean a procedure whether it might

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.749 
might mean a procedure whether it might
mean<00:01:17.869> further<00:01:18.229> office<00:01:18.590> visits<00:01:18.889> it<00:01:19.429> has<00:01:19.609> to

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
mean further office visits it has to

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.099 
mean further office visits it has to
really<00:01:19.909> be<00:01:19.969> an<00:01:20.149> individual<00:01:20.569> by<00:01:20.689> individual

communication I do need the patient to

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.109 
communication I do need the patient to
be<00:01:27.139> patient<00:01:27.499> there<00:01:28.340> are<00:01:28.579> times<00:01:28.819> where<00:01:28.999> it's

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
be patient there are times where it's

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.279 
be patient there are times where it's
hard<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.420> arrive<00:01:29.689> at<00:01:29.959> the<00:01:30.399> diagnosis<00:01:31.399> and<00:01:32.289> it

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
hard to arrive at the diagnosis and it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.020 
hard to arrive at the diagnosis and it
might<00:01:33.469> take<00:01:33.709> some<00:01:33.859> trial<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.280> error<00:01:34.429> that's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
might take some trial and error that's

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.849 
might take some trial and error that's
okay<00:01:35.479> that's<00:01:35.749> a<00:01:35.899> lot<00:01:36.109> of<00:01:36.139> what<00:01:36.439> we<00:01:36.560> do<00:01:36.709> in

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
okay that's a lot of what we do in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.649 
okay that's a lot of what we do in
gastroenterology<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.999> as<00:01:38.090> long<00:01:38.299> as<00:01:38.329> the

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
gastroenterology and as long as the

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.209 
gastroenterology and as long as the
patient<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:39.020> aware<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.530> then<00:01:40.039> I<00:01:40.069> think

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
patient is aware of that then I think

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:41.260 
patient is aware of that then I think
we're<00:01:40.340> gonna<00:01:40.429> have<00:01:40.639> a<00:01:40.700> good<00:01:40.880> working
