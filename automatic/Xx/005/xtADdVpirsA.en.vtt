00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.430
 hello in today's chapter of the 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.080
 tips and from anto we will teach you to 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.120
 segment your facebook posts 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.740
 that is to say that with your page you can launch 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.360
 a message that only people see 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.800
 speak in a certain language or that 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.590
 have a certain marital status 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.750
 for this we are going to activate a small 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.210
 icon that appears by default if 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.099
 we are going to create a state in our 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.869
 page and we write a text we see that 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.759
 we have the option on one side of 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.739
 schedule and on the other hand give the 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.059
 location but there is a third icon that 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.559
 is the one that we are going to activate now that the 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.989
 that will let us then segment 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.730
 our publications the first thing is very 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.710
 important is that you are working on 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.720
 our page as a page, not as a 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.269
 profile that is on a page but as 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.729
 a page so we're going to edit the 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.190
 page just above our image of 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.320
 cover and we give you use facebook as in 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.269
 this case and stop and we're already 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.489
 working as the page and we can 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.500
 check because the icon in the corner 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.900
 upper right changes and acquires the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.000
 the brand that we are working 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.930
 I have done this we give to edit the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.460
 page 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.840
 again on top of the image of 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.450
 cover and we give you edit the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.750
 configuration 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.039
 panel deployed to help 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.719
 configure different aspects of 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.890
 our facebook page but we 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.740
 we will be in which it appears 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.360
 manage permissions and within manage 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.070
 the permit almost at the end we have a 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.049
 option that says privacy of the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.569
 publications by default appears 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.380
 unmarked but let's mark it and it 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.380
 we give to save changes 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.120
 and it stays saved and now we can 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.120
 go back to our page 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.090
 now once we have activated this 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.680
 option we will see that that new 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.760
 icon that we did not have before we go to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.760
 write a state for example 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.280
 good morning but we put it in English 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.530
 because because we are going to tell facebook 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.150
 that this message is only seen by people 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.610
 who speak English even if they are watching 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.040
 our page in Spanish if we look 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 at the bottom of the box 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.420
 postings a new icon has been created this 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.369
 icon that is shaped like a bullseye or 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.170
 gun peephole 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.090
 Pressing it creates a recording that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.580
 says add segmentation and it's very 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.500
 important to notice that right next to us 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.599
 gives the total target audience to whom 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.220
 can the page arrive now as 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.450
 is not segmented reaches the total of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.849
 followers that the page has 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.550
 we give you to add segmentation and we have 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.590
 new options to filter the state 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.319
 who is going to get in this case we are going to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.530
 give it to language and within languages ​​by 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.910
 example let's tell you English English from 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.060
 USA 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.150
 and English from the United Kingdom and we give 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.290
 target languages we see that our 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.960
 target audience has decreased quite 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.880
 in particular it has remained at 160 because 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.360
 are the people who follow our 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.490
 page that have English language 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.590
 predefined in its characteristics or 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.020
 as the default language if now 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.540
 we publish this state we're just going to 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.190
 receive those people this is an option 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.360
 very useful to segment our 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.100
 publications and reach the public 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.040
 objective that we have established in the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.780
 communication strategy 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.780
 thank you very much I hope you have served
