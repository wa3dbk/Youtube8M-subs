00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
where they wouldn't move it's a good

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.919 
where they wouldn't move it's a good
idea<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:52.070> soak<00:00:52.280> them<00:00:52.460> in<00:00:52.640> PB<00:00:53.030> Blaster<00:00:53.570> or<00:00:53.719> some

other kind of penetrating Lube but I
resorted<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:56.839> beating<00:00:57.170> on<00:00:57.289> them<00:00:57.440> with<00:00:57.589> a

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
hammer this is not the best way to go as

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.689 
hammer this is not the best way to go as
you'll<00:01:00.530> see<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.769> little<00:01:00.980> bit<00:01:01.160> later<00:01:01.370> in<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
you'll see a little bit later in the

video
there<00:01:02.570> are<00:01:02.719> definitely<00:01:03.140> better<00:01:03.379> ways<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.649> do

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
there are definitely better ways to do

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.740 
there are definitely better ways to do
it<00:01:03.980> but<00:01:04.790> if<00:01:04.879> you're<00:01:05.030> getting<00:01:05.269> impatient

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
it but if you're getting impatient

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.410 
it but if you're getting impatient
sometimes<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.680> hammer<00:01:06.890> will<00:01:07.159> work

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.730 

once<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.600> bolts<00:01:11.900> come<00:01:12.110> loose<00:01:12.350> with<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
once the bolts come loose with the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.890 
once the bolts come loose with the
box-end<00:01:13.160> wrench<00:01:13.190> I<00:01:13.700> like<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.360> switch<00:01:14.570> over<00:01:14.720> to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900

box-end wrench I like to switch over to
a<00:01:15.050> ratchet<00:01:15.620> to<00:01:15.650> get<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.010> bolts<00:01:16.250> out<00:01:16.370> a<00:01:16.400> little

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
a ratchet to get the bolts out a little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
a ratchet to get the bolts out a little
bit<00:01:16.700> faster

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.330 

at<00:01:22.570> some<00:01:22.869> point<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.320> can<00:01:23.470> finish<00:01:23.710> them<00:01:23.920> off<00:01:24.070> by

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
at some point you can finish them off by

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.109 
at some point you can finish them off by
hand<00:01:25.740> there's<00:01:26.740> just<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.310> two<00:01:27.340> bolts<00:01:27.970> holding

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119

hand there's just the two bolts holding
the<00:01:28.450> caliper<00:01:28.930> in<00:01:29.049> place<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.799> once<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.159> get<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
the caliper in place so once you get the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.310 
the caliper in place so once you get the
second<00:01:30.790> one<00:01:30.820> off<00:01:31.119> you're<00:01:31.720> ready<00:01:31.900> to<00:01:32.080> start

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
second one off you're ready to start

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.649 
second one off you're ready to start
pulling<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.799> caliper<00:01:33.310> off<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:34.240> should<00:01:34.509> be

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
pulling that caliper off you should be

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.539 
pulling that caliper off you should be
able<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:35.020> just<00:01:35.229> kind<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.500> wiggle<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.159> pull

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
able to just kind of wiggle it and pull

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.910 
able to just kind of wiggle it and pull
it<00:01:36.580> out<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.150> should<00:01:37.780> pop<00:01:37.990> right<00:01:38.020> off<00:01:38.290> fairly

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
it out and should pop right off fairly

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.999 
it out and should pop right off fairly
easily<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.600> brake<00:01:40.869> hose<00:01:41.110> attached<00:01:41.649> to<00:01:41.890> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
easily the brake hose attached to the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.789 
easily the brake hose attached to the
caliper<00:01:42.369> is<00:01:42.670> somewhat<00:01:43.600> delicate<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.500> instead

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
caliper is somewhat delicate so instead

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.590 
caliper is somewhat delicate so instead
of<00:01:44.860> letting<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.340> caliper<00:01:45.790> hang<00:01:46.000> by<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.299> hose

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
of letting the caliper hang by the hose

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.690 
of letting the caliper hang by the hose
you'll<00:01:47.229> want<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.500> bend<00:01:47.740> up<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:48.009> piece<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.369> hanger

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
you'll want to bend up a piece of hanger

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.469 
you'll want to bend up a piece of hanger
like<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.240> hook<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.649> coils<00:01:51.070> of<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
like this hook it to the coils of the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.880 
like this hook it to the coils of the
suspension<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.630> then<00:01:53.170> slide<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.619> through<00:01:53.649> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
suspension and then slide it through the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.590 
suspension and then slide it through the
caliper<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.149> weight<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.390> the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
caliper so that the weight of the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600 
caliper so that the weight of the
caliper<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.170> hanging<00:01:56.470> on<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.740> wire<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.250> not

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
caliper is hanging on the wire and not

caliper is hanging on the wire and not
on<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.060> hose<00:01:58.210> with<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.170> brake<00:01:59.560> pads<00:01:59.950> exposed

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
on the hose with the brake pads exposed

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.090 
on the hose with the brake pads exposed
you<00:02:01.030> can<00:02:01.240> now<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.690> wiggle<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.619> slide

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
you can now just wiggle it and slide

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.980 
you can now just wiggle it and slide
that<00:02:03.340> brake<00:02:03.700> pad<00:02:04.000> right<00:02:04.300> out<00:02:04.539> of<00:02:04.780> the

that brake pad right out of the
remaining<00:02:05.380> bracket<00:02:05.979> piece<00:02:06.509> there's<00:02:07.509> just<00:02:07.780> a

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
remaining bracket piece there's just a

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.270 
remaining bracket piece there's just a
couple<00:02:08.019> little<00:02:08.380> channels<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.069> slides

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
couple little channels that it slides

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.699 
couple little channels that it slides
out<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.610> if<00:02:09.970> you're<00:02:10.660> unfamiliar<00:02:11.170> with<00:02:11.319> this

out of if you're unfamiliar with this
type<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.010> vehicle<00:02:12.640> go<00:02:13.480> ahead<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.810> take<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.019> look

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
type of vehicle go ahead and take a look

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.410 
type of vehicle go ahead and take a look
at<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> brake<00:02:14.739> pads<00:02:15.040> as<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.670> remove<00:02:15.970> them<00:02:16.180> so

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
at the brake pads as you remove them so

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.759 
at the brake pads as you remove them so
that<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.810> remember<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.290> way<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.590> they

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
that you can remember the way that they

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.820 
that you can remember the way that they
go<00:02:17.950> back<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.630> back<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.380> same<00:02:20.590> way

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
go back on the back one is the same way

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.410 
go back on the back one is the same way
and<00:02:21.069> sometimes<00:02:21.400> they<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.060> little<00:02:22.209> bit

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
and sometimes they do get a little bit

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.690 
and sometimes they do get a little bit
stiff<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.500> need<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:23.950> kind<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.280> work

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
stiff but you need to just kind of work

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.780 
stiff but you need to just kind of work
them<00:02:24.910> until<00:02:25.180> they<00:02:25.269> slide<00:02:25.570> right<00:02:25.600> out<00:02:26.790> there's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
them until they slide right out there's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.060 
them until they slide right out there's
two<00:02:28.120> screws<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.600> hold<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.260> disk<00:02:29.530> onto<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
two screws that hold the disk onto the

screwdriver to remove them to get the
disk<00:02:36.190> off<00:02:36.430> you'll<00:02:36.880> need<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.209> remove<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
disk off you'll need to remove the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.560 
disk off you'll need to remove the
caliper<00:02:38.079> bracket<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.769> well<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.880> also<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.360> held

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
caliper bracket as well it also is held

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:50.890

in<00:02:40.750> by<00:02:40.810> two<00:02:41.019> fourteen<00:02:41.769> millimeter<00:02:42.010> bolts

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.190 

I<00:02:52.360> think<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.450> mentioned<00:02:53.659> a<00:02:53.870> little<00:02:54.049> earlier

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
I think I mentioned a little earlier

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.500 
I think I mentioned a little earlier
that<00:02:54.709> beaten<00:02:55.129> on<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> wrench<00:02:55.819> with<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> hammers

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
that beaten on a wrench with a hammers

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.020 
that beaten on a wrench with a hammers
not<00:02:56.689> that<00:02:56.900> great<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.230> an<00:02:57.349> idea<00:02:57.790> here's<00:02:58.790> where

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
not that great of an idea here's where

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:06.520 
not that great of an idea here's where
it<00:02:59.150> all<00:02:59.239> went<00:02:59.540> south<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:04.870> didn't<00:03:05.870> realize<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.379> at

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
it all went south I didn't realize it at

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.349 
it all went south I didn't realize it at
the<00:03:06.560> time<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:07.159> that<00:03:07.189> last<00:03:07.609> hit<00:03:07.939> with<00:03:08.209> the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
the time but that last hit with the

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.479 
the time but that last hit with the
hammer<00:03:08.569> was<00:03:08.900> enough<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.319> break<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.829> bolt<00:03:10.189> off

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
hammer was enough to break that bolt off

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.089 
hammer was enough to break that bolt off
and<00:03:10.819> once<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.659> hit<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.140> ratchet<00:03:12.799> it

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
and once I hit it with the ratchet it

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.979 
and once I hit it with the ratchet it
actually<00:03:13.549> came<00:03:13.790> off<00:03:13.819> right<00:03:14.329> in<00:03:14.480> my<00:03:14.629> hand

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
actually came off right in my hand

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.559 
actually came off right in my hand
even<00:03:15.890> with<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.220> broken<00:03:16.459> bolt<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.120> caliper

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569

there's<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.939> little<00:03:20.120> remaining<00:03:20.540> piece<00:03:20.829> we'll

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
there's the little remaining piece we'll

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:22.990 
there's the little remaining piece we'll
show<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.010> how<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.250> remove<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.609> in<00:03:22.909> a

there<00:03:30.230> pretty<00:03:30.409> good<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.950> we<00:03:31.069> had<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.280> hit<00:03:31.430> it

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
there pretty good and we had to hit it

that was fine in our situation because
