to look for is dependent on what kind of
controller<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> 3<00:01:20.729> channel

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
controller you got we have a 3 channel

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.719 
controller you got we have a 3 channel
sha<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.439> DMX<00:01:22.830> controller<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.610> we're

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
sha of a DMX controller here so we're

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
sha of a DMX controller here so we're
going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.200> through<00:01:25.439> here

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
going to go so go back through here

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.249 
going to go so go back through here
again<00:01:25.710> we're<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.360> 3<00:01:27.840> channel

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
again we're going to go to the 3 channel

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.760 
again we're going to go to the 3 channel
we're<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> enter<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> now<00:01:31.530> we're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
we're going to enter so now we're

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
we're going to enter so now we're
telling<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.630> unit<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.110> controlled

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
telling this unit to be controlled

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
telling this unit to be controlled
through<00:01:34.979> DMX<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
through DMX and that it's going to

through DMX and that it's going to
operate<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.790> looking<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.299> 3

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
operate it's going to be looking for 3

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.109 
operate it's going to be looking for 3
channels<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.560> control<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.090> a

channel<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> write<00:01:59.670> hit<00:01:59.850> enter<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
channel so write hit enter all right so

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.069 
channel so write hit enter all right so
let's<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.710> over<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> DMX<00:02:02.820> controller<00:02:03.329> now

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.999 

so<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.229> our<00:02:07.530> shot<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.160> obey<00:02:08.520> 3<00:02:09.000> controller

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
so this is our shot a obey 3 controller

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.160 
so this is our shot a obey 3 controller
and<00:02:11.009> there's<00:02:11.160> two<00:02:11.400> main<00:02:11.700> ways<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.720> you're

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and there's two main ways that you're

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.530 
and there's two main ways that you're
going<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
going to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.849 
going to
use<00:02:13.659> this<00:02:13.959> in<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.920> church<00:02:15.159> settings<00:02:15.610> probably

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
use this in a church settings probably

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.899 
use this in a church settings probably
one<00:02:17.859> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.040> ways<00:02:18.189> is<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.879> manual<00:02:19.510> RGB<00:02:20.200> so

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
one of the ways is this manual RGB so

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.149 
one of the ways is this manual RGB so
internalize<00:02:21.909> down<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.680> turn<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:23.920> this

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
internalize down if I turn on this

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.190 
internalize down if I turn on this
manual<00:02:24.400> RGB<00:02:25.150> you'll<00:02:25.569> see<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.930> I've<00:02:26.049> got

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
manual RGB you'll see that I've got

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.490 
manual RGB you'll see that I've got
controls<00:02:26.620> for<00:02:26.799> red<00:02:27.040> green<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.030> blue<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:29.349> if<00:02:29.439> I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
controls for red green and blue so if I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.460 
controls for red green and blue so if I
turn<00:02:29.680> up<00:02:29.709> red<00:02:30.099> I<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:32.560> red<00:02:34.049> turn<00:02:35.049> up<00:02:35.170> green

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
turn up red I get red turn up green

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.360 
turn up red I get red turn up green
green<00:02:36.280> blue<00:02:36.989> blue<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.319> I<00:02:38.799> can<00:02:38.980> mix<00:02:39.220> them

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
green blue blue and I can mix them

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.929 
green blue blue and I can mix them
together<00:02:41.700> alright

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
together alright

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.830 
together alright
so<00:02:43.239> good<00:02:43.930> control<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.379> mix<00:02:45.209> so<00:02:46.209> that's<00:02:46.329> manual

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
so good control the mix so that's manual

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.360 
so good control the mix so that's manual
RGB<00:02:47.319> now<00:02:47.799> if<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.010> turn<00:02:48.220> off<00:02:48.250> manual<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:51.040> it's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
RGB now if I turn off manual now it's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.990 
RGB now if I turn off manual now it's
going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.909> default<00:02:52.510> over<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.260> these<00:02:54.010> presets

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
going to default over to these presets

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.759 
going to default over to these presets
here<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.379> I<00:02:56.409> can<00:02:56.739> turn<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:58.379> and<00:03:01.769> now

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
here and so I can turn this up and now

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.800 
here and so I can turn this up and now
now<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.189> controls<00:03:03.669> when<00:03:04.239> I'm<00:03:04.359> using<00:03:04.599> these

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
now the controls when I'm using these

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.849 
now the controls when I'm using these
presets<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:07.169> control<00:03:08.169> here<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.650> going<00:03:08.799> to

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
presets this control here is going to

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.460 
presets this control here is going to
control<00:03:09.220> how<00:03:09.849> fast<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.629> fade<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.079> from<00:03:11.319> one

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
control how fast the fade is from one

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.670 
control how fast the fade is from one
color<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.829> another<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.659> this<00:03:13.659> control<00:03:14.139> here

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
color to another and this control here

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.360 
color to another and this control here
is<00:03:14.859> going<00:03:15.579> to<00:03:15.790> control<00:03:16.269> how<00:03:16.629> bright<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:18.010> gets

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
is going to control how bright it gets

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.039 
is going to control how bright it gets
so<00:03:19.239> master<00:03:19.959> brightness<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:21.449> so<00:03:22.449> if<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.870> have

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
so master brightness and so if I have

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.780 
so master brightness and so if I have
this<00:03:23.229> all<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.470> way<00:03:23.620> up<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.859> top<00:03:24.129> the<00:03:24.579> fade

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
this all the way up to the top the fade

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.039 
this all the way up to the top the fade
is<00:03:24.940> going<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.120> be<00:03:25.180> really<00:03:25.449> short<00:03:25.479> between

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
is going to be really short between

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.710 
is going to be really short between
colors<00:03:26.409> right<00:03:26.769> now<00:03:26.949> it's<00:03:27.250> on<00:03:27.430> bloom<00:03:27.849> I'm<00:03:28.569> gonna

red<00:03:30.129> button<00:03:30.780> let's<00:03:31.780> see<00:03:31.900> if<00:03:31.959> we<00:03:32.049> can<00:03:32.340> get<00:03:33.340> both

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
red button let's see if we can get both

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.250 
red button let's see if we can get both
in<00:03:33.729> the<00:03:33.790> picture<00:03:35.639> so<00:03:36.639> I<00:03:36.669> can<00:03:36.940> change<00:03:37.359> really

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
in the picture so I can change really

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.330 
in the picture so I can change really
quick<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:39.150> turn<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.389> fader<00:03:40.659> down<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:42.190> going

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
quick I turn this fader down it's going

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.520 
quick I turn this fader down it's going
to<00:03:42.400> make<00:03:42.639> that<00:03:42.989> going<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.049> make<00:03:44.169> the<00:03:44.290> fade

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
to make that going to make the fade

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.710 
to make that going to make the fade
between<00:03:44.979> colors<00:03:45.459> take<00:03:46.000> longer<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.540> I'm<00:03:46.599> going

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
between colors take longer so I'm going

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.050 
between colors take longer so I'm going
to<00:03:46.780> hit<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.930> red<00:03:47.079> button<00:03:47.109> now<00:03:49.349> that<00:03:50.940> takes<00:03:51.940> a

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
to hit the red button now that takes a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.020 
to hit the red button now that takes a
little<00:03:52.180> while<00:03:52.329> to<00:03:52.389> fade<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:54.220> pricing<00:03:54.699> here<00:03:54.879> on

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
little while to fade the pricing here on

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.610 
little while to fade the pricing here on
video<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.599> looks<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.109> strobing<00:03:56.560> a

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
video it looks like it's strobing a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.309 
video it looks like it's strobing a
little<00:03:56.829> bit<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.189> person<00:03:57.579> it's<00:03:57.729> not<00:03:58.109> it's<00:03:59.109> just

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
little bit in person it's not it's just

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.349 
little bit in person it's not it's just
because<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.620> LEDs<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.519> waiting<00:04:01.060> on

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
because the LEDs and the waiting on

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.580 
because the LEDs and the waiting on
marks<00:04:01.659> for<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.069> video<00:04:03.069> sensor<00:04:04.229> all<00:04:05.229> right<00:04:05.379> in

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
marks for the video sensor all right in

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.089 
marks for the video sensor all right in
this<00:04:05.739> up<00:04:05.919> I<00:04:06.010> pick<00:04:06.189> green<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:08.560> going<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.829> fade

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
this up I pick green it's going to fade

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.499 
this up I pick green it's going to fade
slowly<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:09.970> green<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:12.879> like<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.150> said<00:04:13.299> if<00:04:13.419> I

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:13.509 
slowly to green and like I said if I

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.539 
slowly to green and like I said if I
move<00:04:13.689> that<00:04:13.870> up<00:04:14.109> it's<00:04:14.979> going<00:04:15.159> to<00:04:15.220> make<00:04:15.370> those

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
move that up it's going to make those

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.699 
move that up it's going to make those
fades<00:04:15.790> quicker<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:19.329> block<00:04:19.630> out

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
fades quicker that block out

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.700 
fades quicker that block out
I'm<00:04:21.310> gonna<00:04:21.489> do<00:04:22.530> all<00:04:23.530> right

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
I'm gonna do all right

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.850 
I'm gonna do all right
so<00:04:24.100> that's<00:04:24.759> the<00:04:24.910> basic<00:04:25.300> controls<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.139> obey

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
so that's the basic controls on the obey
