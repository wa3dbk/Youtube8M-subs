 if they could immerse themselves in the sea 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.750
 they would observe a paradise 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.120
 a universe of colors and shapes that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.969
 they show the magic and mysteries of the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.510
 oceans where many species of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.510
 animals 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.380
 with coral reefs of consume 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.649
 in the state of quintana roo to the southeast 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.140
 from Mexico is the island of Cozumel 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.829
 whose coasts we can find 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.600
 coral reefs on this island are 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.390
 find the national park of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.909
 reefs of cozumel to thousands of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.549
 organisms live and reproduce under the 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:59.030
 water and form incredible ecosystems 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.799
 submarines which are dynamic and the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.190
 energy is used in a cycle 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.520
 perfect life on these reefs 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.340
 animals like anemones and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.130
 the octopuses that with their tentacles 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.950
 they catch small crabs that with 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.440
 their pincers catch their prey and a 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.440
 endless multicolored fish that 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.490
 They feed on marine plants and coexist 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.340
 in a delicate ecosystem the corals and 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.539
 the other inhabitants of the reef 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.209
 take advantage of different forms of 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.670
 food present in the sea the 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.159
 coral reef is a colony of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.390
 marine organisms formed by small 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.909
 animal 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.280
 calcium-based polyps create 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.860
 large coral formations 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.100
 polyps are hidden during the day and in 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.350
 the night with the help of its tentacles 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.990
 They capture blandÃ³n formed by very algae 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.080
 small and other microorganisms that 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.270
 several species float near them 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.970
 of fish not only find protection 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.790
 in the corals but some of them 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.190
 feeds polio on the reefs it 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.289
 form food chains from 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.500
 the seaweeds that are the food 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.150
 Basic small fish or sponges 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.760
 these in turn become prey 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.360
 of snails sea slugs fish 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.100
 butterflies stools balloons and octopuses that are 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.430
 food of other larger species 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.530
 the coral reefs are the refuge or 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.900
 food of endangered species 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.540
 extinction 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.640
 many coral reefs have been 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.430
 declared national parties for 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.920
 protect them we can also 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.200
 help your protection by avoiding 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.549
 Water pollution and trade 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.549
 illegal of marine species
