00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.470
 as far as I'm concerned no barbecue without it 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.450
 burger so the weather is very nice 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.590
 I will treat myself to a real one 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.360
 rib eye 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.760
 cheeseburger and what do you have for that 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.060
 Need the very best meat of course 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.460
 and a barbecue 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.110
 I take the schedule off 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.239
 you put the blocks on the bottom 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.430
 then grill charcoal 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.869
 I like it because you just got there 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.079
 slightly tasty flavor to the meat from 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.079
 gets 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.829
 then the last four bad ones on top and 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.750
 light it clean 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.879
 the ripa is a wonderful piece of beef 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.590
 with much more fat dorade than a normal one 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.899
 steak gives an incredibly tasty 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.000
 taste and also a good bond later 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.970
 when making the burger that you cut 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.739
 turn it into strips then you turn it one 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.600
 quarter turn and make those strips 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.220
 small cubes 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.750
 you keep actually cutting the meat in 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.120
 ever smaller pieces 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.500
 until you have minced it is only necessary 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.330
 yet to be seasoned a 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.780
 little mousse between sauce 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.180
 sigh evert okay that's all right 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.250
 through for the perfect hamburger 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.840
 I use today hamburger press you 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.939
 put a little olive oil in it 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.799
 the meat itself is also super 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.060
 fat but if you put it in here in a minute 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.420
 press wants it to stay sometime 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.320
 paste that beef in equally well 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.150
 press on 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.360
 This is really a top inventions you 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.490
 gets here every time 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.619
 super nice hamburger stand if you like it 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.240
 well if you want to shave a side dish then you can 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.590
 you just put your hand to the small 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.079
 make ball 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.450
 ok citizens cindy good i'm ready 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.950

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.829
 of course you do citizen 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.609
 and draws your coarse rings 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.159
 cuts 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.619
 and then of course the break in 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.240
 this case a little thin slices 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.249
 but you can also speak breakfast 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.679
 use non-bacon strips 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.609
 it just depends on where you are at this 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.329
 is warm 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:02.950
 you can do this by hand 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.950
 put the slices in the middle 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.760
 and the bacon is also good before the 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.530
 burgers on the whim go throw snack quite 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.540
 smooth the sandwiches in half 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.760
 lift them with the cutting edge and from the grill 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.760
 and so must be with the second or thirty 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.430

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.040

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.660

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.989

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.620

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.209
