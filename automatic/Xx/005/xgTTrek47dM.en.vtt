00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.959
 short the people and welcome 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.450
 Israel phlegmatically welcome to one 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.369
 new update video and that is yesterday 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.480
 a bit more what happens to the cisco 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.000
 and now there is the huntsman 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.250
 cancer naturally with skins and 9live 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.680
 furthermore, five new weapons one man 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.099
 handy in game after the round print 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.130
 can 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.379
 the emerald ak-47 will be very, very much there 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.530
 worth and a new sticker capsule 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.879
 came out with 18 19 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.620
 and this video team practically does not work 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.079
 just to update but I want you 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.180
 now two variants show the one 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.309
 Require a bit of luck both require 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.820
 luck but a little bit more than that 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.620
 other 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.649
 the one that requires more luck is whole 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.059
 easy money clearly I would 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.620
 just a bit paysafe no now 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.609
 Clueless suffers the 50 euro or super 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.399
 on it and then we come to the point the 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.030
 huntsman cats are just 720 702's 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.840
 in circulation 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.910
 the price fluctuates so the price was also 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.100
 already at 3 90 for the short moment 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.640
 but already at 650 and now mine 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.890
 tip to you yes buy the boxes if the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.080
 in the border near five euros 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.780
 are so whether the 15 or 25 now costs 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.789
 490 buys the weir because right 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.660
 blatantly now I would already 538 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.899
 to buy superior 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.750
 who nevertheless kaster I assure 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.619
 you guys will be like this tomorrow 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.479
 box seven euro or something worth having 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.649
 or eight euros more because that 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.940
 problem is always when the new one 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.259
 crate comes in for example in the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.270
 Phoenix Lake is also so it has 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.840
 right money costs 7 euros also on 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.440
 Beginning 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.130
 and that was up the next day 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.509
 eight euros 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.069
 and now you have to introduce yourself there 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.709
 there were only new skins now there is one 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.800
 new live which of course everyone has 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.050
 Everybody wants a tip-over 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.630
 already six euros if the at 520 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.030
 yes it takes a bit of patience 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.979
 little skill so no matter buys you 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.590
 pull the boxes and then have the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.330
 guns really shit worth 480 now there 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.220
 you have to hack a few really that 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.650
 it takes time, but it's worth it 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 I tell you the second variant is 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.470
 bit safer and cost money and 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.069
 Although there are servers with mods handy 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.019
 So on it comes the normal 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.249
 and if server or again my name is 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.230
 yes, for example, in under the 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.849
 you can also manage intex 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.329
 like to just play deathmatch in there 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.599
 The match making here fast game 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.549
 or we are always looking for such a team 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.439
 deathmatch what's playing that most of the time 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.569
 lasts ten minutes or so or eight 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.709
 minutes if you handle it a bit 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.159
 and then drop animal crates and old the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.109
 weapons 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.689
 So I really believe that way 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.260
 hour you have no matter if you have bad luck or 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:54.000
 you do not get a box then pulled 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 if you are extremely improved but that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.579
 should actually be feasible if one 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.939
 luck has got you but one stop 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.949
 bit more pronounced hour 6 euro so 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.900
 about hourly wage of six euros for 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.280
 A little gamble sounds like that now 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.340
 Everything was a bit addictive though 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.799
 take this chance yes that's really 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.859
 unbelievable how many people as new 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.480
 crate up on the market comes immediately 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.680
 to want the best things out of it 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.629
 that's incredible so he hits it 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.879
 maybe a short clip will come in 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.560
 other video and otherwise I say goodbye 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.560
 Sometimes better to gritti
