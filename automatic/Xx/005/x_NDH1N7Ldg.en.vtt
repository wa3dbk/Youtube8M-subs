we're going to do is displace the groove

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.070 
we're going to do is displace the groove
by<00:01:14.100> sixteenth<00:01:14.760> note<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.659> start

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
by sixteenth note so I'm going to start

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.280 
by sixteenth note so I'm going to start
the<00:01:16.290> groove<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.369> e<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.390> E<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.020> E

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the groove on the e so one E and a two E

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.649 
the groove on the e so one E and a two E
and<00:01:19.500> A<00:01:19.890> three<00:01:19.920> E<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.759> four<00:01:20.790> E<00:01:21.060> aren't<00:01:21.540> there

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and A three E and a four E aren't there

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
and A three E and a four E aren't there
and<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> count<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.280> clicks<00:01:23.549> till

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and I'm going to count the clicks till

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.620 
and I'm going to count the clicks till
so<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.770> what<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:25.920> playing<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:27.210> E<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
so now what we're playing is one E and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.390 
so now what we're playing is one E and
AH<00:01:28.320> two<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.159> AH<00:01:29.250> three<00:01:30.210> E<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> four<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:34.400> now

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
AH two and AH three E and four and now

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.730 
AH two and AH three E and four and now
remember<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:37.020> clicks<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> your

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
remember that if the clicks just in your

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.969 
remember that if the clicks just in your
cans<00:01:38.009> nobody<00:01:38.490> else<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> hear<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> so

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
cans nobody else can hear it so

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.020 
cans nobody else can hear it so
essentially<00:01:40.979> you're<00:01:41.159> playing<00:01:41.400> exactly<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
essentially you're playing exactly the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.850 
essentially you're playing exactly the
same<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.259> played<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.710> were

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
same as what we played when we were

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
same as what we played when we were
playing<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.610> click<00:01:44.820> part<00:01:45.540> from<00:01:45.750> your

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
playing on the click part from your

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.340 
playing on the click part from your
mental<00:01:46.670> one<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> different<00:01:48.240> place<00:01:48.780> it's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
mental one is in a different place it's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950 
mental one is in a different place it's
a<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:50.240> thing<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> practice<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
a really good thing to practice if you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.550 
a really good thing to practice if you
can<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
can do it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.399 
can do it
it's<00:01:52.740> get<00:01:52.920> old<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> video<00:01:53.430> camera<00:01:54.079> get<00:01:55.079> some

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
it's get old a video camera get some

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
it's get old a video camera get some
headphones<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> click<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.850> set<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.540> video

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
headphones with a click on set the video

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.249 
headphones with a click on set the video
camera<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> play<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.610> groove<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.329> all

camera up and play this groove in all

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.889 
camera up and play this groove in all
for<00:02:01.799> displacement<00:02:02.700> places<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.390> starting<00:02:03.840> on

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
for displacement places so starting on

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.679 
for displacement places so starting on
the<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.250> starting<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> e<00:02:05.600> starting<00:02:06.600> on

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the one starting on the e starting on

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.919 
the one starting on the e starting on
the<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.350> starting<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> R<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the and and starting on the R and the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.080 
the and and starting on the R and the
motion<00:02:10.560> should<00:02:11.250> look<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> same

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
motion should look the same

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.790 
motion should look the same
it<00:02:12.180> should<00:02:12.510> sign<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> same<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.470> should

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it should sign the same and it should

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
it should sign the same and it should
all<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> same<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.300> begin<00:02:15.570> with<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.840> won't

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
all the same now to begin with it won't

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
all the same now to begin with it won't
it'll<00:02:16.530> be<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> little<00:02:16.770> bit<00:02:16.890> complicated<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it'll be a little bit complicated and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790 
it'll be a little bit complicated and
you're<00:02:17.880> gonna<00:02:18.030> find<00:02:18.510> yourself<00:02:18.710> flailing<00:02:19.710> all

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
you're gonna find yourself flailing all

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.160 
you're gonna find yourself flailing all
over<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.160> place<00:02:20.370> but<00:02:20.670> with<00:02:21.600> practice<00:02:22.050> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
over the place but with practice you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.380 
over the place but with practice you
should<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.470> able<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.650> really<00:02:23.100> smooth<00:02:23.970> out<00:02:24.150> this

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
should be able to really smooth out this

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.330 
should be able to really smooth out this
motion<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.140> make<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.470> feel<00:02:25.680> as<00:02:25.860> good<00:02:26.040> playing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
motion and make it feel as good playing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.210 
motion and make it feel as good playing
in<00:02:26.430> any<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> four<00:02:26.940> places<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:29.010> time

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
in any of the four places so this time

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.150 
in any of the four places so this time
I'm<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.490> play<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.090> E<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.800> second

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
I'm going to play on the E the second

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.350 
I'm going to play on the E the second
sixteenth<00:02:32.520> note<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.820> where<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.000> gonna<00:02:33.120> start

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
sixteenth note is where I'm gonna start

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
sixteenth note is where I'm gonna start
the<00:02:33.540> groove<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.020> I'm<00:02:34.290> gonna<00:02:34.380> count<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the groove and I'm gonna count with the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:03:02.960 
the groove and I'm gonna count with the
click<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:59.460> the<00:03:00.300> next<00:03:00.600> thing<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.110> do<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:02.070> count

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
click so the next thing you do is count

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.510 
click so the next thing you do is count
the<00:03:03.090> groove<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> can't<00:03:05.160> what<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.430> were

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
the groove so can't what you were

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.070 
the groove so can't what you were
playing<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:06.240> two<00:03:06.980> three<00:03:07.980> four<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.810> still

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
playing one two three four but you still

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.650 
playing one two three four but you still
play<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.410> displaced<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.460> time<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
play it displaced and this time the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.720 
play it displaced and this time the
high-pitched<00:03:13.200> click<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:14.310> click<00:03:14.550> that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
high-pitched click the click that

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.150 
high-pitched click the click that
normally<00:03:15.330> notifies<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.990> one<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.410> going<00:03:17.010> to

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
normally notifies the one is going to

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.570 
normally notifies the one is going to
fall<00:03:17.460> on<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:18.390> app<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.800> if<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.459> were

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
fall on the app so if the if we were

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.880 
fall on the app so if the if we were
kinda<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.940> click<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.390> one<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.890> we

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
kinda in the click on the one and we

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.670 
kinda in the click on the one and we
were<00:03:23.010> playing<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.430> e<00:03:23.459> as<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:25.050> down<00:03:25.260> beat<00:03:25.500> with

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
were playing the e as the down beat with

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.650 
were playing the e as the down beat with
the<00:03:25.770> bass<00:03:25.890> drum<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> hi-hat<00:03:26.430> then<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:27.540> you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
the bass drum and the hi-hat then if you

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.270 
the bass drum and the hi-hat then if you
think<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.110> counting<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.709> groove<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
think about counting the groove so

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
think about counting the groove so
instead<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.640> being<00:03:30.260> click<00:03:31.260> E<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.920> click<00:03:32.700> e<00:03:32.910> and

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
instead of being click E and click e and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.510 
instead of being click E and click e and
this<00:03:34.110> time<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.560> gonna<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:38.250> gonna<00:03:38.400> be

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
this time it's gonna be a is gonna be

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.120 
this time it's gonna be a is gonna be
the<00:03:38.610> one<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.060> won't<00:03:39.450> eat<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.959> click<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.860> eat

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the one so won't eat and click to eat

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.300 
the one so won't eat and click to eat
and<00:03:41.370> click<00:03:42.620> that<00:03:43.620> make<00:03:43.800> more<00:03:43.950> sense<00:03:44.130> on<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
and click that make more sense on a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.070 
and click that make more sense on a
plate<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:44.790> I'm<00:03:44.850> counting<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.570> groove<00:03:45.810> this

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
plate so I'm counting the groove this

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.100 
plate so I'm counting the groove this
time<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> creek<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.070> displaced<00:03:51.110> only

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
time and the creek is displaced only

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:11.300 
time and the creek is displaced only
yeah<00:03:52.320> uh<00:03:52.470> -<00:03:52.770> we<00:03:52.980> are<00:03:53.220> up<00:03:53.370> three<00:03:53.640> yeah

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.160 

so<00:04:12.310> that's<00:04:12.489> two<00:04:12.790> ways<00:04:12.819> of<00:04:13.300> playing<00:04:13.540> exactly

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
so that's two ways of playing exactly

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.699 
so that's two ways of playing exactly
the<00:04:14.290> same<00:04:14.500> thing<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:15.989> relationship<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.200> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
the same thing the relationship of the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.349 
the same thing the relationship of the
click<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.280> groove<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.760> either<00:04:18.910> sing<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
click to the groove you either sing the

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.460 
click to the groove you either sing the
click<00:04:19.600> or<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:20.350> sing<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:21.669> groove<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.330> if<00:04:23.260> you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
click or you sing the groove and if you

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.770 
click or you sing the groove and if you
can<00:04:23.620> switch<00:04:23.950> between<00:04:24.160> those<00:04:24.580> at<00:04:24.790> will<00:04:25.030> you'll

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
can switch between those at will you'll

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.740 
can switch between those at will you'll
be<00:04:25.930> able<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.200> start<00:04:26.440> comparing<00:04:27.389> you<00:04:28.389> know<00:04:28.419> the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
be able to start comparing you know the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.480 
be able to start comparing you know the
motions<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.380> see<00:04:29.500> if<00:04:29.620> anything<00:04:29.919> changes<00:04:30.250> for

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
motions and see if anything changes for

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.220 
motions and see if anything changes for
me<00:04:30.520> it's<00:04:30.790> easier<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.360> play<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:31.630> can't<00:04:32.080> the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
me it's easier to play and can't the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.140 
me it's easier to play and can't the
groove<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.740> just<00:04:32.770> have<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.460> click<00:04:33.700> fall<00:04:33.970> on

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
groove and just have the click fall on

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.909 
groove and just have the click fall on
the<00:04:34.270> art<00:04:34.419> or<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.990> E<00:04:35.020> or<00:04:35.380> wherever<00:04:35.710> it's<00:04:35.889> going

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
the art or the E or wherever it's going

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.680 
the art or the E or wherever it's going
to<00:04:36.100> be<00:04:36.220> but<00:04:36.910> what<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.150> want<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.389> really<00:04:37.600> be

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
to be but what you want to really be

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.300 
to be but what you want to really be
able<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.840> do<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.110> switch<00:04:38.380> between<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.919> two<00:04:39.100> so

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
able to do is switch between the two so

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.590 
able to do is switch between the two so
you<00:04:39.340> can<00:04:39.490> either<00:04:39.729> be<00:04:39.910> playing<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.240> displace

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
you can either be playing a displace

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.330 
you can either be playing a displace
groove<00:04:40.930> or<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.560> can<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.800> playing<00:04:42.010> a<00:04:42.100> straight

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
groove or you can be playing a straight

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.900 
groove or you can be playing a straight
groove<00:04:42.610> in<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.850> click<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.150> displaced<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:45.760> this

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
groove in the click is displaced so this

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.280 
groove in the click is displaced so this
time<00:04:46.150> I'm<00:04:46.300> going<00:04:46.389> to<00:04:46.450> do<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:48.520> so<00:04:49.290> I'm

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
time I'm going to do the and so I'm

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.960 
time I'm going to do the and so I'm
going<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.500> can't<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.919> click<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.340> play<00:04:51.700> a

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
going to can't the click and play a

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.670 
going to can't the click and play a
groove<00:04:52.600> that's<00:04:52.750> displaced<00:04:53.200> by<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:53.560> an

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
groove that's displaced by just an

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.630 
groove that's displaced by just an
eighth<00:04:53.800> note<00:04:55.889> one<00:04:56.889> two<00:04:57.760> three
