this<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> build<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:04.490> shed<00:00:05.490> for<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.850> riffle

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
this is how to build a shed for a riffle

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.499 
this is how to build a shed for a riffle
shed<00:00:07.820> and<00:00:11.389> constructed<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.509> out<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.370> 3/4

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
shed and constructed it out of 3/4

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.540 
shed and constructed it out of 3/4
exterior<00:00:15.509> plywood<00:00:16.049> as<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> decking<00:00:19.550> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
exterior plywood as a decking the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.340 
exterior plywood as a decking the
decking<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:21.689> over<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.760> 3/4

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
decking and then over here is 3/4

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.720 
decking and then over here is 3/4

rip<00:00:27.720> down<00:00:28.099> from<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.820> slope<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.510> buried

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
rip down from the slope and then buried

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.240 
rip down from the slope and then buried
in<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> ground<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.920> tell<00:00:32.070> it's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
in the ground because you can tell it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.470 
in the ground because you can tell it's
not<00:00:32.309> much<00:00:32.579> above<00:00:32.899> not<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> slope<00:00:34.649> so

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
not much above not much of a slope so

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.220 
not much above not much of a slope so
the<00:00:36.480> other<00:00:36.630> thing<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.930> did<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the other thing we did with the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.590 
the other thing we did with the
composite<00:00:37.530> decking<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.550> minor<00:00:39.210> off<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
composite decking is to minor off the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.220 
composite decking is to minor off the
edges<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:41.390> miter<00:00:42.390> off<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:42.809> tail

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
edges and then miter off these tail

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.420 
edges and then miter off these tail
pieces<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> they'll<00:00:45.510> fit<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.190> really<00:00:47.190> nicely

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
pieces so they'll fit in really nicely

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.740 
pieces so they'll fit in really nicely
here<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:50.059> not<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.360> show

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
here and not have to not have to show

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
here and not have to not have to show

any screws of topper on the side as they
come<00:00:54.840> together<00:00:54.989> nicely

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
come together nicely

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.049 
come together nicely

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
range with stainless steel screws I find

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
range with stainless steel screws I find
out<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.720> really<00:01:09.720> should<00:01:09.960> take<00:01:11.180> take<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
out that you really should take take the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.550 
out that you really should take take the
screw<00:01:12.650> put<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.040> locations<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.659> mark

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
screw put put in locations and then mark

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.359 
screw put put in locations and then mark
the<00:01:16.619> center<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.299> way<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.630> screw

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
the center of it and that way the screw

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.649 
the center of it and that way the screw
little<00:01:20.369> stainless<00:01:20.640> steel<00:01:20.939> screws<00:01:22.130> will<00:01:23.130> sit

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
little stainless steel screws will sit

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.590 
little stainless steel screws will sit
much<00:01:24.659> easier<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.850> step<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> hole<00:01:27.450> right

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
much easier in that step that hole right

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.100 
much easier in that step that hole right
there<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:29.659> instead<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.900> you're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
there with the instead of it you're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.190 
there with the instead of it you're
trying<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.439> manage<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.189> hand<00:01:32.400> so

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
trying to manage it with your hand so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.069 
trying to manage it with your hand so
it's<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.530> composite<00:01:35.220> decking<00:01:36.079> I'm

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it's going to be composite decking I'm

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.859 
it's going to be composite decking I'm
Dan<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.979> top<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> 3/4<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.979> slope<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
Dan it up on top of 3/4 and the slope is

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.069 
Dan it up on top of 3/4 and the slope is
any<00:01:42.869> negative<00:01:43.560> Bowl<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:45.720> still<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
any negative Bowl but you still have to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.010 
any negative Bowl but you still have to
dig<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.619> stuff<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.840> for<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> two

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
dig out some stuff for the for the two

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.060 
dig out some stuff for the for the two
by<00:01:49.170> sixes<00:01:49.470> delay<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> two<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:51.890> next<00:01:52.890> I'll<00:01:53.040> show

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
by sixes delay in two and next I'll show

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.370 
by sixes delay in two and next I'll show
you<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.579> ramp<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.570> built<00:01:54.810> into<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.259> other
