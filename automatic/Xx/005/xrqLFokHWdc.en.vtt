00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.780
 hello love in exile community today too 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.870
 guest 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.420
 countless in his late with guitars 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.200
 forge hello martin so attack for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.509
 the invitation 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.400
 Let's get started with yours 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.410
 passion for guitar wall began 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 the passion that started 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 actually already in the age of 13 14 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.369
 years in which at a time for 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 the greed of the scouts at that time all 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.829
 you can not play the guitar 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.480
 around 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.850
 each of us had such an instrument 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 So I also learned it in my hand 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.340
 but much better than the piano 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.469
 since then i have been from my parents 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.449
 was effectively forced to this 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.399
 time now can imagine that 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.839
 Of course, that was a lot cooler the word 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.659
 but at the time you did not know it yet 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.710
 I also play all the works today 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.489
 guitar and that was then 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 continuing 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.399
 and I have only after the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.559
 graduation met someone at the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.699
 I could look like it was built 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.710
 that will have me very much back then 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.080
 fascinated and by a happy one 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 circumstance and the mediation of a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.150
 I am a friend then I lived in 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.880
 kassel then come to enjoy one 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 training to start him in 1979 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.590
 This training started in 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 Taunus held in a small workshop 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.460
 and so everything went off 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.140
 I could have been something else too 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.390
 if that chance did not exist then 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.920
 but guitar was of course that 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.869
 instrument for me and this connection 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.180
 totally fascinated and to manufacture 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.619
 your your series lakewood since when 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.520
 There are the lakers emerged in the year 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.320
 1985 as thought and 1986 in reality in 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.380
 the form that really instruments up 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.009
 the market came the brand names 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.570
 have worn 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.920
 Years ago, however, I had 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.640
 guitars under my own name 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.740
 built 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 Martin Souliger stood in every guitar 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.710
 and I did not have it yet 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.210
 to say the self-confidence so all 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.170
 our guitars have to martin now 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.850
 seeliger hot 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.500
 i had that thought it must 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.509
 but a name created the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.009
 the international sounds of everyone 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.390
 is pronounce even if he is with the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.550
 German language has difficulties 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.070
 and so in slate with your finger on the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.440
 map emerged 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.260
 as the name of a city near cleveland am 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.080
 eriesee and from a long list of 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.950
 Names that I mainly from 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.480
 American but also of the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.550
 English map was taken 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.290
 then lake will be the best afterwards 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.710
 arrived and to warm our guitars 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.720
 wakeboard where i have to say out 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.840
 my experience with conversations with 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.960
 guitarists play this guitar 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.480
 blessed this soulful and or so 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.680
 a lot of character of his guitars already has 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.450
 also very well fitted 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.130
 surely today would probably be different 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.950
 I would say then decide 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.230
 my own name and every guitar 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.940
 But it is so, too 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.770
 Of course, many people also lay with 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.340
 but also connect to my name 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.040
 that you sometimes stand at this 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.840
 Lakewood is far from us 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 alone consists of many 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.410
 very committed employees 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.170
 we are that he has almost 20 people in here 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.750
 The workshop is all for your part 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.340
 the high quality of our guitars and 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.090
 this commitment in detail then 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.959
 endorse 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.910
 and I'm very grateful for that 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.200
 Good dedicated employee circle too 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.770
 have without that not possible 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.660
 would 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.090
 It's always a blake team effort 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.670
 becomes the system and not the result 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.930
 the performance of a single super me 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.760
 I think I'll be an instrument 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.580
 and it will be such a feedback in 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.150
 the music scene is how came the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.440
 cooperation with elixir sites 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.200
 Of course I had different 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.220
 pages tried over the years 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.040
 different manufacturer and am 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.610
 then I ate many years ago 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.320
 really now ten fifteen years ago 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.610
 on all sides and have the 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.730
 I liked it spontaneously 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:00.950
 By the way, there were only the two 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.200
 sides and not only in politics 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.239
 version but then in the nano 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.519
 webversion and in the beginning as the 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.590
 came out first nano sites we have 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.920
 this site spontaneously fell because of it 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.410
 because you have such a wonderful combination 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.200
 In addition, our character is sound 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.450
 have resulted in 64 pages counteract 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.090
 In a sense, that's what we're in 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.250
 our guitars 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.780
 to convey brilliance through the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.510
 special cover and corpus 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.600
 constructions our instruments and 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.290
 Add this heat that is necessary 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.479
 to make a complex beautiful sound in all 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.060
 to produce layers then realize 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.449
 and with the introduction of research on 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.880
 I am completely fan of elixir 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.770
 become and I do not know what 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.210
 i should do if experian you side 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.139
 would give up manufacturers 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.410
 I would probably have one 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.630
 looking for another profession and maybe 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.090
 gutigenbau okay there was a lot going on and 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.200
 wins I am convinced that he 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.639
 lay here for a long time these pages 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.950
 notice and I'm easy 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.919
 fused with the product the guitars 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.919
 sound through alex four pages in the reason 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.770
 just as I wish that the 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.900
 expect customers and music lovers and 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.880
 how would you like the difference? 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.260
 between phosphor bronze and editor 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.400
 define titles according to my experience 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.350
 it is so that the phosphor bronze 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.240
 something a bit warmer 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.669
 sounds more charming than Austrian 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.960
 with the word came even more start than 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.970
 I as German and just that brings 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.620
 basically our normal sound 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.610
 piece further forward so the change of 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.630
 Prepare frost if from the label 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.700
 pages was for us actually the 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.580
 key again for a gain 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.200
 ton so I can only confirm this from 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.700
 my experience with guitarists that 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.710
 also all of this combination 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.599
 swear martin what is it 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.639
 current projects 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.340
 I believe in the website, too 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.919
 a very special tool itself 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.270
 own guitar meanwhile together too 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.700
 To ask 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.050
 I find that very exciting, too 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.430
 that's right our guitars 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.590
 configurator of the many listeners and too 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.849
 certainly see videos then too 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.070
 it will be familiar it is a 3d 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.320
 designing tool that we are the only one 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.729
 guitar manufacturer offer man is in 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.740
 the location of the diverse 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.110
 Combinations of our custom shop in 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.700
 moment for the 158 combinations one 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.250
 to build individual guitar together 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.440
 and this guitar is three dimensional too 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.040
 consider turning to turn in to 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.820
 search 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.350
 to look at from afar and the 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.590
 combination of the individual details themselves 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.180
 to print out then in the 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.210
 In case of doubt, an order will lead to 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.770
 let and not a single day passes 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.320
 without a custom shop order with us 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.180
 this possibility his guitar 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.580
 individually tailored to produce 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.350
 let is used very diverse and 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.900
 We are going through the autumn now 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.120
 update our guitars design as yet 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.580
 more features can show that optically 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.680
 prepare even more beautiful and are yes 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.590
 also very excited about it like that then
