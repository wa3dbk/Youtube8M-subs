Ehsan<00:00:40.399> so<00:00:40.670> we<00:00:41.000> were<00:00:41.210> looking<00:00:41.360> at<00:00:41.690> spaces<00:00:42.079> where

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
Ehsan so we were looking at spaces where

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:43.600 
Ehsan so we were looking at spaces where
we<00:00:42.440> could<00:00:42.590> do<00:00:42.680> an<00:00:42.800> off-site<00:00:43.129> commercial

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
we could do an off-site commercial

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.180 
we could do an off-site commercial
kitchen<00:00:43.969> and<00:00:44.380> one<00:00:45.380> popped<00:00:45.620> up<00:00:45.800> in<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.010> rocks

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
kitchen and one popped up in the rocks

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.730 
kitchen and one popped up in the rocks
which<00:00:46.490> was<00:00:46.700> a<00:00:46.730> big<00:00:47.030> site<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.660> we<00:00:48.230> realized<00:00:48.560> we

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
which was a big site and we realized we

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.500 
which was a big site and we realized we
could<00:00:48.920> put<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.120> commercial<00:00:50.120> production

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
could put a commercial production

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.660 
could put a commercial production
kitchen<00:00:50.690> in<00:00:50.960> there<00:00:51.140> for<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.860> pastry<00:00:52.220> site<00:00:52.460> and

kitchen in there for the pastry site and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.340 
kitchen in there for the pastry site and
also<00:00:52.880> to<00:00:53.000> a<00:00:53.030> French<00:00:53.300> bistro<00:00:53.480> which<00:00:53.900> was<00:00:54.050> always

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
also to a French bistro which was always

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.500 
also to a French bistro which was always
a<00:00:54.380> dream<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.400> my<00:00:55.489> late<00:00:55.670> father<00:00:55.700> Pierre

a dream of my late father Pierre

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.690 
a dream of my late father Pierre
I<00:00:56.780> think<00:00:57.680> that's<00:00:57.800> popular<00:00:58.160> because<00:00:58.310> people

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
I think that's popular because people

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.950 
I think that's popular because people
know<00:00:58.850> what<00:00:59.060> they're<00:00:59.210> going<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.450> get<00:00:59.540> they<00:00:59.750> know

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
know what they're going to get they know

the tradition of quality at Lara

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.030 
the tradition of quality at Lara
nissan's<00:01:02.480> they<00:01:02.750> know<00:01:02.930> what<00:01:03.739> they're<00:01:03.860> going<00:01:03.980> to

nissan's they know what they're going to

nissan's they know what they're going to
get<00:01:04.159> up<00:01:04.309> there<00:01:04.339> they're<00:01:04.729> always<00:01:04.879> going<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:05.149> you

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
know and the quality is ubiquitous

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.510 
know and the quality is ubiquitous
across<00:01:07.909> them<00:01:08.390> about<00:01:09.320> both<00:01:09.770> venues<00:01:10.130> which<00:01:10.340> is

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
across them about both venues which is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.679 
across them about both venues which is
what<00:01:10.700> we<00:01:10.820> really<00:01:11.000> like<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.299> achieve

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
what we really like to achieve

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.840 
what we really like to achieve
well<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:12.110> think<00:01:12.290> in<00:01:12.500> France<00:01:12.770> really<00:01:12.920> what<00:01:13.189> what

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
well I think in France really what what

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.700 
well I think in France really what what
we're<00:01:14.750> quite<00:01:14.990> particular<00:01:15.229> about<00:01:15.439> is<00:01:15.680> a

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
we're quite particular about is a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.830 
we're quite particular about is a
technique<00:01:16.070> more<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:16.460> than<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.759> flavors<00:01:17.659> and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
technique more so than the flavors and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.630 
technique more so than the flavors and
the<00:01:17.960> loops<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.409> mean<00:01:18.530> of<00:01:18.620> course<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:18.950> critical

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
the loops I mean of course it's critical

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.969 
the loops I mean of course it's critical
to<00:01:20.330> what<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:20.510> do<00:01:20.780> but<00:01:21.260> technically<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:21.770> has<00:01:21.799> to

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
to what we do but technically it has to

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.170 
to what we do but technically it has to
be<00:01:22.100> arrived<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.490> it's<00:01:22.610> really<00:01:22.820> what<00:01:23.000> people

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
be arrived and it's really what people

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.969 
be arrived and it's really what people
are<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.600> pastry<00:01:23.840> chef<00:01:24.080> look<00:01:24.290> upon<00:01:24.530> each<00:01:24.650> other's

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
are a pastry chef look upon each other's

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.980 
are a pastry chef look upon each other's
but<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:25.790> know<00:01:25.909> what<00:01:26.120> what<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.570> happening

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
but you know what what is happening

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.080 
but you know what what is happening
lately<00:01:27.620> macaron<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.369> really<00:01:28.729> good<00:01:28.880> because

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
lately macaron is really good because

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.180 
lately macaron is really good because

mucker always actually pushing it in a
little<00:01:31.430> bit<00:01:31.520> further<00:01:31.760> it's<00:01:31.909> actually<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:32.180> lot

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
little bit further it's actually a lot

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.730 
little bit further it's actually a lot
more<00:01:32.330> technical<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.110> looks<00:01:33.320> it's<00:01:33.590> a

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
more technical that it looks it's a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.219 
more technical that it looks it's a
small<00:01:34.460> biscuits<00:01:34.610> it's<00:01:34.970> not<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.270> easy<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.690> get

right together the fun upon of it is a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.700 
right together the fun upon of it is a
bit<00:01:38.450> subjective<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:39.020> course<00:01:39.229> everybody's<00:01:39.590> got

inside the reason we put berries because
he's<00:02:35.680> got<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> much<00:02:36.069> lower<00:02:36.280> melting<00:02:37.060> point<00:02:37.269> than

he's got a much lower melting point than

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.710 
he's got a much lower melting point than
cacao<00:02:38.680> butter<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.790> finish<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.690> job

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
cacao butter and then you finish the job

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.949 
cacao butter and then you finish the job
with<00:02:41.370> an<00:02:42.370> immersion<00:02:42.849> blender<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.780> is

the sugar the Triana gram of sugar
inside<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:49.000> what<00:04:49.960> we're<00:04:50.140> doing<00:04:50.170> now<00:04:50.500> is

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
inside of it so what we're doing now is

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.010 
inside of it so what we're doing now is
cooking<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.220> sugar<00:04:51.490> by<00:04:52.360> cooking<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:52.780> sugar

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
cooking the sugar by cooking the sugar

cooking the sugar by cooking the sugar
what<00:04:53.260> I<00:04:53.290> mean<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.560> actually<00:04:53.680> we're<00:04:53.980> gonna

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
what I mean is actually we're gonna

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.850 
what I mean is actually we're gonna
bring<00:04:54.280> it<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:55.180> a<00:04:55.210> boil<00:04:55.480> don't<00:04:56.290> get<00:04:56.440> daunted<00:04:56.830> by

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
here what we see is a syrup starting to

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.960 
here what we see is a syrup starting to
boil<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.980> then<00:05:03.130> I'm<00:05:03.250> just<00:05:03.370> gonna<00:05:03.550> grab<00:05:03.760> some

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.300 
boil and then I'm just gonna grab some
sugar<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.450> see<00:05:04.930> what<00:05:05.470> temperature<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.250> is

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
sugar and see what temperature it is

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.390 
sugar and see what temperature it is
simply<00:05:06.820> by<00:05:06.940> looking<00:05:07.060> at<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.650> texture<00:05:08.650> what<00:05:09.250> we

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
simply by looking at the texture what we

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.010 
simply by looking at the texture what we
do<00:05:09.520> here<00:05:09.760> is<00:05:09.940> bring<00:05:10.210> some<00:05:10.390> of<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.600> sugar<00:05:10.870> in

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
do here is bring some of the sugar in

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.320 
do here is bring some of the sugar in
the<00:05:11.110> ice<00:05:11.230> and<00:05:11.560> as<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.070> can<00:05:12.220> see<00:05:12.280> here<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:13.000> can

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
the ice and as you can see here I can

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.540 
the ice and as you can see here I can
make<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.480> soft<00:05:13.750> ball<00:05:14.010> meaning<00:05:15.010> that<00:05:15.220> much<00:05:15.400> sugar

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
make a soft ball meaning that much sugar

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.240 
make a soft ball meaning that much sugar
is<00:05:15.850> actually<00:05:16.270> ready<00:05:17.080> all<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:17.920> have<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.130> do

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
here is take your sugar and drop it in

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.070 
here is take your sugar and drop it in
the<00:05:23.560> mix<00:05:23.740> of<00:05:24.670> course<00:05:24.970> what<00:05:25.300> you<00:05:25.450> end<00:05:25.540> up<00:05:25.630> with<00:05:25.690> a

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
the mix of course what you end up with a

and soft same thing got the meringue the

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.810 
and soft same thing got the meringue the
only<00:05:35.710> thing<00:05:35.830> you<00:05:35.890> need<00:05:36.010> to<00:05:36.070> do<00:05:36.250> there<00:05:36.430> before

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
you finish this mix this into that

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.620 
you finish this mix this into that
simple<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:39.310> you<00:05:39.400> do<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.670> lighten<00:05:40.000> up<00:05:40.090> your

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
simple all you do is lighten up your

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.380 
simple all you do is lighten up your
caramel<00:05:41.350> mix<00:05:41.670> when<00:05:42.670> it<00:05:42.790> gets<00:05:42.940> to<00:05:43.120> a<00:05:43.150> point

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
caramel mix when it gets to a point

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.840 
caramel mix when it gets to a point
where<00:05:43.630> it's<00:05:43.750> actually<00:05:43.840> quite<00:05:44.200> soft<00:05:44.490> use<00:05:45.490> a

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
where it's actually quite soft use a

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.300 
where it's actually quite soft use a
rubber<00:05:46.540> spatula<00:05:46.690> just<00:05:47.500> make<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.710> streak<00:05:48.100> on<00:05:48.220> the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
rubber spatula just make a streak on the

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.270 
rubber spatula just make a streak on the
top<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:49.300> shake<00:05:49.540> your<00:05:49.630> ball<00:05:49.810> all<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.770> elements

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
top and shake your ball all the elements

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.340 
top and shake your ball all the elements
sinks<00:05:51.820> on<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.210> bottom<00:05:52.510> and<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:52.990> want<00:05:53.140> to<00:05:53.200> see

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
sinks on the bottom and you want to see

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.540 
sinks on the bottom and you want to see
that<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.590> streaks<00:05:53.890> are<00:05:54.100> getting<00:05:54.340> a<00:05:54.400> little

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
that the streaks are getting a little

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.070 
that the streaks are getting a little
bit<00:05:54.640> softer<00:05:55.000> so<00:05:55.120> what<00:05:55.720> we're<00:05:55.840> going<00:05:55.960> to<00:05:55.990> be

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
bit softer so what we're going to be

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.430 
bit softer so what we're going to be
using<00:05:56.380> is<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.830> piping<00:05:57.460> bag<00:05:57.610> with<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:58.660> nozzle<00:05:58.900> one

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
using is a piping bag with a nozzle one

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.090 
using is a piping bag with a nozzle one

number 10 number 11 is really what you

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.220 
number 10 number 11 is really what you
want<00:06:02.710> put<00:06:03.580> a<00:06:03.790> bit<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.180> mix<00:06:04.390> and<00:06:04.690> a<00:06:04.840> tiny<00:06:05.050> bit

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
want put a bit of the mix and a tiny bit

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.800 
want put a bit of the mix and a tiny bit
is<00:06:05.350> enough<00:06:05.560> to<00:06:06.010> pipe<00:06:06.250> new<00:06:06.640> macaron<00:06:07.270> lean<00:06:07.660> over

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
is enough to pipe new macaron lean over

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.900 
is enough to pipe new macaron lean over
and<00:06:08.170> then<00:06:09.160> just<00:06:09.880> by<00:06:10.110> very<00:06:11.110> simple<00:06:11.760> we're<00:06:12.760> gonna

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
and then just by very simple we're gonna

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.960 
and then just by very simple we're gonna
be<00:06:13.030> putting<00:06:13.260> luster<00:06:14.260> powders<00:06:14.670> those<00:06:15.670> are<00:06:15.850> the

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
be putting luster powders those are the

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.490 
be putting luster powders those are the
same<00:06:16.240> thing<00:06:16.510> that<00:06:16.630> you<00:06:16.840> actually<00:06:16.960> have<00:06:17.320> in<00:06:17.470> a

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
same thing that you actually have in a

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.070 
same thing that you actually have in a
ladies<00:06:18.310> makeup<00:06:18.670> so<00:06:19.420> you<00:06:19.510> get<00:06:19.630> a<00:06:19.660> nice<00:06:19.840> little

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
ladies makeup so you get a nice little

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.160 
ladies makeup so you get a nice little
luster<00:06:20.530> to<00:06:20.560> it<00:06:20.850> it's<00:06:21.850> nice<00:06:22.000> to<00:06:22.150> have<00:06:22.240> finish<00:06:22.510> so

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
luster to it it's nice to have finish so

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.290 
luster to it it's nice to have finish so
now<00:06:23.350> we<00:06:24.340> have<00:06:24.520> people<00:06:24.730> to<00:06:24.790> finish<00:06:24.940> whatever

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
now we have people to finish whatever

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.030 
now we have people to finish whatever
you<00:06:25.570> put<00:06:26.020> we're<00:06:26.200> gonna<00:06:26.320> put<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.590> into<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.920> oven

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
you put we're gonna put it into the oven

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.780 
you put we're gonna put it into the oven
and<00:06:27.370> usually<00:06:28.020> 150<00:06:29.020> degrees<00:06:29.350> for<00:06:29.590> about<00:06:29.680> 20<00:06:30.610> to

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
and usually 150 degrees for about 20 to

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.750 
and usually 150 degrees for about 20 to
23<00:06:31.600> minutes<00:06:31.960> anything<00:06:32.320> between<00:06:32.470> 20<00:06:32.920> to<00:06:33.130> 25

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
23 minutes anything between 20 to 25

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.960 
23 minutes anything between 20 to 25
minutes<00:06:33.940> okay<00:06:34.590> so<00:06:35.590> now<00:06:35.890> we've<00:06:36.070> laid<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.580> smack

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
minutes okay so now we've laid the smack

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.970 
minutes okay so now we've laid the smack
on<00:06:37.120> cool<00:06:37.390> down<00:06:37.420> nicely<00:06:37.840> and<00:06:38.230> really<00:06:38.800> the<00:06:38.950> whole

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
on cool down nicely and really the whole

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.620 
on cool down nicely and really the whole
the<00:06:39.400> exercise<00:06:39.850> here<00:06:40.090> is<00:06:40.180> to<00:06:40.330> actually<00:06:40.390> find

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
the exercise here is to actually find

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.510 
the exercise here is to actually find
two<00:06:41.080> which<00:06:41.350> are<00:06:41.530> of<00:06:41.680> course<00:06:41.830> a<00:06:41.950> similar<00:06:42.280> size

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
two which are of course a similar size

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.670 
two which are of course a similar size
it's<00:06:43.030> bound<00:06:43.270> some<00:06:43.780> irregularities

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
it's bound some irregularities

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.080 
it's bound some irregularities
especially<00:06:45.100> when<00:06:45.220> you<00:06:45.280> start<00:06:45.460> piping<00:06:45.670> a<00:06:45.940> bit

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
especially when you start piping a bit

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.450 
especially when you start piping a bit
bigger<00:06:46.300> maybe<00:06:46.810> smaller<00:06:47.170> it's<00:06:47.980> not<00:06:48.100> a<00:06:48.130> big<00:06:48.310> deal

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
bigger maybe smaller it's not a big deal

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.430 
bigger maybe smaller it's not a big deal
because<00:06:48.580> all<00:06:48.730> you<00:06:48.880> do<00:06:49.030> is<00:06:49.060> you<00:06:49.300> go<00:06:49.450> back<00:06:49.720> and

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
because all you do is you go back and

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.820 
because all you do is you go back and
forth
