00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello everyone with you arcade likon this is our 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.690
 The first issue of 3 minutes is simple and in it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.669
 we will answer 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.150
 issues related to loot in the counter 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:19.310
 strike bol loot in this camouflage game 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.930
 which by themselves except the beauty of 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.210
 give no advantage 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.460
 just in the game until 7 value skins 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.099
 weapons first are those that drop out 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.759
 while you players the other six falls out 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.550
 from chests 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.160
 they vary in color blue 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.920
 purple pink red orange 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 the kill count and especially read now 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.960
 it's just knives 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.820
 there are also 5 types of novelty weapons 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 from factory production to 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.589
 battle-hardened over the course of the game 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.149
 weapons do not deteriorate however in appearance 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.280
 strongly affects its price 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.559
 so the first thing to do 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.140
 attention is a certain amount 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.449
 drop we can get in one 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.159
 week namely it is just 2 just from 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.229
 kiev weapons two boxes 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.750
 more we can not knock out anything 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.670
 no matter how much we play it is worth noting 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.740
 that the more we play the less chance 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.190
 drop on the thing however at the end of the timer 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.200
 loot 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.330
 if we still have not dropped things 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.490
 the chance to drop again will increase by the way 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.550
 whether the timer is reset to metal 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.560
 Thursday night on Friday in other words 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.690
 if they win constantly and in pursuit 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.670
 for items you just go to 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.160
 friday or wednesday to knock them out 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.840
 as short as possible 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.180
 items fall out in any game mode 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.710
 and even if you came at the end of the match you 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.230
 there is still a chance to get the item 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.030
 it's worth noting that the onion doesn't depend on 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.920
 how well do you play on whose 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.110
 side you and what methods of the game you 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.090
 use with single bots 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.770
 items don't fall out but if you 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.690
 play with other players and with you 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.030
 play a few bots a chance to get 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.070
 the subject is still true it is extremely small 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.500
 from myself I want to note that to earn money 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.870
 onion counter-strike especially not 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.180
 unless you open the drawers and there 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.400
 of course how lucky the keys are too 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.530
 worth the money with you was arkady whether kun and 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.190
 in the next issue I will tell you about the essence 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.230
