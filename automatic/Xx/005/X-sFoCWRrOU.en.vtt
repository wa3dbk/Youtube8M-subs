00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
however much this soup is easy to make I

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.580 
however much this soup is easy to make I
don't<00:01:15.700> really<00:01:15.850> have<00:01:16.119> quantities<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.290> give<00:01:17.439> you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
don't really have quantities to give you

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.530 
don't really have quantities to give you
but<00:01:17.830> this<00:01:18.280> doubles<00:01:18.700> up<00:01:18.909> and<00:01:19.210> what<00:01:19.420> you're

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
but this doubles up and what you're

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.020 
but this doubles up and what you're
going<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.780> do<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.290> you're<00:01:20.979> going<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.340> use<00:01:21.759> this

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
going to do is you're going to use this

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.120 
going to do is you're going to use this
as<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.659> gauge<00:01:22.900> of<00:01:23.140> how<00:01:23.320> much<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.560> your<00:01:23.950> other

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
as the gauge of how much of your other

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.060 
as the gauge of how much of your other
ingredients<00:01:24.759> are<00:01:24.850> going<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.060> use<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:26.140> this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
ingredients are going to use so this

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.730 
ingredients are going to use so this
looks<00:01:27.250> like<00:01:27.310> about<00:01:27.520> three<00:01:27.909> cups<00:01:28.119> or<00:01:28.740> maybe

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
looks like about three cups or maybe

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.520 
looks like about three cups or maybe
even<00:01:30.009> four<00:01:30.220> cups<00:01:30.460> of<00:01:30.990> lentils<00:01:31.990> after<00:01:32.409> they're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
even four cups of lentils after they're

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.260 
even four cups of lentils after they're
soaked<00:01:32.829> so<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.250> probably<00:01:33.579> two<00:01:33.759> cups<00:01:34.030> to

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
soaked so it's probably two cups to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.740 
soaked so it's probably two cups to
start<00:01:34.509> with<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:36.430> I<00:01:36.700> have<00:01:36.970> about<00:01:37.509> the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750

blend<00:03:50.949> half<00:03:51.220> of<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.639> I<00:03:51.699> put<00:03:51.879> it<00:03:52.030> back<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.239> we

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
blend half of it and I put it back in we

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.199 
blend half of it and I put it back in we
it<00:03:52.870> gives<00:03:53.079> it<00:03:53.229> more<00:03:53.260> body<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.979> a<00:03:54.699> different<00:03:55.120> a

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
it gives it more body and a different a

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.699 
it gives it more body and a different a
little<00:03:55.299> bit<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.629> a<00:03:55.690> different<00:03:56.019> texture<00:03:56.349> and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709
