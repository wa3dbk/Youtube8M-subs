tell me about what you've changed on it
what<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.340> transpired<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.970> we

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
what what what transpired is we

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.999 
what what what transpired is we
eventually<00:00:30.660> learned<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.349> after<00:00:31.619> having<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
eventually learned that after having the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.740 
eventually learned that after having the
product<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.460> marketplace<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.329> period

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
product in the marketplace for a period

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.860 
product in the marketplace for a period
of<00:00:33.780> time<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.050> some<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> items<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.489> felt

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
of time that some of the items we felt

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.560 
of time that some of the items we felt
secure<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.100> actually<00:00:38.100> became<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.700> problem

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
secure in actually became a problem

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
secure in actually became a problem
later<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> happen<00:00:41.190> yeah<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
later and that's going to happen yeah it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.670 
later and that's going to happen yeah it
is<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:42.989> frustrating<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is but it was frustrating in the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.049 
is but it was frustrating in the
beginning<00:00:44.010> especially<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.579> our<00:00:44.670> customers

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
beginning especially for our customers

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.819 
beginning especially for our customers
because<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:46.050> were<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.350> ones<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.739> were

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
because they were the ones that were

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.860 
because they were the ones that were
going<00:00:47.010> why<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.670> occurring<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.360> some<00:00:48.840> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
going why is this occurring so some of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020 
going why is this occurring so some of
the<00:00:49.020> things<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.379> did<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.950> found<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the things we did is we found it in the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
the things we did is we found it in the
original<00:00:51.270> valve<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:52.500> had<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> small<00:00:53.010> screen

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
original valve we had a small screen

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
original valve we had a small screen
that<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.059> meant<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> catch<00:00:54.750> large

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
that was meant to catch large

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.290 
that was meant to catch large
particulate<00:00:55.739> matter<00:00:55.980> yeah<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.879> couldn't

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
particulate matter yeah but you couldn't

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.479 
particulate matter yeah but you couldn't
really<00:00:57.690> clean<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> all<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.500> easy<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.370> we

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
really clean it all that easy so what we

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.869 
really clean it all that easy so what we
did<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.879> developed<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.600> foamed<00:01:00.930> type

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
did is we developed a little foamed type

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.820 
did is we developed a little foamed type
device<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.420> look<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.350> pop<00:01:04.619> out

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
device that look at that would pop out

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.280 
device that look at that would pop out
you<00:01:05.189> could<00:01:05.339> drop<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:06.030> either<00:01:06.420> some<00:01:07.049> form

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you could drop it into either some form

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.590 
you could drop it into either some form
of<00:01:07.380> citric<00:01:08.070> acid<00:01:08.520> and/or<00:01:08.970> vinegar<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
of citric acid and/or vinegar and you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.240 
of citric acid and/or vinegar and you
could<00:01:10.080> clean<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> didn't

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
could clean it out and so you didn't

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
could clean it out and so you didn't
have<00:01:11.369> problems<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> valves<00:01:12.360> clogging

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
have problems with the valves clogging

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
have problems with the valves clogging
great<00:01:13.380> other<00:01:13.530> thing<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:13.950> found<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
great other thing we found is that the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600 
great other thing we found is that the
valve<00:01:15.180> material<00:01:15.900> we're<00:01:16.890> always<00:01:17.070> looking<00:01:17.369> for

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
valve material we're always looking for

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
valve material we're always looking for
ways<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.119> improve<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.680> valve<00:01:19.860> material

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
ways to improve the valve material

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
ways to improve the valve material
originally<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:20.909> full<00:01:21.420> FDA<00:01:22.080> approved<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:22.950> we

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
originally was full FDA approved but we

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520 
originally was full FDA approved but we
then<00:01:23.490> looked<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.909> other<00:01:24.150> material<00:01:24.630> by<00:01:25.140> nickel

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
then looked at other material by nickel

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.370 
then looked at other material by nickel
plating<00:01:25.950> were<00:01:26.280> NSF<00:01:26.939> approved<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> an<00:01:27.810> X

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
plating were NSF approved which is an X

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
plating were NSF approved which is an X
higher<00:01:28.619> rating<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> means<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
higher rating and what that means is it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
higher rating and what that means is it
can<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> restaurant<00:01:30.960> environment<00:01:31.350> NSF

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
can go into a restaurant environment NSF

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.310 
can go into a restaurant environment NSF
is<00:01:32.460> required<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.030> restaurants<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.930> we

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
is required for restaurants and so we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.920 
is required for restaurants and so we
felt<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.040> would<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.490> better<00:01:35.670> for<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.119> valve

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
felt that would be better for the valve

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.550 
felt that would be better for the valve
itself<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.509> we<00:01:39.509> try<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> build<00:01:39.990> products

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
itself we also we try to build products

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
itself we also we try to build products
where<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.070> try<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> build<00:01:41.490> our<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:42.360> know<00:01:42.450> try

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to build our products so that we are a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.850 
to build our products so that we are a
universal<00:01:45.180> platform<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> use<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
universal platform so that we can use it

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
universal platform so that we can use it
both<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> United<00:01:47.549> States<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:48.030> anywhere

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
both in the United States or anywhere

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
both in the United States or anywhere
else<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> world<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.530> what<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.040> discovered

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
else in the world and what we discovered

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.039 
else in the world and what we discovered
was<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.119> certain<00:01:51.329> countries<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.899> don't

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
was that in certain countries they don't

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
was that in certain countries they don't
have<00:01:52.200> paper<00:01:52.439> filters<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.610> had<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> enlarge

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
have paper filters so we had to enlarge

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.109 
have paper filters so we had to enlarge
the<00:01:54.780> gold<00:01:54.990> filter<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.860> act<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.369> place<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the gold filter to act in place of the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
the gold filter to act in place of the
gold<00:01:57.299> fill<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.719> excuse<00:01:58.049> me<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> paper<00:01:58.500> filter

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
gold fill or excuse me the paper filter

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.980 
gold fill or excuse me the paper filter
so<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.460> enlarged<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.210> enlarged<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.780> gold

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so we enlarged it we enlarged the gold

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.249 
so we enlarged it we enlarged the gold
filter<00:02:01.320> by<00:02:01.469> about<00:02:01.680> 15%<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:02.909> they<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
filter by about 15% because they use the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.709 
filter by about 15% because they use the
grams<00:02:04.590> versus<00:02:05.040> what<00:02:05.159> they<00:02:05.310> use<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:06.270> gland

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
grams versus what they use for one gland

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.559 
grams versus what they use for one gland
well<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.439> recommended<00:02:08.009> 65<00:02:08.550> grams<00:02:08.910> per<00:02:09.300> liter

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
well it's recommended 65 grams per liter

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.530 
well it's recommended 65 grams per liter
so<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.200> 1.2<00:02:10.679> liters<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.819> 78<00:02:12.330> grams

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so for 1.2 liters it would be 78 grams

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.050 
so for 1.2 liters it would be 78 grams
and<00:02:12.870> we

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and we

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.990 
and we
use<00:02:13.180> we<00:02:13.690> use<00:02:13.720> 55<00:02:14.290> grams<00:02:14.770> per<00:02:15.069> liter<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.580> if<00:02:15.760> it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
use we use 55 grams per liter so if it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.020 
use we use 55 grams per liter so if it
was<00:02:16.120> 10%<00:02:16.810> larger<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.620> we<00:02:17.770> had<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.040> enlarge<00:02:18.670> this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
was 10% larger so we had to enlarge this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.660 
was 10% larger so we had to enlarge this
thus<00:02:19.870> we<00:02:20.110> had<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.410> enlarge<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.340> grounds

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
thus we had to enlarge the grounds

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.790 
thus we had to enlarge the grounds
basket<00:02:22.090> itself<00:02:22.420> perfect<00:02:22.989> well<00:02:23.290> we<00:02:23.410> took<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
basket itself perfect well we took the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.430 
basket itself perfect well we took the
time<00:02:24.069> at<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.760> opportunity<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.750> redesign<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
time at that opportunity to redesign the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.280 
time at that opportunity to redesign the
valve<00:02:26.650> stem<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.610> instead<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.510> feed<00:02:28.930> coming

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
valve stem so instead of the feed coming

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.920 
valve stem so instead of the feed coming
on<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> outside<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.700> carafe<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.780> were

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
on the outside of the carafe we were

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.229 
on the outside of the carafe we were
doing<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.380> center<00:02:32.739> feed<00:02:32.980> which<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.910> turn

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
doing a center feed which in turn

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.140 
doing a center feed which in turn
created<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.930> hotter<00:02:35.170> cup<00:02:35.560> or<00:02:36.370> hotter<00:02:36.790> coffee

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
created a hotter cup or hotter coffee

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.420 
created a hotter cup or hotter coffee
into<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> carafe<00:02:38.230> there<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:38.980> go

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
into the carafe there you go

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.990 
into the carafe there you go
lastly<00:02:40.209> we<00:02:40.420> changed<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.980> spout<00:02:42.250> we<00:02:42.730> found

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
lastly we changed the spout we found

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.300 
lastly we changed the spout we found
that<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.330> were<00:02:43.360> getting<00:02:43.870> ourselves<00:02:44.200> yes<00:02:44.980> we

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
that we were getting ourselves yes we

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.690 
that we were getting ourselves yes we
were<00:02:45.489> we<00:02:46.120> had<00:02:46.510> used<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.959> design<00:02:47.680> developed<00:02:48.549> for

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
were we had used a design developed for

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.759 
were we had used a design developed for
another<00:02:48.910> company<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:50.260> found<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
another company and we found that the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.729 
another company and we found that the
tooling<00:02:51.130> had<00:02:51.370> not<00:02:51.910> stayed<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:52.959> stable<00:02:53.319> as<00:02:53.590> we'd

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
tooling had not stayed as stable as we'd

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.800 
tooling had not stayed as stable as we'd
like<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.280> we're<00:02:54.760> getting<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.150> dribble<00:02:55.480> effect

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
like and we're getting a dribble effect

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.800 
like and we're getting a dribble effect
so<00:02:55.989> we<00:02:56.110> actually<00:02:56.849> redesigned<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:58.269> spout<00:02:58.540> and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
so we actually redesigned the spout and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.930 
so we actually redesigned the spout and
now<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.200> get<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> little<00:02:59.830> bit<00:02:59.920> of<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.160> flair

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
now you get a little bit of a flair

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.059 
now you get a little bit of a flair
going<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.450> usually<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.560> brought<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.980> up

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
going on usually you brought it up

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.640 
going on usually you brought it up
essentially<00:03:03.670> we're<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.120> would<00:03:04.450> sit<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.810> hotels

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
essentially we're I would sit in hotels

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.470 
essentially we're I would sit in hotels
and<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.040> their<00:03:06.220> lobbies<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.819> look<00:03:06.940> at<00:03:07.060> every

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
and in their lobbies and look at every

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.050 
and in their lobbies and look at every
spout<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.530> just<00:03:09.250> take<00:03:09.400> photographs<00:03:09.940> really

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
spout and just take photographs really

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.199 
spout and just take photographs really
so<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.360> go<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.830> hotels<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.040> spend<00:03:12.280> $400<00:03:13.180> a

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
so you go to hotels and spend $400 a

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.539 
so you go to hotels and spend $400 a
night<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.569> look<00:03:13.690> at<00:03:13.840> spas<00:03:14.049> this<00:03:14.380> was<00:03:15.340> just

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
night to look at spas this was just

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.460 
night to look at spas this was just
during<00:03:15.700> all<00:03:15.970> my<00:03:16.000> travels<00:03:16.599> Oh<00:03:16.810> gotcha<00:03:17.140> yeah

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
during all my travels Oh gotcha yeah

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.310 
during all my travels Oh gotcha yeah
yeah<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:19.000> those<00:03:19.450> those<00:03:19.690> are<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.900> basics

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
yeah so those those are the basics

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.130 
yeah so those those are the basics
changes<00:03:20.859> those<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.730> know<00:03:21.850> tell<00:03:22.690> us<00:03:22.720> about<00:03:23.019> the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
changes those you know tell us about the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.289 
changes those you know tell us about the
programming<00:03:23.650> that's<00:03:23.829> remain<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.910> same<00:03:25.090> on

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
programming that's remain the same on

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.390 
programming that's remain the same on
this<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.840> programming<00:03:26.530> has<00:03:26.709> remained<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
this the programming has remained the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.539 
this the programming has remained the
same<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.850> mean<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.359> still<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.810> basic<00:03:29.400> set<00:03:30.400> up

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
same I mean it's still the basic set up

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.190 
same I mean it's still the basic set up
if<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.420> tell<00:03:31.630> people<00:03:31.750> if<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.049> could

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
if you and I tell people if you could

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.860 
if you and I tell people if you could
set<00:03:32.350> up<00:03:32.440> an<00:03:32.560> iPhone<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.940> far<00:03:34.209> easier<00:03:34.480> to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
set up an iPhone this is far easier to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.380 
set up an iPhone this is far easier to
set<00:03:35.049> up<00:03:35.079> than<00:03:35.319> even<00:03:35.709> well<00:03:35.859> I<00:03:35.890> remember<00:03:36.190> be<00:03:36.760> when

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
set up than even well I remember be when

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.020 
set up than even well I remember be when
we<00:03:37.510> did<00:03:37.750> our<00:03:37.780> first<00:03:37.959> video<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:39.030> vision

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
we did our first video on the vision

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.590 
we did our first video on the vision
version<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.609> I<00:03:42.609> guess<00:03:43.000> got<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.359> cold

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
version one and I guess got it cold

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.390 
version one and I guess got it cold
didn't<00:03:44.350> read<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.560> manual<00:03:44.650> nothing<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.310> it

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
didn't read the manual nothing and it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.729 
didn't read the manual nothing and it
was<00:03:45.519> like<00:03:45.720> intuitive<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.810> if<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.260> can<00:03:47.440> do<00:03:47.560> it

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
was like intuitive I if I can do it

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.250 
was like intuitive I if I can do it
it<00:03:48.459> really<00:03:48.760> can<00:03:49.150> do<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.870> that's<00:03:49.959> what<00:03:50.139> we

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
it really can do it and that's what we

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.009 
it really can do it and that's what we
tried<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.530> do<00:03:50.709> we<00:03:50.859> we<00:03:51.340> understand<00:03:51.819> that<00:03:52.060> if<00:03:52.690> we

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
tried to do we we understand that if we

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.690 
tried to do we we understand that if we
all<00:03:53.170> go<00:03:53.319> back<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.739> days<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.100> our<00:03:54.280> first

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
all go back to the days of our first

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.110 
all go back to the days of our first
video<00:03:55.090> machine<00:03:55.510> oh<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:57.430> take<00:03:57.579> me<00:03:57.760> there<00:03:57.940> and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
video machine oh don't take me there and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.030 
video machine oh don't take me there and
that's<00:03:58.329> what<00:03:58.600> what<00:03:59.079> we<00:03:59.200> wanted<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.650> prevent

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
that's what what we wanted to prevent

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.830 
that's what what we wanted to prevent
people<00:04:00.549> having<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.150> kind<00:04:01.329> of<00:04:01.450> video<00:04:01.569> it's

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
people having that kind of video it's

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720 
people having that kind of video it's
easy<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.260> set<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.709> can<00:04:02.859> change<00:04:03.130> temperature

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
easy to set you can change temperature

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.110 
easy to set you can change temperature
altitude<00:04:04.660> yeah<00:04:05.620> that's<00:04:05.889> a<00:04:05.950> crime<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.670> well

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
altitude yeah that's a crime in it well

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.599 
altitude yeah that's a crime in it well
you<00:04:07.750> can<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.260> can<00:04:08.410> change<00:04:08.590> every<00:04:09.010> aspect<00:04:09.040> time

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
you can you can change every aspect time

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.240 
you can you can change every aspect time
of<00:04:09.790> day<00:04:10.350> everything<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.620> beauty<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
of day everything and the beauty is the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.680 
of day everything and the beauty is the
system<00:04:12.609> actually<00:04:12.910> stores<00:04:13.209> memory<00:04:13.510> we

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
system actually stores memory we

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.140 
system actually stores memory we
actually<00:04:14.139> have<00:04:14.350> onboard<00:04:15.250> memory<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:15.760> if<00:04:15.970> you

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
actually have onboard memory so if you

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.360 
actually have onboard memory so if you
were<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.419> unplug<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.989> system<00:04:17.350> it<00:04:17.620> will<00:04:18.010> store

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
were to unplug the system it will store

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.909 
were to unplug the system it will store
everything<00:04:18.880> you've<00:04:19.269> put<00:04:19.570> into<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.900> except<00:04:20.709> for

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
everything you've put into it except for

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.710 
everything you've put into it except for
the<00:04:21.010> time<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.430> day<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.849> the<00:04:22.060> reason<00:04:22.419> for<00:04:22.450> that

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
the time of day and the reason for that

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.310 
the time of day and the reason for that
is<00:04:22.990> when<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:23.979> have<00:04:24.130> an<00:04:24.640> active<00:04:25.180> de<00:04:25.510> product<00:04:26.200> or

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
is when you have an active de product or

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.910 
is when you have an active de product or
something

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
something

something
of<00:04:27.010> like<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.250> clock<00:04:27.580> you<00:04:27.880> have<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.420> have

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
of like a clock you have to have

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.780 
of like a clock you have to have
constant<00:04:29.200> power<00:04:29.530> whether<00:04:29.860> it's<00:04:30.070> battery<00:04:30.520> and

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
constant power whether it's battery and

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.460 
constant power whether it's battery and
or<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.600> that's<00:04:31.960> okay

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
or and that's okay

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
temperatures and taste it to see if

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.280 
temperatures and taste it to see if
there<00:04:54.940> isn't<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.360> difference<00:04:55.570> because<00:04:56.110> that's

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
the beauty of this machine is you can

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.670 
the beauty of this machine is you can
change<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.360> temperature<00:04:58.630> that's<00:04:59.170> correct

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
change the temperature that's correct

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.920 
change the temperature that's correct
so<00:04:59.890> let's<00:05:00.340> cut<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:01.060> chase<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.360> do<00:05:01.780> that

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
so let's cut to the chase and do that

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.030 
so let's cut to the chase and do that
and<00:05:02.200> then<00:05:02.320> we'll<00:05:02.380> come<00:05:02.560> back<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:02.740> we'll<00:05:02.980> have

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
we have brewed these we let them cool

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.810 
we have brewed these we let them cool
down<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.830> little<00:05:11.920> cuz<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.310> flavors<00:05:12.670> come

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
down a little cuz the flavors come

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.340 
down a little cuz the flavors come
through<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:13.090> little<00:05:13.510> bit<00:05:13.600> better<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:14.110> coffee

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
through a little bit better the coffee

before we let it cool down there wasn't
as<00:05:50.380> much<00:05:50.610> separation<00:05:51.610> that's<00:05:52.330> right<00:05:52.570> now<00:05:52.750> the

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
as much separation that's right now the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.600 
as much separation that's right now the
berries<00:05:53.590> are<00:05:53.710> coming<00:05:53.950> through<00:05:54.070> loud<00:05:54.580> and
