00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
one is called latest I believe and I'm

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.310 
one is called latest I believe and I'm
using<00:00:10.670> a<00:00:10.820> fluffy<00:00:11.030> brush<00:00:11.179> and<00:00:11.629> blending<00:00:12.110> this

using a fluffy brush and blending this

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.510 
using a fluffy brush and blending this
into<00:00:12.830> my<00:00:13.519> crease<00:00:14.169> so<00:00:15.169> that<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:15.860> other<00:00:16.129> the

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
into my crease so that the other the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.340 
into my crease so that the other the
darker<00:00:16.820> colors<00:00:17.180> will<00:00:17.480> be<00:00:17.600> able<00:00:17.750> to<00:00:17.960> blend<00:00:18.200> out

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
darker colors will be able to blend out

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.630 
darker colors will be able to blend out
a<00:00:18.560> lot<00:00:18.770> easier

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.259 

you

then<00:00:29.199> I'm<00:00:29.349> taking<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:30.009> color<00:00:30.419> Lucius<00:00:31.419> I<00:00:31.749> think

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
then I'm taking the color Lucius I think

then I'm taking the color Lucius I think
and<00:00:32.739> it's<00:00:32.860> just<00:00:32.980> a<00:00:33.219> red<00:00:33.930> reddish<00:00:34.930> brown<00:00:35.290> shade

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
and it's just a red reddish brown shade

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.880 
and it's just a red reddish brown shade
and<00:00:36.100> I'm<00:00:36.190> using<00:00:36.519> a<00:00:36.940> dome<00:00:37.750> brush<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.590> putting

today<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:50.829> then<00:00:51.790> I<00:00:51.820> took<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.390> fluffy<00:00:52.750> brush

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.590 
today so then I took the fluffy brush
again<00:00:53.229> and<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:54.100> little<00:00:54.280> bit<00:00:54.550> more<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:54.970> the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
again and a little bit more of the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.689 
again and a little bit more of the
transition<00:00:56.409> shade<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:56.860> blended<00:00:57.159> it<00:00:57.250> out<00:00:57.370> and

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
transition shade and blended it out and

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
then I'm adding more and blending out so

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.609 
then I'm adding more and blending out so
that<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.509> doesn't<00:01:01.900> become<00:01:02.790> muddy<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.379> that

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
that it doesn't become muddy and so that

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:35.830 
that it doesn't become muddy and so that
the<00:01:06.570> shadows<00:01:07.650> transition<00:01:08.650> easily

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.959 

taking<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.219> called<00:01:38.490> side

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
taking I think the is called side

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.580 
taking I think the is called side
try<00:01:39.979> um<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.429> just<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.289> reddish-brown

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
try um it's just a it's a reddish-brown

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.789 
try um it's just a it's a reddish-brown
trade<00:01:44.100> again<00:01:44.429> but<00:01:44.819> it's<00:01:45.090> more<00:01:45.420> Brown<00:01:46.170> than<00:01:46.469> red

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
trade again but it's more Brown than red

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.459 
trade again but it's more Brown than red
and<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.850> putting<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.750> over<00:01:48.810> my<00:01:49.110> lid

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
and I'm putting this all over my lid

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.590 
and I'm putting this all over my lid
with<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.679> flat<00:01:49.920> shader<00:01:50.189> brush<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:51.090> change

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
with a flat shader brush and I change

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.090 
with a flat shader brush and I change
the<00:01:51.689> angle<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.679> mirror<00:01:52.920> was

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the angle here because the mirror was

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.160 
the angle here because the mirror was
easier<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.539> like<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> standing

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
easier to see it was like a standing

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
easier to see it was like a standing
mirror<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> pulled<00:01:56.520> my<00:01:56.670> eye<00:01:56.700> caught<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
mirror but I pulled my eye caught a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.580 
mirror but I pulled my eye caught a
little<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.959> in<00:01:58.109> the<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.380> inner

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
little bit just to get in the very inner

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.440 
little bit just to get in the very inner
corner<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.310> packing<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> all<00:02:00.209> over<00:02:00.359> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
corner and I'm packing this all over the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.370 
corner and I'm packing this all over the
lid<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:01.670> stopping<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:03.479> before<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.049> crease

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
lid and stopping right before the crease

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.479 
lid and stopping right before the crease
and<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.179> taking<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.380> shade<00:02:07.709> Lucius<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and then I'm taking the shade Lucius and

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.339 
and then I'm taking the shade Lucius and
so<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.759> try<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.179> mixing<00:02:09.479> those<00:02:09.599> together<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
so I try and mixing those together and

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.740 
so I try and mixing those together and
putting<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.799> in<00:02:11.009> between<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:12.060> darker<00:02:12.480> shade

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
putting this in between the darker shade

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.449 
putting this in between the darker shade
in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> middle<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.860> red<00:02:14.069> crease<00:02:14.519> color

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.190 

and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.150> I'm<00:02:18.239> blending<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.689> with<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> fluffy

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
and then I'm blending out with a fluffy

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.270 
and then I'm blending out with a fluffy
brush<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.700> add<00:02:20.970> more<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.739> transition

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
brush you can add more of the transition

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.399 
brush you can add more of the transition
shade<00:02:23.519> or<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.909> can<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.420> use<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.110> fluffy

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409
