back<00:00:14.009> truck<00:00:14.250> me<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.759> move<00:00:15.480> around<00:00:15.599> to

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
back truck me I just move around to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.980 
back truck me I just move around to
those<00:00:15.990> okay<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.830> put<00:00:17.670> purple<00:00:18.210> LEDs<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
those okay I put purple LEDs in the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470 
those okay I put purple LEDs in the
bottom<00:00:19.289> one<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.400> shows<00:00:20.609> blue<00:00:20.910> which<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
bottom one and it shows blue which is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.050 
bottom one and it shows blue which is
not<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:21.930> want<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:23.100> i<00:00:23.279> was<00:00:23.430> looking<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.880> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
not what we want and i was looking at to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.650 
not what we want and i was looking at to
how<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> might<00:00:24.420> get<00:00:24.779> around<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:26.400> I

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
how I might get around that and I

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.880 
how I might get around that and I
obviously<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.050> first<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:28.439> ed<00:00:28.619> fire

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
obviously this is the first I've ed fire

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.440 
obviously this is the first I've ed fire
made<00:00:29.869> which<00:00:30.869> does<00:00:31.380> show<00:00:31.560> purple<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.969> wanted

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
made which does show purple but I wanted

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.950 
made which does show purple but I wanted
that<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.860> more<00:00:34.860> light<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.399> possible<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.270> I'm

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that to be more light if possible so I'm

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.090 
that to be more light if possible so I'm
looking<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> possibility<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.980> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
looking at the possibility now of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.200 
looking at the possibility now of
painting<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> fins<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> fan<00:00:40.920> white<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
painting the fins on the fan white and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.310 
painting the fins on the fan white and
see<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.420> will<00:00:42.600> reflect<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.140> bit

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
see if that will reflect a little bit

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
see if that will reflect a little bit
more<00:00:43.530> light<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.879> doing<00:00:44.910> on

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
more light so that's what I'm doing on

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.069 
more light so that's what I'm doing on
this<00:00:45.180> project<00:00:45.420> we're<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> take<00:00:45.960> those

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
this project we're going to take those

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.310 
this project we're going to take those
spins<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.300> better<00:00:48.300> Liam<00:00:48.690> paint<00:00:49.200> them

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
spins out and better Liam paint them

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.049 
spins out and better Liam paint them
white<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.920> also<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> try<00:00:50.550> spraying

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
white I'm also going to try spraying

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.479 
white I'm also going to try spraying
this<00:00:51.270> round<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> edge<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.980> black<00:00:53.250> paint

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
this round the edge and with black paint

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.139 
this round the edge and with black paint
as<00:00:53.760> well<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.899> kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.289> hide<00:00:56.039> those<00:00:56.370> those

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
as well just to kind of hide those those

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
as well just to kind of hide those those
cables<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> make<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
cables a little bit just to make the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.210 
cables a little bit just to make the
whole<00:00:59.100> job<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.550> little<00:01:00.059> bit<00:01:00.239> neater<00:01:04.159> okay<00:01:05.159> so

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
whole job a little bit neater okay so

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.510 
whole job a little bit neater okay so
we've<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:05.700> removed<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> part<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.400> are

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
we've now removed the part that we are

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.390 
we've now removed the part that we are
going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.880> paint<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.220> there's<00:01:11.220> many

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
going to paint and there's many

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to paint and there's many
tutorials<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.630> YouTube<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.290> how<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> do

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
tutorials on on YouTube about how to do

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.289 
tutorials on on YouTube about how to do
that<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.340> I'm<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> cover

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
that so I'm not really going to cover

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.560 
that so I'm not really going to cover
that<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.689> any<00:01:16.320> great<00:01:16.710> detail<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.640> suffice<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that in any great detail here suffice to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
that in any great detail here suffice to
say<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.380> actually<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.799> at<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> ring

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
say that it's actually get at the ring

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.969 
say that it's actually get at the ring
in<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.740> rubber

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
in here there was a kind of a rubber

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.100 
in here there was a kind of a rubber
grommet<00:01:23.340> ramat<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.360> sealed<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.900> quite

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
grommet ramat which was sealed in quite

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.679 
grommet ramat which was sealed in quite
well<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.590> almost<00:01:25.710> hidden<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:27.479> had<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
well it was almost hidden and I had to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.580 
well it was almost hidden and I had to
get<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.530> small

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
get that out with a very small

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.810 
get that out with a very small
screwdriver<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.939> managed<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.820> there

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
screwdriver but we managed it and there

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.960 
screwdriver but we managed it and there
we<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> motor<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
we go we can actually see the motor of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.899 
we go we can actually see the motor of
the<00:01:36.479> fan<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.409> well<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.650> that's<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.700> fan

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the fan there as well so that's the fan

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.719 
the fan there as well so that's the fan
now<00:01:38.939> split<00:01:39.600> into<00:01:39.810> its<00:01:39.930> respective<00:01:40.560> parts<00:01:40.950> we

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
now split into its respective parts we

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.399 
now split into its respective parts we
now<00:01:41.880> need<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.420> prior<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.990> some

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
now need to get some prior and some

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.800 
now need to get some prior and some
paint<00:01:44.780> okay<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.759> we've<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
paint okay well with them we've got the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.280 
paint okay well with them we've got the
fins<00:01:49.079> painted<00:01:49.890> we've<00:01:50.540> got<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> coat<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.079> primer

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
fins painted we've got a coat of primer

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.010 
fins painted we've got a coat of primer
on<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.579> coat<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> paint<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
on there and a coat of paint and that is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
on there and a coat of paint and that is
now<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> glossy<00:01:56.009> white<00:01:56.280> probably<00:01:56.579> need<00:01:56.700> another

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
now a glossy white probably need another

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.880 
now a glossy white probably need another
coat<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:58.229> waiting<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.770> go

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
coat I think so just waiting that to go

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.429 
coat I think so just waiting that to go
and<00:01:59.159> touch<00:01:59.729> dry<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.509> put<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> put

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
and touch dry so we can put a put

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.260 
and touch dry so we can put a put
another<00:02:01.619> coat<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.460> then<00:02:02.520> hopefully

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
another coat on there and then hopefully

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
another coat on there and then hopefully
we'll<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.509> able<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.719> wear<00:02:03.930> fun<00:02:04.799> back<00:02:04.950> together

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.640 

okay<00:02:10.290> so<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.770> fun<00:02:11.010> has<00:02:11.400> now<00:02:11.550> been<00:02:11.730> painted<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
okay so the fun has now been painted and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.850 
okay so the fun has now been painted and
put<00:02:13.650> back<00:02:13.890> together<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.410> actually<00:02:16.410> quite

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
put back together and actually quite

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500 
put back together and actually quite
more<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.310> look<00:02:17.640> about<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.030> looks<00:02:18.210> like<00:02:18.360> one

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
more like look about it looks like one

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.930 
more like look about it looks like one
of<00:02:18.540> those<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:19.650> fancy<00:02:19.860> sharkoon<00:02:20.460> fans<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
of those a really fancy sharkoon fans of

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.120 
of those a really fancy sharkoon fans of
course<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.270> isn't<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.720> that's<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.860> looks

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
course it isn't but that's what it looks

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
course it isn't but that's what it looks
like<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:24.300> think<00:02:24.480> we've<00:02:24.570> done<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.750> good<00:02:24.870> job

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
like and I think we've done a good job

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.290 
like and I think we've done a good job
of<00:02:25.110> kind<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.980> stealth<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> cables<00:02:27.120> around

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
of kind of stealth in the cables around

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.510 
of kind of stealth in the cables around
the<00:02:27.540> edge<00:02:27.690> as<00:02:27.930> well<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.130> thing<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.490> now

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the edge as well so the thing to do now

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.870 
the edge as well so the thing to do now
obviously<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:31.010> connect<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.160> up<00:02:32.280> get<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.550> wired

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
obviously to connect it up get it wired

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.440 
obviously to connect it up get it wired
into<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.420> jumble<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.380> wires<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.700> though<00:02:35.880> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
into that jumble of wires on though and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.580 
into that jumble of wires on though and
see<00:02:36.780> what<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.990> effect<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:39.290> okay<00:02:40.290> then

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
see what the effect is like okay then

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.620 
see what the effect is like okay then
here<00:02:40.740> we<00:02:40.770> go<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.550> all<00:02:41.820> connected<00:02:42.150> up

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
here we go there it is all connected up

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.820 
here we go there it is all connected up
and<00:02:43.160> that's<00:02:44.160> not<00:02:44.520> bad<00:02:44.820> actually<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.560> does

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
and that's not bad actually that does

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.850 
and that's not bad actually that does
kick<00:02:47.430> out<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.610> little<00:02:47.850> bit<00:02:48.030> more<00:02:48.240> light<00:02:48.480> than<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
kick out a little bit more light than it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.610 
kick out a little bit more light than it
did<00:02:50.130> before<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:51.150> painted<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.600> white<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:52.590> I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
did before we painted it white but I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.230 
did before we painted it white but I
think<00:02:52.740> what<00:02:52.920> we<00:02:53.010> should<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.580> turn<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
think what we should do is turn the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.750 
think what we should do is turn the
light<00:02:54.390> off<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.350> see<00:02:55.650> how<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.920> looks

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.030 

okay<00:02:59.760> so<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.030> lights<00:03:00.210> are<00:03:00.420> off<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.930> well<00:03:01.770> I

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
okay so the lights are off and well I

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.530 
okay so the lights are off and well I
actually<00:03:02.430> think<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.910> there<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.390> an

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
actually think that there is an

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.740 
actually think that there is an
improvement<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:04.740> we<00:03:04.860> had<00:03:05.100> before<00:03:05.750> it's

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
improvement and what we had before it's

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.600 
improvement and what we had before it's
still<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.020> softer<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.740> more<00:03:07.800> subtle<00:03:08.280> effect

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
still a softer and more subtle effect

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.700 
still a softer and more subtle effect
than<00:03:09.180> having<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.540> clear<00:03:09.750> fan<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.560> know

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
than having a clear fan but you know

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.910 
than having a clear fan but you know
that<00:03:11.160> might<00:03:11.550> actually<00:03:11.989> do<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.440> job<00:03:13.680> no<00:03:13.890> I

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
that might actually do the job no I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.380 
that might actually do the job no I
could<00:03:14.250> probably<00:03:14.430> go<00:03:14.580> out<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:14.700> buy<00:03:14.850> some<00:03:15.180> clear

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
could probably go out and buy some clear

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.330 
could probably go out and buy some clear
LED<00:03:15.600> fans<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.230> wanted<00:03:16.560> but<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:17.190> know

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
LED fans if I wanted but you know

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100 
LED fans if I wanted but you know
where's<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> fun<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.209> I'm<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.840> trying

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
where's the fun in that I'm just trying

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.770 
where's the fun in that I'm just trying
to<00:03:19.140> see<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.070> can<00:03:20.250> make<00:03:20.370> my<00:03:20.520> own<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:21.030> wait<00:03:21.660> and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
to see if I can make my own and wait and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.470 
to see if I can make my own and wait and
do<00:03:21.959> what<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.830> them<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:22.980> do<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:23.459> I'm<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:24.360> the

whole<00:03:24.660> but<00:03:24.930> that's<00:03:25.470> not<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.650> bad<00:03:25.860> fan<00:03:26.390> what<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
whole but that's not a bad fan what I

and see how much we like it and if we
don't<00:03:38.730> then<00:03:38.940> we'll<00:03:39.060> try<00:03:39.180> something<00:03:39.450> else<00:03:39.660> but

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
don't then we'll try something else but
