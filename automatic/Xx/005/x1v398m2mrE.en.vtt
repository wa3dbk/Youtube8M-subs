00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.990 
go up the neck so down here you won't
really<00:01:05.950> notice<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.280> at<00:01:06.400> all<00:01:06.580> but<00:01:06.700> as<00:01:06.790> you<00:01:06.880> start

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
really notice it at all but as you start

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.550 
really notice it at all but as you start
to<00:01:07.119> get<00:01:07.210> above<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.450> 12th<00:01:07.810> fret<00:01:07.990> or<00:01:08.229> start<00:01:08.440> to

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
to get above the 12th fret or start to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.070

feel that the frets start becoming very

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.330 
feel that the frets start becoming very
scalloped<00:01:11.560> which<00:01:11.830> means<00:01:12.040> they've<00:01:12.220> actually

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
scalloped which means they've actually

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.620 
scalloped which means they've actually
taken<00:01:12.700> away<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.880> little<00:01:13.030> bit<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.270> neck<00:01:13.479> in

taken away a little bit the neck in
between<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.020> frets<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.860> dips<00:01:15.100> down

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
between the frets and it dips down

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.670 
between the frets and it dips down
