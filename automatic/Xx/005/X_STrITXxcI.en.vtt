00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
around the yards but then they got new

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.490 
around the yards but then they got new
ones<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.330> someone<00:02:38.630> riding<00:02:38.870> into<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.260> one

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500

ones and someone riding into this one
with<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.860> actually<00:02:40.700> riding<00:02:40.910> into<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.480> a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
with the actually riding into it with a

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:52.720 
with the actually riding into it with a
crane<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:43.070> what<00:02:43.190> they<00:02:43.310> did<00:02:43.490> was<00:02:51.490> anyway<00:02:52.490> tubes

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
crane but what they did was anyway tubes

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.170 
crane but what they did was anyway tubes
so<00:02:53.210> my<00:02:53.330> dad<00:02:53.540> as<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.320> can<00:02:54.470> see<00:02:55.180> fiberglass

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
so my dad as you can see fiberglass

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.510 
so my dad as you can see fiberglass
stick<00:02:56.450> together<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.770> now<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.100> works<00:02:58.220> pretty

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
stick together and now it works pretty

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.020 
stick together and now it works pretty
good<00:02:59.440> it<00:03:00.440> was<00:03:00.590> my<00:03:00.740> first<00:03:01.010> vehicle<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.700> used<00:03:01.910> to

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
good it was my first vehicle I used to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.450 
good it was my first vehicle I used to

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
drive it all around the yard when I was

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.250 
drive it all around the yard when I was
probably<00:03:04.640> younger<00:03:04.910> than<00:03:05.210> even<00:03:05.570> matt<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.990> now

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
probably younger than even matt is now

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.440 
probably younger than even matt is now
but<00:03:06.500> he's<00:03:06.770> doing<00:03:07.520> pretty<00:03:07.580> good<00:03:07.790> with<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.300> maybe

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
but he's doing pretty good with it maybe

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:28.190 
but he's doing pretty good with it maybe
want<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.780> let<00:03:09.020> him<00:03:09.110> drive<00:03:09.320> that<00:03:09.530> world

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.560 

it's<00:03:29.200> electric<00:03:29.800> we<00:03:30.040> run<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.430> on<00:03:30.550> three<00:03:31.300> big

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
it's electric we run it on three big

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.840 
it's electric we run it on three big
truck<00:03:31.960> batteries<00:03:32.560> uh<00:03:32.590> we<00:03:33.340> used<00:03:33.490> to<00:03:33.580> just<00:03:33.760> have

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
truck batteries uh we used to just have

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.390 
truck batteries uh we used to just have
like<00:03:34.090> deep<00:03:34.330> cells<00:03:34.600> but<00:03:34.900> we<00:03:35.110> had<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.320> someone<00:03:36.280> we

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
like deep cells but we had a someone we

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.760 
like deep cells but we had a someone we
could<00:03:36.550> get<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.820> truck<00:03:37.000> batteries<00:03:37.450> from<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.050> we

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
could get the truck batteries from so we

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.840 
could get the truck batteries from so we
use<00:03:38.980> them<00:03:39.220> now<00:03:40.740> 36<00:03:41.740> volts<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.370> put<00:03:42.580> them<00:03:42.670> in<00:03:42.790> a

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
use them now 36 volts and put them in a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.210 
use them now 36 volts and put them in a
series<00:03:43.180> me<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.290> friend<00:03:44.410> were<00:03:44.650> driving<00:03:45.070> all

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
series me and a friend were driving all

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.940 
series me and a friend were driving all
around<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.640> neighborhood<00:03:46.090> one<00:03:46.330> time<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:46.870> did<00:03:47.680> I

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
around the neighborhood one time I did I

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.530 
around the neighborhood one time I did I
came<00:03:48.310> back<00:03:48.490> checked<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:49.000> it's<00:03:49.120> still<00:03:49.300> I'd<00:03:49.390> like

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
came back checked it it's still I'd like

00:03:49.540 --> 00:04:12.610 
came back checked it it's still I'd like
37<00:03:50.170> volts<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.740> it'll<00:03:51.550> go<00:03:51.700> pretty<00:03:51.940> far

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.100 

eventually<00:04:13.620> we're<00:04:13.800> going<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.690> fix<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.930> all<00:04:16.049> up

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
eventually we're going to fix it all up

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.199 
eventually we're going to fix it all up
you<00:04:16.530> know<00:04:16.620> finish<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.040> fiberglass<00:04:17.610> sand<00:04:18.000> it

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
you know finish the fiberglass sand it

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.110 
you know finish the fiberglass sand it
paint<00:04:19.109> it<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.500> do<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.970> I'll

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
paint it and do all that and I'll

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.240 
paint it and do all that and I'll
probably<00:04:21.420> do<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.690> whole<00:04:21.959> series<00:04:22.290> of<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.800> right

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
probably do a whole series of that right

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:36.400 
probably do a whole series of that right

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.710 

I<00:05:41.670> remember<00:05:42.670> you<00:05:42.790> don't<00:05:42.910> want<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.210> turn<00:05:43.390> too

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
I remember you don't want to turn too

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.570 
I remember you don't want to turn too
sharply<00:05:44.200> cuz<00:05:44.500> you<00:05:44.590> couldn't<00:05:44.830> flip<00:05:44.920> over<00:05:45.340> cuz

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
sharply cuz you couldn't flip over cuz

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:52.470 
sharply cuz you couldn't flip over cuz
it<00:05:45.700> only<00:05:45.820> has<00:05:46.060> three<00:05:46.360> wheels<00:05:51.360> what<00:05:52.360> are<00:05:52.420> you

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
it only has three wheels what are you

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:08.280 
it only has three wheels what are you
doing<00:05:53.520> are<00:05:54.520> you<00:05:54.610> gonna<00:05:54.730> drive<00:05:54.940> anymore<00:06:07.290> you

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
doing are you gonna drive anymore you

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:18.860 
doing are you gonna drive anymore you
find<00:06:08.530> that<00:06:17.220> how<00:06:18.220> do<00:06:18.280> you<00:06:18.370> go<00:06:18.550> backwards

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
find that how do you go backwards

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.760 
find that how do you go backwards
backwards<00:06:21.720> it's<00:06:22.720> better<00:06:22.990> just<00:06:23.230> to<00:06:23.380> turn<00:06:23.590> it

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
backwards it's better just to turn it

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.630 
backwards it's better just to turn it
real<00:06:23.920> sharp<00:06:24.220> and<00:06:24.430> to<00:06:24.490> go<00:06:24.640> around<00:06:24.940> okay<00:06:26.400> hey<00:06:27.400> go

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
real sharp and to go around okay hey go

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.960 
real sharp and to go around okay hey go
on<00:06:27.760> the<00:06:27.880> driveway<00:06:28.240> yeah<00:06:29.310> cuz<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.460> back<00:06:30.640> of<00:06:30.820> his

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.850 
on the driveway yeah cuz the back of his
it<00:06:31.120> backwards<00:06:31.540> goes<00:06:31.750> very<00:06:31.990> fast<00:06:32.350> and<00:06:32.740> it's

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
it backwards goes very fast and it's

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:40.380 
it backwards goes very fast and it's
hard<00:06:33.070> to<00:06:33.100> control<00:06:38.610> all<00:06:39.610> right<00:06:39.730> no<00:06:39.880> wait<00:06:40.090> here
