 of those good songs of enrique 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.809
 churches and are mentioned here the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.460
 perfection with the chords the arpeggio the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.440
 rhythm that make us have videos 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
 show on this side and letter of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
 chords and cristian dotcom down here 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.600
 in information I leave the link so 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.160
 ok let's start perfect with 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.789
 standard actions look how 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.789
 we start 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.360
 i 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.620
 i 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.620
 to shout 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.620
 lost 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 to burn 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 you 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
 Favourite 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.640
 all right 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.640
 Y 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.130
 and let's start with the chords we're going 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.900
 to use only after the trick of 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.260
 all the songs that we never take off 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.060
 finger number 3 and 4 always always 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.760
 they stay playing the third fret 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 then we passed omniscient as they 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.560
 I say we do not wait for the fingers after 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.260
 he founded the ninth that this is like the sun 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.160
 we just lowered a rope to the 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.310
 fingers and then in a normal nothing more 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.410
 always leave finger 3 and 4 as they are 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.640
 let's start with the arpeggio that is 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.640
 simple chequen know 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.810
 let's use big toe one two and 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.330
 three the fat one is going to be the low ones in 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.370
 sixth fifth and fourth respectively 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.890
 when he touches him and then finger number 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.880
 one we anchor in rope number three 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.460
 the 12 na 2 and the 3 na 1 these are never 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.670
 move from position we start the sun 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.430
 touching sixth after third and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.080
 we accentuated after first and we went back 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.080
 second third 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.680
 Y 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.760
 okay 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.409
 Y 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.510
 Y 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.709
 alive 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.590
 practically this way the refuge for 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.129
 the whole chicken song was started 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.129
 first sun 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.670
 then we change to me that I tell them and it's 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.670
 exactly the same arpeggio 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.720
 Y 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.550
 and nothing else endo changes the neighborhood what 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.550
 we do in the neighborhood on the fifth string 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.989
 and then network nothing lower to the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.989
 fourth rope the down or 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.480
 Y 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.319
 and it's going to be slow and we're giving it 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.319
 speed little by little 3 2 1 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.650
 in return 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.340
 In return 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.440
 i 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.440
 i 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.410
 although already horacio a little faster 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.410
 3 2 1 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.990
 i 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.710
 Y 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.670
 two 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.670
 i 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.730
 you 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.490
 Y 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.490
 two 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.190
 Y 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.150
 Y 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.150
 Y 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.810
 see, I'm going to put the letter 321 and 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.959
 once 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.959
 I could fill we changed to 2 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.840
 of vido 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.959
 again they are to burn 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.299
 my minor 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.500
 i 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.960
 is 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.700
 and we repeat all 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.810
 single 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.810
 you stop 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:38.790
 you will cry 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.790
 9 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.919
 and again 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.110
 a baby bottle 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.059
 another wind 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.059
 and we finish the sun 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.060
 we come immediately to the part of 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.840
 chorus and this is very easy strumming 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.870
 we are going to use only the king that 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.699
 I said and the dow do not see who is going 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.699
 cutting first two down 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.360
 you 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.570
 who already know that the boy is a change 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.650
 fast down up is 2 first towards 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:32.330
 down up again two down yuko 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:37.040
 and then tuntun tam tam tun tun what 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.610
 it's going to be slow 3 2 1 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.610
 yes 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.840
 yes 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.940
 i 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.940
 ah 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.219
 well a little faster 3 2 1 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.220
 Y 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.650
 because I put the letter 321 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.620
 and we repeat 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.180
 clouds 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.180
 yes 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.349
 comes the next stanza they can already 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:52.810
 opt for one of two or do the 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.639
 arpeggio that teaches them at the beginning or do 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.349
 the strum that teaches them right now 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.479
 I liked doing it more after the 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.759
 next stanza with this fast since 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:02.940
 it gives the song more fluency in 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.940
 yes 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.360
 Y 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.509
 and again 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:38.380
 perfect and now more than him alone this 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.180
 I leave them in another video so that 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.530
 do not make them so tedious and already when 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.990
 have learned this video to the 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.520
 perfection can go to that of the alone already 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.320
 they know that on my page they find the 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.000
 lyrics and the emo video so you do not 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.580
 no doubt do not forget to leave me here below 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.169
