00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
but what if that doesn't happen would

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.230 
but what if that doesn't happen would
you<00:06:34.280> would<00:06:34.669> you<00:06:34.699> hang<00:06:35.000> it<00:06:35.150> up<00:06:35.300> no<00:06:36.169> I<00:06:36.909> think<00:06:37.909> that
