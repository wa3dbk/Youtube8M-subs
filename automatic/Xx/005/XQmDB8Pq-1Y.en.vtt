shoot when you look at your shoes do you
ever<00:00:15.000> see<00:00:15.240> these<00:00:15.389> two<00:00:15.719> holes<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> side

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
ever see these two holes on the side

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.410 
ever see these two holes on the side
here<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.820> know<00:00:17.940> what<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> do<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.390> them

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
here do you know what to do with them

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.359 
here do you know what to do with them
well<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> didn't<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.470> thought<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.949> was<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.220> like

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
well I didn't I thought it was just like

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.939 
well I didn't I thought it was just like
an<00:00:20.520> option<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.930> where<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.560> want<00:00:22.800> your

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
an option to where you want your

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.210 
an option to where you want your
shoelaces<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.930> secure<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:25.949> it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
shoelaces to secure but actually it's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.290 
shoelaces to secure but actually it's
really<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.849> keep<00:00:27.289> your<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:29.279> ankle<00:00:30.029> from

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
really to keep your your ankle from

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.840 
really to keep your your ankle from
sliding<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.619> your<00:00:32.070> toes<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.489> hitting<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
sliding up and your toes I'm hitting the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.790 
sliding up and your toes I'm hitting the
top<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.809> let's<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.440> through<00:00:34.680> this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
top so let's go through this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.389 
top so let's go through this
step-by-step<00:00:36.050> laser<00:00:37.050> shoelaces<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:38.010> normal

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
step-by-step laser shoelaces as normal

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.830 
step-by-step laser shoelaces as normal
here<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:39.090> shown<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:41.210> sorry<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.719> go

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
here as shown here and sorry if you go

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.170 
here as shown here and sorry if you go
so<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.350> issues<00:00:44.190> aren't<00:00:44.489> those<00:00:44.850> shoelaces

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
so here issues aren't those shoelaces

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.490 
so here issues aren't those shoelaces
are<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.539> through<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> holes<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.260> anything

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
are not through the holes or anything

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.479 
are not through the holes or anything
yet<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.370> lasers<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.090> laces<00:00:48.480> through<00:00:49.489> normally

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
yet so lasers to laces through normally

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
yet so lasers to laces through normally
and<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.270> first<00:00:51.480> thing<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.170> step<00:00:52.590> one

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
and the first thing you do for step one

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
and the first thing you do for step one
is<00:00:53.100> take<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:54.000> strand<00:00:54.449> loop<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.199> underneath

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
is take one strand loop it underneath

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.930 
is take one strand loop it underneath
and<00:00:56.010> through<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> hole<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.050> other<00:00:58.079> side

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
and through the hole on the other side

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
and through the hole on the other side
so<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.210> looping<00:01:00.600> under<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> through<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so you're looping under and through the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.310 
so you're looping under and through the
first<00:01:01.710> hole<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.789> second<00:01:03.149> step<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.140> create

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
first hole your second step is to create

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.590 
first hole your second step is to create
bunny<00:01:04.739> loops<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.339> these<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.479> your

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
bunny loops with these two with your

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.600 
bunny loops with these two with your
shoelaces<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.760> shoelace<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
shoelaces you take the one shoelace and

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.030 
shoelaces you take the one shoelace and
you<00:01:11.610> loop<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> through<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.659> hole<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.830> same

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you loop it through the hole on the same

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.719 
you loop it through the hole on the same
side<00:01:15.200> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> outside<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.520> going

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
side on the outside in and you're going

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.070 
side on the outside in and you're going
to<00:01:17.820> leave<00:01:17.970> some<00:01:18.150> space<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.659> you're

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to leave some space here so you're

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
to leave some space here so you're
making<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> bunny<00:01:19.590> loop<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> same<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
making a bunny loop do the same on the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.260 
making a bunny loop do the same on the
other<00:01:21.030> side<00:01:22.009> you're<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
other side you're going out and then

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.899 
other side you're going out and then
inward<00:01:26.180> now<00:01:27.200> step<00:01:28.200> 3<00:01:28.530> you're<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> take

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
inward now step 3 you're going to take

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.499 
inward now step 3 you're going to take
the<00:01:30.560> Strand<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.700> side<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.240> loop<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the Strand on the one side and loop it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.120 
the Strand on the one side and loop it
through<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.869> bunny<00:01:34.079> ear<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> opposite

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
through the bunny ear on the opposite

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.929 
through the bunny ear on the opposite
side<00:01:38.600> like<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:41.040> now<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
side like so and now you're going to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.550 
side like so and now you're going to
pull<00:01:42.240> tightly<00:01:43.670> horizontally<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:46.229> really

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
pull tightly horizontally you really

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.410 
pull tightly horizontally you really
feel<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:47.040> ankle<00:01:47.340> lock<00:01:47.520> into<00:01:47.790> place<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.299> your

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
feel your ankle lock into place and your

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.370 
feel your ankle lock into place and your
heel<00:01:48.720> lock<00:01:49.229> into<00:01:49.500> place<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.950> well<00:01:51.229> make<00:01:52.229> sure

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
now you just secure the shoelace how do

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.179 
now you just secure the shoelace how do
you<00:01:58.439> normally<00:01:58.680> would

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.340 

right<00:02:03.189> super<00:02:03.880> easy<00:02:04.090> but<00:02:04.570> also<00:02:04.720> super<00:02:04.990> helpful
