00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.709 

make<00:02:13.250> sure<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.670> little<00:02:13.879> properly<00:02:14.450> coded

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
make sure it's a little properly coded

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.479 
make sure it's a little properly coded
and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:16.640> take<00:02:16.939> that<00:02:17.769> coated<00:02:18.769> mustard<00:02:19.280> piece

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.319 
of chicken and then dunk it in the flour
and<00:02:22.689> you<00:02:23.689> want<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.959> get<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.200> nice<00:02:24.439> and<00:02:24.500> properly

and you want to get it nice and properly
coded<00:02:26.329> with<00:02:26.629> flour<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:29.030> might<00:02:29.209> get<00:02:29.390> little

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
coded with flour you might get little

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.020 
coded with flour you might get little
bits<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.200> mustard<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.189> fall<00:02:31.400> off<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.939> kind

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030

of<00:02:32.180> flake<00:02:32.420> up<00:02:32.629> in<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> flour<00:02:33.349> that's<00:02:33.799> fine

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
of flake up in the flour that's fine

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.190 
of flake up in the flour that's fine
just<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.629> know<00:02:36.909> work<00:02:37.909> around<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.629> then
