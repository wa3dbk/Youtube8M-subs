a Silent Hill track as a reference you
know<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.570> think<00:01:15.570> when<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.200> actually

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
know and I think when you're actually

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
know and I think when you're actually
putting<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.280> trailer<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.299> horror

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
game something tells me that I don't

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.200 
game something tells me that I don't
think<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:26.270> Konami<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:28.280> would<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.759> kind

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
think that Konami at all would be kind

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.330 
think that Konami at all would be kind
of<00:01:30.329> cool<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.140> like

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
of cool with that that would be like

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
of cool with that that would be like
doing<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.549> trailer<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.150> an<00:01:33.270> RPG<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.900> you've

crystal<00:01:41.549> theme<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.060> lot<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
crystal theme I think I think a lot of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.789 
crystal theme I think I think a lot of
fans<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:47.540> people<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.439> game<00:01:49.590> industry

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
fans and people in the game industry

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.289 
fans and people in the game industry
would<00:01:50.310> take<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.820> bit<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.970> umbrage<00:01:51.270> with

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
would take a little bit of umbrage with

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.319 
would take a little bit of umbrage with
that<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.520> somewhat<00:01:54.000> shocking

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
that so that was just somewhat shocking

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.810 
that so that was just somewhat shocking
and<00:01:54.689> what's<00:01:54.930> more<00:01:55.110> shocking<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.979> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and what's more shocking is that in in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.380 
and what's more shocking is that in in
three<00:01:57.780> pages<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.560> greenlight<00:01:59.310> comments<00:02:00.090> on
