hello<00:00:01.170> and<00:00:01.319> welcome<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.860> river<00:00:02.070> channel

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hello and welcome to the river channel

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.260 
hello and welcome to the river channel
today<00:00:03.149> we're<00:00:03.449> looking<00:00:03.540> at<00:00:03.750> 3d<00:00:04.259> details<00:00:05.270> now

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
today we're looking at 3d details now

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.900 
today we're looking at 3d details now
River<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.690> an<00:00:06.779> amazing<00:00:07.319> piece<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.680> engineering

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
River is an amazing piece of engineering

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.330 
River is an amazing piece of engineering
software<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.530> it's<00:00:10.530> allowing<00:00:10.889> us<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.070> do

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
software and it's allowing us to do

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.669 
software and it's allowing us to do
things<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.940> previously<00:00:12.420> we've<00:00:12.990> only<00:00:13.200> dreamt

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
things that previously we've only dreamt

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.849 
things that previously we've only dreamt
of<00:00:13.950> doing<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:15.719> it's<00:00:15.839> also<00:00:16.020> allowing<00:00:16.350> us<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.740> do

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
of doing and it's also allowing us to do

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.500 
of doing and it's also allowing us to do
things<00:00:17.070> like<00:00:17.960> details<00:00:18.960> three<00:00:19.619> dimensionally

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
things like details three dimensionally

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.810 
things like details three dimensionally
things<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.720> would<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:22.050> basically<00:00:22.980> close<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
things that would be basically close to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.130 
things that would be basically close to
impossible<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.350> CAD<00:00:26.099> or<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> drawing

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
impossible on to the CAD or on a drawing

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.660 
impossible on to the CAD or on a drawing
board

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
board

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.070 
board
the<00:00:29.670> only<00:00:29.789> problem<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:30.539> still

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the only problem is there's still

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.970 
the only problem is there's still
certain<00:00:31.349> limitations<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.770> comes

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
certain limitations to it when it comes

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.910 
certain limitations to it when it comes
to<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> 3d<00:00:35.910> file<00:00:36.540> or<00:00:36.840> drawing<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.469> busy

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
to the 3d file or drawing that we busy

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.760 
to the 3d file or drawing that we busy
doing<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
doing so what you really want to do is

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.920 
doing so what you really want to do is
you<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.040> us<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> 3d<00:00:42.420> detail

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you want us you want to do a 3d detail

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.350 
you want us you want to do a 3d detail
and<00:00:43.250> then<00:00:44.300> kind<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.539> able<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.960> save<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
and then kind of be able to save it and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.670 
and then kind of be able to save it and
when<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> set<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.989> drawings<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> want

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
when you do a set of drawings you want

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.150 
when you do a set of drawings you want
to<00:00:49.770> bring<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.010> 3d<00:00:50.579> detail<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.559> without<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to bring that 3d detail in without the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
to bring that 3d detail in without the
3d<00:00:53.460> components<00:00:54.329> showing<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.170> 3d

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
3d components showing up in your 3d

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.279 
3d components showing up in your 3d
model<00:00:55.800> space<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:57.120> basically<00:00:57.539> what

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
model space and that's basically what

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
model space and that's basically what
we're<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.770> doing<00:00:58.949> today<00:00:59.270> see<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
we're going to be doing today see on the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.229 
we're going to be doing today see on the
screen<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:01.079> drawn<00:01:01.859> an<00:01:01.980> acoustic<00:01:02.640> roof

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
screen I've drawn an acoustic roof

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.189 
screen I've drawn an acoustic roof

I'm<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> redraw<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> show

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I'm not going to redraw that now to show

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920 
I'm not going to redraw that now to show
you<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.409> I've<00:01:07.560> done<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:08.510> model<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> bits

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you all I've done was model the bits

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
you all I've done was model the bits
that<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.860> need<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:12.030> 3d<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.159> then<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.490> used

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that are need in 3d and then I used

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
that are need in 3d and then I used
voids<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.450> layer<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> drawing<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.830> can

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
voids to layer the drawing so you can

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
voids to layer the drawing so you can
actually<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> different<00:01:18.270> components

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
actually see the different components

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.740 
actually see the different components
exposed<00:01:20.030> no<00:01:21.030> zoom<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.009> okay

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
exposed no zoom in you can see that okay

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.499 
exposed no zoom in you can see that okay
now<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:24.990> tip<00:01:26.150> something<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.330> did<00:01:27.479> wrong

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
now a little tip something I did wrong

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.130 
now a little tip something I did wrong
here<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.770> drew<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.630> cropped

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
here was I drew this and then cropped

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.710 
here was I drew this and then cropped
the<00:01:31.619> view<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.790> only<00:01:32.939> problem<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.540> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the view the only problem is when you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.770 
the view the only problem is when you
export<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:35.750> everything<00:01:36.750> that's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
export this then everything that's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.260 
export this then everything that's
cropped<00:01:37.350> won't<00:01:37.770> show<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.400> AutoCAD<00:01:38.970> it's

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
cropped won't show up in AutoCAD it's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.789 
cropped won't show up in AutoCAD it's
just<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.140> show<00:01:40.290> everything<00:01:40.650> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
just going to show everything that

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
just going to show everything that
you've<00:01:41.040> modeled<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> ignore

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you've modeled and it's going to ignore

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.999 
you've modeled and it's going to ignore
the<00:01:43.500> crop<00:01:43.740> lines<00:01:44.509> but<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.530> keep<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> in

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the crop lines but so just keep that in

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.010 
the crop lines but so just keep that in
mind<00:01:47.189> when<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> detail<00:01:48.180> okay<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.750> what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
mind when you do a detail okay so what

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
mind when you do a detail okay so what
we<00:01:49.170> want<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.310> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
we want to do is we want to see this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910 
we want to do is we want to see this
