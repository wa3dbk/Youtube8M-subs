00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.290 

yes<00:00:23.350> so<00:00:23.770> bad<00:00:24.010> you<00:00:24.160> have<00:00:24.340> you<00:00:24.550> did<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:25.150> have<00:00:25.240> a

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
yes so bad you have you did you have a

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.780 
yes so bad you have you did you have a
good<00:00:25.420> ride<00:00:25.630> yes<00:00:26.050> very<00:00:26.470> easy<00:00:26.530> often<00:00:27.340> think<00:00:27.640> of

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
good ride yes very easy often think of

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.790 
good ride yes very easy often think of
it<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:30.400> this<00:00:30.610> first<00:00:30.940> model<00:00:31.450> we<00:00:31.510> have<00:00:31.780> I<00:00:32.110> did

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
it in this first model we have I did

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.440 
it in this first model we have I did
these<00:00:33.160> little<00:00:33.340> rounds<00:00:34.300> each<00:00:34.720> one<00:00:35.170> is<00:00:35.470> a<00:00:35.830> small

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
these little rounds each one is a small

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.330 
these little rounds each one is a small
reconstructed<00:00:37.450> skin<00:00:37.750> mo<00:00:37.900> as<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.440> biologist<00:00:39.190> I

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
reconstructed skin mo as a biologist I

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.490 
reconstructed skin mo as a biologist I
would<00:00:39.610> just<00:00:39.760> love<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.510> take<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:40.989> skin<00:00:41.290> biopsy

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
would just love to take a skin biopsy

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.770 
would just love to take a skin biopsy
and<00:00:42.070> look<00:00:42.280> what<00:00:42.430> it's<00:00:42.550> happening<00:00:42.760> yeah<00:00:43.450> of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
and look what it's happening yeah of

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.770 
and look what it's happening yeah of
course<00:00:44.020> I<00:00:44.140> can't<00:00:44.350> do<00:00:44.500> no<00:00:45.210> curious<00:00:46.210> about<00:00:46.510> this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
course I can't do no curious about this

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.330 
course I can't do no curious about this
two<00:00:47.050> people<00:00:47.379> said<00:00:47.650> they<00:00:47.739> didn't<00:00:47.950> test<00:00:48.129> on<00:00:48.250> that

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
two people said they didn't test on that

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.500 
two people said they didn't test on that
else<00:00:48.520> you<00:00:48.610> feel<00:00:48.790> like<00:00:48.940> well<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.180> name<00:00:49.300> just

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
else you feel like well the name just

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.820 
else you feel like well the name just
must<00:00:49.690> have<00:00:49.750> volunteers

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
must have volunteers

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.530 
must have volunteers
I<00:00:50.860> mean<00:00:51.040> honestly<00:00:51.460> that's<00:00:51.820> what<00:00:52.120> we<00:00:52.269> thought

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
I mean honestly that's what we thought

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.200 
I mean honestly that's what we thought
you<00:00:53.409> know<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:53.860> this<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.070> fascinating<00:00:54.430> I<00:00:54.850> had<00:00:55.030> no

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
you know so this is fascinating I had no

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:06.730 
you know so this is fascinating I had no
idea

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.220 

so<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.160> we<00:01:08.400> are<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.660> place<00:01:09.900> where<00:01:10.200> we

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
so here we are in the place where we

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.710 
so here we are in the place where we
designed<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.010> new<00:01:11.040> formulas<00:01:11.730> and<00:01:12.120> where<00:01:12.480> we

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
designed the new formulas and where we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.390 
designed the new formulas and where we
create<00:01:13.140> them<00:01:14.660> most<00:01:15.660> of<00:01:15.990> our<00:01:16.140> formulas<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
create them most of our formulas are the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.760 
create them most of our formulas are the
mixture<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.210> oil<00:01:18.540> components<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.470> water

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
mixture of oil components with water

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.570 
mixture of oil components with water
components<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.900> definition<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:23.190> are<00:01:23.220> not

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
components so by definition they are not

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
components so by definition they are not
compatible<00:01:24.480> and<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.230> don't<00:01:25.440> like<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.650> be

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
compatible and they don't like to be

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.400 
compatible and they don't like to be
with<00:01:26.100> each<00:01:26.250> other<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.480> we<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.870> is<00:01:28.050> we<00:01:28.260> mix

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
with each other so what we do is we mix

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.890 
with each other so what we do is we mix
them<00:01:28.620> together<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.430> surfactants<00:01:30.210> that's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
them together with surfactants that's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.540 
them together with surfactants that's
great

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.990 

you<00:01:37.550> can<00:01:37.790> see<00:01:38.180> all<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.440> oil<00:01:39.980> droplets<00:01:40.640> very

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
you can see all the oil droplets very

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.810 
you can see all the oil droplets very
well<00:01:41.300> dispersed<00:01:41.810> very<00:01:42.320> very<00:01:42.620> small<00:01:43.010> tiny<00:01:43.460> one

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
well dispersed very very small tiny one

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.000 
well dispersed very very small tiny one
so<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.240> shows<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.780> formula<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.410> stable

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
so that shows that the formula is stable

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.680 
so that shows that the formula is stable
here<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.520> well<00:01:46.850> done<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:48.490> it's<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:50.270> going<00:01:50.570> to

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
here is well done and it's a is going to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.840 
here is well done and it's a is going to
have<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.930> good<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.680> good<00:01:52.070> life<00:01:52.310> on<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.550> market

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
have a good a good life on the market

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:04.540 
have a good a good life on the market
that's<00:01:52.970> great<00:01:53.390> Wow

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.170 

you

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.240 

you
