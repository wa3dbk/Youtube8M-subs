00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.789
 possible 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.680
 The ride is difficult because here 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.230
 there are no paved roads anymore 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.739

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.739
 tackle 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.830
 The view compensates for that

 kamchatka blue chips came back 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.590
 raw material key christoph ski and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.309
 clumsy leaves you 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.440
 lasting impression not quite 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.530
 it is currently not dangerous on the volcano 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 clumsy end of november 2012 began 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.160
 the volcano after 36 years rest 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.920
 break out again 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.020
 on the southern slope columns formed off 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.610
 which lava flows and ash up to three 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.210
 miles high into the air 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.250
 becomes 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.250
 for many an insane experience 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.780
 is either in the tent or 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.510
 as here traditionally with the people the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.430
 venen in anna free you are a very 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.950
 small people and belong to the man 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 blame these people for their own 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 few languages ​​speak very much 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.390
 few 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.300
 the more important it is the custom 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.040
 get the gear about the fire and the 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.960
 Brush with the juniper shrub 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.270
 serves to release everything bad 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.170
 and negative and donate power for the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.170
 further travel 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.030
 so strengthened it goes on to the 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.979
 southern volcanoes fight jet gas to 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.299
 first of all, the desperate need to ski 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.619
 career of another volcano 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.019
 be crossed 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.090
 There you can find in a height of 1000 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.879
 even in august still extended 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 snowfields the way up to the active 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.430
 crater leads through an impressive 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.110
 Landscape passing a glacier 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.489
 mud holes floor next to the way and on 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.930
 another place 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.930
 sulfuric acid damper 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:40.430
 for all involved, the pure adventure 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.430
 Certainly not forgotten so quickly
