00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello friends today we want you times 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.020
 imagine a game with caps 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.660
 we here 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.559
 not difficult to recognize speed cups is 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.260
 from amigo and it's very funny 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.240
 so also a turbulent family game 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.060
 really quite with younger children 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.130
 also playing can be as turbulent as that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 game is it can us right on the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.279
 bottom of the facts forced because we 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.970
 do not break our table 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.189
 wanted to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 but let's start packing 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.870
 together once the thing out there for 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 the four players g4 hat sets and 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.660
 this bell here of course and everyone 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.840
 from these four players or us 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 currently play 1 of this set 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.539
 consisting of money blue red black and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.730
 a green hat and this damned 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.860
 There are cards and recognize now 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.590
 Of course, even these ten cards 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.109
 contain the same colors as yours 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.840
 hat and that is already the inside 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.510
 here everyone gets eur 435 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.810
 Rübchen are gray and yellow black 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.650
 grill and vanity theme cards here eg 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.920
 let that go 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.799
 the socks or the ice from left to right 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.290
 right or from top to bottom right 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.880
 has given you the card 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.970
 of course if you were the fastest 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.130
 and directly on the buzzer resp 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.140
 which has carved flap here see it yet 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.229
 times from left to right 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.229
 while those once for example or from 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.460
 top down the flowers also became 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.590
 here the thing but long talk short 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.830
 We'll just do it 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.680
 while preparing a game for 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.830
 So we have to wait two players 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 the hats that is fair and lay 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:01.560
 but just a round going on so the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.390
 first card march yellow blue red green 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.390
 black and as fast as possible 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.209
 now dealing hütchen and 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.489
 would remain so the players links 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.920
 Of course, that's absolutely right 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.390
 you see you turn yellow red again 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.850
 green black 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.420
 Thus, this player also receives the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.750
 Map of the balzheimer 11 of the nec 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.180
 faster players then the surcharge 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.239
 would have done right if he but 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.769
 play for two makes it more meaningful if 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.830
 then just the other the card 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.439
 to get 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.569
 so and we can see that again 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.700
 flags are now yellow, for example 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.450
 green red black blue and as fast as 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.959
 possible to adjust and thus gives 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.959
 damn right out of here yet the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.659
 hütchen the coats the girl 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.099
 right places shows says yes 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.859
 now it's already the last 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:05.189
 map how right she agrees flawlessly 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.799
 and the last card would be okay from the top 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:15.150
 down green black red blue yellow 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:15.629
 Unfortunately, gas starts so great 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.909
 past 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.159
 but they control it again 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.019
 In the end, of course, everyone counts 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.909
 again his cards themselves through and 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.400
 Who thought the most now 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.620
 cards wins beat comes in 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.870
