to talk to you today about the most

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.550 
to talk to you today about the most
important<00:00:20.820> thing<00:00:20.939> when<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.990> figuring<00:00:22.380> out

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
important thing when you're figuring out

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.200 
important thing when you're figuring out
how<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.740> hold<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> drum<00:00:23.220> stick<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.910> figuring<00:00:24.180> out

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
how to hold a drum stick is figuring out

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390 
how to hold a drum stick is figuring out
where<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> hold<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.019> generally<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> third

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
where to hold it generally about a third

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.480 
where to hold it generally about a third
of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> way<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> stick<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.279> best

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
of the way of the stick is the the best

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.740 
of the way of the stick is the the best
place<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.760> that's<00:00:30.090> often<00:00:30.390> called<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
place and that's often called the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.260 
place and that's often called the
fulcrum<00:00:31.289> point<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:32.130> actually<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.700> balance

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
fulcrum point it's actually a balance

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
fulcrum point it's actually a balance
point<00:00:33.480> where<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> stick<00:00:34.590> will<00:00:34.710> actually

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
point where the stick will actually

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.260 
point where the stick will actually
achieve<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.399> most<00:00:35.610> amount<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> rebound<00:00:38.270> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
achieve the most amount of rebound and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
achieve the most amount of rebound and
you'll<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.690> able<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.350> most<00:00:40.469> speed<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
you'll be able to get the most speed and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
you'll be able to get the most speed and
relaxed<00:00:41.550> motion<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> hold<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
relaxed motion off of it if you hold a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.840 
relaxed motion off of it if you hold a
stick<00:00:43.230> too<00:00:43.440> far<00:00:43.680> back<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.370> kill<00:00:44.579> all<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
stick too far back you kill all the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.549 
stick too far back you kill all the
rebound<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> hold<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> stick<00:00:46.379> too

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
rebound and if you hold the stick too

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.979 
rebound and if you hold the stick too
far<00:00:46.770> forward<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.180> weight<00:00:48.360> falls<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.780> back

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
far forward the weight falls to the back

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.229 
far forward the weight falls to the back
of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> stick<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.460> important<00:00:50.969> thing

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of the stick so a really important thing

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.810 
of the stick so a really important thing
is<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.530> figure<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.770> where<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.460> fulcrum

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
is to figure out where your fulcrum

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000 
is to figure out where your fulcrum
point<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.320> different<00:00:55.620> approaches

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
point is there are different approaches

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.529 
point is there are different approaches
to<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.250> some<00:00:56.430> guys<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:57.090> people<00:00:57.270> will<00:00:57.390> hold

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
to this some guys some people will hold

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.040 
to this some guys some people will hold
it<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> first<00:00:59.309> two<00:00:59.670> fingers

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
it right up with the first two fingers

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.209 
it right up with the first two fingers
some<00:01:01.050> people<00:01:01.289> hold<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> back<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> second

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
some people hold it back on the second

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.410 
some people hold it back on the second
finger<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:02.609> becoming<00:01:02.879> more<00:01:03.000> popular

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
finger that's becoming more popular

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.670 
finger that's becoming more popular
these<00:01:03.539> days

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
these days

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
these days
either<00:01:05.280> way<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.240> rest<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> fingers

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
either way the rest of the fingers

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.469 
either way the rest of the fingers
should<00:01:07.080> wrap<00:01:07.290> around<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> drumstick<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
should wrap around the drumstick so that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.940 
should wrap around the drumstick so that
each<00:01:10.380> crease<00:01:11.630> falls<00:01:12.630> around<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.560> stick<00:01:13.740> here

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
each crease falls around the stick here

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.870 
each crease falls around the stick here
so<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.549> effectively<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.700> most

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
so you effectively get this the most

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.920 
so you effectively get this the most
important<00:01:18.270> thing<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> sense<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
important thing is to get a sense of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.840 
important thing is to get a sense of
rebound<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> stick<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
rebound from the stick so one of the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.100 
rebound from the stick so one of the
most<00:01:20.970> important<00:01:21.270> things<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.600> work<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
most important things you can work on is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.929 
most important things you can work on is
actually<00:01:22.590> what's<00:01:23.009> known<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> full<00:01:23.640> stroke

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
actually what's known as a full stroke

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060 
actually what's known as a full stroke
or<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> free<00:01:24.479> stroke<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.650> hold<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> stick

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
or a free stroke where we hold the stick

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
or a free stroke where we hold the stick
lightly<00:01:26.810> maintaining<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> bit<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> openness

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
lightly maintaining a bit of openness

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.340 
lightly maintaining a bit of openness
here<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.860> don't<00:01:28.920> want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> clamp<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:33.350> I'd

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here you don't want to clamp down I'd

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
here you don't want to clamp down I'd
let<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> stick<00:01:34.860> come<00:01:35.220> back<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.640> let<00:01:36.000> nature

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
let the stick come back up let nature

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.399 
let the stick come back up let nature
take<00:01:36.750> its<00:01:37.020> course<00:01:41.960> obviously<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.229> two

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
take its course obviously we have two

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.630 
take its course obviously we have two
hands<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.979> want<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> actually<00:01:44.250> spend<00:01:44.579> some

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
hands so you want to actually spend some

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.920 
hands so you want to actually spend some
time<00:01:44.850> working<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> other<00:01:45.479> hand<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.780> well

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
time working on the other hand as well

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.670 
time working on the other hand as well
same<00:01:46.320> principle<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.750> tend<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> hold<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.200> with

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
same principle I tend to hold it with

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.260 
same principle I tend to hold it with
the<00:01:49.829> first<00:01:50.070> three<00:01:50.399> fingers<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the first three fingers so it's kind of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.350 
the first three fingers so it's kind of
balanced<00:01:51.720> slightly<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.829> second<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.360> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
balanced slightly on the second one and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.140 
balanced slightly on the second one and
again<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.990> fingers<00:01:55.290> wrap<00:01:55.439> around<00:01:55.740> left<00:01:56.009> hand

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.910 

that's<00:02:02.150> your<00:02:02.300> fulcrum<00:02:02.660> point<00:02:02.960> there<00:02:03.800> are<00:02:03.830> a

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
that's your fulcrum point there are a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.230 
that's your fulcrum point there are a
few<00:02:04.010> different<00:02:04.310> types<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.700> strokes<00:02:04.910> we<00:02:05.090> can

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
few different types of strokes we can

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.320 
few different types of strokes we can
use<00:02:05.450> one<00:02:06.170> would<00:02:06.290> be<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.500> full<00:02:06.830> stroke<00:02:07.330> there's

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
use one would be the full stroke there's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.230 
use one would be the full stroke there's
also<00:02:08.450> something<00:02:08.720> called<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.960> down<00:02:09.200> stroke

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
also something called the down stroke

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.400 
also something called the down stroke
where<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:11.330> actually<00:02:11.450> start<00:02:11.990> from<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> high

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
where we actually start from a high

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.520 
where we actually start from a high
position<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.340> let<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.880> stick<00:02:14.170> hit<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> drum

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
position and let the stick hit the drum

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.500 
position and let the stick hit the drum
and<00:02:16.330> don't<00:02:17.330> let<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.630> rebound<00:02:19.360> we're<00:02:20.360> only

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
and don't let it rebound we're only

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.200 
and don't let it rebound we're only
there<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> come<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:20.990> maybe<00:02:21.260> about<00:02:21.500> an<00:02:21.650> inch<00:02:22.210> so

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
there to come up maybe about an inch so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.030 
there to come up maybe about an inch so
we've<00:02:23.300> got<00:02:23.420> your<00:02:23.510> free<00:02:23.720> stroke<00:02:23.990> or<00:02:24.530> your<00:02:24.710> full

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
we've got your free stroke or your full

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.140 
we've got your free stroke or your full
stroke<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.450> then<00:02:26.570> your<00:02:26.750> down<00:02:26.960> stroke<00:02:28.030> now<00:02:29.030> if

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
stroke and then your down stroke now if

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.580 
stroke and then your down stroke now if
you<00:02:29.270> play<00:02:29.420> these<00:02:29.630> in<00:02:29.750> succession<00:02:30.170> you'll<00:02:30.440> get

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
you play these in succession you'll get

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.000 
you play these in succession you'll get
two<00:02:30.800> different<00:02:30.950> volumes<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.710> tap

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
two different volumes this is a tap

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.800 
two different volumes this is a tap
stroke<00:02:37.370> where<00:02:37.880> we're<00:02:38.030> starting<00:02:38.240> from<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.570> low

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
stroke where we're starting from a low

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.000 
stroke where we're starting from a low
height<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:41.290> bringing<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.380> back<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.830> same

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
height and bringing it back to the same

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.130 
height and bringing it back to the same
height<00:02:43.190> again<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:47.390> here<00:02:47.630> we<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.960> three

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
height again so here we have the three

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.570 
height again so here we have the three
different<00:02:48.170> strokes<00:02:48.590> again<00:02:48.740> we<00:02:49.070> have<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.400> full

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
different strokes again we have the full

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.720 
different strokes again we have the full
stroke<00:02:49.840> or<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.020> down<00:02:51.200> stroke<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:52.520> we<00:02:52.610> have<00:02:52.700> a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
stroke or the down stroke and we have a

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.880 
stroke or the down stroke and we have a
tap<00:02:52.940> stroke<00:02:53.240> which<00:02:54.080> leaves<00:02:54.320> us<00:02:54.440> with<00:02:54.590> one<00:02:54.740> more

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
tap stroke which leaves us with one more

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.160 
tap stroke which leaves us with one more
which<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.160> an<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.370> stroke<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.930> we're<00:02:57.050> starting

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
which is an up stroke so we're starting

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.870 
which is an up stroke so we're starting
at<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.470> low<00:02:57.620> height<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.400> bringing<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.700> stick

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
at a low height and bringing the stick

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:10.720 
at a low height and bringing the stick
back<00:02:59.000> up<00:03:08.709> by<00:03:09.709> doing<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.070> we<00:03:10.220> achieved<00:03:10.520> three

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
back up by doing this we achieved three

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.180 
back up by doing this we achieved three
different<00:03:11.120> dynamic<00:03:12.020> levels<00:03:12.320> by<00:03:12.770> dynamic

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
different dynamic levels by dynamic

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.250 
different dynamic levels by dynamic
levels<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.459> mean<00:03:13.489> different<00:03:13.880> volumes<00:03:14.300> right<00:03:14.930> so

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
levels I mean different volumes right so

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:29.020 
levels I mean different volumes right so
here<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:16.190> have<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:27.430> now<00:03:28.430> there<00:03:28.610> are<00:03:28.790> other

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
here we have this now there are other

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.460 
here we have this now there are other
approaches<00:03:29.630> don't<00:03:29.780> let<00:03:29.959> anybody<00:03:30.170> tell<00:03:30.410> you

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
approaches don't let anybody tell you

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.960 
approaches don't let anybody tell you
there's<00:03:30.680> only<00:03:30.739> one<00:03:31.040> way<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.250> do<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.670> this<00:03:31.850> is

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
there's only one way to do it this is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.220 
there's only one way to do it this is
just<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.180> way<00:03:32.270> that<00:03:32.420> works<00:03:32.570> for<00:03:32.660> me<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:32.930> it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
just a way that works for me and it's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.620 
just a way that works for me and it's
kind<00:03:33.320> of<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.530> hybrid<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:34.130> different<00:03:34.880> techniques

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
kind of a hybrid of different techniques

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.160 
kind of a hybrid of different techniques
that<00:03:35.660> we've<00:03:35.840> learned<00:03:35.870> over<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.320> years<00:03:36.350> how

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
that we've learned over the years how

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.690 
that we've learned over the years how
would<00:03:39.170> we<00:03:39.380> put<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.680> into<00:03:39.860> concepts<00:03:40.370> with

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
would we put that into concepts with

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.759 
would we put that into concepts with
actually<00:03:41.180> playing<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> drum<00:03:41.780> kit<00:03:42.019> well<00:03:42.590> if<00:03:42.680> I

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
actually playing the drum kit well if I

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.509 
actually playing the drum kit well if I
were<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.950> play<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.100> beat<00:03:43.370> without<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.570> hi-hat

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
were to play a beat without the hi-hat

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.590 
were to play a beat without the hi-hat
for<00:03:46.519> me<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.640> lot<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.000> time<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.209> would<00:03:47.450> use

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
for me a lot of the time I would use

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:57.780 
for me a lot of the time I would use
full<00:03:47.900> strokes<00:03:48.170> on<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.410> hi-hat

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.980 

the<00:03:58.790> most<00:03:58.970> important<00:03:59.510> thing<00:03:59.630> is<00:03:59.720> that<00:03:59.840> we<00:03:59.900> have

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
the most important thing is that we have

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.450 
the most important thing is that we have
a<00:04:00.020> free<00:04:00.320> range<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.740> motion<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.280> you

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
a free range of motion and that you

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.190 
a free range of motion and that you
remain<00:04:01.730> relaxed<00:04:02.240> by<00:04:02.390> squeezing<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.930> stick

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
remain relaxed by squeezing the stick

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.470 
remain relaxed by squeezing the stick
too<00:04:03.350> tight<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.890> you'll<00:04:04.610> see<00:04:04.790> sometimes<00:04:05.210> your

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
too tight and you'll see sometimes your

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.240 
too tight and you'll see sometimes your
hand<00:04:05.720> will<00:04:05.870> clamp<00:04:06.140> up<00:04:06.320> here<00:04:06.620> you're<00:04:07.160> actually

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
hand will clamp up here you're actually

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.400 
hand will clamp up here you're actually
getting<00:04:07.580> really<00:04:07.820> really<00:04:08.210> tense<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
getting really really tense and the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.140 
getting really really tense and the
stick<00:04:09.620> won't<00:04:09.860> actually<00:04:10.100> move<00:04:10.520> freely<00:04:10.820> if<00:04:11.060> you

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
stick won't actually move freely if you

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.850 
stick won't actually move freely if you
do<00:04:11.300> that<00:04:11.480> which<00:04:12.080> makes<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.410> harder<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.650> play

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
do that which makes it harder to play

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.840 
do that which makes it harder to play
faster<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:13.760> quieter<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.489> again<00:04:16.489> what<00:04:16.730> we

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
faster and quieter so again what we

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.680 
faster and quieter so again what we
talked<00:04:17.030> about<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.300> how<00:04:17.330> to<00:04:17.420> hold<00:04:17.600> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
talked about is how to hold the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.570 
talked about is how to hold the
drumstick

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
drumstick

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.800
