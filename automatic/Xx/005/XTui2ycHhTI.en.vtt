00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.139
 They dream of reaching the gold 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.379
 Peruvian women's soccer team 

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:12.530
 sub-20 in a locked match won 2 to 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.749
 1 to its like of Dominican Republic and 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.300
 so he achieves his first three points in the 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:19.850
 contest with goals from cindy novoa and 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.170
 Liliana Neira defeated the team 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.170
 Caribbean at the start of the tournament 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.480
 Bolivarian both consider that it is a 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.090
 advantage to have the location but 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.220
 they hope to be finer in the definition 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.220
 we dominate I think the first time 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.690
 if in any case always the nerves 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.070
 of the first match of the first championship 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.230
 especially for some girls that is the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.940
 first selection so 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.590
 after the first one I think we gave ourselves 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.180
 the tranquility and we could touch a little 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.040
 best 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 the touch of the ball became more complicated 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.570
 taking into account the air the wind is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.230
 difficult in Lima for example we do not have 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.900
 so much heat the wind too but they are 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.540
 things that we already have to start and 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.220
 we have to start with them but everything 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.020
 good good you feel feels 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.829
 satisfactory that the team 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.439
 with a good fans be there 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:20.049
 supporting us that is the but not playing with 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.990
 the 12th out there is an extra incentive in 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.759
 his field I think that if I think that 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.439
 If I see my team happy that the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.750
 people are here cheering you 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.590
 now the weather out there in this first 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.259
 match 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.179
 it reduced performance a little to me 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.729
 the wind bothers more than the heat is the 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.679
 wind that loses control of the ball is 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.079
 you go the shots go long in the 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.490
 another time you fall short but it's 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.039
 the wind is not the heat for me 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.799
 while in the duel between Bolivian and 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.289
 Ecuadorian altiplano summers of 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.349
 to three after winning with a goal by Laura 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.090
 gomez for the minimum difference equator 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.470
 play much more were already a little more 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.079
 rested and is going to play a lot 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.670
 better I'm sure we're going to have 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.200
 best offer in terms of attack and that 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.740
 is what interests me because today I do not 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.050
 it works a lot however this one 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.420
 it is expected that after the first 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.420
 debut of several girls who do it for 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.820
 first time then it costs but I know 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.910
 we have this and we hope and continue 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.130
 going well and the goal and you dreamed of this 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.180
 debut debuted winning and scoring is 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.690
 my granddaughter 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.570
 in 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.020
 Canada is a dream of everything not for that 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.810
 we come here 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.370
 and I said well I'm going to do it if god 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.390
 he wants to let me go and make a goal and 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.390
 thanks to him I made a goal
