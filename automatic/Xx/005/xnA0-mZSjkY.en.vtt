00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.820
 machine intel lumix 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 one of the most interesting machines for 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 biscuit production 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.930
 over its creation worked more 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.610
 dozens of designers to translate 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.470
 design ideas into reality 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.430
 it took a year of experimentation and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.720
 test machine makers are sure that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.699
 on innovative ideas 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.320
 intel and mix has surpassed not only everything 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.940
 popular types of molding machines 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.650
 cookies but also the expectation of the creators themselves 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.049
 even when designing a predecessor 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.239
 intel and mix of a well-known automaton 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.549
 intel and drop thought 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.299
 set aside two doughs simultaneously 

00:00:53.549 --> 00:01:00.059
 different colors in general, the operation of the machine 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.070
 can be described as follows in 2 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.070
 bunker refuel two types of dough 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.750
 different colors immediately notice instead 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 one of the types of dough for molding 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.900
 some products can use term and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.570
 stable filling under pressure two 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.820
 kind of dough are pressed into the head and 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.390
 individual channels gets into the nozzle or 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.850
 plates for string and trimming further 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.730
 the fate of the test is determined by technology and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.310
 molding method during molding 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.110
 multicolored clipping string method 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.770
 the workpiece is cut by the string and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.659
 Throws off on a sheet or under much 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.149
 more interesting is the issue with jigging 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.950
 a cylinder of two kinds of dough can just 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.979
 set aside on the surface of the sheet or 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.259
 code when using swivel 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.250
 mechanism workpiece twists 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.829
 forming a new product shape besides 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.229
 now weave you can move the table on 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.920
 which is jigging getting 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.310
 in this way 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.020
 product oblong at the moment 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.270
 jigging table can be lowered on 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.929
 arbitrary height adjusting so 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.789
 way height of the product of interest 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.010
 opportunities open up when you change 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.519
 the ratio of time and speed jigging 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.799
 one kind of dough relative to another 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.920
 so one kind of dough can be hidden inside 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.610
 another and you can deposit a product that 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.390
 consists of layers of different colors 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.799
 the possibilities for fantasy are endless 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.319
 the machine is controlled from the color touch 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.209
 screen display computer control 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.480
 made in the best traditions 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.150
 Physics equipment companies are understandable 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.400
 icons and convenient logical transitions with 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.790
 screen screen make the operator work 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.269
 easy and pleasant as in previous 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.489
 models 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.849
 all events are recorded in a log and 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.579
 available to the operator at any time like and 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.630
 in the latest models of intel and drop 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.359
 design machine intel mix 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.989
 provides for sheet feeding and receiving 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.400
 from molded products on both sides 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.620
 so if the machine works alone 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.269
 operator he can submit a sheet and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.260
 get ready-made semi-finished products with 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:14.349
 computer panel side if 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.269
 jigging speed is high or for example when 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.730
 jet cutting method 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.380
 the operator can submit a sheet from the front 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.480
 parties and assistant 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.870
 take a sheet with molded products 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.639
 on the other, there is also an option 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.950
 emergency shutdown machine when 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.540
 triggered sensors for example 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.290
 hitting foreign objects in 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.310
 working area according to the creators 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.829
 automat 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
 another important feature is 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.599
 possibility of single-color jigging 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.750
 from one bunker ie more 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.190
 simplified use of machines 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.739
 so the owner 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.690
 intel and mix gets machine two in 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.000
 one 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.320
 new car in addition to novelty completely 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.440
 preserves all functions and capabilities 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.280
 its predecessor machine intel a 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.070
 drop of the mad intel mix 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.470
 made in the new style of the designer 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.090
 significantly reduced the weight of the machine due to 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.989
 use of new ultralight 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.780
 materials and assemblies lifting mechanism 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.919
 became removed from under the table and moved to 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.560
 side housing like all equipment 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.220
 of the company the automatic machine is completed 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.850
 power unit a b b germanium drives 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.449
 moto vario italy electronics company 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.790
 omron 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.040
 japan 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.320
 I would like to note the most important thing with 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.370
 our point of view of the dignity of the machine 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.970
 intel remix 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.800
 according to market experts on 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.780
 the moment of the creation of the first automaton 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.340
 and he was first presented at the exhibition 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.740
 February 2002 for beauty and 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.140
 product originality products 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.320
 manufactured on the intel machine and mix 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.750
 does not have and will not have competition on 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.750
 the length of the next two or three meters
