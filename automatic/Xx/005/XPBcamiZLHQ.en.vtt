00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.049 

and<00:00:58.350> now<00:00:58.469> I'll<00:00:58.620> marinate<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.280> apply<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and now I'll marinate this apply the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
and now I'll marinate this apply the
marination<00:01:00.539> properly<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:05.070> reason<00:01:05.430> behind

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
marination properly the reason behind

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.850 
marination properly the reason behind
pricking<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> chicken<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pricking the chicken is so that the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.430 
pricking the chicken is so that the
marination<00:01:08.280> seeps<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.509> chicken<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
marination seeps into the chicken and

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.950 
marination seeps into the chicken and
you<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> bland<00:01:11.430> taste<00:01:11.759> inside<00:01:12.360> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
you don't get that bland taste inside so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
you don't get that bland taste inside so
that's<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.380> reason<00:01:13.649> I<00:01:13.830> had<00:01:14.399> done<00:01:14.610> deep

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that's the reason I had done deep

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.999 
that's the reason I had done deep
insertions<00:01:15.509> now<00:01:16.080> apply<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.530> marination

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
insertions now apply the marination

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
insertions now apply the marination
properly<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> let<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.390> marinate<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.080> ten

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
properly and let this marinate for ten

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.210 
properly and let this marinate for ten
to<00:01:19.380> fifteen<00:01:19.500> minutes

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to fifteen minutes

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.870 
to fifteen minutes
