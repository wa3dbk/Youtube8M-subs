00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
circles out of your mesh so to do this I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.440 
circles out of your mesh so to do this I
double<00:01:07.140> my<00:01:07.260> fabric<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> fold<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.270> into

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
double my fabric and then I fold it into

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.010 
double my fabric and then I fold it into
thirds<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.740> six<00:01:11.250> squares<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:15.020> from

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
thirds so I can get six squares and from

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.960 
thirds so I can get six squares and from
those<00:01:16.200> six<00:01:16.470> squares<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.520> trace<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
those six squares I'm going to trace a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.070 
those six squares I'm going to trace a
four<00:01:18.540> inch<00:01:18.840> circle<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.509> I'll<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.720> cut<00:01:21.930> those

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
four inch circle and I'll just cut those

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170 
four inch circle and I'll just cut those
out<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.070> pin<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> together<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> doesn't

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
out so I pin it together so it doesn't

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.120 
out so I pin it together so it doesn't
move<00:01:24.240> around<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:25.110> full<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> ribbon<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
move around this full of ribbon is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.649 
move around this full of ribbon is
exactly<00:01:26.700> four<00:01:27.000> inches<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.299> it'll<00:01:27.630> work

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
exactly four inches so it'll work

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
exactly four inches so it'll work
perfect<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:29.100> trace<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.460> circle<00:01:29.880> directly

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
perfect just trace the circle directly

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030 
perfect just trace the circle directly
onto<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.930> fabric<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.530> we're<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
onto the fabric and we're going to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
onto the fabric and we're going to
pretend<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.700> used<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.360> pretty<00:01:33.750> buy

once<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.480> it<00:01:38.630> traced<00:01:38.870> on<00:01:39.080> pin<00:01:39.470> it

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
once you have it traced on pin it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.730 
once you have it traced on pin it
together<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.070> doesn't<00:01:40.310> move<00:01:40.370> around<00:01:40.670> and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
together so it doesn't move around and

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.100 
together so it doesn't move around and
cut<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.890> out<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.730> have<00:01:43.880> your<00:01:44.180> six<00:01:44.540> circles

cut it out so you have your six circles

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.340 
cut it out so you have your six circles
and<00:01:45.940> don't<00:01:46.940> worry<00:01:47.120> about<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.540> ugly<00:01:47.810> pen<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.200> it

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
and don't worry about the ugly pen on it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.390 
and don't worry about the ugly pen on it
we'll<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:48.770> sewing<00:01:49.010> over<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.490> part<00:01:51.220> now<00:01:52.220> we're

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
we'll be sewing over that part now we're

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.640 
we'll be sewing over that part now we're
going<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.790> fold<00:01:53.120> our<00:01:53.420> circles<00:01:53.840> into<00:01:54.080> triangles

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
going to fold our circles into triangles

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.050 
going to fold our circles into triangles
so<00:01:54.800> you<00:01:54.860> can<00:01:55.070> see<00:01:55.220> I've<00:01:55.310> got<00:01:55.460> little<00:01:55.670> spark

sparkly and this is actually a button

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.150 
sparkly and this is actually a button
that<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.930> thought<00:03:47.200> was<00:03:47.350> really<00:03:47.530> pretty<00:03:47.890> it's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
that I thought was really pretty it's

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.070 
that I thought was really pretty it's
just<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.580> sparkly<00:03:49.180> great<00:03:49.420> button<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.990> I

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
just a sparkly great button and I

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.710 
just a sparkly great button and I
decided<00:03:50.440> this<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:50.890> one<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.040> wanted<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.520> use

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
decided this is the one I wanted to use

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.790 
decided this is the one I wanted to use
so<00:03:52.720> I'm<00:03:52.840> going<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.080> take<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> little<00:03:53.500> bit<00:03:53.680> of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
so I'm going to take a little bit of

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.620 
so I'm going to take a little bit of
glue<00:03:54.010> put<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.310> right<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.060> center<00:03:55.330> of<00:03:55.360> the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
where any of the marker would be and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.030
