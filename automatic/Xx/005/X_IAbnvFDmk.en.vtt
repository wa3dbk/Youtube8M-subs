00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
holding up the rubber bands on there

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.140 
holding up the rubber bands on there
just<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> keep<00:01:06.450> pressure<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.860> chip<00:01:08.159> well

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
just to keep pressure on the chip well

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.219 
just to keep pressure on the chip well
the<00:01:10.130> paste<00:01:11.130> dries<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.780> tapes<00:01:12.990> here

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229

up for you guys and not have to worry
about<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> chip<00:01:18.299> moving<00:01:18.600> around<00:01:19.820> while<00:01:20.820> I'm

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
about the chip moving around while I'm

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.499 
about the chip moving around while I'm
moving<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.420> around<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.000> let's<00:01:24.270> just

long and hopefully this is gonna give me
the<00:01:43.380> desired<00:01:43.860> effect<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.640> I'm<00:01:44.759> looking<00:01:44.790> for

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
the desired effect that I'm looking for

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.830 
the desired effect that I'm looking for
now<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.060> did<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.689> some<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.380> chips<00:01:50.840> laying

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
now I did have some other chips laying

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.719 
now I did have some other chips laying
around<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.619> 10<00:01:52.860> watt<00:01:53.100> guys<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
around these are little 10 watt guys and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.569 
around these are little 10 watt guys and
I<00:01:54.210> had<00:01:54.360> these<00:01:54.540> where<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> lot<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
I had these where there is a lot of

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.399 
I had these where there is a lot of
bubbling<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.790> stuff<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.259> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
bubbling and stuff going on but as you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.620 
bubbling and stuff going on but as you
can<00:01:58.530> see<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:01.350> chips<00:02:01.619> got<00:02:01.770> real<00:02:01.950> corroded<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
can see the chips got real corroded the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.910 
can see the chips got real corroded the
front<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.020> them<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.320> all<00:02:04.920> damaged<00:02:06.829> believe<00:02:07.829> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
front of them is all damaged believe it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.660 
front of them is all damaged believe it
or<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.099> these<00:02:08.940> still<00:02:09.239> work<00:02:12.980> they<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.040> kick<00:02:14.489> off

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
or not these still work they do kick off

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.320 
or not these still work they do kick off

that<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.140> wasn't<00:03:43.409> kind<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.860> expecting<00:03:45.830> this

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
that I wasn't kind of expecting this

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.820 
that I wasn't kind of expecting this
whole<00:03:47.069> setup<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:48.720> done<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.230> multi<00:03:49.590> chip

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.660 
fashion yes I know it looks pretty crude
but<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:55.650> does<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.159> job

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.110 

most<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.909> stuff<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.239> here<00:04:01.329> looks<00:04:01.569> pretty<00:04:01.629> happy

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120

aside from the bird nest right there
which<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.849> think<00:04:07.209> still<00:04:07.450> kind<00:04:07.689> of<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:07.959> shock<00:04:07.989> and

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
which I think still kind of in shock and

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.330 
which I think still kind of in shock and
he's<00:04:11.049> been<00:04:11.260> picking<00:04:11.499> at<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.769> so<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.069> might<00:04:12.310> have

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
he's been picking at it so I might have

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.770 
he's been picking at it so I might have
to<00:04:12.519> get<00:04:12.609> rid<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.790> him<00:04:14.790> but<00:04:15.790> we'll<00:04:16.630> give<00:04:16.750> that

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
to get rid of him but we'll give that

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.270 
to get rid of him but we'll give that
chip<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.229> little<00:04:17.259> more<00:04:17.560> time<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.859> dry<00:04:17.979> over

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
chip a little more time to dry over

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.620 
chip a little more time to dry over
there<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.609> then<00:04:18.699> we'll<00:04:18.820> toss<00:04:19.060> over<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.479> few

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
there and then we'll toss over the few

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
that's how powerful the LED is I let

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.330 
that's how powerful the LED is I let
this<00:05:09.250> run<00:05:09.580> for<00:05:09.610> maybe<00:05:11.190> all<00:05:12.190> good<00:05:12.520> hour<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:14.340> as

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
this run for maybe all good hour and as

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.649 
this run for maybe all good hour and as
you<00:05:15.490> can<00:05:15.550> see<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.699> can<00:05:15.940> still<00:05:16.150> hold<00:05:16.270> my<00:05:16.389> hand

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.770 
you can see I can still hold my hand
right<00:05:16.870> on<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.639> days<00:05:18.639> over<00:05:18.789> driven<00:05:19.300> just<00:05:19.630> a

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
right on it days over driven just a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.129 
right on it days over driven just a
little<00:05:20.080> bit<00:05:20.320> not<00:05:21.099> a<00:05:21.130> whole<00:05:21.430> lot<00:05:21.729> I'm<00:05:22.690> not<00:05:22.960> too

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
little bit not a whole lot I'm not too

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.420 
little bit not a whole lot I'm not too
concerned<00:05:23.320> about<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:23.889> because<00:05:24.130> like<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.370> said

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
concerned about it because like I said

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.010 
concerned about it because like I said
the<00:05:24.699> cost<00:05:24.880> of<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.150> chip<00:05:25.389> I'm<00:05:25.570> just<00:05:25.780> kind<00:05:25.960> of

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
the cost of the chip I'm just kind of

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.740 
the cost of the chip I'm just kind of
curious<00:05:26.199> to<00:05:26.470> see<00:05:26.500> where<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:26.860> goes

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.170 

so<00:05:30.380> we<00:05:30.920> got<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.160> little<00:05:31.340> quarterly<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:31.970> growth

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
so we got a little quarterly and growth

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.460 
so we got a little quarterly and growth
down<00:05:32.420> here<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.220> some<00:05:34.220> little<00:05:34.370> Tufts<00:05:34.700> of<00:05:35.320> Cato

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
down here and some little Tufts of Cato

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.130 
down here and some little Tufts of Cato
and<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.070> main<00:05:37.250> ball<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:38.450> we'll<00:05:38.810> give<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.020> a

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
and the main ball so we'll give it a

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.840 
and the main ball so we'll give it a
couple<00:05:39.320> weeks<00:05:39.590> I'll<00:05:39.770> kind<00:05:40.010> of<00:05:40.070> see<00:05:40.220> how<00:05:40.370> this

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
couple weeks I'll kind of see how this

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.530 
couple weeks I'll kind of see how this
progresses<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.780> where<00:05:42.410> it<00:05:42.500> ends<00:05:42.740> up<00:05:42.830> at<00:05:43.540> also

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
progresses and where it ends up at also

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.000 
progresses and where it ends up at also
I<00:05:44.570> noticed<00:05:44.930> two<00:05:45.050> of<00:05:45.140> my<00:05:45.260> video<00:05:45.500> before<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:45.860> was

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
I noticed two of my video before I was

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.170 
I noticed two of my video before I was
watching<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:47.180> tank<00:05:47.480> really<00:05:47.960> isn't<00:05:48.760> that<00:05:49.760> blue

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
watching the tank really isn't that blue

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.270 
watching the tank really isn't that blue
I<00:05:50.510> don't<00:05:51.350> know<00:05:51.740> why<00:05:51.950> it<00:05:52.010> shows<00:05:52.400> up<00:05:52.640> that<00:05:52.790> blue

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
I don't know why it shows up that blue

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.440 
I don't know why it shows up that blue
might<00:05:55.280> have<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.730> play<00:05:55.850> with<00:05:56.090> some<00:05:56.270> of<00:05:56.390> the

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
might have to play with some of the

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.830 
might have to play with some of the
camera<00:05:56.840> settings<00:05:58.090> but<00:05:59.090> that's<00:05:59.540> a<00:05:59.660> different

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
camera settings but that's a different

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.600 
camera settings but that's a different
video<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:01.030> there<00:06:02.030> it<00:06:02.210> is<00:06:02.330> folks
