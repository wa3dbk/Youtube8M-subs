00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.630 

and<00:03:44.200> when<00:03:45.159> all<00:03:45.849> together<00:03:46.239> with<00:03:47.200> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and when all together with the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:04:10.410 
and when all together with the
first/last<00:04:08.670> then<00:04:09.670> you're<00:04:09.879> going<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.180> repeat

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
first/last then you're going to repeat

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.800 
first/last then you're going to repeat
that<00:04:10.629> twice<00:04:11.760> in<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:13.000> verse<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:16.269> intro<00:04:16.690> is

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
that twice in the verse the intro is

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:27.080 
that twice in the verse the intro is
just<00:04:17.169> this<00:04:23.460> without<00:04:24.460> anything<00:04:25.090> special<00:04:25.750> so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
just this without anything special so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.860 
just this without anything special so
that's<00:04:28.090> an<00:04:28.389> intro<00:04:29.010> then<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.460> are<00:04:30.699> coming<00:04:31.090> to<00:04:31.360> a

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
that's an intro then you are coming to a

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:46.249 
that's an intro then you are coming to a
little<00:04:32.970> over<00:04:33.970> thing<00:04:35.669> that<00:04:36.669> sounds<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.150> this

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.909 

and<00:04:47.370> that's<00:04:48.370> actually<00:04:49.240> pretty<00:04:49.780> simple<00:04:49.990> it's

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
and that's actually pretty simple it's

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:58.710 
and that's actually pretty simple it's
just<00:04:51.039> a<00:04:51.400> B<00:04:51.940> D<00:04:52.630> F<00:04:53.020> sharp<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.840> play<00:04:56.199> that<00:04:57.720> then

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
just a B D F sharp so you play that then

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:13.560 
just a B D F sharp so you play that then
only<00:04:58.870> B<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:01.060> then<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:05.650> it's<00:05:12.240> when<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.330> play

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
only B and then so it's when you play

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:25.350 
only B and then so it's when you play
this<00:05:14.080> one<00:05:14.320> twice<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.789> this<00:05:16.000> one<00:05:16.949> G<00:05:17.949> B<00:05:18.729> D<00:05:24.360> once

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
this one twice and this one G B D once

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:39.250 
this one twice and this one G B D once
and<00:05:25.919> a<00:05:26.919> coke

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.470 

and<00:05:40.260> you<00:05:40.440> play<00:05:40.620> that<00:05:40.830> twice<00:05:41.040> you<00:05:41.400> can<00:05:41.970> add<00:05:42.270> the

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
and you play that twice you can add the

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:53.370 
and you play that twice you can add the
bass<00:05:43.350> with

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:13.740 

so<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.220> sound<00:05:54.460> like<00:05:54.610> this<00:06:10.530> so<00:06:11.530> that's<00:06:12.130> a<00:06:12.750> main

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
so it sound like this so that's a main

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.100 
so it sound like this so that's a main
rip<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.320> then<00:06:14.560> you<00:06:14.710> are<00:06:14.800> going<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.280> the<00:06:16.110> second

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
rip and then you are going to the second

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.370 
rip and then you are going to the second
verse<00:06:17.320> which<00:06:18.010> is<00:06:18.340> the<00:06:18.790> same<00:06:19.030> you<00:06:19.690> play<00:06:19.960> the

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
verse which is the same you play the

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:28.190 
verse which is the same you play the
bass<00:06:20.950> here<00:06:22.080> this<00:06:23.080> and<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:26.620> so<00:06:26.860> on<00:06:26.890> four<00:06:27.430> times

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
bass here this and and so on four times

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.260 
bass here this and and so on four times
and<00:06:29.200> if<00:06:29.680> you<00:06:29.860> want<00:06:30.070> to<00:06:30.190> sing<00:06:30.610> along<00:06:30.730> with<00:06:30.910> the
