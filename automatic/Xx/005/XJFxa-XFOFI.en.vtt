00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.830
 today we are going to prepare an Iberian loin 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:09.220
 filling of loin and cheese for this we go 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.100
 to need a piece of Iberian loin of 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.620
 pig a package name 12 of the house 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.759
 to joselito a package of bacon slices 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.529
 46 slices of cheese and use cheese 7 2 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.570
 onions 4 cloves of garlic a stream of 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.669
 fine wine I used the stew a squirt 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.480
 of extra virgin olive oil salt and 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.400
 ground pepper 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.520
 The first thing we are going to do is take it 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.030
 the tenderloin all the excess fat that 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.739
 have if you do not know how to open the spine 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.190
 I told your butcher with what he will know 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.020
 if you do not do it without problems if not then 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.510
 is in the way of opening it is given a 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.360
 cut first 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.940
 a think without reaching the end 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.710
 and then it is turned over and given 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 another cut to the other side and so on 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 it's open to us like it's a book 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.530
 once we have it open we are going 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.390
 to give a series of cuts so that the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 meat in the thickest part 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.790
 you can cook well and do not miss 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.790
 raw 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.660
 with the spine open what we are going to do 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.510
 is to fill in, we're going to put slices of 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.510
 tenderloin and let's cover it all 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.360
 on the spine we will place the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.360
 slices of cheese 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.380
 Do not cover the whole loin always leaves 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.180
 a part without uncovered because to the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.550
 today's time making the roll the stuffing 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.290
 is extending so that we are not 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.290
 leave the filling 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.290
 once we have the cheese put 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.710
 we make the roll 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.830
 we are pressing so that the roll is 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.640
 very compact and we try that the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.520
 filling is always inside 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.190
 let's put the slices of bacon 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.340
 on the table to place the roll 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.540
 on top of the bacon we assemble a slice 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.540
 little on top of each other 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.400
 we put the loin our loin roll 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.159
 and cover with the slices of bacon the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.930
 bacon is going to stick to the meat 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.230
 without any problem 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.939
 and if in the bacon fight does not cover 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.269
 completely the back as it happened to me 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.340
 to me then we take other slices and the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.469
 we put upside down for the second up 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.959
 down so that that loin is left 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.230
 totally covered by the bacon and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.730
 we have a rich layer of 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.730
 toasted bacon 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.030
 once we have the loin already well 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.370
 covered a totally covered screw 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.660
 with the bacon slices with a string of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.360
 kitchen let's tighten it well so that 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.200
 do not miss the roll when the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.200
 topics go well 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.310
 kitchen rope we are going 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.630
 for all its circumference 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.310
 and we are tightening it well 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.310
 so they are deformed beings 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.630
 each one is in the roll as 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.490
 best they can be for a goodly or 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.680
 they taught me how to do it this way 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.050
 and the truth that I find very comfortable 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.050
 very easy and nothing complicated 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.110
 once we finish 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.470
 of tying we passed the rope just for 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.470
 below and that's how it does not escape us in 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.400
 you have to do it carefully so that the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.720
 King lift when we are not we 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.389
 move 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.609
 here we are not in a hurry 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.879
 and that's the live string we went through 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.509
 below and we finished tying the two 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:28.680
 tips good our baking tray 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:33.539
 we're going to cover it with the onion 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.539
 chopped with the whole garlic 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.969
 and in that bottom of onion and garlic we are going to 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.369
 place in our roll 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:45.339
 to the roll we are going to add a little 

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:49.719
 salt a little pepper a good spray 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:53.309
 of fine wine wine and a good spray of 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:53.309
 extra virgin olive oil 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.780
 we are also going to put a little bit of 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.050
 water as a half glass of water more or 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.050
 less 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.550
 and when these two aggregates is the 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.480
 we put in the oven what are we going to have 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.360
 over one 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.840
 one hour 45 minutes an hour or so 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.480
 at 175 degrees we are observing each 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.430
 oven I have already said that it is a world and 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.710
 we have to control that we are not 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.960
 do a lot of outside and we're going to 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.280
 to be raw inside after the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:40.310
 60 minutes 170 degrees is the result 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.740
 mine and let a little cool 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.960
 when the roll is a bit warm 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.770
 we take it to a plate and we leave it 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.480
 reserved and all that vegetable we're going to 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.790
 move to 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.980
 to the glass of the blender because from where 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.930
 let's take our our sauce for 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.150
 the meat 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.970
 carp very well the tray if we have to 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.389
 be a little water the chamo but 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.590
 all that in the sauce and we can not leave 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.590
 the flag 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.840
 once we have everything in the glass 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.310
 of the blender if we see that we are 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.470
 thick we add a little water 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.270
 I will open the water the tray well for 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.270
 to be able to keep scratching 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.290
 and there is firewood 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:45.540
 We beat the sauce well and that sauce 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.390
 let's reserve in a sauce boat so that 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.850
 each one is placed on his plate the 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.910
 sauce that you like 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:59.550
 we take the ropes off our roll 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.550
 and we are going to cut it in the lunch 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.900
 with a sharp knife that cut 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:12.340
 well let's take out our slices with 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.340
 care of very creamy cheese 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.290
 if we were told a little bit the roll what 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.290
 we close again and nothing happens 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:40.680
 and this is my roll stuffed tenderloin 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:43.610
 be rich with joselito loin and cheese 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.810
 that we can put that we like more 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.389
 our roll in our tray 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.030
 our sauces from a sauceboat and it's a 

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:53.340
 great and delicious meat dish that 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:56.550
 I advise you and I recommend that you 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:59.490
 do because it is very, very rich 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:03.860
 It can be taken both hot and in 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.860
 cold and it's a delicious bite
