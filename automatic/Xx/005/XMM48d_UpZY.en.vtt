nice<00:00:41.520> condition<00:00:42.500> obviously<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.559> can't

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
nice condition obviously I can't

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580 
nice condition obviously I can't
guarantee<00:00:43.890> 9.5<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.840> would<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
guarantee 9.5 but I think it would it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.389 
guarantee 9.5 but I think it would it
should<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:46.890> least<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.340> nine<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:50.250> was

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
should at least be at nine and it was

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.670 
should at least be at nine and it was
nice<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.940> Caro<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> black<00:00:52.289> jersey

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
nice on Caro and it's a black jersey

nice on Caro and it's a black jersey
which<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.430> sells<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.090> better<00:00:54.270> than

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
which I think sells a little better than

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.080 
which I think sells a little better than
the<00:00:54.600> white<00:00:54.780> version<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.730> right<00:00:56.730> now<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> have
