00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.279
 new video tutor my name is michael 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 o and today i want to show you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.179
 How to make such a bottle correctly 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.950
 photographed a bottle like that 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.609
 photographing is sometimes not 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.050
 very simple undertaking 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:24.830
 There are a few negative examples showing 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.830
 have a quick look 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.480
 so for example this one we see 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:42.260
 we have relatively diffuse reflection here 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.750
 down here is the soft one 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.650
 underground too much in the bottle and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:52.760
 you have the bottle so gray then 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:57.590
 we have here from the lightning or from the 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.379
 background a so-called game of 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.870
 light here on that he sides 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.030
 As a result, the contours are lost 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.850
 no clear contours available 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 This example has also been here 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.500
 even just a softbox changed and that 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.440
 only illuminate from one side 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.270
 This will make the other side something 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.900
 ride is a bit helpless in one 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.280
 black we have one 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.619
 unpleasant run away from the label 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.659
 I have the brand here and so on 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.580
 if taken from the bottles further 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.750
 Do not really care what's here 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.820
 still interesting in this bottle 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.770
 would have been to highlight this would be 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.230
 Here a cast lettering in the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 bottle was indeed missed the r2 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.030
 bad examples 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.689
 My result looks like we have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.369
 Here we see her a little closer 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.369
 ran sees with the 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.180
 we have clear contours around us 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.100
 Here are a few highlights you 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.350
 new level and marks that time so we 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.600
 have a decent neat 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.870
 contour 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:24.150
 Here are two highlights in the picture 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:28.810
 and we have clear here below 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.800
 Reflections and overall we have on 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.470
 the glass reflection the shape of the bottle 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.500
 just after build up here runs one 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.810
 Reflection down as well as this one 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.630
 Reflection close like here a reflection 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.510
 and we have here on the label 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.420
 also a reflection 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.470
 it helps everything around the picture that plastically 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.720
 more is here 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.800
 Label fully lit evenly 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.800
 not half lit half shadow 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 light 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.370
 and also where the bottle is light and 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.440
 Do not take pictures like this from above 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.480
 when I really form something pressed 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.709
 Here was a bit from the bottom 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.459
 photographed from this direction 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.739
 and thus looks a little bigger and 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.530
 the bottle still gives her shape 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.660
 with her the flame became so from 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.590
 photographed above and we have this here 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.799
 let problem 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.730
 the mold is pressed further 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:43.260
 we image on this then 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.620
 this limited edition we have a bright 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.299
 background which then runs out into the dark 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.799
 it helps again around the 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.890
 to draw attention to the product 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:04:00.379
 and not away from the product so everything 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.379
 goal practically on the product 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:11.410
 the construction looks like this 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.410
 we have a lightning here 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.680
 which ensures the illumination of the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:24.930
 labels and then we have two big ones 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:30.110
 studio places with 2 on box to the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.110
 the reflections create a different side 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:41.900
 these two levels sometimes fade out yes 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:44.540
 these two off switch ensure that 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.120
 no that does not overly light of 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.510
 the studio flash on the background 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:55.340
 falls and practically the limit 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:58.000
 nasty second we have in the background 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.510
 there is not quite yet to see one 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.870
 another flash of this flashes against the 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.780
 background and provides for these the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:13.910
 defined here for this illumination 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:16.780
 behind the bottle we would enter 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.950
 I feel a gray background here 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.670
 gray backgrounds have the 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.640
 property that they fall into the paint 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.920
 with the lightning now so I would 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:34.780
 now put a red foil on it 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:40.180
 the background is going well here 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:44.360
 so the camera had the settings 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.790
 of 160 still and a blind of 10 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.400
 everything was photographed with a canon 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:58.130
 5d market though with a 90 millimeter 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:06:01.380
 12.8 mm camera and lens 90 a 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.270
 portrait for a portrait lens 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.880
 and is not very good for 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.480
 such recordings are relative 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.120
 precise lens so there is actually 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.740
 Nothing more to say about this today 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.860
 Sweet composition you have to pay attention 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.260
 that you can not just large heat of 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.470
 the front just takes a picture of it 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.090
 do not hide the tag so to speak the 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.650
 but he should look for it 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.350
 pay attention that just the reflection on 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.050
 runs along and at the latest here 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:37.620
 again stops around here in this contour 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:40.830
 to form if there is this reflection 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.390
 would run out then we have there 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.050
 we have the problem that the contour 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:50.460
 It is simply eaten away by the lightning though 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:55.130
 Here we have a clean record like 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:59.370
 in various websites and catalogs 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.500
 it's true that's it 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.320
 actually so far from me 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.520
 I hope you liked it and me 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.270
 I think about the future a few more 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:12.440
 make such setup videos and cast 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:15.660
 have a special wish he writes 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.310
 whether I can do it 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.730
 Thank you for watching until the 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.730
 next time
