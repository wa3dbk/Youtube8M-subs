see<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.010> stage<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.300> their<00:00:45.510> first<00:00:45.690> time

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
see on stage it is not their first time

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.229 
see on stage it is not their first time
especially<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.039> an<00:00:47.280> opera<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
especially for an opera like this I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.810 
especially for an opera like this I
would<00:00:49.200> try<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.770> someone<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.250> had

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
would try to get someone that had

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
would try to get someone that had
performed<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.809> us<00:00:51.930> before<00:00:52.170> first<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.129> all

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
performed with us before first of all

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.819 
performed with us before first of all
for<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.360> process<00:00:54.750> for<00:00:54.960> Dutchman<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.440> look<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
for the process for Dutchman I look to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.700 
for the process for Dutchman I look to
see<00:00:55.860> who<00:00:56.190> did<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.670> 2002<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.809> certainly

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
see who did it in 2002 I certainly

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470 
see who did it in 2002 I certainly
wanted<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> use<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.730> people<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.420> were

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
wanted to use those people if they were

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.619 
wanted to use those people if they were
available<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> would<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.629> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
available and that would make this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
available and that would make this
process<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.260> easier<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> music

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
process a little easier and the music

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
process a little easier and the music
would<00:01:05.729> come<00:01:05.939> back<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> them<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> would<00:01:07.200> say

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
would come back to them but I would say

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
would come back to them but I would say
about<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.100> third<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> people<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.570> did<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
about a third of the people that did it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.080

Corps<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:17.130> course<00:01:17.670> stirs<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
Corps of course stirs that we have and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.899

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the two auditions that we have had last

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.230 
the two auditions that we have had last
year<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.350> biggest<00:01:23.070> chorus<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.909> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
year this is the biggest chorus of this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.740 
year this is the biggest chorus of this
season<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.070> really<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.250> about<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> year<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.420> was

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
season so really for about a year I was

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.870 
season so really for about a year I was
thinking<00:01:28.170> okay<00:01:28.710> who<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> chorus

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
thinking okay who can be in this chorus

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
thinking okay who can be in this chorus
and<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.150> also<00:01:30.360> requires<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.960> lot<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.259> man<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and it also requires a lot of man you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490 
and it also requires a lot of man you
have<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.130> double<00:01:32.670> men's<00:01:32.939> chorus<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> could

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
have a double men's chorus so I could

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
have a double men's chorus so I could
when<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> someone<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.850> might<00:01:36.030> be

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
when I think of someone that might be

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
when I think of someone that might be
able<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.020> jot<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.380> down

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
able to do it I would just jot it down

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
able to do it I would just jot it down
and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.820> don't<00:01:38.970> audition<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.750> each

months we have maybe two rehearsals a
week<00:02:03.479> sometimes<00:02:04.020> I'll<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.619> men

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.039 
week sometimes I'll have just men
sometimes<00:02:05.250> I'll<00:02:05.580> have<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.880> women<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.539> that<00:02:06.720> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
sometimes I'll have just women so that I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.370 
sometimes I'll have just women so that I
use<00:02:07.560> their<00:02:07.740> time<00:02:07.950> efficiently<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.229> get

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
use their time efficiently and as we get

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.949 
use their time efficiently and as we get
into<00:02:10.530> stagings<00:02:11.130> for<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.150> one<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.630> was<00:02:12.810> about

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
into stagings for this one it was about

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.280 
into stagings for this one it was about
four<00:02:13.860> times<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.670> week<00:02:14.819> plus<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.480> weekends<00:02:16.050> so

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
four times a week plus the weekends so

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.309 
four times a week plus the weekends so
it<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.239> about<00:02:18.239> three<00:02:18.510> weeks<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.900> intense

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
it can be about three weeks of intense

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
it can be about three weeks of intense
rehearsals<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.610> staging<00:02:20.880> for<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.569> women

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
rehearsals for the staging for the women

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.800 
rehearsals for the staging for the women
especially<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.100> act<00:02:23.310> two<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:24.780> actually

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
especially in act two it actually

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.620 
especially in act two it actually
requires<00:02:25.440> more<00:02:26.370> delicacy<00:02:27.180> than<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.510> would

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
requires more delicacy than you would

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.539 
requires more delicacy than you would
think<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:28.080> vogner<00:02:28.590> there's<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.890> lot<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.160> nuance

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
think in vogner there's a lot of nuance

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.110 
think in vogner there's a lot of nuance
to<00:02:29.730> their<00:02:29.970> scene<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:31.350> very<00:02:31.680> quick<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to their scene it's very quick in the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.090 
to their scene it's very quick in the
way<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.569> words<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.350> very<00:02:34.620> quick

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
way of the words there's a very quick

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.370 
way of the words there's a very quick
section<00:02:35.430> which<00:02:35.970> requires<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.569> lot<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.900> ability

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
section which requires a lot of ability

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.979 
section which requires a lot of ability
in<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.560> way<00:02:37.890> there's<00:02:38.730> an<00:02:38.880> acapella<00:02:39.390> section

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
in that way there's an acapella section

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.710 
in that way there's an acapella section
so<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.860> almost<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.819> way<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.090> German

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
so it's almost like in the way of German

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720 
so it's almost like in the way of German
Lieder<00:02:42.959> or<00:02:43.349> German<00:02:43.739> song<00:02:44.010> where<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.519> have

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
Lieder or German song where you have

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.050 
Lieder or German song where you have
that<00:02:44.940> nuance<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.840> musicality<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> man<00:02:47.670> it

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that nuance of musicality for the man it

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.710 
that nuance of musicality for the man it
requires<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.840> real<00:02:49.200> strength<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:50.040> singing

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
requires a real strength of singing

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.940 
requires a real strength of singing
strong<00:02:51.720> tenors<00:02:52.260> strong<00:02:52.650> bases<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.660> also<00:02:54.660> a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
strong tenors strong bases and also a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.699 
strong tenors strong bases and also a
freedom<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.100> acting<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.200> way<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
freedom of acting in the way of the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.460 
freedom of acting in the way of the
sailors<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.880> definitely<00:03:00.630> try<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> look<00:03:01.200> at<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
sailors I definitely try to look at the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.160 
sailors I definitely try to look at the
quarters<00:03:02.160> as<00:03:02.340> individuals<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.480> actually

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
quarters as individuals and actually

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.610 
quarters as individuals and actually
many<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.739> them<00:03:04.980> coach<00:03:05.549> with<00:03:05.820> me<00:03:06.000> privately<00:03:06.620> so

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
many of them coach with me privately so

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.699 
many of them coach with me privately so
I<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.579> their<00:03:08.790> development<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.709> if

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
I can see their development and if

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.500 
I can see their development and if
someone<00:03:11.609> needs<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> little<00:03:12.239> something

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
someone needs to do a little something

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.990 
someone needs to do a little something

coordinating that ensemble wise so this

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.890
