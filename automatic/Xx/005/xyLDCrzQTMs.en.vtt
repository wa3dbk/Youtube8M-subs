 at 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.480
 we end up for the vertigo a 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.949

 event is organized by the ffme and the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.610
 club the g us at 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.970
 it is true that it is also good that we 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.379
 found on a natural site that is 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.940
 strong because the worm in these cases a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.149
 from the biggest climbing sites to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 world and we have this chance there and during 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.070
 these three days we really want to heart 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.590
 to get to the facility the escaladent 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.360
 for everyone especially about on 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 big or even the verdon is a site 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.550
 that scares many who can 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.380
 sometimes seem inaccessible and the idea 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.210
 in putting static that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.399
 allow people to get off 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.800
 quietly without taking the head 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.780
 and to be able to go up autonomously 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.100
 that's really it's to allow a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.410
 access to show people that this is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 also to prove to go up because 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.270
 centrifuges 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.270
 but it's mostly back up 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.869
 he 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410
 so 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.900
 the day of Friday with a 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.500
 who came to climb our cliffs 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.410
 we were going to propose a little game around 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.440
 a fun questionnaire about the park 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.850

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 location information 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.180
 nests in cliffs pay attention 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.100
 particular on climbing routes 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.430
 most rapale will feast 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.920
 show one or two small parents and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.810
 disturb them at the wrong time compound 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.810
 the damage is that it is paid 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.370
 there are people who also took advantage of it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.530

 and then there are all who could 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.480
 enjoy the gardens in the shape of the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.370
 artificial structure of 1000 meters 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.500
 which was mounted for the occasion of the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.620
 trampoline that was next to a workshop 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.170
 slackline and there it will be made to a carton 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.350
 since even tourists are here 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.790
 was not necessarily in the world of 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.010
 climbed up and stop with their 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.730
