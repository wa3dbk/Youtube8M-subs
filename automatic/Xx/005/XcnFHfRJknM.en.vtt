without<00:00:35.570> coming<00:00:36.570> into<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:37.050> LCS<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.940> knew

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
without coming into the LCS we we knew

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.020 
without coming into the LCS we we knew
that<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.870> gonna<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.350> tough<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.910> yeah<00:00:41.910> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that it was gonna be tough and yeah it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.030 
that it was gonna be tough and yeah it
was<00:00:42.270> yes<00:00:42.690> Alliance<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.320> he<00:00:43.410> has<00:00:43.530> gone<00:00:43.739> beat<00:00:43.890> it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
was yes Alliance but he has gone beat it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790 
was yes Alliance but he has gone beat it
was<00:00:44.220> fine<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.269> managed<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.739> add<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
was fine because we managed to add a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.889 
was fine because we managed to add a
really<00:00:47.190> good<00:00:47.429> start<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:47.879> then<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.629> just

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
really good start and then we can just

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.500 
really good start and then we can just
noble<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.679> a<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:50.699> good<00:00:50.879> action<00:00:51.179> on<00:00:51.269> top

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
noble with a really good action on top

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
noble with a really good action on top
and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.890> could<00:00:53.100> come<00:00:53.339> back<00:00:53.489> since<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and then they could come back since that

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.410 
and then they could come back since that
but<00:00:54.649> against<00:00:55.649> Alliance<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.579> had<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:57.390> more

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
but against Alliance we had much more

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
but against Alliance we had much more
clever<00:00:57.960> than<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.469> think<00:00:58.679> they<00:00:58.739> did<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.100> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
clever than I think they did a lot of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.729 
clever than I think they did a lot of
mistakes<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.960> we<00:01:00.960> play<00:01:01.170> really<00:01:01.350> good<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
mistakes and we play really good as a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.829 
mistakes and we play really good as a
team<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.309> think<00:01:02.550> that's<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.269> gave<00:01:03.690> us

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
team and I think that's what gave us

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.040 
team and I think that's what gave us
away<00:01:04.489> what<00:01:05.489> did<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> work<00:01:05.940> on<00:01:06.150> since<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.690> fall

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
away what did you work on since the fall

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.870 
away what did you work on since the fall
line<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> back<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> 20<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.730> get

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
line was in the back of the 20 to get

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.380 
line was in the back of the 20 to get
this<00:01:09.390> boot<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.900> short<00:01:10.200> time<00:01:10.409> come<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.790> think

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
this boot is a short time come I think

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.030 
this boot is a short time come I think
something<00:01:13.020> was<00:01:13.140> missing<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
something was missing because on the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.940 
something was missing because on the
paper<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.150> players<00:01:15.390> but

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
paper we have really good players but

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.460 
paper we have really good players but
since<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.369> practice<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.689> efficiently

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
since then we practice more efficiently

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.920 
since then we practice more efficiently
I<00:01:19.740> mean<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.340> were<00:01:20.369> working<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:21.689> wrong

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
I mean we were working on what was wrong

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.710 
I mean we were working on what was wrong
and<00:01:22.380> 90<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.460> Battle<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> Atlantic<00:01:24.030> we

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and 90 at the Battle of the Atlantic we

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.399 
and 90 at the Battle of the Atlantic we
were<00:01:24.750> prepared<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.770> not<00:01:26.009> enough<00:01:26.899> we<00:01:27.899> write

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
were prepared but not enough we write

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.370 
were prepared but not enough we write
down<00:01:28.649> all<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.979> music<00:01:29.640> speedy<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.840> work<00:01:31.170> on

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
down all the music speedy and we work on

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.850 
down all the music speedy and we work on
them<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.579> now<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:33.210> ready<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.899> I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
them and I think now we are ready and I

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.580 
them and I think now we are ready and I
think<00:01:35.250> we're<00:01:35.399> playing<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.700> none<00:01:36.000> yeah<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
think we're playing good none yeah so I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.010 
think we're playing good none yeah so I
was<00:01:37.740> starting<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.340> ask<00:01:38.549> how<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> synergy

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
was starting to ask how is the synergy

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.840 
was starting to ask how is the synergy
going<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.649> between<00:01:40.920> reckless<00:01:41.369> sent<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
going on now between reckless sent you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.910 
going on now between reckless sent you
but<00:01:42.149> since<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> still<00:01:42.930> haven't<00:01:43.200> died<00:01:43.409> nine

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
but since you still haven't died nine

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.069 
but since you still haven't died nine
that<00:01:44.189> neither<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.329> three<00:01:45.659> games<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that neither of you in three games I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.160 
that neither of you in three games I
guess<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.619> obvious<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.219> treatable<00:01:47.869> yeah<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
guess it's obvious it's treatable yeah I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
guess it's obvious it's treatable yeah I
think<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> Battle<00:01:50.219> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.340> Atlantic<00:01:50.520> both

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
think at the Battle of the Atlantic both

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.660 
think at the Battle of the Atlantic both
I<00:01:51.600> had<00:01:51.810> no<00:01:51.990> problem<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.789> we<00:01:53.789> were<00:01:54.000> already

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
I had no problem at all we were already

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.140 
I had no problem at all we were already
other<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.270> Portland<00:01:57.070> they<00:01:58.070> were<00:01:58.130> really<00:01:58.549> far

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
other in Portland they were really far

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.830 
other in Portland they were really far
behind<00:01:59.330> but<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:01.159> was<00:02:01.369> mainly<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.970> team<00:02:02.360> problem

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
behind but it was mainly a team problem

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.190 
behind but it was mainly a team problem
and<00:02:03.020> we<00:02:03.770> wish<00:02:04.490> we<00:02:04.729> had<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.060> solve<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.540> now<00:02:06.170> I

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and we wish we had to solve and now I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.529 
and we wish we had to solve and now I
think<00:02:06.619> it's<00:02:06.799> done<00:02:07.220> but<00:02:07.939> we<00:02:08.179> still<00:02:08.330> have<00:02:08.509> to

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
think it's done but we still have to

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.870 
think it's done but we still have to
improve<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:09.020> lot<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.440> we<00:02:09.920> will<00:02:10.130> still<00:02:10.520> work<00:02:10.670> on

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
improve a lot and we will still work on

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.540 
improve a lot and we will still work on
that<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.510> saw<00:02:12.140> with<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.470> plan<00:02:12.680> for<00:02:12.860> fanatic<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
that I saw with the plan for fanatic to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.290 
that I saw with the plan for fanatic to
win<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.270> third<00:02:14.480> split<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.170> row<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:16.060> hope<00:02:17.060> so

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
win the third split in a row I hope so

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.540 
win the third split in a row I hope so
but<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.750> know<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.170> Alliance<00:02:18.980> chokes<00:02:19.250> really

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
but we know that Alliance chokes really

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.010 
but we know that Alliance chokes really
are<00:02:19.700> at<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.970> beginning<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:20.750> know<00:02:20.989> that

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
are at the beginning and we know that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.250 
are at the beginning and we know that
they<00:02:21.500> are<00:02:21.709> come<00:02:22.069> stronger<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:23.720> they<00:02:23.900> don't<00:02:24.140> go

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
they are come stronger if they don't go

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.900 
they are come stronger if they don't go
down<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.099> believe<00:02:25.519> that<00:02:25.580> they<00:02:25.880> will

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
down but I believe that they will

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.630 
down but I believe that they will
improve<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.780> lot<00:02:26.930> maybe<00:02:27.530> they<00:02:28.130> have<00:02:28.310> no<00:02:28.430> clue

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
improve a lot maybe they have no clue

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.430 
improve a lot maybe they have no clue
because<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.209> first<00:02:29.420> time<00:02:29.569> they<00:02:29.720> play<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:30.380> a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
because it's a first time they play as a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.009 
because it's a first time they play as a
team<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.010> firstly<00:02:31.880> playing<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.450> LCS<00:02:32.870> and

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
team and firstly playing the LCS and

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.229 
team and firstly playing the LCS and
they<00:02:33.170> maybe<00:02:33.440> didn't<00:02:34.130> really<00:02:34.489> prepare

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
they maybe didn't really prepare

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.090 
they maybe didn't really prepare
correctly<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.049> now<00:02:36.319> they<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.620> write<00:02:37.040> down

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
correctly and now they just write down

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.759 
correctly and now they just write down
what<00:02:37.549> did<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.819> wrong<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.200> ya<00:02:39.200> next<00:02:39.410> time<00:02:39.560> they

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
what did you wrong and ya next time they

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.820 
what did you wrong and ya next time they
become<00:02:40.069> stronger<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:40.819> as<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.660> said<00:02:41.720> finally<00:02:42.680> we

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
become stronger but as I said finally we

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.370 
become stronger but as I said finally we
be<00:02:42.980> here<00:02:43.130> do<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.209> think<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.600> allows<00:02:44.930> me<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
be here do you think that allows me you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.350 
be here do you think that allows me you
were<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> bit<00:02:45.799> overconfident<00:02:46.370> because

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
were a bit overconfident because

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.100 
were a bit overconfident because
everyone<00:02:48.170> was<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.350> hyped<00:02:48.769> about<00:02:48.920> them<00:02:50.080> yeah<00:02:51.080> I

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
everyone was so hyped about them yeah I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.900 
everyone was so hyped about them yeah I
think<00:02:51.350> they<00:02:51.590> had<00:02:51.799> a<00:02:51.830> lot<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.130> pressure<00:02:52.519> first

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
think they had a lot of pressure first

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.660 
think they had a lot of pressure first
of<00:02:53.060> all<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.690> they<00:02:53.900> feel<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:54.890> prepared<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
of all but they feel really prepared and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.199 
of all but they feel really prepared and
confident<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:57.560> know<00:02:57.709> we<00:02:57.950> fed<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.000> same

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
overconfident and this is not good at

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.060 
overconfident and this is not good at

there is 30 teams are really strong now

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.009 
there is 30 teams are really strong now
and<00:03:21.680> they<00:03:21.980> were<00:03:22.100> just<00:03:22.280> work<00:03:22.549> on<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.810> just

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
say it against SD gaming and the figure

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.030 
say it against SD gaming and the figure
was<00:03:26.600> your<00:03:26.750> first<00:03:27.049> time<00:03:27.230> playing<00:03:27.260> against<00:03:27.890> your

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
was your first time playing against your

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.300 
was your first time playing against your
ex<00:03:28.430> both<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.570> partner<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.109> rated<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.680> support

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
ex both a partner and rated the support

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.930 
ex both a partner and rated the support
player<00:03:31.549> how<00:03:32.390> is<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.690> matchup<00:03:33.109> for<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.940> I

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
player how is the matchup for you I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.050 
player how is the matchup for you I
think<00:03:35.870> they<00:03:36.019> didn't<00:03:36.440> really<00:03:37.010> want<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.370> face<00:03:37.790> up

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
think they didn't really want to face up

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.930 
think they didn't really want to face up
straight<00:03:38.569> to<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:38.900> do<00:03:39.109> because<00:03:39.829> when<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:40.489> really

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
straight to be do because when I really

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.630 
straight to be do because when I really
sort<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.209> composition<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.989> know<00:03:42.109> what<00:03:42.380> they

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
sort of composition I know what they

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.580 
sort of composition I know what they
to<00:03:42.790> do<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.270> now<00:03:43.420> were<00:03:43.569> livin<00:03:43.870> when<00:03:44.050> they<00:03:44.110> try

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
to do and now were livin when they try

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.699 
to do and now were livin when they try
to<00:03:44.650> outsmart<00:03:45.550> us<00:03:46.120> i<00:03:46.330> would<00:03:46.510> say<00:03:46.660> but<00:03:47.260> he<00:03:47.410> didn't

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
to outsmart us i would say but he didn't

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.570 
to outsmart us i would say but he didn't
work<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.959> don't<00:03:50.740> know<00:03:50.830> I<00:03:50.860> feel<00:03:51.190> like<00:03:51.340> I'm

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
work and I don't know I feel like I'm

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.970 
work and I don't know I feel like I'm
right<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.270> not<00:03:52.480> as<00:03:52.780> good<00:03:53.260> at<00:03:53.410> he<00:03:53.620> was<00:03:53.770> before

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
right it is not as good at he was before

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.110 
right it is not as good at he was before
because<00:03:54.370> he's<00:03:54.790> played<00:03:55.780> for<00:03:55.990> so<00:03:56.140> long<00:03:56.170> now<00:03:56.319> and

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
because he's played for so long now and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.330 
because he's played for so long now and
I<00:03:58.350> believe<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.380> he<00:03:59.650> will<00:03:59.740> become<00:04:00.070> stronger

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
I believe that he will become stronger

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.250 
I believe that he will become stronger
later<00:04:01.090> on<00:04:01.390> and<00:04:02.550> yeah<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:03.790> think<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.870> was<00:04:05.050> good

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
later on and yeah I think it was good

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.750 
later on and yeah I think it was good
for<00:04:05.320> us<00:04:05.470> all<00:04:05.770> wrong<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:07.230> if<00:04:08.230> plate<00:04:08.650> like<00:04:09.280> six

months<00:04:09.910> support<00:04:10.690> now<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:12.069> think<00:04:12.160> really

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
months support now and I think really
