to the fourth and then repeat it at
least<00:00:42.000> two<00:00:42.300> circuits<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.079> you're

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
least two circuits now if you're

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.750 
least two circuits now if you're
beginning<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:44.129> circuit<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> be

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
beginning one circuit is going to be

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.340

great<00:00:45.030> if<00:00:45.239> you're<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.780> advanced<00:00:46.079> two

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
great if you're more advanced two

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
great if you're more advanced two
circuits<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:46.829> also<00:00:47.160> work<00:00:47.969> you're<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.360> fine

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
circuits will also work you're just fine

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
circuits will also work you're just fine
as<00:00:49.110> far<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:49.620> many<00:00:49.680> times<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
as far as how many times to do this a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.130 
as far as how many times to do this a
week<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> try<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> in

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the number of reps is going to be

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
the number of reps is going to be
determined<00:01:36.299> by<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.869> level<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.259> fitness<00:01:37.470> the

determined by your level of fitness the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.260 
determined by your level of fitness the
second<00:01:38.220> exercise<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.180> you've

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
second exercise is one that you've

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
second exercise is one that you've
probably<00:01:39.420> seen<00:01:39.750> everywhere<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> great

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
probably seen everywhere it's a great

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.370 
probably seen everywhere it's a great
good<00:01:41.549> total<00:01:42.030> body<00:01:42.150> exercise<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.960> called<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
good total body exercise it's called a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.969 
good total body exercise it's called a
plank<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.420> how<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.810> starts<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.829> just

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
plank and how that is starts is you just
