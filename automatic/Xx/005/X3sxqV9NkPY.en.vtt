 the fifty future mountaineers those of the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.440
 courses that are set up by the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.660
 regional committee rhône-alpes and the famous 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.250
 whose purpose is to initiate or 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.800
 to perfect young people to mountaineer 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.940
 from the second week of July to the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.940
 first week of taste 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.720
 so the stadiums are aimed at young people 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.740
 between 14 and 22 years old who are in school 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.740
 in rhône alpes 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.180
 the first day did a school of 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.130
 climbing 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 my goal is to recall the techniques 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.140
 of progression in big voice 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.190
 never made the big way i did 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.410
 never done is not bad art corsican 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.160
 is also here I really have my 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.160
 parents it's really cool 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.070
 why did not you take things are 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.360
 not because we are in the mountains 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.360
 big is the base 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.560
 jeanne saw well 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.960
 for sure it's much better than the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.640
 room but in fact one 120 all year long 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.830
 in the room only after when it's good 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.830
 come here to please 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.420
 the second day is devoted to a 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.700
 race stops so it helps to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.200
 show young people the escaladent entrance 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.960
 adventure raid and techniques 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.180
 belaying in motion I really 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.790
 a lot liked the hawks arette race 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.840
 did I like the most in the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.750
 mountain since I was little 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.390
 so it went like that mountain 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.160
 really want to always do it then 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.400
 the third day is dedicated and 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.780
 a school of snow and ice 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 and there we pass the second stage where we 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.590
 does the progression with crampons that's 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.360
 when we arrive alone wc because done 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.100

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.810
 exercises here we go down on the 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.030
 refuge of the argentière and there we are 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.250
 completely recovered from ice yesterday so he 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.440
 We need to learn how to evolve safely 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.030
 on glacier we also seek committed yesterday 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.830
 agree to cross the legs for 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.550
 save yourself and not have to ride everything 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.550
 free right if we stall 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.230

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.500
 here are the smallest nichols steps 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.500

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.599
 it's the only tool at the 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.670
 security 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:59.170
