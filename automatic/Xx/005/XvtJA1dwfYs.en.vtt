00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
everybody it's flying Ryan here with a

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.789 
everybody it's flying Ryan here with a
review<00:00:10.870> of<00:00:10.930> the<00:00:11.230> Syma<00:00:11.559> x12<00:00:12.370> nano<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:14.620> is<00:00:14.770> a

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
review of the Syma x12 nano this is a

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.090 
review of the Syma x12 nano this is a
pretty<00:00:15.070> cool<00:00:15.340> little<00:00:15.400> nano<00:00:16.059> here<00:00:17.010> kind<00:00:18.010> of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
pretty cool little nano here kind of

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.630 
pretty cool little nano here kind of
looks<00:00:18.400> like<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.910> cheerson<00:00:19.240> cx-10<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:21.520> it's

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
looks like the cheerson cx-10 but it's

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.179 
looks like the cheerson cx-10 but it's
not<00:00:21.789> quite<00:00:22.060> as<00:00:22.210> small<00:00:22.779> it's<00:00:23.080> more<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.679> size<00:00:23.949> of

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
not quite as small it's more the size of

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.120 
not quite as small it's more the size of
like<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.460> proto<00:00:24.730> X<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:26.650> you<00:00:26.800> know<00:00:26.919> nice

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
like the proto X but you know nice

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.279 
like the proto X but you know nice
little<00:00:27.460> nano<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:28.060> battery<00:00:28.449> is<00:00:28.570> on<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.869> bottom

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
little nano the battery is on the bottom

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.659 
little nano the battery is on the bottom
here<00:00:29.589> which<00:00:29.740> is<00:00:29.890> a<00:00:29.949> little<00:00:30.130> different<00:00:30.519> than

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
here which is a little different than

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.660 
here which is a little different than
they<00:00:30.820> usually<00:00:30.999> are<00:00:31.390> I<00:00:31.749> think<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.590> helps<00:00:33.010> make

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
they usually are I think that helps make

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.370 
they usually are I think that helps make
it<00:00:33.850> or<00:00:33.940> you<00:00:34.030> know<00:00:34.150> really<00:00:34.329> smooth<00:00:34.870> stable

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
it or you know really smooth stable

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.240 
it or you know really smooth stable
flyer<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:37.270> got<00:00:37.420> nice<00:00:37.690> little<00:00:37.990> landing<00:00:38.980> a

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
flyer it's got nice little landing a

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.430 
flyer it's got nice little landing a
little<00:00:39.760> rubber<00:00:39.969> landing<00:00:40.539> feet<00:00:40.780> on<00:00:40.960> it<00:00:41.140> so<00:00:41.289> it's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
little rubber landing feet on it so it's

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.090 
little rubber landing feet on it so it's
got<00:00:41.620> a<00:00:41.649> nice<00:00:42.030> soft<00:00:43.030> landing<00:00:43.750> and<00:00:44.020> it's<00:00:44.829> got<00:00:45.070> a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
got a nice soft landing and it's got a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.450 
got a nice soft landing and it's got a
bright<00:00:45.820> white<00:00:46.149> LED<00:00:46.420> on<00:00:46.989> the<00:00:47.020> front<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.800> then

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
bright white LED on the front and then

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.180 
bright white LED on the front and then
colored<00:00:48.969> LEDs<00:00:49.480> on<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.840> top<00:00:50.230> of<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:50.559> body<00:00:50.770> here

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
colored LEDs on the top of the body here

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.670 
colored LEDs on the top of the body here
which<00:00:51.399> is<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:51.609> little<00:00:51.940> bit<00:00:52.180> odd<00:00:52.449> that<00:00:52.960> they're

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
which is a little bit odd that they're

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.470 
which is a little bit odd that they're
on<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:54.010> top<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.609> frame<00:00:54.910> they're<00:00:55.120> not<00:00:55.269> out

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
on the top of the frame they're not out

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.770 
on the top of the frame they're not out
on<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.750> motor<00:00:56.019> mount<00:00:56.410> or<00:00:56.649> anything<00:00:57.359> so<00:00:58.359> kind

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
on the motor mount or anything so kind

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.290 
on the motor mount or anything so kind
of<00:00:58.929> hard<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.320> see<00:00:59.679> the<00:00:59.859> LEDs<00:01:00.340> especially<00:01:01.030> from

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
of hard to see the LEDs especially from

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.380 
of hard to see the LEDs especially from
below<00:01:01.949> though<00:01:02.949> they<00:01:03.160> do<00:01:03.219> kind<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:03.879> cast<00:01:04.150> a

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
below though they do kind of cast a

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.290 
below though they do kind of cast a
light<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.989> prop<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:05.770> see<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.880> props

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
light on the prop so you see the props

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.570 
light on the prop so you see the props
lit<00:01:07.690> up<00:01:07.840> by<00:01:08.050> them<00:01:08.290> more<00:01:08.590> than<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.830> see<00:01:09.310> them

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
lit up by them more than you see them

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.750 
lit up by them more than you see them
themselves<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.740> still<00:01:12.070> not<00:01:12.280> I<00:01:12.340> don't<00:01:12.580> think

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
themselves but still not I don't think

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.660 
themselves but still not I don't think
it's<00:01:12.850> really<00:01:13.150> quite<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.480> night<00:01:13.900> flyer<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:15.400> may

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
it's really quite a night flyer you may

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's really quite a night flyer you may
be<00:01:15.730> able<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.270> get<00:01:16.450> away<00:01:16.570> with<00:01:16.930> it<00:01:16.960> but<00:01:17.290> I<00:01:17.350> would

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
be able to get away with it but I would

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.620 
be able to get away with it but I would
risk<00:01:18.010> you<00:01:18.340> know<00:01:18.460> I'd<00:01:18.790> worry<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.240> you'd<00:01:19.360> risk

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
risk you know I'd worry that you'd risk

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.690 
risk you know I'd worry that you'd risk
you<00:01:19.900> know<00:01:20.050> not<00:01:20.380> seeing<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:20.980> at<00:01:21.130> certain<00:01:21.310> times

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
you know not seeing it at certain times

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.820 
you know not seeing it at certain times
and<00:01:21.880> just<00:01:21.970> completely<00:01:22.630> losing<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.260> or<00:01:23.470> losing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
and just completely losing it or losing

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.000 
and just completely losing it or losing
orientation<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.780> kind<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.140> weird<00:01:26.410> LED

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
orientation so kind of a weird LED

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.840 
orientation so kind of a weird LED
placement<00:01:27.640> but<00:01:28.510> at<00:01:28.660> least<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:29.020> has<00:01:29.050> them<00:01:29.850> this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
placement but at least it has them this

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.510 
placement but at least it has them this
has<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.540> same<00:01:32.020> transmitter<00:01:32.740> style<00:01:33.130> that<00:01:33.400> I've

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
has the same transmitter style that I've

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.370 
has the same transmitter style that I've
complained<00:01:34.000> about<00:01:34.180> from<00:01:34.540> cyma<00:01:34.840> before<00:01:35.350> I

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
complained about from cyma before I

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.420 
complained about from cyma before I
don't<00:01:35.620> like<00:01:35.980> this

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
don't like this

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.790 
don't like this
Saima<00:01:36.700> transmitter<00:01:37.390> but<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.410> know<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:38.620> does

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
Saima transmitter but you know it does

Saima transmitter but you know it does
its<00:01:39.010> job<00:01:39.070> it's<00:01:39.670> kind<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.060> geared<00:01:40.300> more<00:01:40.510> towards

its job it's kind of geared more towards
thumb<00:01:41.290> flyers<00:01:41.650> but<00:01:42.070> it<00:01:42.160> is<00:01:42.340> pinchable<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.420> you

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.990 
what they were thinking on the yaw you
know<00:02:02.110> especially<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.860> little<00:02:03.460> nano<00:02:03.700> that's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
know especially for a little nano that's

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.590 
know especially for a little nano that's
intended<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.540> be<00:02:04.720> flown<00:02:04.990> in<00:02:05.170> small<00:02:05.470> areas<00:02:06.600> it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
intended to be flown in small areas it's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.640 
intended to be flown in small areas it's
just<00:02:07.930> too<00:02:08.170> slow<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.050> know<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.470> would

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
just too slow I think you know it would

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.220 
just too slow I think you know it would
be<00:02:11.680> better<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.340> big<00:02:12.550> area<00:02:13.000> or<00:02:13.180> outdoors<00:02:13.720> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
be better in a big area or outdoors the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.190 
be better in a big area or outdoors the
yaw<00:02:14.440> rate<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.890> more<00:02:15.129> suited<00:02:15.579> for<00:02:15.609> that<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
yaw rate is more suited for that and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.809 
yaw rate is more suited for that and
then<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.469> flip<00:02:17.769> by<00:02:18.040> holding<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.640> right

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
then you flip by holding the right

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.510 
then you flip by holding the right
button

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
button

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.840 
button
giving<00:02:19.910> you're<00:02:20.150> right<00:02:20.540> stick<00:02:20.870> input<00:02:21.850> comes

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
giving you're right stick input comes

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.690 
giving you're right stick input comes
with<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> USB<00:02:23.630> charging<00:02:24.290> cable<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.400> spare

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
with a USB charging cable and a spare

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.300 
with a USB charging cable and a spare
set<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.030> props<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.930> screwdriver<00:02:27.680> which<00:02:28.130> i

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
set of props and a screwdriver which i

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.540 
set of props and a screwdriver which i
think<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:29.260> maybe<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.560> had<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.710> take<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.310> quad

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
think is maybe you had to take the quad

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.580 
think is maybe you had to take the quad
apart<00:02:32.000> if<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.210> need<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.260> think<00:02:33.320> there

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
apart if you need to and I think there

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.490 
apart if you need to and I think there
is<00:02:33.710> also<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.040> screw<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> battery

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
is also a screw in the battery

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.390 
is also a screw in the battery
compartment<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.920> that's<00:02:37.100> right<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
compartment so that's right the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.480 
compartment so that's right the
screwdrivers<00:02:38.030> for<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:39.380> takes<00:02:39.620> about<00:02:39.770> 25

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
screwdrivers for it takes about 25

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.660 
screwdrivers for it takes about 25
minutes<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.210> charge<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.350> 100<00:02:42.980> milliamp<00:02:43.430> our

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
minutes to charge the 100 milliamp our

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.390 
minutes to charge the 100 milliamp our
internal<00:02:44.300> battery<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.710> get<00:02:45.860> about<00:02:46.070> five

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
internal battery and you get about five

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.280 
internal battery and you get about five
and<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.640> half<00:02:46.670> minute<00:02:47.180> flight<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.810> pretty<00:02:48.050> long

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
and a half minute flight so pretty long

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.220 
and a half minute flight so pretty long
flights

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
if there is an LV see it kicks on it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.420 
if there is an LV see it kicks on it
like<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.780> last<00:02:54.020> second<00:02:54.590> sometimes<00:02:55.130> I've<00:02:55.400> seen

the x5 c-more hobby-grade style

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.180 
the x5 c-more hobby-grade style
transmitters<00:03:16.700> you've<00:03:16.850> got<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.180> use<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:18.590> Xbox

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
transmitters you've got to use this Xbox

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.790 
transmitters you've got to use this Xbox
style<00:03:19.610> transmitter<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.660> then<00:03:21.410> as<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.680> can

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
style transmitter and then as you can

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.370 
style transmitter and then as you can
see<00:03:21.860> here<00:03:22.280> comes<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:22.850> red<00:03:23.120> white<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.720> black<00:03:23.990> as

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
see here comes in red white and black as

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.070 
see here comes in red white and black as
well<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.400> course<00:03:25.640> green<00:03:26.570> being<00:03:26.900> my

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
well and of course green being my

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.810 
well and of course green being my
favorite<00:03:27.410> color<00:03:27.650> which<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.040> think<00:03:28.310> green<00:03:28.580> is

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
favorite color which I think green is

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.670 
favorite color which I think green is
the<00:03:28.970> coolest<00:03:29.360> looking<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.900> them<00:03:30.080> all<00:03:30.320> but

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
the coolest looking of them all but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.800 
the coolest looking of them all but
you've<00:03:31.370> got<00:03:31.580> some<00:03:31.790> other<00:03:31.880> options<00:03:32.480> if<00:03:32.690> you

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
you've got some other options if you

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.560 
you've got some other options if you
prefer<00:03:33.170> other<00:03:33.380> colors<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:34.940> think<00:03:35.240> that's

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
prefer other colors and I think that's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.060 
prefer other colors and I think that's
about<00:03:35.690> all<00:03:35.870> there<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.110> to<00:03:36.200> say<00:03:36.500> about<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.860> so

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
about all there is to say about it so

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.030 
about all there is to say about it so
let's<00:03:37.310> go<00:03:37.550> take<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:37.880> from<00:03:38.120> flight<00:03:39.040> alright

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
let's go take it from flight alright

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.770 
let's go take it from flight alright
this<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.610> flight<00:03:40.820> review<00:03:41.240> of<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.510> Syma

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
this is the flight review of the Syma

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.360 
this is the flight review of the Syma
x12<00:03:42.230> nano<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.940> as<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.540> can<00:03:44.690> see<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.290> LEDs<00:03:46.040> on

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
x12 nano and as you can see the LEDs on

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.070 
x12 nano and as you can see the LEDs on
the<00:03:46.400> top<00:03:46.730> of<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:46.970> body<00:03:47.180> they're<00:03:47.540> kind<00:03:47.990> of

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
the top of the body they're kind of

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.440 
the top of the body they're kind of
interesting<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.030> don't<00:03:50.030> think<00:03:50.360> I

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
interesting and I don't think I

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.030 
interesting and I don't think I
mentioned<00:03:50.510> this<00:03:50.959> in<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.170> flight<00:03:51.470> review<00:03:51.709> but

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
mentioned this in the flight review but

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.220 
mentioned this in the flight review but
you<00:03:52.130> can<00:03:52.280> recalibrate<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.209> accelerometer<00:03:54.050> by

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
you can recalibrate the accelerometer by

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.060 
you can recalibrate the accelerometer by
holding<00:03:54.709> both<00:03:55.640> sticks<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.240> the<00:03:56.360> down<00:03:56.540> right

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
holding both sticks to the down right

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.160 
holding both sticks to the down right
and<00:03:58.070> there<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.030> LEDs<00:03:59.390> blink<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.910> now<00:04:01.910> the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
and there the LEDs blink and now the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.199 
and there the LEDs blink and now the
accelerometers<00:04:03.170> recalibrated<00:04:03.970> alright<00:04:04.970> so

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
accelerometers recalibrated alright so

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.650 
accelerometers recalibrated alright so
let's<00:04:05.420> give<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.840> spin<00:04:07.060> start<00:04:08.060> off<00:04:08.209> on<00:04:08.420> high

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
let's give it a spin start off on high

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.930 
let's give it a spin start off on high
rates<00:04:08.990> and<00:04:10.870> there's<00:04:11.870> our<00:04:12.350> full<00:04:13.340> pure<00:04:13.670> light

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
rates and there's our full pure light

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.390 
rates and there's our full pure light
there<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.230> doesn't<00:04:15.620> change<00:04:15.860> with<00:04:16.250> the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
there and it doesn't change with the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.539 
there and it doesn't change with the
rates<00:04:16.640> or<00:04:16.940> just<00:04:17.180> one<00:04:17.359> yaw<00:04:17.630> rate<00:04:17.890> so<00:04:18.890> pretty

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
rates or just one yaw rate so pretty

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.320 
rates or just one yaw rate so pretty
slow<00:04:20.150> on<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.690> yaw<00:04:21.700> actually<00:04:22.700> let's<00:04:22.910> go<00:04:22.970> ahead

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
slow on the yaw actually let's go ahead

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.650 
slow on the yaw actually let's go ahead
and<00:04:23.510> fly<00:04:23.750> on<00:04:23.960> low<00:04:24.200> rate<00:04:24.530> since<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.419> don't<00:04:26.419> have

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
and fly on low rate since I don't have

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.960 
and fly on low rate since I don't have
much<00:04:26.960> y'all<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.470> work<00:04:27.650> with

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.920 

so<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:32.630> think<00:04:32.960> that's<00:04:33.260> about<00:04:34.419> about<00:04:35.419> as<00:04:35.600> good<00:04:35.810> as

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
so I think that's about about as good as

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.469 
so I think that's about about as good as
I<00:04:36.050> can<00:04:36.229> do<00:04:36.410> for<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.740> funnel<00:04:37.220> at<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:37.550> one<00:04:40.330> get<00:04:41.330> it

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
I can do for a funnel at this one get it

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.879 
I can do for a funnel at this one get it
back<00:04:41.690> around<00:04:41.930> okay<00:04:42.830> let's<00:04:43.100> do<00:04:43.310> some<00:04:43.340> flipping

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
back around okay let's do some flipping

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.450 
back around okay let's do some flipping
so<00:04:45.889> kind<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.400> loopy<00:04:46.910> flips<00:04:47.300> sort<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.750> like<00:04:47.930> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
so kind of loopy flips sort of like the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.200 
so kind of loopy flips sort of like the
the<00:04:49.460> sine<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.790> X<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:51.340> kind<00:04:52.340> of<00:04:52.430> have<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.610> big<00:04:52.880> role

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
the sine of X to kind of have a big role

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:02.740 
the sine of X to kind of have a big role
to<00:04:53.240> them<00:04:54.430> kind<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.580> unique<00:04:56.180> flip<00:05:01.479> but<00:05:02.479> it<00:05:02.600> is

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
to them kind of a unique flip but it is

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.469 
to them kind of a unique flip but it is
real<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.410> know<00:05:03.470> smooth<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.400> precise<00:05:05.060> and

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
real you know smooth and precise and

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.060 
real you know smooth and precise and
stable<00:05:05.990> just<00:05:06.350> that<00:05:07.310> yaw<00:05:07.639> keeps<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.510> from<00:05:08.750> being

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
stable just that yaw keeps it from being

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.350 
stable just that yaw keeps it from being
you<00:05:10.070> know<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:11.810> uh<00:05:11.949> you<00:05:12.949> know<00:05:12.979> nimble<00:05:13.850> you<00:05:14.120> can't

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
you know to uh you know nimble you can't

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.540 
you know to uh you know nimble you can't
really<00:05:14.570> do<00:05:14.889> very<00:05:15.889> aggressive<00:05:16.610> flying<00:05:16.970> with<00:05:17.330> it

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
really do very aggressive flying with it

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:33.410 
really do very aggressive flying with it
but<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.639> is<00:05:19.669> really<00:05:19.820> smooth

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.870 

so<00:05:34.020> not<00:05:34.290> bad<00:05:34.530> other<00:05:34.830> than<00:05:34.920> that<00:05:35.250> slowly<00:05:35.610> all

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
so not bad other than that slowly all

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.110 
so not bad other than that slowly all
right<00:05:36.180> it's<00:05:36.420> pretty<00:05:36.930> cool<00:05:37.200> little<00:05:37.470> quad<00:05:38.120> let's

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
right it's pretty cool little quad let's

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.600 
right it's pretty cool little quad let's
go<00:05:39.390> ahead<00:05:39.540> and<00:05:40.020> take<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:40.980> in<00:05:41.070> for<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.340> landing

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
go ahead and take it in for a landing

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.670 
go ahead and take it in for a landing
and<00:05:42.120> turn<00:05:42.360> off<00:05:42.510> some<00:05:42.780> lights<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.350> see<00:05:43.530> how

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
and turn off some lights and see how

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.580 
and turn off some lights and see how
these<00:05:43.940> top<00:05:44.940> mounted<00:05:45.540> LEDs<00:05:46.110> do<00:05:46.440> in<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.710> dark<00:05:48.590> so

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
these top mounted LEDs do in the dark so

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.740 
these top mounted LEDs do in the dark so
from<00:05:49.890> above<00:05:50.190> you<00:05:50.490> can<00:05:50.700> see<00:05:50.940> I'm<00:05:51.090> no<00:05:51.240> problem

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
from above you can see I'm no problem

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.790 
from above you can see I'm no problem
that's<00:05:51.960> for<00:05:52.200> sure

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.230 

bright<00:05:55.800> white<00:05:56.130> headlight<00:05:56.760> there<00:05:57.000> in<00:05:57.150> the

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
bright white headlight there in the

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.350 
bright white headlight there in the
front<00:05:57.540> I<00:05:58.340> don't<00:05:59.340> know<00:05:59.460> if<00:05:59.580> it'll<00:05:59.730> show<00:06:00.060> up<00:06:00.180> on

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
front I don't know if it'll show up on

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.600 
front I don't know if it'll show up on
video<00:06:00.900> or<00:06:01.080> not<00:06:01.320> but<00:06:01.620> you<00:06:01.710> can<00:06:01.860> kind<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.340> see

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
video or not but you can kind of see

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.020 
video or not but you can kind of see
that<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.840> LEDs<00:06:04.470> reflecting<00:06:05.460> off<00:06:05.700> of<00:06:05.940> the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
that the LEDs reflecting off of the

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.840 
that the LEDs reflecting off of the
props<00:06:06.420> you<00:06:06.750> see<00:06:07.170> that<00:06:07.440> more<00:06:07.830> than<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.280> do

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
props you see that more than you do

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.750 
props you see that more than you do
the<00:06:09.360> LEDs<00:06:09.870> themselves<00:06:10.200> you<00:06:11.040> just<00:06:11.220> kind<00:06:11.430> of<00:06:11.490> see

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
the LEDs themselves you just kind of see

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.920 
the LEDs themselves you just kind of see
the<00:06:12.030> light<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:12.510> shines<00:06:13.110> on<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:13.650> props<00:06:14.930> so

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
the light that shines on the props so

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.830 
the light that shines on the props so
kind<00:06:16.200> of<00:06:16.350> weird<00:06:16.650> call<00:06:17.190> to<00:06:17.550> mount<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:18.060> LEDs<00:06:18.570> on

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
kind of weird call to mount the LEDs on

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.620 
kind of weird call to mount the LEDs on
the<00:06:18.960> top<00:06:19.200> like<00:06:19.530> that<00:06:20.030> so<00:06:21.030> I<00:06:21.090> don't<00:06:21.300> know<00:06:21.390> if<00:06:21.510> I

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
the top like that so I don't know if I

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.570 
the top like that so I don't know if I
would<00:06:21.780> call<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:22.230> a<00:06:22.290> night<00:06:22.680> flyer<00:06:23.070> I<00:06:23.100> think

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
would call this a night flyer I think

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.850 
would call this a night flyer I think
it'd<00:06:23.730> be<00:06:23.760> way<00:06:24.180> too<00:06:24.240> likely<00:06:25.200> to<00:06:25.680> lose

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
it'd be way too likely to lose

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.640 
it'd be way too likely to lose
orientation<00:06:27.200> because<00:06:28.200> you<00:06:28.350> can<00:06:28.500> only

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
orientation because you can only

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:35.030 
orientation because you can only
sometimes<00:06:29.340> see<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:30.330> LEDs<00:06:30.840> well<00:06:33.500> alright<00:06:34.530> take

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
sometimes see the LEDs well alright take

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.440 
sometimes see the LEDs well alright take
it<00:06:35.190> in<00:06:35.310> for<00:06:35.490> a<00:06:35.520> landing<00:06:35.670> I<00:06:35.910> think<00:06:36.090> that<00:06:36.300> was<00:06:36.420> a

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
it in for a landing I think that was a

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.650 
it in for a landing I think that was a
pretty<00:06:36.780> good<00:06:37.050> demo<00:06:38.090> nice<00:06:39.090> good<00:06:39.480> nice<00:06:39.900> landing

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
pretty good demo nice good nice landing

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.090 
pretty good demo nice good nice landing
alright<00:06:42.660> well<00:06:42.840> that's<00:06:42.960> that<00:06:43.230> that's<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.770> Syma

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
alright well that's that that's the Syma

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.510 
alright well that's that that's the Syma
x12<00:06:44.760> Nano<00:06:45.590> pretty<00:06:46.590> cool<00:06:46.860> if<00:06:47.040> it<00:06:47.190> weren't<00:06:47.400> for

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
x12 Nano pretty cool if it weren't for

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.490 
x12 Nano pretty cool if it weren't for
that<00:06:47.760> y'all<00:06:48.090> if<00:06:48.330> it<00:06:48.510> had<00:06:48.660> a<00:06:48.690> little<00:06:48.870> bit<00:06:49.020> faster

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
that y'all if it had a little bit faster
