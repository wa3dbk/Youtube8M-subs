actually<00:04:57.220> wanted<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.550> deviances<00:04:58.150> didn't<00:04:58.390> get

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
actually wanted the deviances didn't get

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.900 
actually wanted the deviances didn't get
the<00:04:58.540> timing<00:04:58.960> either<00:04:59.800> way<00:04:59.950> still<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.520> chance<00:05:00.790> to

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
the timing either way still a chance to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.290 
the timing either way still a chance to
camera<00:05:01.210> view<00:05:01.240> Oh
