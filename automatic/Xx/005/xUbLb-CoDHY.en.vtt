00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.559
 yes hello people throat I want you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.260
 Show me what to test today 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:14.010
 has provided and that is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.139
 a smart socket fritz covers 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.119
 200 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.330
 and that goes to the fritz box 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.000
 pair and filter different 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.039
 functions on the one hand is simply one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.330
 manually switchable sockets 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.510
 you can then over the fritz box 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.439
 Surface on and off 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.999
 but the whole thing can be done 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.699
 switch automatically 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:38.460
 there it is one, so to speak 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.379
 Timer and the third function 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.780
 is that measure current 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.010
 You can also use this outlet as 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.010
 use ammeter 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:54.949
 he is opening the box is a little 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:56.969
 handbook to the socket itself 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.359
 and that's it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.049
 So in the box now nothing in it 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.520
 except the socket it also needs 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 Not 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.720
 The name already reveals that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.910
 outlet works via the dect 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 standard and radio to fritz box therefore 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:22.410
 There are no other cables or plugs 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.600
 necessary in front are two push buttons, too 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.300
 as led act once to manual 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.480
 Turn off the power and once 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:35.430
 to make the dect connection so 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.770
 I now have the initial coupling with 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.820
 the fritz box ever completed 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.640
 and show you how it works 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.250
 looks in action gives me 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.250
 first in the socket catches the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.860
 ceiling light to blink that means 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.460
 the socket is trying now by 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.900
 Covers the signal at the fritzbox 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.720
 that worked out now as well 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.690
 brings more 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.440
 and we can talk about the fritz now 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.460
 surface the socket manually 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.070
 turn off 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.470
 click additionally you can now 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.710
 set the automatic switch 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.510
 It looks like this here weekly 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.490
 is the classic the classic one 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.890
 Timer where we just say 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.180
 can from this period to this 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.190
 stays on 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.920
 otherwise you can stay here in the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.700
 Setting the quarter hour segments 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.160
 Classic timer daily 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.500
 then turn off the classic by chance 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.870
 holiday circuit the burglars think 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.860
 nobody who at home what I then 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.810
 I like it here 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.300
 you can turn astronomical here 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.600
 specify its latitude degree of longitude 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.730
 and then depending on the sunrise and 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.940
 sunset this outlet 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.940
 switched 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.900
 Another option is the find calendar 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.209
 I am very funny and can be a google 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.910
 specify calendar and so has the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.030
 possibility of external this outlet 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.250
 to turn on a google calendar 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.060
 I think that's a smart idea 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.160
 other functions are now here 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.160
 just the light on again 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.110
 you go here on energy and there you can 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.060
 here too the energy consumption 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.620
 Posted pretty watch 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.110
 comfortable even you can see it here 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.420
 how much watts have flowed and how much 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:37.750
 volt on abutment 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:42.630
 he consumes here 232 and watt 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.630
 we have consumption here 25 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.739
 These were the functionalities that I have 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.170
 you wanted to show you, of course you can 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.239
 Switch directly to the socket 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.980
 This covers the connection 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.829
 holding a socket is a dect ule 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.650
 connection pole stands for ultra 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.069
 low energy power consumption of this 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.840
 outlet is also only 0.7 is one 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.180
 which is somewhat puzzling when testing 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.170
 has, however, lukewarm is in 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.870
 Area of ​​the chip and the relay 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.889
 software-based gear still guarantees a lot 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.829
 to be delivered by update this 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.539
 outlet is expected to be on the market in 2013 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.539
 and should cost 50 euros
