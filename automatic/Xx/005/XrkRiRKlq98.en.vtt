that in the future and still have it on
the<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.219> estimate<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.790> example<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.240> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the on the estimate now for example if I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.980 
the on the estimate now for example if I
just<00:02:03.600> press<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.939> plus<00:02:05.939> button<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.630> comes<00:02:06.869> up

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
just press the plus button it comes up

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.050 
just press the plus button it comes up
on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:08.039> right<00:02:08.190> hand<00:02:08.429> side<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.640> say<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
on the the right hand side to say that

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.999 
on the the right hand side to say that
that's<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> preset<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.289> whenever<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.649> press

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that's the preset so whenever I press

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.920 
that's the preset so whenever I press
the<00:02:11.340> button<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the button it's going to go on to that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.690 
the button it's going to go on to that
and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.540 
and
if<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.940> do<00:02:14.000> brush<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.560> add<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.099> as<00:02:16.280> well<00:02:16.310> that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
if I do brush if I add that as well that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.630 
if I do brush if I add that as well that
would<00:02:16.970> be<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.090> green<00:02:17.420> brush<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.019> then

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
would be a green brush and then

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.009 
would be a green brush and then
basically<00:02:19.640> means<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.000> if<00:02:20.300> I'm<00:02:20.540> writing<00:02:20.900> with

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
basically means that if I'm writing with

basically means that if I'm writing with
this<00:02:21.140> off<00:02:21.319> if<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.560> press<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.830> button

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
he'll chain to that one and then just to

obviously<00:03:13.239> erase<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:15.769> array<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.250> like<00:03:16.430> a

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
obviously erase the array is like a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.250 
obviously erase the array is like a
standard<00:03:17.030> one<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.540> wouldn't<00:03:17.840> be<00:03:17.900> able<00:03:18.139> to

either you don't need to set that up as
a<00:03:19.639> preset<00:03:20.150> or<00:03:20.299> anything<00:03:20.569> like<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:20.870> if<00:03:21.769> it

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
reaches the end of the presets and you

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.900 
reaches the end of the presets and you

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.470 
obviously when you put the s-pen onto
the<00:03:59.870> screen<00:04:00.620> then<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.910> is<00:04:02.030> kind<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.269> like<00:04:02.420> a

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
the screen then this is kind of like a

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.569 
the screen then this is kind of like a
preview<00:04:02.750> window<00:04:03.139> so<00:04:03.829> when<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.069> select<00:04:04.400> it

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
preview window so when you select it

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.839 
preview window so when you select it
you'll<00:04:04.910> select<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.450> color<00:04:06.099> converse<00:04:07.099> or<00:04:07.700> the

you'll select the color converse or the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.830 
you'll select the color converse or the
colors<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:11.150> wouldn't<00:04:11.389> be<00:04:11.450> able<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.690> obviously

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
colors you wouldn't be able to obviously

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.129 
colors you wouldn't be able to obviously
go<00:04:12.319> off<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.549> canvas<00:04:13.910> itself<00:04:14.269> as<00:04:14.569> you<00:04:14.959> saw

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
go off the canvas itself as you saw

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.900 
go off the canvas itself as you saw
there<00:04:15.380> when<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.650> selected<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.160> record<00:04:16.549> start

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
there when I selected the record start

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.569 
there when I selected the record start
recording<00:04:17.359> but<00:04:18.349> obviously<00:04:18.799> if<00:04:19.070> you're

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
recording but obviously if you're

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.899 
recording but obviously if you're
working<00:04:19.940> with<00:04:20.060> something<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:21.490> color<00:04:22.490> palette

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
working with something a color palette

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.330 
working with something a color palette
that<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.330> maybe<00:04:23.810> don't<00:04:24.409> have<00:04:24.590> or<00:04:25.039> you're

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
that you maybe don't have or you're

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.160 
that you maybe don't have or you're
finding<00:04:25.700> it<00:04:25.820> hard<00:04:26.150> to<00:04:26.300> kind

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
finding it hard to kind

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.860 
finding it hard to kind
match<00:04:27.710> colors<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.820> are<00:04:29.420> in<00:04:29.480> the<00:04:29.690> picture

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
match colors that are in the picture

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.230 
match colors that are in the picture
that<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.200> may<00:04:30.410> be<00:04:30.470> changing<00:04:31.460> for<00:04:31.730> some<00:04:31.790> reason

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
that you may be changing for some reason

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.170 
that you may be changing for some reason
then<00:04:32.630> this<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.200> very<00:04:33.530> very<00:04:33.890> useful<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.490> was<00:04:34.640> a

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
then this is very very useful it was a

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.810 
then this is very very useful it was a
bit<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.840> pain<00:04:36.110> before<00:04:36.650> when<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:37.100> were

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
bit of a pain before when you were

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.880 
bit of a pain before when you were
trying<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.300> maybe<00:04:38.590> mimic<00:04:39.590> rather<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.990> picture

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
trying to maybe mimic rather a picture

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.490 
trying to maybe mimic rather a picture
and<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.640> couldn't<00:04:44.030> because<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.990> was<00:04:45.260> it

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
and you couldn't because it was it

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.780 
and you couldn't because it was it
didn't<00:04:45.770> look<00:04:45.860> right<00:04:46.070> because<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.580> color

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
didn't look right because the color

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.910 
didn't look right because the color
palette<00:04:47.150> wasn't<00:04:47.510> wasn't<00:04:47.960> there<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:48.380> this<00:04:48.800> is

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
palette wasn't wasn't there so this is

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.300 
palette wasn't wasn't there so this is
definitely<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.940> thumbs<00:04:50.630> up<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.170> my<00:04:51.890> point<00:04:52.160> of
