00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
is one I like looking a lot of winter

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.220 
is one I like looking a lot of winter
time<00:00:20.090> as<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.449> there's<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> lot<00:00:22.140> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
time as you can see there's a lot of

time as you can see there's a lot of
content<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.800> there<00:00:23.010> there's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> lot<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> images

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
content on there there's a lot of images

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.500 
content on there there's a lot of images
on<00:00:24.000> there<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:25.019> sort<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:26.510> layout

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
on there and this sort of layout

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.109 
on there and this sort of layout
wouldn't<00:00:28.080> look<00:00:28.980> particularly<00:00:29.310> good<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
wouldn't look particularly good on on a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.620 
wouldn't look particularly good on on a
mobile<00:00:30.420> phone<00:00:30.769> now<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:31.980> site<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
mobile phone now this site is a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.900 
mobile phone now this site is a
combination<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.980> manually<00:00:35.340> select<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
combination you can manually select a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.670 
combination you can manually select a
mobile<00:00:36.540> version<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> side<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> saucer

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
mobile version on the side but a saucer

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.360 
mobile version on the side but a saucer
adaptive<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> means<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.340> view<00:00:41.340> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
adaptive so that means if you view it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.389 
adaptive so that means if you view it
with<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> mobile<00:00:42.390> device<00:00:42.840> such<00:00:43.739> as<00:00:43.770> an<00:00:44.129> iPhone

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
with a mobile device such as an iPhone

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.729 
with a mobile device such as an iPhone
or<00:00:44.850> iPad<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.920> automatically<00:00:47.760> display<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
or iPad it automatically display the

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.229 
or iPad it automatically display the
content<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.010> optimized<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.850> device

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
content that's optimized for that device

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
content that's optimized for that device
so<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.489> have<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:55.100> an

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so if we have a look here this is an

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.080 
so if we have a look here this is an
iPhone<00:00:56.489> 4<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.910> content<00:00:59.910> that's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
iPhone 4 and this is the content that's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.630 
iPhone 4 and this is the content that's
been<00:01:00.239> optimized<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.870> mobile<00:01:01.440> devices<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.550> as

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
been optimized for mobile devices so as

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.870 
been optimized for mobile devices so as
you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.570> quite<00:01:03.780> different<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you can see it's quite different the the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.500 
you can see it's quite different the the
layout<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.350> much<00:01:07.830> better<00:01:08.010> suits<00:01:08.510> mobile

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
layout is much better suits mobile

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.100 
layout is much better suits mobile
devices<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.040> navigation<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
devices and the navigation is more like

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.760 
devices and the navigation is more like
an<00:01:13.380> 8<00:01:13.710> native<00:01:14.460> navigation<00:01:15.180> use<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.810> mobile

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
an 8 native navigation use on mobile

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.830 
an 8 native navigation use on mobile
phones<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.580> such<00:01:18.030> life<00:01:19.220> now<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> other<00:01:21.000> type

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
phones and such life now the other type

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.359 
phones and such life now the other type
of<00:01:23.060> design<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.299> responsive<00:01:24.479> design<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.369> where

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
of design is responsive design so where

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.080 
of design is responsive design so where
you<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> look<00:01:27.080> at<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.460> WordPress<00:01:29.460> site

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you have a look at this WordPress site

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.649 
you have a look at this WordPress site
here<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.829> again<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> looks<00:01:33.450> like

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
here so again that's what it looks like

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.630 
here so again that's what it looks like
on<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.409> normal<00:01:35.720> sized<00:01:36.720> screen<00:01:37.189> but<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
on a normal sized screen but with a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.660 
on a normal sized screen but with a
responsive<00:01:39.360> design<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.600> actual<00:01:43.670> content

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
responsive design the actual content

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
responsive design the actual content
doesn't<00:01:45.119> doesn't<00:01:45.570> change<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
doesn't doesn't change at all it just

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.940 
doesn't doesn't change at all it just
responds<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> width<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.350> browser<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
responds to the width of the browser so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.210 
responds to the width of the browser so
if<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.250> move<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.119> browser<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.100> see

if I move this browser in as you can see

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520 
if I move this browser in as you can see
here<00:01:53.460> we've<00:01:53.640> got<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:54.000> menus<00:01:54.570> across<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
here we've got these menus across the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.209 
here we've got these menus across the
top<00:01:55.740> here<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:57.060> as<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.619> squeeze<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> bit

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
top here but as I squeeze it in a bit

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.319 
top here but as I squeeze it in a bit
that<00:01:59.430> turns<00:02:00.210> into<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.920> drop<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:02.759> navigation

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
that turns into a drop down navigation

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.319 
that turns into a drop down navigation
which<00:02:03.780> better<00:02:04.229> suits<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.280> narrower<00:02:05.579> devices

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
scale yeah when it's a bit wider you can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.520 
scale yeah when it's a bit wider you can
fit
