 I'm working because to you a server 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.940
 minecraft thrown in the room 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.200
 dragon bar television the truth is that 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.050
 we have been working on this for several months 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.180
 project and good has been nothing easy but 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.520
 I have to admit that it was worth it 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.080
 thanks live and put 92 which has been 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.550
 charged with buying the dedicated to 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.380
 This server 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.950

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 everyone 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.910
 Many of you already know this server but 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.470
 others will say what the server is going 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.120
 must be done 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.880
 the server consists of different modes 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.560
 of game both survival and pvp what 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.570
 That means that on the one hand 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.570
 I would have survival to get 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.310
 materials build your house 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.350
 tools etc 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.190
 and on the other hand also in different 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.600
 areas can be made pvp 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.219
 we also have the possibility of 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.829
 perform different events both of 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.570
 agility combat speed is ingenuity e 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.700
 even of questions in which they will be 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.100
 awarded with different objects 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.960
 besides we will always be inside 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 of the server since dragon ball creative 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
 there is no end every time they arise 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.610
 new ideas and that takes them to new 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.120
 new events scenarios awards and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.670
 a long etcetera 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.580
 as you can see this area is the stadium 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.120
 tenkaichi budokai tenkaichi where 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.010
 will perform a type of pvp event also 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.350
 you can enter the platform and fight 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.860
 dv but be careful what you see in 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.860
 the pockets 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.710
 as you can see it is in the entrance and 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.650
 there will be two different types of input 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 so to speak we will have on the one hand the 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.490
 of visitors who will not be able to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.230
 fight will go up to the clear and not them 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.760
 they can attack without any danger 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.220
 then we will have the entrance of the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.660
 fighters where the warriors more 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.930
 brave will be prepared to enter the 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.930
 pallet 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.090
 and good as you can see there are some 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.500
 things that even I am 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.379
 surprising because this was no longer 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 with which what I have told you does not stop 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.310
 to build things and is that the truth 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.709
 this has no end the truth I do not know 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.659
 even what is this going to be since it looks 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.069
 that they did last night did not have there 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.620
