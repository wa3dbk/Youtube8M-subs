yourself so technically it will be you
on<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> jet<00:02:46.770> pack<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.160> some<00:02:47.430> sort<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.670> loose

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
on a jet pack in some sort of loose

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.210 
on a jet pack in some sort of loose
nation<00:02:48.210> or<00:02:48.360> dream<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.080> whatever<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.470> do<00:02:49.680> will

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
nation or dream so whatever you do will

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.040 
nation or dream so whatever you do will
not<00:02:50.250> actually<00:02:50.520> take<00:02:51.000> place<00:02:51.240> in<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.600> game<00:02:51.810> and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
not actually take place in the game and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.330 
not actually take place in the game and
of<00:02:52.350> course<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.740> will<00:02:52.890> only<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.310> in

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
of course this will only be in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.460 
of course this will only be in
single-player<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.450> can't<00:02:54.810> actually<00:02:55.050> do

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
single-player so you can't actually do

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.560 
single-player so you can't actually do
any<00:02:55.680> damage<00:02:55.950> within<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.490> game<00:02:56.700> itself<00:02:57.060> where

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
any damage within the game itself where

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.940 
any damage within the game itself where
the<00:02:57.600> jet<00:02:57.870> pack<00:02:58.080> which<00:02:58.320> means<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.710> would<00:02:58.800> just

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the jet pack which means it would just

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.560 
the jet pack which means it would just
be<00:02:59.040> one<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.250> really<00:02:59.520> cool<00:02:59.610> experience<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:00.270> have

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
be one of really cool experience to have

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.210 
be one of really cool experience to have
in<00:03:00.780> single-player<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.740> would<00:03:01.830> be<00:03:01.920> really

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
in single-player and it would be really

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.130 
in single-player and it would be really
nice<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.910> Rockstar<00:03:03.390> interacting<00:03:03.960> and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
nice to see Rockstar interacting and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.570 
nice to see Rockstar interacting and
giving<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> community<00:03:04.830> what<00:03:05.040> they<00:03:05.190> really

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
giving the community what they really

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.420 
giving the community what they really
really<00:03:06.180> want<00:03:06.390> over<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> past<00:03:07.140> year<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.160> few

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
Rockstar teased this jetpack everywhere

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.150 
Rockstar teased this jetpack everywhere
through<00:03:15.930> Easter<00:03:16.320> eggs<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.860> they've<00:03:17.010> also

given us tons and tons of teasers within

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.230 
given us tons and tons of teasers within
the<00:03:19.620> game<00:03:19.830> they<00:03:20.160> could<00:03:20.430> actually<00:03:20.670> be<00:03:21.030> hinting

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
the game they could actually be hinting

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.470 
the game they could actually be hinting
towards<00:03:21.750> d-27<00:03:22.620> at<00:03:22.830> 27<00:03:23.340> PLA<00:03:23.670> plants<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.270> once

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
towards d-27 at 27 PLA plants and once

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.460 
towards d-27 at 27 PLA plants and once
we<00:03:24.630> do<00:03:24.750> end<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:24.960> collecting<00:03:25.200> them<00:03:25.380> all

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
we do end up collecting them all

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.410 
we do end up collecting them all
hopefully<00:03:26.190> we<00:03:26.520> will<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.150> hallucination

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
hopefully we will get this hallucination

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.420 
hopefully we will get this hallucination
