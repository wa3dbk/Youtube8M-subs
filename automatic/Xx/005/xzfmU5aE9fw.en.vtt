00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the question is the following in sir 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.560
 possibility of the waters of the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.349
 oceans and seas are the flood and the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.490
 singing system that is not us 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 You know it's over but the flood is over. 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 there then what is here in jesus nazareth 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.080
 Second Step Chapter 2 verse 5 says 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.820
 so god did not spare the ancient world 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.820
 when he brought the flood upon that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.790
 wicked people but saved Noah a preacher of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.300
 justice and seven others also 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.570
 condemned city sodom and gomorrah 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.410
 reducing them by becoming the example 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 of what would come and then he says so 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.420
 The world that exists today has been 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:55.440
 waters and was created by the well 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:59.520
 the text is speaking that the world today 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 was removed from the waters and not the opposite 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.060
 the world was not land and god's people 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.380
 water the world was water and water god made 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.869
 comes the land so I believe that the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.570
 of the seas we have today are not 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.890
 of the flood because the flood was something already 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.750
 posterior 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.159
 I believe that the waters of the seas that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 we have today are those narrated in 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.409
 Genesis 1 When the Bible says and says 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.560
 God make your seas 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.159
 God made the seas in truth what 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.979
 happened was that the land emerged was already 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.920
 all water and God then brought 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.650
 continents climbed up to the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 geological is this obvious that got me and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.670
 I 'm next I do not believe the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 The waters of today are of the flood because 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.790
 Bible says the earth came out of the water 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.479
 then the waters of today are prior to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.250
 again the water of the flood rose very 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.040
 high above the highest mountain of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.710
 land but then she returned to the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.469
 your previous level , or the level you 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.439
 God had done there in creation in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.300
 Genesis chapter one such 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.160
 biblical curiosities when they are 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.970
 possible to be answered by the text 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.680
 we respond 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.150
 many of these questions do not even have 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.280
 how to respond 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.130
 simply because we do not have so 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.170
 in the word of God nothing that answers a 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.510
 doubt but in this case we have this 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.800
 Back to top of the page up there ^ 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.860
 For me, this question I'm going to try 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.680
 answer here in the light of the word 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.860
