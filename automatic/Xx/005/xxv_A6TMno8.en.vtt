and this is half-inch bar stock that's
welded<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> way<00:01:08.340> around<00:01:08.670> there's<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
welded all the way around there's a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.550 
welded all the way around there's a
about<00:01:10.760> three<00:01:11.760> sixteenths<00:01:12.510> tread<00:01:13.170> plate<00:01:13.409> on

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
about three sixteenths tread plate on

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
about three sixteenths tread plate on
the<00:01:13.680> top<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:15.020> welded<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.770> way

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the top that is welded all the way

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.060 
the top that is welded all the way
around<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.520> support<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.470> then<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> goes<00:01:19.770> up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
around for support and then it goes up

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.950 
around for support and then it goes up
and<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:21.060> kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.950> contours<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and just kind of contours there the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.330 
and just kind of contours there the
wheel<00:01:25.170> well<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:29.009> looks

pretty good and you can see where the
old<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:34.140> old<00:01:34.170> part<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> frame<00:01:34.920> used<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
old the old part of the frame used to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.910 
old the old part of the frame used to
come<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.329> way<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> no

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
come all the way down to here and it no

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.240 
come all the way down to here and it no
longer<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> pretty<00:01:40.560> happy<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
looks good also have the hard labor

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.980 
looks good also have the hard labor
Creek<00:01:45.869> tire<00:01:46.170> carrier<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.509> it's<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.750> cool

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
Creek tire carrier and it's really cool

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
Creek tire carrier and it's really cool
I<00:01:49.350> welded<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.310> spindle<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I welded this spindle on here and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.620 
I welded this spindle on here and
wrapped<00:01:52.530> tread<00:01:53.220> plate<00:01:53.460> around<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.210> took

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
wrapped tread plate around it that took

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.310 
wrapped tread plate around it that took
a<00:01:54.720> long<00:01:54.930> time<00:01:56.240> anyway<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:57.960> uses<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
a long time anyway so it uses a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.719 
a long time anyway so it uses a
parallelogram<00:01:59.250> right<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.649> basically<00:02:01.729> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
parallelogram right here basically to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.100 
parallelogram right here basically to
swing<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:06.350> probably<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.469> about<00:02:07.619> oh

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
swing out and probably have about oh

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.110 
swing out and probably have about oh

other stuff like this tubing in the mesh

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.009 
other stuff like this tubing in the mesh
I<00:02:55.860> just<00:02:56.700> pretty<00:02:56.910> much<00:02:57.000> got<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.300> for<00:02:57.750> free

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
I just pretty much got that for free

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.589 
I just pretty much got that for free
because<00:02:58.230> they<00:02:58.440> gave<00:02:59.159> it<00:02:59.340> away<00:02:59.430> when<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.120> went<00:03:00.420> in

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.470 
I think it takes the most time is all
