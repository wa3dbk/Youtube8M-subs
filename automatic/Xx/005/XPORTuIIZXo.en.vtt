broke and this this summer not that it

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.060 
broke and this this summer not that it
all<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.840> me<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.289> them<00:00:28.439> stick<00:00:28.680> mixes<00:00:28.980> I've

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
all in me is all them stick mixes I've

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.980 
all in me is all them stick mixes I've
made<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.849> know<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> makes

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
made in it like you know but it makes

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.190 
made in it like you know but it makes
them<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.560> know<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:32.030> could<00:00:33.030> job<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.630> simple

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
them you know what could job so simple

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.470 
them you know what could job so simple
so<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> always<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> food

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so because I always use the food

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.180 
so because I always use the food
processor<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:37.200> mixers<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.829> always<00:00:38.010> been

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
processor my mixers have always been

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
processor my mixers have always been
really<00:00:38.399> milled<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:39.750> fine

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
really milled you know really fine

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.520 
really milled you know really fine
powder<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.780> I've<00:00:43.110> used<00:00:43.320> them<00:00:43.500> like

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
powder and and I've used them like

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
powder and and I've used them like
compress<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:44.489> massively<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.239> try<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
compress them massively and try to to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.020 
compress them massively and try to to
get<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> too<00:00:46.500> big<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:47.070> integral<00:00:47.520> part<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
get it too big in an integral part of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
get it too big in an integral part of
how<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> reed<00:00:48.539> works<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.079> know<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> cast

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
how the reed works you know how you cast

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.529 
how the reed works you know how you cast
the<00:00:49.829> rig<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.219> laid<00:00:50.399> itself<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the rig out it laid itself out and it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
the rig out it laid itself out and it
broke<00:00:51.750> down<00:00:51.809> over<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> hook<00:00:52.710> clink<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
broke down over the hook clink and the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.310 
broke down over the hook clink and the
hook<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.570> went<00:00:54.750> into<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.079> almost

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
hook you know I went into it almost

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
hook you know I went into it almost
scientifically<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.370> did<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.940> much

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
scientifically because I did it so much

know what I need to stick mix here so
I've<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.159> few<00:01:23.340> bits<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> motor

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
I've got a few bits in the motor

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.380 
I've got a few bits in the motor
so<00:01:24.210> anyway<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:26.390> some

this<00:06:14.600> palette<00:06:14.930> really<00:06:15.200> well<00:06:15.380> I<00:06:15.650> can<00:06:16.040> get<00:06:16.220> like

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
this palette really well I can get like

this palette really well I can get like
five<00:06:16.580> or<00:06:16.730> six<00:06:16.760> wheel<00:06:17.120> backs<00:06:17.390> before<00:06:17.570> all<00:06:17.750> that

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
five or six wheel backs before all that

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.390 
five or six wheel backs before all that
was<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.050> break<00:06:18.260> away<00:06:18.410> from<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:18.770> reef<00:06:18.920> so<00:06:19.100> I'm

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
was to break away from the reef so I'm

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.670 
was to break away from the reef so I'm
going<00:06:19.580> don't<00:06:19.990> don't<00:06:21.220> but<00:06:22.220> a<00:06:23.410> little<00:06:24.410> bits

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
going don't don't but a little bits

estimate<00:06:25.160> that's<00:06:25.490> MIT<00:06:25.670> that's<00:06:25.820> me<00:06:25.940> by<00:06:26.090> and

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
estimate that's MIT that's me by and

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.000 
estimate that's MIT that's me by and
this<00:06:26.390> exactly<00:06:26.720> what<00:06:26.810> I<00:06:26.870> did<00:06:27.020> yesterday<00:06:27.140> and

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
this exactly what I did yesterday and

this exactly what I did yesterday and
that's<00:06:28.460> how<00:06:28.550> I<00:06:28.580> caught<00:06:28.820> me<00:06:28.940> carp<00:06:29.440> so<00:06:30.440> there<00:06:30.560> you

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
that's how I caught me carp so there you

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.320 
that's how I caught me carp so there you
go<00:06:30.800> stick<00:06:31.250> fishing<00:06:31.610> you<00:06:31.790> know<00:06:31.880> really<00:06:32.180> easy

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330

but<00:06:32.750> you<00:06:33.470> know<00:06:33.560> you<00:06:33.620> have<00:06:33.860> to<00:06:33.950> give<00:06:34.070> it<00:06:34.160> a

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
but you know you have to give it a

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.260 
but you know you have to give it a
little<00:06:34.340> bit<00:06:34.490> of<00:06:34.610> thought<00:06:34.700> more<00:06:34.970> thought<00:06:35.180> you

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
little bit of thought more thought you

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.640
