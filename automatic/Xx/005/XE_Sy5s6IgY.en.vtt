00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.420
 all right 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.570
 and in 1923 in Tokyo a huge tornado of 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.110
 fire swept through the city taking away 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.629
 38 thousand people taking the life of 38 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.500
 thousand people today I come to talk about 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.120
 of one of the most natural phenomena 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.460
 dangerous that you can find 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.100
 they call swirls of fire or tornadoes 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.330
 fire are like normal tornadoes 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.379
 but fire with what that implies 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.090
 they are usually generated through 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.180
 large fire fires 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.369
 forestry to carry out a 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.780
 fire of these characteristics is 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.300
 necessary to meet in certain 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.610
 conditions it is necessary that they have 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.780
 strong that there are strong currents of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.030
 wind that collide and generate that kind 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.830
 of fire swirl normally the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.940
 most common swirls usually have as 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.840
 maximum 50 meters high 2 meters 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.780
 wide and have the capacity to devastate 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.880
 the best as a whole neighborhood but 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.040
 there are swirls of fire that can come 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.290
 at a height of one thousand meters a 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.170
 kilometer high can reach a 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.500
 kilometer high and devastate a 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.560
 entire city 38 thousand people died 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.170
 by this swirl of fire it is not only 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.970
 the theme of the swirl of fire from 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.210
 be right next to the whirlpool of 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.369
 fire but the swirl of fire 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.490
 generates a kind of expansive wave of 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.780
 heat that goes 160 kilometers per hour 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.420
 that burns absolutely everything that is 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.150
 near him 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 the whirlwinds of fire in case it 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.950
 See, it's very important to get 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.500
 extremely far from these eddies 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.930
 because if it's not like that even if you're not 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.780
 within the whirlpool the currents 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.209
 fiery air that move and that 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.520
 are generated by this swirl of 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.670
 fire can get to incinerate you in 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.000
 question of seconds 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.730
 very important is to take precautions 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.959
 of injuries when there is a fire and 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 keep in mind that this of the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.000
 swirls of fire even if strange 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.790
 even if it is a strange event it can 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.790
 happen and it can take thousands of lives
