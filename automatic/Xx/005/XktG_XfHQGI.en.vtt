00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
straight remake of the sissy spacek

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.990 
straight remake of the sissy spacek
version<00:04:34.620> because<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.430> know<00:04:35.520> there<00:04:35.670> was<00:04:35.790> you

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
version because you know there was you

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.700 
version because you know there was you
know<00:04:36.090> they<00:04:36.240> show<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:36.630> mother<00:04:36.810> being<00:04:37.410> of

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
know they show the mother being of

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.200 
know they show the mother being of

course being super religious and stuff
and<00:04:39.420> but<00:04:40.170> I<00:04:40.200> think<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.830> difference<00:04:41.160> in<00:04:41.430> this

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
and but I think the difference in this

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.220 
and but I think the difference in this
one<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.210> other<00:04:42.390> one<00:04:42.480> this<00:04:42.780> one<00:04:42.960> seems

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
one and the other one this one seems

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.690 
one and the other one this one seems
like<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.910> can<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.360> specific<00:04:45.900> version<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:47.580> know

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
like I can the specific version you know

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.830 
like I can the specific version you know
she<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:49.500> know<00:04:49.560> she<00:04:49.770> I<00:04:50.240> think<00:04:51.240> she<00:04:51.420> found<00:04:51.690> out

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
she you know she I think she found out

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.020 
she you know she I think she found out
that<00:04:51.900> she<00:04:52.050> knew<00:04:52.470> later<00:04:52.980> she<00:04:53.280> could<00:04:53.430> do<00:04:54.000> her

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.150 
classic you know scene of her getting uh
I<00:05:18.630> think<00:05:19.200> when<00:05:19.350> she<00:05:19.380> has<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.620> period<00:05:19.980> for<00:05:20.100> the

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
I think when she has a period for the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.410 
I think when she has a period for the
first<00:05:20.190> time<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.640> they<00:05:20.700> thought<00:05:20.850> the<00:05:20.970> tampons

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
first time and they thought the tampons

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.840 
first time and they thought the tampons
are<00:05:21.600> though<00:05:21.900> in<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.440> locker<00:05:22.650> room<00:05:22.890> and<00:05:23.070> then

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
are though in the locker room and then

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.880

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
and this looks good I know they people I

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:56.629 
and this looks good I know they people I
read<00:06:55.710> that<00:06:55.830> people<00:06:56.009> said<00:06:56.250> this<00:06:56.400> one<00:06:56.550> is

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
read that people said this one is

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.850 
read that people said this one is
supposed<00:06:56.729> to<00:06:56.909> be<00:06:56.969> closer<00:06:57.210> to<00:06:57.389> the<00:06:57.479> book<00:06:57.689> so<00:06:58.560> I

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
supposed to be closer to the book so I

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.439 
supposed to be closer to the book so I
guess<00:06:59.550> we'll<00:06:59.729> see<00:06:59.849> when<00:07:00.029> it<00:07:00.120> comes<00:07:00.150> out

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449 
guess we'll see when it comes out

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:01.700 
guess we'll see when it comes out
because<00:07:00.539> I<00:07:00.689> never<00:07:00.750> read<00:07:01.050> that<00:07:01.080> the<00:07:01.409> Stephen

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
because I never read that the Stephen

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.140 
because I never read that the Stephen
King<00:07:01.860> books<00:07:02.129> I<00:07:02.279> don't<00:07:02.430> know<00:07:02.520> exactly<00:07:02.639> what<00:07:03.090> the

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
King books I don't know exactly what the

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.670 
King books I don't know exactly what the
differences<00:07:03.509> were<00:07:03.569> between<00:07:03.870> that<00:07:04.439> and<00:07:04.469> that

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
differences were between that and that

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.800
