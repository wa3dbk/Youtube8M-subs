00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.600 
files is fine just make sure it's not on
a<00:02:00.659> folder<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.619> it'll<00:02:01.860> go<00:02:02.070> into<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
a folder because then it'll go into the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.240 
a folder because then it'll go into the
folder<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.570> don't<00:02:03.780> want<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.250> because

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
folder and we don't want that because

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.620 
folder and we don't want that because
that<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.759> bleed<00:02:06.119> through<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.390> lot<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that could bleed through a lot of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.979 
that could bleed through a lot of
problems<00:02:07.489> so<00:02:08.489> once<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.030> modloader

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
problems so once you have that modloader

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.460 
problems so once you have that modloader
should<00:02:10.410> be<00:02:10.530> pretty<00:02:10.679> much<00:02:10.800> ready<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> go<00:02:11.340> just
