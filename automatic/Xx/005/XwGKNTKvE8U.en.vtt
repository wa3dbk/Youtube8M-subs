00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
kind of an update from the last one I

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.870 
kind of an update from the last one I
made<00:00:11.130> month<00:00:11.820> two<00:00:12.090> months<00:00:12.330> ago<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> guess<00:00:13.880> got

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
made month two months ago I guess got

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.380 
made month two months ago I guess got
some<00:00:15.059> new<00:00:15.150> headlights<00:00:17.060> they<00:00:18.060> kind<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
some new headlights they kind of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.200 
some new headlights they kind of
restrict<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> light<00:00:19.109> coming<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.939> guess

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
restrict the light coming out so I guess

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.640
