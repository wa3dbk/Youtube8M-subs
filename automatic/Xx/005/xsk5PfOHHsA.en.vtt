00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.690
 in this episode of the basic flash course we are going to see two tools that 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.639
 they go very hand in hand and it is the tool of the hand internally the magnifying glass and not 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 I only say that they go hand in hand because we are going to see the tool of the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.939
 hand but it's true quito 20 let's see 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.789
 First of all, the magnifying glass refers to what is good for what there is 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.699
 magnifying glass to accept things we will give a 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.869
 select the route the magnifying glass we click and we approach and a way 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.600
 obvious to know that we approach is that he wants Ivan Deniz the percentage 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.970
 which we have approached here in 400% 800% thousand 602 thousand 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.519
 and good until we get there 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:43.990
 and here appears a 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.760
 good the magnifying glass not the pressure anymore because we can no longer approach 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.770
 what we can do is click here to select the one between us of the 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.600
 magnifying glass that is the opposite and if it does not reach to know we stopped being here indicated 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 kelly reduce the magnifying glass an easier way because it is not very practical is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.730
 living here to select this is simply by depressing altuna their 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.360
 keyboard we give a 'click' we equip to see what we are moving away we move away 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.740
 we move away from the loans and up to 8% and we arrived 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.650
 now the most usual with health using the magnifying glass tool our 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.660
 clicks without making pictures 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.730
 she that I mean with good pictures we're going to select here in the oval and 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.320
 create an object 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 hinojosa make a filling a slightly less prominent contour 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.960
 or that incite or merely painful is that we will approach this piece of him from the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.270
 circle what we are is a picture with the magnifying glass we give a click 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 picture and we just approached that picture that we did 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.880
 this we are going away to make another picture s3f 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.990
 Now what is the good hand for? The hand of the concessionaire going to remove a 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.860
 faster way to do it and to finish it in a more efficient way 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.280
 with the return address the magnifying glass 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.970
 it's with the space bar 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.180
 that implemented that has the tool of the hand is that never 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 takes away the tool that we have that I mean with this 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.920
 good if you have the tool of the magnifying glass and you are here if you want to move 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.160
 is the left with the hand you leave pressed with your bar space 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.120
 it's a click 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.689
 and you can move dry 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.519
 but the moment you release percent Navarre space will come back 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.829
 automatically your tool if this works for any tool by 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.159
 example if I have the morocha 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.339
 I'm drawing and that's lying move up pressed compression to 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:33.989
 the memo space bar up and then automatically without me having 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.710
 to select again the brunette 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.020
 Quito appears - Vera and woman this is because the tool of the hand and is 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.710
 a transitive tool nothing more transitive or good of this ciry atayde 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.330
 a tool other i is quite quick to use simply pressing 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.720
 that is pressed turre space you move and that is how you can use 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.590
 now other keys that team did very well with these tools are 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.009
 the tools to do is a to get away from you 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.649
 ys reduce the scenario without having to use the magnifying glass now does not allow me 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.579
 make a way to do this is by simply typing you have 100% and 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.439
 It also has 100% 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.519
 but another option being the good click here my most is the commanders key 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.100
 which is the key that are followed by the space bar 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.710
 probably on your computer is 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.069
 that key which exist followed by the space bar 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.780
 what are we going to give him that key and then number one 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.730
 that's how it takes us 100% and nothing happened because we are 100% yes we give 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.560
 click that key and then the number 2 we get closer a bit more than type 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.360
 and the number three plus number 4 400 that then asmara speed they have 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.710
 practically duplicated 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.150
 are fast ways to get closer to buy a certain size in the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.240
 scenario and well I hope that introduction to the 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.560
 magnifier tool to ideally approach the hand to move between 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.870
 the atmosphere is on stage see you in another episode of the course and do not forget
