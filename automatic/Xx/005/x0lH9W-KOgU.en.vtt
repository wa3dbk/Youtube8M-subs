opened up hours ago what's a similar
number<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.730> actually<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> theory

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
number now I actually have a theory

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.910 
number now I actually have a theory
about<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:31.410> there<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.590> actually<00:00:31.890> two

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
about actually there was actually two

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.170 
about actually there was actually two
theories<00:00:32.219> about<00:00:32.460> why<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> Mushroom<00:00:33.149> Kingdom

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
theories about why the Mushroom Kingdom

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
theories about why the Mushroom Kingdom
isn't<00:00:33.750> affected<00:00:34.110> by<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.260> Stroop<00:00:34.620> invasion

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
isn't affected by the Stroop invasion

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010 
isn't affected by the Stroop invasion
the<00:00:35.190> present<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.750> simple

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the present one of them is really simple

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.250 
the present one of them is really simple
and<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.610> well<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:39.149> mine<00:00:39.600> everyone<00:00:39.960> else's

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and that well it's mine everyone else's

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.430 
and that well it's mine everyone else's
theory<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.829> well<00:00:41.989> I'll<00:00:42.989> tell<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> after

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
theory is that well I'll tell you after

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440 
theory is that well I'll tell you after
this<00:00:43.620> fight<00:00:43.860> all<00:00:44.430> rights<00:00:44.610> holds<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> say<00:00:45.120> before

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
this fight all rights holds I say before

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.639 
this fight all rights holds I say before
was<00:00:45.570> interrupted<00:00:45.989> oh<00:00:46.110> yeah<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.500> two

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
was interrupted oh yeah there are two

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
was interrupted oh yeah there are two
theories<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.640> well<00:00:47.940> since<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> end<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
theories one is well since the end of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
theories one is well since the end of
the<00:00:49.050> game<00:00:49.110> Mario<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.800> Luigi<00:00:50.120> save<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> past

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the game Mario and Luigi save the past

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.479 
the game Mario and Luigi save the past
there's<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.289> no<00:00:52.530> point<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.010> them<00:00:53.129> even

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
there's really no point in them even

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.790 
there's really no point in them even
having<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.480> president<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> affected<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> two

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
having the president be affected and two

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
having the president be affected and two
there's<00:00:56.070> also<00:00:56.250> say<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:56.879> maybe<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
there's also say and then maybe the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
there's also say and then maybe the
shoobs<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.629> invading<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.739> mush<00:00:59.160> Kingdom<00:00:59.460> in

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
