 htv channel well I've been seeing then 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.250
 I see them is to say yes with which the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.740

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660

 I know him, well, I'm going to release them or 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.840
 application does not always download them but 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.059
 Well I decided to do the review of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 two excellent games that I consider one 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.989
 a little stressful and another post 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 totally free 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.030
 one is called amazing bridge recommended 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.160
 by gabriel oviedo and the other recommended 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.620
 by oscar omar ramÃ­rez called 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.210
 magic touch both games are going to be in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.640
 the previous description directly to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 download them just like the links from 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.060
 my social networks what came from a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.980
 page on facebook away from you for 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.140
 you do you give light and good for me 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.730
 you are recommending to and some other 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.439
 game so that I do not show in life 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.210
 imposed I sent a greeting a strong 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.890
 I embrace all of you and well, good 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 nothing more to say I invite you to you 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.130
 You can watch the full video of these 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.840
 two excellent games with this I 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.549
 dismissal and we start with the video not a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.320
 little bit of it is never bad for 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.060
 the channel and bonus I invite you to download 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.040
 the application of jose htv 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.570
 when I was video there you will be 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 appearing a notification so that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.619
 see and checks directly from 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.850
 youtube or from the same application and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.310
 well the first game that we go is 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.649
 performing is called magic touch wizards 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 for hire in this case then we're going to 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.830
 go directly on the application I have already 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.200
 played this game therefore therefore 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.320
 I have a moderate score for this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.850
 say it let's lower the volume a bit 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.970
 to show this and as for now 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.050
 we have good graphics you know is a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 nice impression what am I 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.710
 carrying basically we're going to be 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.120
 here making the symbols that we 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.220
 appear on the balloons for example 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.380
 we have a plus or minus we have a 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.050
 line shows it doing we have one of 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.590
 here chin 'low cost' htv walks with everything 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.780
 right i'm thinking i can 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 be like willy rex vegeta and all 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.310
 them there the race of youtube gamers 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.500
 from the youtube community as they can 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.979
 see here we walk with everything doing things 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.979
 salty 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.689
 ok it was a montage we made 19 mis 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.340
 best 34 kilos fill a little bit of 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.159
 money we have converted this score 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.930
 just like we can steal the ads 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.000
 to applications by the developer 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.250
 trophies scores just like that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.810
 good successes so to speak 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.970
 we have what would be the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.200
 normal spells is backgrounds for 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.760
 change the wallpaper just like 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 you can buy more inhuman coins 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.450
 here to spells, let's go here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.579
 we can buy for example this spell 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 of time does not reach us in the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.870
 budget neither in great wear nor in 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.579
 the game that we are analyzing in this 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.590
 case then we 're not going to give us all this 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.239
 let's turn off taccetti well with 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.459
 the game is pretty simple 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.470
 there's so much to explain basically 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.420
 Well, this is about the whole game as 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.370
 you can see this is the menu we have one 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 that another setting to not move music or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.909
 high as the announcements we close this and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.379
 let's play one more time you know jose 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.889
 there is to see playing 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:14.549
 we make one do one of another to a 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:17.720
 line another from another line we walk with 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.720
 all gentlemen and gentlemen 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.870
 the truth is that we are going to the best are 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.140
 what I do but when I'm not in 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.000
 They put the camera camera gives me a 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.080
 little of grief and good recently 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.270
 I discovered that 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.560
 is talking to a subscriber and and I 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.540
 I said no then you should play with 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.250
 wounds me because she 's playing and 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.080
 I suffer a lot I said that is point 2 of 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.760
 joke we want to see suffer well 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.170
 obviously I felt very bad this 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.060
 these are several you have to 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.060
 do in this case as you will see 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.879
 we go with all ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.550
 excellent excellent people what if 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.230
 you can beat my hand score is 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.290
 a screenshot via twitter 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.280
 real chitiva works or by facebook 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.230
 and well I feel that we will be 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.780
 analyzing is called amazing week and at 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.930
 game once without a doubt I consider it as 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.910
 a slightly stressful game thanks 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.590
 for showing that being touching the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.900
 screen several times either to the 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.420
 left or right to pass 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.700
 about these cubes as you can see then 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.500
 well, it's not going to be easy because then 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.360
 it seems life is not easy and games 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.730
 free of the wii play store either 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.880
 let's continue here with all the lords 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.540
 gentlemen and their children 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.090
 ladies and gentlemen the children of branches with 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.770
 all together 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.069
 way of pop in the way of hope 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.470
 record segment of 5 life boys 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:55.970
 a thousand laps today 35 stable points 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.970
 right now will make 10 or 1 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.970
 You already know that I 'm not good at games 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.210
 so you can not say they have 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.790
 they had high expectations that is to say 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.790
 I look for the truth but I think that 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.449
 I think it is worth trying at times 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.729
 let's go down and collide is not that 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.030
 it makes sense because for example this 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.340
 box have the strength to propel themselves 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.020
 but not for the strength to throw the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.229
 pictures that are there floating around doing 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.509
 nothing person as I mean or is now yes 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.880
 now yes we are going to do 10 in a row 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.759
 already after this after this 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.030
 after this we go one more time 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.160
 ladies and gentlemen the third is the good 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.700
 nothing with this, I say goodbye, sir 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.710
 we closed the joke barn 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.690
 you know that if it can be a score more 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.450
 high to mine that apparently everyone 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.000
 You can beat me in my scores because 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.910
 with a two-point score they do not send 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.160
 scores of 17 points I put scores of 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.440
 30 and scoring habit of 31 in the 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.840
 last we need to call a score 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.990
 of 120 but good 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.500
 how small is the world and apparently the 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.990
 Wild music is a bit more 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.480
 enjoy the melody the boys 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.870
 We were cheeky if you said goodbye 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.870
 Thank you
