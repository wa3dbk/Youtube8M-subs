00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
on it several times it's clean so we're

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.710 
on it several times it's clean so we're
going<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.200> feed<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.500> cable<00:02:35.860> back<00:02:36.040> through<00:02:36.720> it

going to feed the cable back through it

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.979 
going to feed the cable back through it
back<00:02:38.049> up<00:02:38.230> here<00:02:38.410> again<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:39.610> time<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.269> this<00:02:40.900> is

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
back up here again this time is this is

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:41.849 
back up here again this time is this is
what<00:02:41.110> we're<00:02:41.200> going<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.380> use<00:02:41.530> we're<00:02:41.709> going<00:02:41.739> to

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
what we're going to use we're going to

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.130 
what we're going to use we're going to
use<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> squeegee<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.269> really<00:02:43.959> neat

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
use a squeegee this is really neat

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.930 
use a squeegee this is really neat
system<00:02:44.350> because<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.040> doesn't<00:02:45.310> require<00:02:45.519> any

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
system because it doesn't require any

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.750 
system because it doesn't require any
patches<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.380> we've<00:02:47.530> all<00:02:47.680> known<00:02:47.950> we'd<00:02:48.459> rather

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
patches and we've all known we'd rather

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.360 
patches and we've all known we'd rather
had<00:02:48.970> two<00:02:49.180> larger<00:02:49.480> patches<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.260> small<00:02:50.620> or<00:02:50.950> we

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
had two larger patches to small or we

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.309 
had two larger patches to small or we
run<00:02:51.579> out<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.970> them<00:02:52.120> well<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.630> cleaning

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
run out of them well this cleaning

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.130 
run out of them well this cleaning
system<00:02:53.650> doesn't<00:02:53.829> need<00:02:54.130> any<00:02:54.459> patches<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:56.049> what

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
system doesn't need any patches so what

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.090 
system doesn't need any patches so what
we're<00:02:56.230> gonna<00:02:56.350> do<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.590> we're<00:02:56.680> going<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.859> feed<00:02:57.010> it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
we're gonna do is we're going to feed it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.710 
we're gonna do is we're going to feed it
through<00:02:57.130> here<00:02:57.700> now<00:02:57.850> this<00:02:57.970> is<00:02:58.120> very<00:02:58.180> important

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
through here now this is very important

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.900 
through here now this is very important
that<00:02:59.440> when<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.769> pull<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.100> through<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.670> pull

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
that when you pull this through you pull

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.300 
that when you pull this through you pull
it<00:03:01.000> through<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:01.660> solid<00:03:01.870> motion<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.739> don't

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
it through in one solid motion and don't

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.569 
it through in one solid motion and don't
stop<00:03:03.609> it's<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.829> solid<00:03:05.829> motion<00:03:06.190> we're

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
stop it's just one solid motion we're

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.460 
stop it's just one solid motion we're
gonna<00:03:06.670> pull<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:06.970> through<00:03:07.329> this<00:03:08.019> squeegee<00:03:08.290> is

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
gonna pull it through this squeegee is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.349 
gonna pull it through this squeegee is
going<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.680> capture<00:03:09.069> all<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.370> oils<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:10.209> you

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
going to capture all the oils and you

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:11.910 
going to capture all the oils and you
let<00:03:10.480> any<00:03:10.630> fouling<00:03:11.170> or<00:03:11.319> anything<00:03:11.560> that's<00:03:11.709> left

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
let any fouling or anything that's left

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.559 
let any fouling or anything that's left
in<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.100> barrel<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.730> gonna<00:03:13.090> pull<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.329> all<00:03:13.540> out

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
in the barrel is gonna pull it all out

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.460 
in the barrel is gonna pull it all out
so<00:03:14.109> here<00:03:14.290> we<00:03:14.380> go<00:03:14.500> gonna<00:03:14.799> pull<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.069> out<00:03:16.470> just

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
so here we go gonna pull this out just

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.020 
so here we go gonna pull this out just
like<00:03:17.560> that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
like that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.699 
like that
and<00:03:19.030> as<00:03:19.299> you<00:03:19.420> can<00:03:19.510> see<00:03:19.569> left<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:20.319> this<00:03:20.440> squeegee

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
and as you can see left on this squeegee

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.440 
and as you can see left on this squeegee
here<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.160> when<00:03:21.280> we<00:03:21.340> pull<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:21.730> out<00:03:21.850> this<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.420> a

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
here is when we pull it out this is a

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.390 
here is when we pull it out this is a
really<00:03:22.720> neat<00:03:22.930> design<00:03:23.350> because<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.920> ridges

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
really neat design because of the ridges

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.250 
really neat design because of the ridges
and<00:03:24.910> how<00:03:25.000> tight<00:03:25.299> it<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.019> first

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and how tight it is is that the first

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.530 
and how tight it is is that the first
one<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:27.190> can<00:03:27.340> see<00:03:27.519> where<00:03:27.730> most<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.359> dirt

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
one you can see where most of the dirt

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.150 
one you can see where most of the dirt
and<00:03:28.569> grime<00:03:28.750> or<00:03:29.170> any<00:03:29.319> following<00:03:29.709> that<00:03:29.829> was<00:03:29.950> left

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
and grime or any following that was left

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.069 
and grime or any following that was left
in<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.340> barrel<00:03:30.519> was<00:03:30.819> right<00:03:31.000> there<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.569> then

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
in the barrel was right there and then
