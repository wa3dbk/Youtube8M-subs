00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.110 
actually wear the part on the opposite
side<00:02:20.030> change<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.019> part<00:02:21.320> on<00:02:21.739> Anna<00:02:21.920> client<00:02:22.459> over

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
side change the part on Anna client over

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.090 
side change the part on Anna client over
to<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.420> opposite<00:02:23.870> side<00:02:23.930> now<00:02:24.769> what<00:02:24.950> we're

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
to the opposite side now what we're

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.830 
to the opposite side now what we're
doing<00:02:25.340> were<00:02:25.489> also<00:02:25.910> with<00:02:26.090> closures<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.510> have

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
doing were also with closures you have

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.170 
doing were also with closures you have
to<00:02:26.959> remember<00:02:27.320> lady<00:02:27.769> that<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.640> have<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.970> cut

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
to remember lady that you have to cut

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.420 
to remember lady that you have to cut
off<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.630> short<00:02:29.959> pieces<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.010> end<00:02:31.280> up

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
off the short pieces that I end up

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.890 
off the short pieces that I end up
closure<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.480> looks<00:02:32.629> very

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
closure so that it looks very

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.600 
closure so that it looks very
natural-looking<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.190> want<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.459> show

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
natural-looking so I just want to show

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.880 
natural-looking so I just want to show
you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.970 
you
how<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.690> through<00:02:36.720> light<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.560> pieces

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
how you go through light little pieces

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.710 
how you go through light little pieces
like<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.550> are<00:02:38.580> sticking<00:02:38.970> up<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.510> just

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
like this that are sticking up you just

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.230 
like this that are sticking up you just
basically<00:02:39.900> go<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.470> under<00:02:40.830> them<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.130> take<00:02:42.060> them

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
basically go up under them and take them

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.290 
basically go up under them and take them
off<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.950> may<00:02:44.100> take<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:44.610> longer<00:02:44.730> than

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
off it may take a little longer than

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.480 
off it may take a little longer than
normal<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:50.060> add<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.270> your<00:02:51.420> styling<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.110> time

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
normal to add to your styling the time

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.490 
normal to add to your styling the time
doing<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:53.820> time<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.840> I've<00:02:55.020> cleared<00:02:55.320> all

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
doing it one time like I've cleared all

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.150 
doing it one time like I've cleared all
of<00:02:55.530> those<00:02:55.830> once<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.910> calm<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.540> down<00:02:57.600> again

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
of those once you calm it down again

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.620 
of those once you calm it down again
you're<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.790> couple<00:03:00.330> more<00:03:00.570> and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
you're going to see a couple more and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.540 
you're going to see a couple more and
the<00:03:00.810> reason<00:03:00.990> for<00:03:01.200> these<00:03:01.500> pieces<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
the reason for these pieces is that the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.120 
the reason for these pieces is that the
closures<00:03:03.030> are<00:03:03.209> very<00:03:03.420> full<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.959> make<00:03:04.170> sure<00:03:04.440> no

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
closures are very full to make sure no

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.430 
closures are very full to make sure no
matter<00:03:05.280> where<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.730> part<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:07.110> you're<00:03:07.290> going

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
matter where you part that you're going

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.160 
matter where you part that you're going
to<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.620> coverage<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:09.000> once<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.959> put<00:03:10.140> your

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to have coverage so once you put your

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.510 
to have coverage so once you put your
part<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:12.300> really<00:03:12.480> wouldn't<00:03:12.810> need

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
part in there you really wouldn't need

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.160 
part in there you really wouldn't need
those<00:03:14.520> pieces<00:03:14.850> anymore<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.570> that's<00:03:15.720> why<00:03:15.989> we're

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
those pieces anymore so that's why we're

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.620 
those pieces anymore so that's why we're
going<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.350> discard<00:03:16.770> them<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:18.300> what<00:03:18.480> we're

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
going to discard them so what we're

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.210 
going to discard them so what we're
doing<00:03:18.660> now<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.020> just<00:03:19.140> cleaning<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.950> closure

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
doing now is just cleaning the closure

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:31.730 
doing now is just cleaning the closure
and<00:03:21.560> we'll<00:03:22.560> be<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:22.860> that

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:39.370
