00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the door handles in the back they

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.609 
the door handles in the back they
thought<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.420> carefully<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:07.110> things<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
thought very carefully about things that

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.710 
thought very carefully about things that
should<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:09.510> however

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
should go in the back I think however

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.050 
should go in the back I think however
there<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> couple<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.380> misses<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> car

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
there are a couple of misses in the car

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.660 
there are a couple of misses in the car
there<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.990> no<00:01:13.320> stop-start<00:01:13.799> technology<00:01:13.979> nor

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
there is no stop-start technology nor

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.859 
there is no stop-start technology nor
are<00:01:14.760> there<00:01:14.850> any<00:01:14.880> plans<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> stop<00:01:15.600> start

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
are there any plans to stop start

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.050 
are there any plans to stop start
technology<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.950> i<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.700> big<00:01:17.880> miss

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
technology which i think is a big miss

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
technology which i think is a big miss
in<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.270> day<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.570> age<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.409> car<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.950> very

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
in this day and age the car is very

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.749 
in this day and age the car is very
claustrophobic

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
claustrophobic

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
claustrophobic
it<00:01:21.000> feels<00:01:21.450> quite<00:01:21.600> dark<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> sporty

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it feels quite dark because the sporty

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.679 
it feels quite dark because the sporty
roofline<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.850> brings<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> waistline<00:01:24.479> up

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
roofline it brings the waistline up

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.609 
roofline it brings the waistline up
which<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> don't<00:01:25.049> think<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
which I don't think it's going to be a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.789 
which I don't think it's going to be a
great<00:01:25.799> feature<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> small<00:01:26.400> children

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.099 

I<00:01:31.820> think<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.149> sound<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> been<00:01:33.570> quite<00:01:33.810> brave

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
I think this sound of been quite brave

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.289 
I think this sound of been quite brave
in<00:01:34.469> this<00:01:34.619> design<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.729> nice<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.210> be

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
in this design and it's nice to be

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.620 
in this design and it's nice to be
seeing<00:01:36.570> something<00:01:36.899> different<00:01:37.049> coming<00:01:37.829> along

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
seeing something different coming along

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.700 
seeing something different coming along
it's<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.719> couple<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.049> things<00:01:40.259> couple<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it's a couple of things couple of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.490 
it's a couple of things couple of
dislikes<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.610> vehicle<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:43.350> in

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
dislikes with this vehicle I think in

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
dislikes with this vehicle I think in
the<00:01:43.590> cabin<00:01:44.069> it<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.549> feel<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.850> little

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the cabin it can feel a little

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.529 
the cabin it can feel a little
claustrophobic<00:01:46.549> but<00:01:47.549> however<00:01:47.729> saying<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
claustrophobic but however saying that I

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.600 
claustrophobic but however saying that I
think<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.229> would<00:01:49.409> put<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.709> glass<00:01:49.950> roof<00:01:50.310> on

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
think if they would put a glass roof on

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.139 
think if they would put a glass roof on
that<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.869> eliminate<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.649> feel<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that could eliminate that feel and and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
that could eliminate that feel and and
would<00:01:54.539> improve<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.049> look<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.380> vehicle<00:01:55.560> as

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
would improve the look of the vehicle as

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.359 
would improve the look of the vehicle as
well<00:01:56.780> with<00:01:57.780> regard<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> boot<00:01:58.740> area<00:01:59.130> I

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
well with regard to the boot area I

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.100 
well with regard to the boot area I
think<00:01:59.700> there<00:01:59.850> could<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.209> versatility

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
think there could be more versatility

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.710 
think there could be more versatility
and<00:02:01.560> space<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.340> boots<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:03.539> have<00:02:03.569> a

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
and space with the boots we have a

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.830 
and space with the boots we have a
plastic<00:02:04.259> molded<00:02:04.709> area<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.539> I<00:02:06.569> just

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
plastic molded area in here but I just

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
plastic molded area in here but I just
think<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.319> had<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.500> lower<00:02:07.770> shelf<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
think if it had a lower shelf in this

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880 
think if it had a lower shelf in this
area<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.299> would<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.899> would<00:02:10.019> be<00:02:10.079> more<00:02:10.319> versatile

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
area it would it would be more versatile

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.500 
area it would it would be more versatile
than<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> at<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.610> moment<00:02:17.180> styling<00:02:18.180> styling

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
than it is at the moment styling styling

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.300 
than it is at the moment styling styling
is<00:02:18.720> definitely<00:02:19.170> different<00:02:19.620> which<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> good

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
is definitely different which is a good

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.970 
is definitely different which is a good
point<00:02:20.750> whether<00:02:21.750> whether<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.319> styling<00:02:22.680> itself

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
point whether whether the styling itself

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.530 
point whether whether the styling itself
is<00:02:23.099> good<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.400> another<00:02:23.610> matter<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.120> was<00:02:24.360> doing

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
is good is another matter I was doing

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850 
is good is another matter I was doing
pressure<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.900> driving<00:02:25.290> position<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.709> thought

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
pressure the driving position I thought

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.440 
pressure the driving position I thought
that<00:02:26.010> was<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.489> was<00:02:26.579> quite<00:02:26.760> comfortable<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
that was that was quite comfortable and

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.430 
that was that was quite comfortable and
all<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.230> switch<00:02:28.739> gear<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:30.060> feels<00:02:31.019> well<00:02:31.230> made

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
how that's lasted so it seems they've

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.420 
how that's lasted so it seems they've

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.530 

well<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.460> think<00:02:45.580> what<00:02:45.820> I<00:02:45.850> like<00:02:46.030> most<00:02:46.210> about<00:02:46.390> it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
well I think what I like most about it

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.450 
well I think what I like most about it
is<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.050> bold<00:02:47.260> but<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:47.980> not<00:02:48.100> trying<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.370> be

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
is it's bold but it's not trying to be

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.760 
is it's bold but it's not trying to be
retro<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:49.930> trying<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.320> pastiche

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
retro it's not trying to be a pastiche

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.520 
retro it's not trying to be a pastiche

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.860 
on a 1970s dachshund sunny a light brat
I<00:02:54.280> think<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.090> they've<00:02:55.210> done<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> good<00:02:55.600> job<00:02:55.660> in

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
I think that they've done a good job in

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.570 
I think that they've done a good job in
terms<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.410> some<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.710> styling<00:02:56.950> cues

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
terms of some of the styling cues

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.030 
terms of some of the styling cues
it's<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> 21st<00:02:58.870> century<00:02:59.230> car<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.680> respect

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
it's a 21st century car in that respect

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.490 
it's a 21st century car in that respect
not<00:03:00.970> quite<00:03:01.240> sure<00:03:01.270> who<00:03:01.690> attained<00:03:02.050> out<00:03:02.230> from<00:03:02.410> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
not quite sure who attained out from the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.100 
not quite sure who attained out from the
market<00:03:02.830> perspective<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:04.000> would<00:03:04.180> suit<00:03:04.390> me<00:03:04.570> but

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
market perspective it would suit me but

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.720 
market perspective it would suit me but
I<00:03:05.170> think<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.530> made<00:03:05.710> me<00:03:05.890> not<00:03:06.100> see<00:03:06.280> people<00:03:06.580> with

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
I think it made me not see people with

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.590 
I think it made me not see people with
families<00:03:07.060> with<00:03:07.210> kids<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.570> back

the dashboard is nice soft touch

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.970 
the dashboard is nice soft touch

plastics the doors are the hard brittle

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.040 
plastics the doors are the hard brittle
plastics<00:03:18.730> which<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.030> thought<00:03:19.300> we<00:03:19.780> got<00:03:19.810> away

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
plastics which I thought we got away

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.080 
plastics which I thought we got away
from<00:03:20.140> now<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.460> bit<00:03:21.610> of<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.760> mixture

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
from now so it's a bit of a mixture
