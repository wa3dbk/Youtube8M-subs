he will not go down so easily what's

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.230 
he will not go down so easily what's
even<00:01:29.770> worse<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:30.700> thing<00:01:31.060> between

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
even worse is that this thing between

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.450

nominals Bond and Nick Fury is personal
so<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:34.090> means<00:01:34.300> it's<00:01:34.540> gonna<00:01:34.660> get<00:01:34.900> even<00:01:35.050> more

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
so that means it's gonna get even more

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.030 
so that means it's gonna get even more
intense
