 hi how are you in this new video 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.120
 tutorial I'm going to show you another 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.610
 novel tool of photoshop cs 6 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.340
 if we go here to the tools of 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.970
 contextual retouch of photoshop and 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.280
 we click for a little while we can 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.340
 see the entire set of tools 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.620
 contextual retouching notice here that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.770
 this one that is new in photoshop appears 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.800
 cs 6 and it is the movement tool with 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.379
 content detection 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.239
 it's a very simple tool and we 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.430
 allows you to do something that previously 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.800
 we could do but in a couple of steps 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.900
 let's imagine that I want to move this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 boat to occupy another place 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.860
 inside the photograph then that 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.420
 it should be 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.420
 I select with the tool around 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.990
 and moved it where I want it to be its 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.990
 final destination for example here 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.670
 see then that automatically the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.490
 sailboat was integrated into its new fund and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.070
 photoshop covered the hole that the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.130
 displacement would generate in the image 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.920
 this is the original position and with a 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.970
 I only pass what we managed to move 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.579
 the boat and cover the empty area see 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.899
 let's try another image this is 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.110
 an image where the stage is 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.980
 pretty simple let's open this 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 Photography 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.030
 and what we are going to try is to move 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.080
 the bird that is 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.150
 on the sand then again 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.659
 I select with the tool around 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.659
 of the seagull 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.880
 and I move it here for example 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.879
 see that the area where we removed the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.879
 Seagull covered up pretty well but 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.150
 in the new place I also did not stay 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.740
 integrated seagull with the background 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.250
 then to improve this what is 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.250
 can do 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.410
 I make the selection again 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.720
 and see that here I have the option to adapt 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.480
 I can choose that the adaptation be 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.760
 very stiff so the edges that the 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.580
 limits are very hard or I can 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.800
 return very loose by default the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.250
 tool is in average but we're going to 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.030
 try now with very loose 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.670
 I select displacement 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.220
 and they see that the integration is a bit 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.440
 it's not perfect either, it all depends 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.140
 of the funds note that here also 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.000
 we lost the legs of the seagull 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.420
 so what I can do is go back 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.590
 back control h so it reappears 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.980
 the selection and could with the tool 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.459
 loop enlarge the area a bit 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.500
 selection then I come back here to the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.319
 movement tool with detection 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.620
 content and I move the 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.620
 seagull 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.060
 see that now we did not lose the legs 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.280
 Seagull also not finished 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.690
 integrate a lot with the background we should 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.330
 use some tool 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.550
 complementary I show them to you 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.770
 They see that there is not perfect 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.610
 many cases where you have to do 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.530
 equally an extra job we do not go back 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.660
 to this image, notice that here we have the 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.390
 option so we were in move mode 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.790
 to move an object from a part of 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.700
 the photo to the other let's now put the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.180
 option to extend how it works 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.190
 good option 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.430
 let's image canvas size 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.430
 and we're going to give it a width instead of 42 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.160
 centimeters a width of 50 centimeters 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.380
 for example then imagine that 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.380
 we want to have a photograph 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.150
 of this specific size 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.490
 we could stretch the image but 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.950
 we would be deforming or scaling the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.290
 image according to content that does not give us 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.330
 always the best result 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.120
 then using this tool that 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.250
 we can do first instead of very 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.720
 loose let's put media to see what 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.760
 happens 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:56.820
 we come here we draw a rectangle 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.820
 we return we check that it is in extend 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.290
 and we see how the background has spread 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 well, I hope it's your 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.130
 utility that you practice with this 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.340
 tool and any query that 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:22.550
 have not hesitate to write us to info
