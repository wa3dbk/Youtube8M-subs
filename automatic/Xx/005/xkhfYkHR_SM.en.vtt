for this particular braid we have to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
for this particular braid we have to
make<00:00:43.470> sure<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.980> our<00:00:44.129> hair<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> totally

this<00:01:12.899> way<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> way<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:14.100> ends

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this way all the way down to your ends

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
this way all the way down to your ends
as<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.780> result<00:01:15.780> you're<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.410> obtain<00:01:16.800> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
as a result you're going to obtain a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219 
as a result you're going to obtain a
square<00:01:17.160> 3-dimensional<00:01:18.090> braid<00:01:18.390> also<00:01:18.869> known<00:01:19.020> as

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
square 3-dimensional braid also known as

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:40.840 
square 3-dimensional braid also known as
a<00:01:19.259> box<00:01:19.590> braid

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.130 

tyrants<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.000> an<00:01:42.090> elastic<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.780> you're<00:01:42.960> ready

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
tyrants with an elastic and you're ready

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.550 
tyrants with an elastic and you're ready
to<00:01:43.380> go

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.460 

and<00:01:49.040> now<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.850> create<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.330> stacked<00:01:50.720> braid<00:01:51.110> you

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
and now to create a stacked braid you

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.020 
and now to create a stacked braid you
also<00:01:51.619> have<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.920> do<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.159> same<00:01:52.340> thing<00:01:52.610> splitting

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
also have to do the same thing splitting

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.510 
also have to do the same thing splitting
your<00:01:53.150> outer<00:01:53.390> strands<00:01:53.990> into<00:01:54.170> parts<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.860> weave

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
your outer strands into parts and weave

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.730 
your outer strands into parts and weave
in<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.820> middle<00:01:56.060> strands<00:01:56.420> through<00:01:56.720> them<00:01:56.990> but

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
in the middle strands through them but

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.499 
in the middle strands through them but
now<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:57.979> two<00:01:58.280> strands<00:01:58.610> will<00:01:58.820> no<00:01:58.940> longer<00:01:59.180> be

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
now the two strands will no longer be

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.630 
now the two strands will no longer be
equal<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.710> want<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.009> split<00:02:01.190> your<00:02:01.430> outer

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
equal you want to split your outer

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.030 
equal you want to split your outer
strands<00:02:02.270> into<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.630> small<00:02:02.930> closer<00:02:03.259> strand<00:02:03.830> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
strands into a small closer strand and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.700 
strands into a small closer strand and
figure<00:02:04.759> further<00:02:05.090> strand<00:02:05.690> this<00:02:06.409> way<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
figure further strand this way the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.440 
figure further strand this way the
smaller<00:02:06.979> strands<00:02:07.399> will<00:02:07.580> create<00:02:07.850> an<00:02:08.000> effect<00:02:08.300> of

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
smaller strands will create an effect of

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.719 
smaller strands will create an effect of
a<00:02:08.600> tiny<00:02:08.810> braids<00:02:09.229> stacked<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:09.950> top<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.369> bigger

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
a tiny braids stacked on top of a bigger

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.030 
a tiny braids stacked on top of a bigger
one

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.580 

you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.920 

once<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.459> get<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.670> your<00:02:19.880> ends<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.569> can<00:02:20.750> tack

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
once you get to your ends you can tack

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.750 
once you get to your ends you can tack
on<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.230> sides<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.830> bigger<00:02:22.040> braids<00:02:22.490> to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760
