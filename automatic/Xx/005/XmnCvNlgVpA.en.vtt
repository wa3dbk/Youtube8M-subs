00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 the fifth friendly arrived one 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.799
 defeat with apple we justify between 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.299
 quotes with the fact that they are more 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.690
 ahead in the preparation, in short, it can 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.170
 to stay 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.600
 well that's an aspect that surely 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.010
 important it will certainly be in the sense 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.809
 that in a week they start playing 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.820
 I also believe against Chelsea therefore 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.020
 This is where beautiful loads arrive at 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.200
 this was a practical one today 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 match for their final then sum 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.470
 preparations so I think it is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.750
 important as far as we are concerned 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 a good match in terms of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.260
 run but let's say maybe with a little more 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.059
 of confusion and therefore in short how I owe 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.140
 say a path that is there and also 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.480
 last year I remember that he had 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.580
 a defeat after a while abroad e 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.650
 so we hope it is a good omen 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.170
 yesterday arrived by plane with rafa 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.150
 márquez met the new companions 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.409
 tells us a little about how you managed to 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.080
 make this big shot but the shot 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.620
 always comes from a set of ideas no 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.720
 so it was one thing in one evening 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.000
 while watching the World Cup game 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.559
 I saw this player in that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.610
 moment I had not sincerely connected 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.740
 which perhaps will come between played in the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.420
 barcelona and I called net threshold 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 on this through a player 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.520
 interesting for us immediately gave me 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.710
 of the mad then after we started 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.380
 this is what we are here in short 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.850
 so what arrived important 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.799
 leads to rafa márquez his other 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.659
 experience in the field for us is 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.159
 certainly the important one you bring 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.149
 that because I believe we took it 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.960
 for what is important then 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.149
 honestly he is such a player there 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.329
 we immediately realized that at scale 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.749
 let's say a little changed what the is 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.640
 way of interacting in communication 

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:47.600
 because anyway TV have come forward 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.460
 and journalists from all over the world 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.069
 this makes it clear what it means then 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.359
 for a club to be able to afford let's say 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.700
 to have some samples of that 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.200
 level because it makes you a little bit more 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.359
 international are therefore also a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.460
 path we say that helps us grow 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.810
 that profile because then there is not 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.299
 we forget that a year we are in 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.140
 series a then lelas verona even if one 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.560
 historical and a 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.090
 we say important today as it is today 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 second time doing the series later 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.530
 so high after so many years so I believe 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.810
 that this is the most important thing 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.600
 first luca toni then rafa márquez verona 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 it really becomes an appetizing stage 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.010
 yes i believe that what you said is a 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.209
 important concept is the fact of having 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.520
 the fact of having we say so brought 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.250
 of players of that level 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.160
 create a highway let's say a little more 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.810
 free from hitches for the arrival of others 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.720
 players of that level in the sense that 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.250
 however it is normal that I think about the city 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.300
 that there were no problems 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.400
 of doubts as to whether it is one 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.989
 beautiful city is good is a nice 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.970
 public a nice cheer a beautiful stadium 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.269
 so I actually knew that, though 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.620
 knowledge passes through certain 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.600
 champions and these helped us 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.670
 surely grow the market however not 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.170
 it is finished dream to us touches three planes to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.420
 arrangement tonight she stops in 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.420
 england threshold did not have and did not 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.700
 but now we surely see the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.620
 market is not finished we try to stay 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.100
 be careful we take something 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.530
 that is preparatory to improving the 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.540
 our rose and then again I am still there 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.680
 so long we will do something 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.480
 reveal something more in it 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.440
 attack 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.600
 we say that surely in attack 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.220
 something will happen i have to ask her 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.690
 the elections are approaching 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.460
 Albertini then surely we have 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.680
 in 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.930
 let's say so voted a program a 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.120
 program that includes so many reforms are 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.030
 those that interest us then 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.380
 we want to say to prove once by 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.850
 more coherence in what has been 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.940
 decided in the assembly and then Monday at 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.330
 urns I know what to do let's see what 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.020
 will happen when newcomers come to 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.190
 casa verona okay they are entering 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.930
 maybe someone in preparation 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.880
 some of us to get into the schemes 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.110
 but it seems to me that the group as a 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:08.090
 people say so that you are 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.040
 mixing well it seems to me that this 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.630
 it is therefore important for us 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.670
 because a team like our creed 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.230
 that should always count on a 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.910
 the importance of the group at what point 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.080
 seen Verona after this trip 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.940
 english i saw like like last year 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.780
 we have to say neither more nor less we are there 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.490
 preparing 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.110
 how many players that is growing 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.360
 someone who has a moment of pause but 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.490
 it's normal I repeat I think this does 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.800
 part of the preparation 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.890
 today we made a quick trip 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.790
 and in my opinion these days then 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.980
 get to the end of the championship 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.510
 they will be those that cause damage 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.580
 definitely better preparation e 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.500
 I also believe above all a speech 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.180
 tactician still asks for one thing when 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.670
 arrived here if how he wanted to remove it 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.310
 stadium import it down by plane if the 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.020
 field especially no and stadium not 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.200
 both in the structure but in its fact 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.970
 which includes its fans in contact 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.220
 a wonderful thing with the players 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.590
 if we had this thing to verona 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.950
 surely it would be a few more points 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.950
 this yes
