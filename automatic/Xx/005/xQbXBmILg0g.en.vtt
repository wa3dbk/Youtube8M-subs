like washing-up boxes and stuff like
that<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> has<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.029> clear<00:00:21.270> plastic<00:00:21.570> here

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
that but it has to be clear plastic here

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.170 
that but it has to be clear plastic here
right<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.670> cut<00:00:24.000> out<00:00:25.220> some<00:00:26.220> pieces<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
right so you cut out some pieces of the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.900 
right so you cut out some pieces of the
plastic<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.080> cut<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.560> oh<00:00:28.910> sorry

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
plastic you have to cut it out oh sorry

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.780 
plastic you have to cut it out oh sorry
so<00:00:30.390> at<00:00:30.570> first<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.410> cut<00:00:31.679> out<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.399> pieces<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
so at first you cut out some pieces of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.459 
so at first you cut out some pieces of
the<00:00:35.120> cardboard<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.809> doesn't<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.320> be

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
pieces of the cardboard the top one the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.299 
pieces of the cardboard the top one the
bigger<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.950> six

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
bigger one is going to be six

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.119 
bigger one is going to be six
centimeters<00:00:45.059> by<00:00:45.239> six<00:00:45.539> centimeters<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
centimeters by six centimeters and the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
centimeters by six centimeters and the
smaller<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> 1<00:00:48.480> centimeter

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
smaller one is going to be 1 centimeter

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.439 
smaller one is going to be 1 centimeter
by<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.680> or<00:00:50.160> maybe<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.000> go<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> little<00:00:51.239> bit

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
by one or maybe you can go a little bit

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.729 
by one or maybe you can go a little bit
bigger<00:00:51.719> by<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> maybe<00:00:52.699> half<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.739> well

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
bigger by going to maybe half and well

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.790 
bigger by going to maybe half and well
two<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.430> three<00:00:56.760> centimeters<00:00:57.239> big<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.350> pretty

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
two or three centimeters big but pretty

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.240 
two or three centimeters big but pretty
much<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.399> by<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.690> then<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.879> your

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
much one by one and then you get your

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.300 
much one by one and then you get your
you<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.430> your<00:01:06.710> plastic<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.570> cut<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:10.310> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you get your plastic and you cut it so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
you get your plastic and you cut it so
that<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.810> into<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.670> triangle<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.600> goes<00:01:15.840> from

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that it's into a triangle that goes from

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.149 
that it's into a triangle that goes from
6<00:01:16.680> centimeters<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.700> top<00:01:18.000> two<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.710> then

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
6 centimeters at the top two and then

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
6 centimeters at the top two and then
three<00:01:20.189> point<00:01:20.759> five<00:01:20.970> centimeters<00:01:21.840> down<00:01:22.590> from

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
three point five centimeters down from

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.070 
three point five centimeters down from
the<00:01:23.009> middle<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> middle<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the middle there to the middle of the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.120 
the middle there to the middle of the
top<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.659> middle<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> after

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
top and then at the middle and after

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.420 
top and then at the middle and after
three<00:01:29.340> point<00:01:29.549> five<00:01:29.700> centimeters<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:31.400> do<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
three point five centimeters you do a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.730 
three point five centimeters you do a
one<00:01:32.759> centimeter<00:01:33.619> cut<00:01:34.619> across<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.549> across

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
one centimeter cut across there across

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.550 
one centimeter cut across there across
there<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.090> yep<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.259> four<00:01:40.530> of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
there and yep I know you do four of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.219 
there and yep I know you do four of
those<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.180> stick<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.950 
those and you just stick them on like I
have<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.090> stick<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> square

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
have here and then you stick the square

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.039 
have here and then you stick the square
on<00:01:46.290> top<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.299> that's<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
on top of it and that's just so it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.969 
on top of it and that's just so it
stands<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.649> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
stands up like that so and then you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.880 
stands up like that so and then you

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the Apple one first and put this on

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.020 
the Apple one first and put this on
there<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.790> line<00:02:32.970> up<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.670> right<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:35.819> just

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.650 
there and line up and right I'm just
gonna<00:02:36.150> turn<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.480> light<00:02:36.660> off<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.860> now<00:02:43.950> see

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
gonna turn the light off you can now see

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.900 
gonna turn the light off you can now see
up<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:50.970> go<00:02:52.010> around<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.190> here<00:02:53.760> and

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
up and then I can go around to here and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.860 
up and then I can go around to here and
it<00:02:54.030> should<00:02:54.239> be<00:02:56.239> now<00:02:57.239> it's<00:02:57.390> not<00:02:57.540> particularly

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
it should be now it's not particularly

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:09.339 
it should be now it's not particularly
good<00:02:58.140> side<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.549> get<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> general<00:03:00.060> idea

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:18.979 

just<00:03:10.349> reposition<00:03:15.770> something<00:03:16.770> yes<00:03:16.920> there<00:03:17.989> is

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
just reposition something yes there is

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.670 
just reposition something yes there is
uh<00:03:21.170> almost<00:03:22.170> there

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
uh almost there

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.910 
uh almost there
