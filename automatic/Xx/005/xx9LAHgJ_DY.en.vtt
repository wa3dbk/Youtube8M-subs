the<00:00:49.079> point<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> trick<00:00:49.620> anyway<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
the point of the trick anyway so then

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.810 
the point of the trick anyway so then
you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.620> whoops<00:00:53.539> that<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.660> clumsy

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
you can have them whoops that was clumsy

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.420 
you can have them whoops that was clumsy
so<00:00:56.820> basically<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:58.430> shuffle

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so basically you can have them shuffle

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150 
so basically you can have them shuffle
it<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.789> they<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> spectator<00:01:01.890> knows

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it all they want the spectator knows

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.820 
it all they want the spectator knows

now<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.090> one<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.299> those<00:01:59.479> perspective

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
now and this is one of those perspective

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.870 
now and this is one of those perspective
tricks<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.799> it's<00:02:01.369> all<00:02:01.490> based<00:02:01.729> around

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
tricks and it's all based around

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.760 
tricks and it's all based around
perspectives<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:02.720> it's<00:02:02.840> really<00:02:03.049> hard<00:02:03.380> like

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
perspectives so it's really hard like

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.889 
perspectives so it's really hard like
you<00:02:04.070> know<00:02:04.189> like<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.580> snap<00:02:04.790> change<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:05.780> is

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
you know like the snap change that is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.450 
you know like the snap change that is
all<00:02:06.020> based<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.290> perspective<00:02:06.619> like<00:02:07.100> if<00:02:07.280> you

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
all based on perspective like if you

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.850 
all based on perspective like if you
were<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.610> little<00:02:07.790> high<00:02:08.060> or<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.630> little<00:02:08.840> low<00:02:09.110> you

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
were a little high or a little low you

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.309 
were a little high or a little low you
can<00:02:10.039> see<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.550> you'll<00:02:11.239> know<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.930> know<00:02:12.050> I've

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
can see that you'll know you know I've

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.290 
can see that you'll know you know I've
assumed<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.220> practice<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.940> at<00:02:14.090> least

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
assumed you practice this on at least

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.590 
assumed you practice this on at least
someone<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.640> they've<00:02:16.640> probably<00:02:17.000> said<00:02:17.420> oh<00:02:17.540> I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
someone and they've probably said oh I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.620 
someone and they've probably said oh I
saw<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:17.989> other<00:02:18.200> card<00:02:18.530> or<00:02:18.739> whatever<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.150> it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
saw the other card or whatever so it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.390 
saw the other card or whatever so it
isn't<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:21.019> hard<00:02:21.200> as<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.350> snap<00:02:21.620> change<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.190> terms

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
isn't as hard as a snap change in terms

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.130 
isn't as hard as a snap change in terms
of<00:02:22.550> angle<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.510> still<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.810> one<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.019> those

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
of angle but it still is one of those

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.320 
of angle but it still is one of those
hard<00:02:24.349> tricks<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.819> definitely<00:02:25.970> one

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
hard tricks and this is definitely one

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.820 
hard tricks and this is definitely one
of<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.540> harder<00:02:26.900> maneuvers<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.709> I've

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
of the harder maneuvers that I've

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.220 
of the harder maneuvers that I've
learned<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.459> newbies<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.390> shouldn't<00:02:29.780> go<00:02:30.019> any

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
learned so newbies you shouldn't go any

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.670 
learned so newbies you shouldn't go any
further<00:02:30.380> than<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.860> probably<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.500> here's<00:02:33.500> how

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
further than this probably so here's how

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.780 
further than this probably so here's how
it's<00:02:33.860> setup<00:02:35.650> they<00:02:36.650> pick<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.830> card<00:02:37.160> okay<00:02:37.730> so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
it's setup they pick a card okay so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.170 
it's setup they pick a card okay so
three<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.360> phase<00:02:38.630> doesn't<00:02:39.290> matter<00:02:39.880> now<00:02:40.880> here's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
three is phase doesn't matter now here's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.330 
three is phase doesn't matter now here's
where<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.480> all<00:02:41.540> gets<00:02:41.720> tricky<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:43.069> part

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
where it all gets tricky is this part

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.130 
where it all gets tricky is this part
you<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.239> to<00:02:44.390> make<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.630> look<00:02:44.780> really

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you have to make this look really

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.650 
you have to make this look really
natural<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:46.430> people<00:02:47.330> think<00:02:47.510> you're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
natural because people think you're

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.640 
natural because people think you're
putting<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.080> right<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.350> middle<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
putting it right in the middle of the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.789 
putting it right in the middle of the
deck<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.790> they<00:02:50.390> would<00:02:50.569> think<00:02:50.750> well<00:02:50.930> then<00:02:51.590> if

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
deck so they would think well then if

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.199 
deck so they would think well then if
you're<00:02:52.010> having<00:02:52.190> such<00:02:52.459> trouble<00:02:52.489> doing<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.060> that

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
you're having such trouble doing it that

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.120 
you're having such trouble doing it that
way<00:02:53.239> why<00:02:53.569> wouldn't<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.930> just<00:02:53.959> make<00:02:54.680> two<00:02:54.860> piles

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
way why wouldn't you just make two piles

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.550 
way why wouldn't you just make two piles
put<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.150> pile<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.690> cover<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.380> like

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
put it in the pile and cover it like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.110 
put it in the pile and cover it like
that<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:58.579> you<00:02:58.640> have<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.820> make<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.060> look

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
that so you have to make this look

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.710 
that so you have to make this look
totally<00:02:59.510> natural<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:01.130> it<00:03:02.000> looks<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.480> this

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
totally natural so it looks like this

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.509 
totally natural so it looks like this
you<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.109> pack<00:03:03.320> you<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.040> cut<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.400> with

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
you have to pack you can cut it with

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.060 
you have to pack you can cut it with
your<00:03:04.760> thumb<00:03:04.790> I'll<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.959> like<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.530> hold<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.920> like

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
your thumb I'll I like to hold it like

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
your thumb I'll I like to hold it like
this<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.519> then<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:08.209> let<00:03:08.480> part<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.170> drop

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
this and then just let part of it drop

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.360 
this and then just let part of it drop
into<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.269> part<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.630> my<00:03:11.720> hand<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:13.010> here's<00:03:13.220> what

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
into that part of my hand so here's what

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.500 
into that part of my hand so here's what
you're<00:03:13.489> going<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.670> do<00:03:13.760> next<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.090> slide<00:03:14.329> your

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
you're going to do next you slide your

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.030 
you're going to do next you slide your
thumb<00:03:14.630> down<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.870> little<00:03:15.019> bit<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.799> you<00:03:15.859> get<00:03:15.980> a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
thumb down a little bit so you get a

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.099 
thumb down a little bit so you get a
grip<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:17.390> we're<00:03:17.570> going<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.930> put

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
grip on that and then we're going to put

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.490 
grip on that and then we're going to put
the<00:03:18.260> card<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.950> what<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.000> do<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:21.350> have

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
the card in what you do is this you have

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.349 
the card in what you do is this you have
your<00:03:21.650> hand<00:03:21.890> hold<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.310> like<00:03:22.459> right<00:03:22.609> here<00:03:23.030> so

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
your hand hold it like right here so

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.530 
your hand hold it like right here so
that<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.510> can<00:03:23.660> cover<00:03:23.870> things<00:03:24.230> up<00:03:24.459> then<00:03:25.459> as<00:03:25.820> you

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
that it can cover things up then as you

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.310 
that it can cover things up then as you
curl<00:03:26.989> over<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:28.480> you're<00:03:29.480> going<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:29.720> go<00:03:29.840> on<00:03:30.019> top

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
curl over this you're going to go on top

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.729 
curl over this you're going to go on top
of<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.620> deck<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.040> then<00:03:31.609> this<00:03:31.820> hand<00:03:32.120> this

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
of the deck and then this hand this

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.539 
of the deck and then this hand this
thumb<00:03:33.739> is<00:03:34.010> going<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.340> push<00:03:34.609> out<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:34.850> card<00:03:35.440> so

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
thumb is going to push out a card so

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.120 
thumb is going to push out a card so
it'll<00:03:37.549> look<00:03:37.579> like<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:38.859> obviously<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.920> card

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
it'll look like that obviously the card

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.640 
it'll look like that obviously the card
won't<00:03:40.310> go<00:03:40.430> out<00:03:40.519> that<00:03:40.700> far<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.930> in<00:03:42.290> fast<00:03:42.530> motion

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
won't go out that far so in fast motion

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.110 
won't go out that far so in fast motion
it'll<00:03:43.040> be<00:03:43.130> like<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:45.590> after<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.910> do

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
it'll be like that and then after you do

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.660 
it'll be like that and then after you do
the<00:03:47.329> switch<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:49.010> obviously<00:03:49.370> you're<00:03:49.489> going<00:03:49.609> to

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
the switch and obviously you're going to

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.920 
the switch and obviously you're going to
do<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.880> later<00:03:50.090> when<00:03:50.269> your<00:03:50.389> hands<00:03:50.569> covering

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
do that later when your hands covering

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.990 
do that later when your hands covering
it<00:03:51.109> then<00:03:51.650> when<00:03:52.130> your<00:03:52.250> thumb<00:03:52.430> comes<00:03:52.609> down<00:03:52.819> you

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
it then when your thumb comes down you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.720 
it then when your thumb comes down you
just<00:03:53.150> adjust<00:03:53.389> this<00:03:53.810> one<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.340> then<00:03:55.340> straighten

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
just adjust this one and then straighten

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.780 
just adjust this one and then straighten
out<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.060> deck<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.680> again<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:59.350> fast<00:04:00.350> motion

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
out the deck so again in fast motion

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.100 
out the deck so again in fast motion
it's<00:04:01.790> going<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:01.970> look<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:02.120> this

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
it's going to look like this

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.130 
it's going to look like this
and<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:04.850> is<00:04:05.030> kind<00:04:05.210> of<00:04:05.300> hard<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.630> do<00:04:05.870> because

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
and this is kind of hard to do because

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.260 
and this is kind of hard to do because
you<00:04:07.130> really<00:04:07.400> want<00:04:07.580> to<00:04:07.640> make<00:04:07.760> sure<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:08.030> get<00:04:08.150> as

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
you really want to make sure you get as

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.390 
you really want to make sure you get as
close<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.720> deck<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:09.020> possible<00:04:09.560> when<00:04:10.310> you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
close to the deck as possible when you

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.000 
close to the deck as possible when you
put<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:10.760> in<00:04:10.970> because<00:04:11.510> as<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.020> can<00:04:12.050> see<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.590> also

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
put it in because as you can see I also

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.950 
put it in because as you can see I also
pushed<00:04:13.340> out<00:04:13.460> a<00:04:13.490> bunch<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.820> cards<00:04:14.030> that's<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.780> big

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
pushed out a bunch of cards that's a big

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.720 
pushed out a bunch of cards that's a big
problem<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.650> i<00:04:15.680> have<00:04:15.740> this<00:04:16.040> trick<00:04:16.250> also<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.700> a

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
problem that i have this trick also is a

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.490 
problem that i have this trick also is a
bunch<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:17.030> cards<00:04:17.239> end<00:04:17.540> up<00:04:17.810> flying<00:04:18.079> out<00:04:18.350> or

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
bunch of cards end up flying out or

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.590 
bunch of cards end up flying out or
something<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.370> i<00:04:19.430> like<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.609> hold<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.030> if<00:04:20.239> i<00:04:20.420> hold

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
something so i like to hold it if i hold

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.720 
something so i like to hold it if i hold
it<00:04:20.750> up<00:04:20.840> higher<00:04:21.079> i<00:04:21.109> think<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.560> helps<00:04:21.829> more<00:04:22.100> just

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
it up higher i think it helps more just

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.380 
it up higher i think it helps more just
get<00:04:22.880> one<00:04:23.030> card<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:24.550> so<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.670> just<00:04:25.850> take<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.240> and

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
get one card and so you just take it and

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.000 
get one card and so you just take it and
make<00:04:26.540> sure<00:04:26.570> your<00:04:26.840> hand<00:04:27.050> is<00:04:27.140> covering<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.800> for

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
make sure your hand is covering it for

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.610 
make sure your hand is covering it for
you<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.940> push<00:04:29.150> out<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.900> it's<00:04:30.380> all<00:04:30.500> going

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
you to the push out and it's all going

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.260 
you to the push out and it's all going
to<00:04:30.650> be<00:04:30.740> really<00:04:31.040> fast<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.550> no<00:04:31.640> one<00:04:31.760> sees<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.090> so

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
to be really fast and no one sees it so

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.710 
to be really fast and no one sees it so
just<00:04:32.300> like<00:04:33.700> those<00:04:34.700> that<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.240> think<00:04:35.510> that<00:04:35.630> was

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
just like those that I think that was

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.320 
just like those that I think that was
kind<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:35.960> bad<00:04:36.140> but<00:04:36.410> anyway<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.850> get<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.060> gist

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
kind of bad but anyway you get the gist

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.510 
kind of bad but anyway you get the gist
of<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:38.900> if<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.500> need<00:04:39.650> any<00:04:39.770> help<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:40.280> can
