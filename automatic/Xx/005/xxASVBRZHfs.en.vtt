hello and welcome to flow mountain bikes

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.690 
hello and welcome to flow mountain bikes
review<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.500> Lapierre's<00:00:10.800> st<00:00:11.389> 304<00:00:12.389> high

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
review of the Lapierre's st 304 high

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.919 
review of the Lapierre's st 304 high
electronic<00:00:14.700> intelligence<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.690> French

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
electronic intelligence but it's French

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.290 
electronic intelligence but it's French
so<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.289> probably<00:00:16.670> electronic<00:00:17.670> intelligence

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.089 

now<00:00:24.300> I'm<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:24.630> gonna<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.830> bike

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
now I'm not gonna go on about this bike

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
now I'm not gonna go on about this bike
too<00:00:26.369> much<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.939> much<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.300> gonna<00:00:27.390> talk<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
too much so much as I'm gonna talk to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.109 
too much so much as I'm gonna talk to
you<00:00:27.840> about<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.830> smart<00:00:29.189> suspension

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you about the very smart suspension

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.569 
you about the very smart suspension
system<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:31.140> how<00:00:31.260> smart<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.710> well<00:00:32.369> we're

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
system just how smart is it well we're

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.920 
system just how smart is it well we're
not<00:00:32.640> talking<00:00:32.790> Rhodes<00:00:33.180> Scholar<00:00:33.480> we're<00:00:33.809> not

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
not talking Rhodes Scholar we're not

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
not talking Rhodes Scholar we're not
talking<00:00:34.260> Stephen<00:00:34.620> Hawking's<00:00:34.980> we're<00:00:35.550> probably

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
talking Stephen Hawking's we're probably

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520 
talking Stephen Hawking's we're probably
talking<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.450> bit<00:00:36.719> above<00:00:36.899> average<00:00:37.110> yeah

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
talking a little bit above average yeah

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.229 
talking a little bit above average yeah
maybe<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> hundred<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.090> some

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
maybe like a hundred and two or some

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.209 
maybe like a hundred and two or some
pretty<00:00:39.960> smart<00:00:42.170> but<00:00:43.170> before<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> start<00:00:43.680> banging

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
pretty smart but before I start banging

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.560 
pretty smart but before I start banging
on<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.610> suspension<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> quick

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
on about the suspension just a quick

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
on about the suspension just a quick
20-second<00:00:46.170> wrap<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.620> bike<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
20-second wrap up this bike it's a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.990 
20-second wrap up this bike it's a
fantastic<00:00:48.210> trial<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.570> 140<00:00:49.350> million<00:00:50.039> 150<00:00:50.760> out

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
fantastic trial by 140 million 150 out

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.209 
fantastic trial by 140 million 150 out
front<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.690> very<00:00:52.379> aggressive<00:00:52.920> angles

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
front right very aggressive angles

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
front right very aggressive angles
probably<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> best<00:00:54.210> rear<00:00:54.510> suspension

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
probably one of the best rear suspension

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.750 
probably one of the best rear suspension
systems<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.250> an<00:00:56.370> excellent

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
systems going and just an excellent

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.369 
systems going and just an excellent
package<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> little<00:00:57.930> bit<00:00:58.020> long<00:00:58.230> on

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
package it's a little bit long on

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.689 
package it's a little bit long on
chainrings<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.370> short<00:00:59.640> on

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
chainrings and a little bit short on

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
chainrings and a little bit short on
dropper<00:00:59.969> seat<00:01:00.210> posts<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.899> apart<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
dropper seat posts and apart from that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
dropper seat posts and apart from that
can't<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.100> fault<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.489> bike<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.850> bloody

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
can't really fault this bike it's bloody

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
can't really fault this bike it's bloody
great<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.170> exactly<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.129> ER

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
great so what exactly is the ER

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
great so what exactly is the ER
suspension<00:01:06.000> system<00:01:06.299> trying<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:07.320> it's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.140 
suspension system trying to do well it's
really<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.740> trying<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> solve<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.610> age-old

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
really just trying to solve that age-old

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.000 
really just trying to solve that age-old
problem<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.689> suspension<00:01:10.140> bikes<00:01:10.350> trying<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
problem with suspension bikes trying to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.250 
problem with suspension bikes trying to
balance<00:01:11.159> efficiency<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:12.600> using<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
balance efficiency with using the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
balance efficiency with using the
suspension<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> give<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> comfort<00:01:14.460> control

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
suspension to give you comfort control

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
suspension to give you comfort control
and<00:01:15.270> traction<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.290> there's<00:01:16.470> always<00:01:16.650> been

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and traction and so there's always been

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.289 
and traction and so there's always been
different<00:01:17.670> ways<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.030> different

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
different ways that different

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.670 
different ways that different
manufacturers<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:18.990> tried<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.470> around

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
manufacturers have tried to get around

the terrain happens to be at that
instant<00:03:21.210> this<00:03:24.020> computer<00:03:33.110> it's<00:03:34.110> very<00:03:34.200> similar

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
instant this computer it's very similar

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.860 
instant this computer it's very similar
all<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:35.670> same<00:03:35.880> information<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.510> there<00:03:36.720> but

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
all that same information is there but

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.620 
all that same information is there but
you've<00:03:37.080> also<00:03:37.290> got<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.650> ability<00:03:37.740> to<00:03:38.220> customize

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
you've also got the ability to customize

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.180 
you've also got the ability to customize
settings<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:39.960> go<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.590> sensitivity

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
settings so you go just the sensitivity

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.820 
settings so you go just the sensitivity
of<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:42.210> sensors<00:03:42.570> so<00:03:43.080> you<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.560> so

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
of the sensors so you can have it so

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:56.080 
of the sensors so you can have it so
it's<00:03:44.010> less<00:03:44.250> responsive<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.590> more<00:03:48.680> efficiency

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.210 

at<00:03:57.090> all<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:58.320> other<00:03:58.440> cool<00:03:58.680> thing<00:03:58.890> about<00:03:58.920> this

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
at all the other cool thing about this

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.590 
at all the other cool thing about this
system<00:03:59.520> is<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.880> toggle<00:04:00.450> between

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
system is that you can toggle between

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.690 
system is that you can toggle between
the<00:04:00.900> different<00:04:01.050> modes<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.710> you<00:04:01.740> can<00:04:01.950> set<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.310> so

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
the different modes so you can set it so

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.970 
the different modes so you can set it so
it's<00:04:02.850> permanently<00:04:03.390> on<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:04.050> medium<00:04:04.500> compression

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
it's permanently on a medium compression

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.320 
it's permanently on a medium compression
dabbing<00:04:05.340> or<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:05.550> can<00:04:05.700> set<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:05.970> there<00:04:06.090> locked

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
dabbing or you can set it there locked

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.700 
dabbing or you can set it there locked
out<00:04:06.510> or<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.750> can<00:04:06.810> leave<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.170> open

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
out or you can leave it open

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.620 
out or you can leave it open
simply<00:04:08.190> by<00:04:08.700> toggling<00:04:08.940> between<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.420> with<00:04:09.510> your

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
simply by toggling between it with your

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.510 
simply by toggling between it with your
little<00:04:09.810> thumb<00:04:10.020> control<00:04:10.170> here<00:04:10.590> all<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.310> wires

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
little thumb control here all the wires

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.490 
little thumb control here all the wires
and<00:04:11.880> stuff<00:04:12.090> for<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> AI<00:04:12.630> system<00:04:12.780> follow<00:04:13.350> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
and stuff for the AI system follow the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.410 
and stuff for the AI system follow the
existing<00:04:13.830> cabling<00:04:14.490> so<00:04:14.970> it's<00:04:15.120> all<00:04:15.270> pretty

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
existing cabling so it's all pretty

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.060 
existing cabling so it's all pretty
smooth<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.990> mean<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.320> little<00:04:16.680> bit<00:04:16.770> thicker

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
smooth I mean a little bit thicker

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.300 
smooth I mean a little bit thicker
whatever<00:04:17.760> shock<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.989> little<00:04:19.950> different<00:04:20.250> you

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
whatever shock is a little different you

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.430 
whatever shock is a little different you
can<00:04:20.430> see<00:04:20.459> it's<00:04:21.000> got<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.209> little<00:04:21.390> relay<00:04:21.930> knob

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
can see it's got the little relay knob

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.590 
can see it's got the little relay knob
on<00:04:22.620> top<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:23.070> which<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.490> what<00:04:23.640> controls<00:04:24.000> the

about<00:05:30.840> this<00:05:31.020> system<00:05:31.350> we<00:05:31.470> wanted

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
about this system we wanted

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.620 
about this system we wanted
we're<00:05:32.250> looking<00:05:32.490> for<00:05:32.610> reasons<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:33.000> dislike<00:05:33.240> it

I mean we're purists at heart but it's
really<00:05:36.840> one<00:05:37.020> assay<00:05:37.260> but<00:05:37.320> we're<00:05:37.560> really<00:05:37.800> really

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100
