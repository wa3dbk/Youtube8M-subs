53<00:03:47.250> seconds<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:48.960> equates<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.380> 113

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
53 seconds and that equates to 113

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.610 
53 seconds and that equates to 113
seconds<00:03:51.170> now<00:03:52.170> we<00:03:52.230> divide<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.860> 113<00:03:53.580> by<00:03:53.910> 60<00:03:54.620> this

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
seconds now we divide the 113 by 60 this

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.250 
seconds now we divide the 113 by 60 this

the true airspeed in this case it's 236

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.480 
the true airspeed in this case it's 236
