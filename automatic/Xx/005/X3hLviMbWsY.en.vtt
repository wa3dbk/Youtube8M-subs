00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
use to upgrade your ship it seems like a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.820 
use to upgrade your ship it seems like a
pretty<00:01:35.450> deep<00:01:35.720> game<00:01:35.990> like<00:01:36.289> there's<00:01:36.470> lots<00:01:36.710> of

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
pretty deep game like there's lots of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.889 
pretty deep game like there's lots of

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
options and things to choose from but

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.950 
options and things to choose from but
based<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.710> what<00:01:39.770> I<00:01:39.890> played<00:01:40.250> it's<00:01:40.460> just<00:01:40.700> not

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
based on what I played it's just not

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.109 
based on what I played it's just not
terribly<00:01:41.960> entertaining<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.310> actual<00:01:43.759> combat

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
terribly entertaining the actual combat

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.510 
terribly entertaining the actual combat
it's<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.899> twin-stick<00:01:45.530> shooter<00:01:45.950> basically<00:01:46.369> so

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it's a twin-stick shooter basically so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.830 
it's a twin-stick shooter basically so
you<00:01:46.580> steer<00:01:46.880> your<00:01:46.970> ship<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.390> left<00:01:47.600> stick

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
you steer your ship of the left stick

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.990 
you steer your ship of the left stick
aim<00:01:48.319> and<00:01:48.590> shoot<00:01:48.770> with<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.039> right<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:49.850> also

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
aim and shoot with the right you also

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.669 
aim and shoot with the right you also
have<00:01:50.240> these<00:01:50.360> drones<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.899> fly<00:01:51.080> around<00:01:51.229> you

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
have these drones that fly around you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.010 
have these drones that fly around you
and<00:01:51.799> they<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.039> aid<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.369> combat<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.240> it

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
and they can aid you in combat and it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.389 
and they can aid you in combat and it
just<00:01:54.229> didn't<00:01:54.560> seem<00:01:54.679> terribly<00:01:55.100> entertaining

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
just didn't seem terribly entertaining

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.180 
just didn't seem terribly entertaining
to<00:01:56.000> me<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.319> certainly<00:01:57.560> seems<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:58.039> have

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
to me but it certainly seems to have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.639 
to me but it certainly seems to have
quite<00:01:58.429> a<00:01:58.550> bit<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.759> contents<00:01:59.509> it<00:02:00.050> promises

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
quite a bit of contents it promises

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.490 
quite a bit of contents it promises
