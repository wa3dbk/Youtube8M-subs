00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Well the sweet is here 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.839
 velvety voice from which my friends 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.540
 so much fun this week the traigo 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.759
 ribs in barbecue sauce for this 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.340
 recipe we're going to need ketchup vinegar 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.680
 water honey brown sugar a spoonful of 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.050
 salt garlic powder powder onion 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.910
 Tabasco pepper and a couple of ribs 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.850
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.750
 pour in a bowl a glass of vinegar another 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.750
 ketchup glass 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 a little more than half a glass of honey 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110
 two glasses of water 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.150
 a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.420
 a small spoonful of onion in 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.899
 powder and other garlic powder 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.190
 one of Tabasco this will be according to what 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.190
 we like it or not the spicy 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.320
 and a half teaspoon of pepper here 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.820
 you see that I have done more quantity but 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.729
 because I 'm doing twice as many 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.520
 amounts that I am saying today and a 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.180
 spoonful of salt we catch the ribs 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.100
 we split them into smaller pieces 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.229
 because before putting it in the oven with 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.580
 the sauce we 're going to marinate is 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.300
 important that there are about three or four 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.190
 hours macerating at least if you can 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.980
 do it better you put him the night of 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.530
 before to do it the next day 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.360
 we take them out of 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.970
 of the sauce to which it is bigger and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.190
 we keep it in the wheat and that sauce is 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.490
 which we are going to put on the fire during 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.940
 almost a couple of hours to reduce 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.759
 up to half or more than half and in 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.149
 this case is reduced by three quarters 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.640
 parts 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.369
 let's see all the foam that is coming out 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.520
 which are impurities and are now fixed in the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.960
 first image of the video the water here is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.390
 missing a couple of fingers for it to arrive 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.780
 up and as it is happening 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 Time is going down and they go 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.090
 concentrating with this all the flavor is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.790
 much more water is lost and you 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.950
 there is a sauce with the most flavors 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.470
 concentrated and more intense 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.470
 that way, more or less, the sauce should remain 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.270
 we jumped the ribs of the refrigerator and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.700
 we are extending this sauce for 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.700
 all the ribs 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.719
 Once ready we put it in the oven to 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.590
 about 200 degrees for about 30 minutes 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:47.940
 approximately 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.180
 and this would be the result of a first 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.310
 flat 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.109
 On the other hand I will explain why 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.299
 he supported the amount of sauce to me 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.120
 interesting that since I start doing 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.790
 this sauce that takes a little time and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.989
 others do others and freeze them 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.230
 I froze it more tomato and in other 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.710
 occasions without macerating the meat 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.410
 directly 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.590
 I ask the sauce above and I put it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.500
 in the macerated oven it comes out better because 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.760
 the sauce store the meat is more 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.970
 juicy and takes more flavor but if not 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.710
 you want complicated life directly 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.470
 make your sauce 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.590
 freezes it and everything you have to do 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.410
 is to buy a rib and throw the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.510
 sauce is beard above without 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.540
 good thing about this sauce is that you do not get to 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.220
 freeze then you have no problem 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.320
 open the case to use the sauce that 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.960
 you need what I'm going to close and not put in 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.970
 the freezer 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.750
 takes the same process as the other one 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.430
 We put in the same oven for about 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:02.240
 30 minutes to approximately 200 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:06.830
 degrees and the result was the same single 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.010
 Maybe the mash gives it a more flavor 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.860
 intense and more juicy here I leave the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.720
 image of the other ribs and without 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.720
 mancera but is equally rich
