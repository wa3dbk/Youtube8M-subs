the clinician does with the patient so

once the diagnosis is made we want to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.640 
once the diagnosis is made we want to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a number of reasons one is to tell what

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
a number of reasons one is to tell what
type<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> therapy<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> patient<00:01:15.840> should

type of therapy the patient should

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
type of therapy the patient should
receive<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.939> example<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.570> an<00:01:18.720> early

stage where the disease has already

stage where the disease has already
spread<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.829> about<00:01:31.950> more

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
spread and you have to think about more

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190 
spread and you have to think about more
systemic<00:01:32.820> therapies<00:01:33.479> treatments<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.079> go

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
systemic therapies treatments that go

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.749 
systemic therapies treatments that go
everywhere<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.890> body<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.490> care<00:01:35.729> of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
everywhere in the body to take care of

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.010 
everywhere in the body to take care of
the<00:01:35.939> disease<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.130> clinician<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the disease and so a clinician will do a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.240 
the disease and so a clinician will do a
staging<00:01:40.500> evaluation<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:42.000> look<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:43.250> prognosis

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
staging evaluation to look at prognosis

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
staging evaluation to look at prognosis
and<00:01:44.729> also<00:01:45.390> come<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> best<00:01:46.500> therapy

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and also come up with the best therapy

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.690 
and also come up with the best therapy
the<00:01:48.060> tests<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.840> done<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.220> staging

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the tests that are done in that staging

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.330 
the tests that are done in that staging
evaluation<00:01:50.990> depends<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.799> clinicians

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
evaluation depends on the clinicians

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.789 
evaluation depends on the clinicians
knowledge<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.750> tumor<00:01:55.229> normally

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
knowledge of what that tumor normally

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.050 
knowledge of what that tumor normally
does<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.299> example<00:01:58.100> if<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.430> had<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> scan<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
does so for example if we had a scan of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
does so for example if we had a scan of
toenails<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> scan<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
toenails we're not going to do a scan of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.859 
toenails we're not going to do a scan of
toenails<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.210> person<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.659> lung<00:02:03.840> cancer

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
toenails in person with lung cancer

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.690 
toenails in person with lung cancer
because<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.710> lung<00:02:04.920> cancer<00:02:05.280> doesn't<00:02:05.490> go

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
because we know lung cancer doesn't go

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.559 
because we know lung cancer doesn't go
to<00:02:05.759> toenails<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:07.220> histologic<00:02:08.220> grade<00:02:08.569> the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
molecular diagnostic labs we are going

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.420 
molecular diagnostic labs we are going
to<00:04:50.300> learn<00:04:50.660> about<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.770> biology<00:04:52.040> of<00:04:52.340> the

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
to learn about the biology of the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.240 
to learn about the biology of the
disease<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:53.090> hopefully<00:04:53.900> in<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.260> future<00:04:54.440> be

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
disease and hopefully in the future be

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.980 
disease and hopefully in the future be
able<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.550> have<00:04:55.700> better<00:04:55.970> drugs<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.810> can

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
able to have better drugs that can

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.880 
able to have better drugs that can
interfere<00:04:57.620> with<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:58.370> cancer<00:04:59.060> process<00:05:00.020> but

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
interfere with the cancer process but

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.850 
interfere with the cancer process but
that<00:05:01.160> process<00:05:01.970> may<00:05:02.570> be<00:05:02.630> very<00:05:03.140> different<00:05:03.500> in

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
that process may be very different in

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.210 
that process may be very different in
one<00:05:04.400> person<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.120> an<00:05:05.390> or<00:05:05.720> another<00:05:05.960> person<00:05:06.440> with

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
one person and an or another person with

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.030 
one person and an or another person with
the<00:05:07.250> same<00:05:07.430> disease<00:05:08.300> under<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:08.960> microscope<00:05:09.380> so

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
the same disease under the microscope so

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.240 
the same disease under the microscope so
it's<00:05:10.190> quite<00:05:10.400> a<00:05:10.460> challenge<00:05:11.169> and<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.890> really

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
it's quite a challenge and it really

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.350 
it's quite a challenge and it really
under<00:05:14.150> my<00:05:14.860> underscores<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.130> importance<00:05:16.760> of

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
under my underscores the importance of

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.650 
under my underscores the importance of
people<00:05:18.110> with<00:05:18.260> cancer

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
people with cancer

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.170 
people with cancer
allowing<00:05:20.979> biopsies<00:05:21.979> to<00:05:22.160> be<00:05:22.280> taken<00:05:22.760> for

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
allowing biopsies to be taken for

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.540 
allowing biopsies to be taken for
research<00:05:23.570> purposes<00:05:24.200> so<00:05:24.710> we<00:05:24.740> can<00:05:25.010> understand

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
research purposes so we can understand

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.969 
research purposes so we can understand
this<00:05:25.850> heterogeneity<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.960> tumor<00:05:27.380> which

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
this heterogeneity of the tumor which

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.740 
this heterogeneity of the tumor which
will<00:05:28.190> ultimately<00:05:28.700> lead<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.360> much<00:05:29.720> better

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
will ultimately lead to much better

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.910 
will ultimately lead to much better
therapies<00:05:30.590> than<00:05:31.130> what<00:05:31.340> we<00:05:31.460> have<00:05:31.669> today
