00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.159 
holiday season that's a cute idea the
Virtual<00:03:41.639> Console<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.269> honestly<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.049> biggest

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
Virtual Console is honestly the biggest

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.770 
Virtual Console is honestly the biggest
appeal<00:03:43.650> there<00:03:43.919> but<00:03:44.669> for<00:03:45.000> me<00:03:45.090> personally<00:03:45.120> I

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
appeal there but for me personally I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.270 
appeal there but for me personally I
would<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:46.109> get<00:03:46.229> any<00:03:46.409> console<00:03:46.919> but<00:03:47.129> that's

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
would just get any console but that's

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.039 
would just get any console but that's
probably<00:03:47.430> because<00:03:47.699> my<00:03:48.209> parents<00:03:48.659> were<00:03:48.750> pretty

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
probably because my parents were pretty

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.960 
probably because my parents were pretty
lenient<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.590> was<00:03:49.769> growing<00:03:50.040> up<00:03:50.159> so<00:03:50.729> I<00:03:50.759> got

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
lenient when I was growing up so I got

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.429 
lenient when I was growing up so I got
to<00:03:51.060> play<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.269> lot<00:03:51.479> of<00:03:51.599> violent<00:03:51.959> games<00:03:52.169> or
