like I said I don't love these
proportions<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:28.890> wish<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.489> know<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
proportions I wish that you know the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.190 
proportions I wish that you know the
casts<00:03:29.940> are<00:03:30.120> kind<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.299> big<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.660> then<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:30.989> wish

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
casts are kind of big and then I wish

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.449 
casts are kind of big and then I wish
that<00:03:31.380> they<00:03:31.500> went<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.890> would<00:03:32.160> have<00:03:32.310> went

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
that they went it would have went

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.850 
that they went it would have went
skinnier<00:03:33.000> down<00:03:33.330> here<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.870> think<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.440> it's<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
skinnier down here I think that it's a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.340 
skinnier down here I think that it's a
little<00:03:34.980> bit<00:03:35.250> too<00:03:35.430> uh<00:03:35.459> too<00:03:36.330> open<00:03:36.660> for<00:03:36.690> carnage

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
little bit too uh too open for carnage

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.380 
little bit too uh too open for carnage
in<00:03:37.500> my<00:03:37.680> opinion<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:38.310> uh<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.850> that's<00:03:39.000> really

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
in my opinion but uh but that's really

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.479 
in my opinion but uh but that's really
just<00:03:39.570> me<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.680> don't<00:03:40.739> think<00:03:41.010> anybody<00:03:41.310> will

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
just me and I don't think anybody will

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.610 
just me and I don't think anybody will
really<00:03:41.940> share<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.239> opinion<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.930> much<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.590> ah

the color and then you get the black
going<00:04:35.280> through<00:04:35.610> them<00:04:35.729> I<00:04:35.909> wish<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.569> they<00:04:36.720> did

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
going through them I wish that they did

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.629 
going through them I wish that they did
a<00:04:36.900> little<00:04:37.169> bit<00:04:37.319> more<00:04:37.560> black<00:04:37.740> detailing<00:04:38.550> I

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
a little bit more black detailing I

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.040 
a little bit more black detailing I
think<00:04:38.819> that<00:04:38.940> it's<00:04:39.090> it's<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.419> little<00:04:39.539> light<00:04:39.840> in

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
think that it's it's a little light in

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.170 
think that it's it's a little light in
some<00:04:40.379> areas<00:04:40.710> like<00:04:40.740> right<00:04:41.099> here<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.580> with<00:04:42.060> the

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
some areas like right here and with the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.790 
some areas like right here and with the
hands<00:04:42.479> I<00:04:42.690> would<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:42.930> liked<00:04:43.050> some<00:04:43.259> some<00:04:43.710> of

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
hands I would have liked some some of

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.969 
hands I would have liked some some of
the<00:04:43.889> black<00:04:44.449> symbiote<00:04:45.740> detailing<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.860> would

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
the black symbiote detailing that would

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.770 
the black symbiote detailing that would
have<00:04:47.069> been<00:04:47.159> nice<00:04:47.340> but<00:04:47.580> overall<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.300> think<00:04:48.360> this

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
have been nice but overall I think this

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.260 
have been nice but overall I think this
is<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> fantastic<00:04:49.349> figure<00:04:50.069> a<00:04:50.400> must-have<00:04:50.970> for
