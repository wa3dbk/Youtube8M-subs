I<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.339> neckline<00:01:05.790> although<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:06.810> my

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
I really like neckline although my my

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.680 
I really like neckline although my my
neck<00:01:07.470> lines<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.890> extra<00:01:08.280> long<00:01:08.570> compared<00:01:09.570> to

neck lines are extra long compared to
most<00:01:09.840> people<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.680> allows<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.550> more

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
most people it allows them a little more

freedom
the<00:01:13.650> shorter<00:01:14.010> necklines<00:01:14.460> keep<00:01:14.790> them<00:01:14.940> close<00:01:15.180> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.650 
there when you get on technical terrain
I<00:01:17.040> feel<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> dogs<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.060> pulled<00:01:18.540> around

here<00:02:08.720> actually<00:02:09.049> he<00:02:09.140> was<00:02:09.259> born<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.679> raised<00:02:09.860> in

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
here actually he was born and raised in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.729 
here actually he was born and raised in
our<00:02:10.130> house<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.989> I've<00:02:11.989> just<00:02:12.260> watched<00:02:12.500> him

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
our house and I've just watched him

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.120 
our house and I've just watched him
develop<00:02:13.069> into<00:02:13.549> that<00:02:13.700> position<00:02:14.769> then<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.920> dogs

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
develop into that position then the dogs

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.650 
develop into that position then the dogs
like<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.370> said<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.880> middle<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.239> team<00:02:17.420> dogs

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
like I said in the middle of team dogs

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.660 
like I said in the middle of team dogs
typically<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.380> put<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.680> fastest<00:02:19.160> dog<00:02:19.370> to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
typically you put your fastest dog to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.300 
typically you put your fastest dog to
the<00:02:19.760> front<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.599> allows<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.530> momentum<00:02:22.160> to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
the front that allows the momentum to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.699 
the front that allows the momentum to
keep<00:02:22.459> going<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.420> put<00:02:23.780> your<00:02:23.959> strongest

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
keep going and you put your strongest

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.160 
keep going and you put your strongest
dog<00:02:24.950> towards<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.610> back<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.630> then<00:02:26.810> if<00:02:27.049> you

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
dog towards the back and then if you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.990 
dog towards the back and then if you
want<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.470> give<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.620> dog<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.890> break<00:02:28.250> say<00:02:28.519> it's<00:02:28.670> run

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
want to give a dog a break say it's run

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.850 
want to give a dog a break say it's run
lead<00:02:29.239> for<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.810> know<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.110> last<00:02:30.260> couple<00:02:30.410> legs

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
lead for you know the last couple legs

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.350 
lead for you know the last couple legs
you<00:02:31.340> stick<00:02:31.549> them<00:02:31.670> right<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.000> middle<00:02:32.209> of

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
you stick them right in the middle of

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.930 
you stick them right in the middle of
teams<00:02:32.690> kind<00:02:32.959> of<00:02:33.110> low<00:02:33.290> pressure<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.860> not<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.340> they

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
teams kind of low pressure is not a they

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000 
teams kind of low pressure is not a they
don't<00:02:35.389> have<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.600> ton<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:35.959> work<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.709> there

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
don't have a ton of work to do there

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.640 
don't have a ton of work to do there
it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.339 
it's
nice<00:02:39.129> relaxed<00:02:39.730> place<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.330> them<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.810> while

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
nice relaxed place for them to be while

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.830 
nice relaxed place for them to be while
they<00:02:41.500> get<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.920> their<00:02:42.790> head<00:02:43.000> back<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
they get on their head back on and

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.199 
they get on their head back on and
conditioning<00:02:44.709> back<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.220> they<00:02:45.400> can<00:02:45.580> run<00:02:45.940> lead

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
conditioning back so they can run lead

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.720 
conditioning back so they can run lead
again<00:02:46.530> some<00:02:47.530> dogs<00:02:47.799> just<00:02:47.920> always<00:02:48.190> want<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.580> be

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
again some dogs just always want to be

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.020 
again some dogs just always want to be
in<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.870> make<00:02:50.080> them<00:02:50.200> face<00:02:51.030> that's

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
in and you just make them face that's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.229 
in and you just make them face that's
pretty<00:02:52.360> much<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.349> sled<00:02:53.709> team<00:02:54.040> consists<00:02:55.030> of

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
pretty much what a sled team consists of

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.110 
pretty much what a sled team consists of
he<00:02:55.720> got<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.019> gang<00:02:56.260> line<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.920> harnesses<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
he got the gang line the harnesses the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.289 
he got the gang line the harnesses the
positions<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.860> command<00:03:00.310> now<00:03:00.970> if<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.209> were

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
positions and the command now if we were

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.759 
positions and the command now if we were
going<00:03:01.629> up<00:03:01.750> here<00:03:01.959> and<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.170> wanted<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.500> make<00:03:02.739> a

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
going up here and I wanted to make a

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.339 
going up here and I wanted to make a
turn<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.489> right<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.730> would<00:03:04.030> say<00:03:04.180> gee<00:03:04.629> if<00:03:05.260> I

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
turn to the right I would say gee if I

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.050 
turn to the right I would say gee if I
wanted<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.739> make<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.040> turn<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.549> left<00:03:06.819> I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
wanted to make it turn to the left I

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.300 
wanted to make it turn to the left I
would<00:03:07.209> say<00:03:07.420> hop<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.110> G<00:03:08.409> means<00:03:08.709> right

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
would say hop so G means right

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.400 
would say hop so G means right
ha<00:03:09.549> means<00:03:09.940> left<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.629> that's<00:03:10.840> pretty<00:03:11.140> standard

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
ha means left and that's pretty standard

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.069 
ha means left and that's pretty standard
there's<00:03:11.799> no<00:03:11.950> other<00:03:12.190> commands<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:13.120> think<00:03:13.930> that

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
there's no other commands I think that

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.300 
there's no other commands I think that
