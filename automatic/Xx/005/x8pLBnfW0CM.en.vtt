00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 friends of the dry windows we have 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.140
 finally received from nokia the new one 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.779
 nokia lumia 720 we are about to run 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 simply unboxing then follo 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.669
 we will try to test it thoroughly as 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.579
 always for you to then execute the 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.509
 full video review 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.430
 let's see the content immediately 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.970
 of the package here it is where 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.590
 we obviously find the phone in 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.290
 very beautiful yellow color here it is 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.230
 here and then quickly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.660
 we should find the key for 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.870
 open the sim port and the memory port 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.109
 cards that are known, however, have already provided 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 let's see this because in fact 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.690
 we find it inside here it is then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 we find micro data cable manuals 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 usb or sd to connect it to the current or 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.690
 to connect headphones to your computer 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.060
 standard so not in here with with 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.780
 microphone has no keys I would say right of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 no 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.160
 exact has no dedicated recalled keys 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.330
 and 3.5 jack and then of course we find 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:29.490
 the wall adapter here it is usb e 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.710
 as I said the key to be able to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.990
 open the various compartments we give 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.930
 a quick look then first 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.300
 very nice aesthetically impressions is 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.060
 a unique piece obviously does not present 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.150
 written there, materials of excellent workmanship 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.270
 as always from nokia 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.579
 let's go see some 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.149
 feature then we see a broad 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.250
 4.3-inch clearblack super display 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.170
 sensitive tag so we have the same 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.530
 possibility of his like on others 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.469
 nokia phones then like 920's 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.019
 be able to use the display also with 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.519
 gloves or objects that are not 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:16.040
 just the fingers the weight is 128 grams 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:21.160
 so I repeat lightly 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:24.700
 we have a 1 ghz processor with 512 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.700
 megabytes of ram 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:33.079
 from the point of view of internal memory 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:38.569
 we have 8 gigabytes that can be 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:41.900
 expanded with a micro sd that I think 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.120
 go or cook which one I remember then 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.459
 we will see it well in the video review 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.370
 full 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:55.330
 we have a camera at the rear from 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:59.010
 6.7 megapixels with focal length of a 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.390
 that is not the lowest focal length 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.890
 never made on a nokia lens device 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.990
 obviously carl zeiss 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.690
 frontally we also find here a 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:15.240
 camera here it is over and obviously i 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.240
 1.3 megapixel camera sensors 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.220
 the battery and the non- removable battery 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:25.270
 because you can't open the Nokia 700 20 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.240
 it's a 2,000 mile per hour battery 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.570
 these three buttons these three buttons 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.910
 why he hadn't followed us to the bar 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.820
 mobile world congress serve for the 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.020
 in fact, wireless charging is possible 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.070
 buy a cover separately 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.050
 connect these three connectors e 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.660
 allows wireless charging as 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:55.740
 precisely on 920 and 820 we finally have 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.959
 the speaker on the right side we have 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.060
 volume control lock unlock 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.120
 left side camera screen 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.560
 completely clean except for the entrance 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.060
 for the sim for I assume frontally 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.370
 superiorly we find the entrance instead 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.030
 I hope for the memory and then input for 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.190
 headphones 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.820
 I would say that for this first impression it is 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.980
 everything I repeat from today we will test it 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.310
 thoroughly and we will create for you 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.940
 usual short and fast video review 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.550
 complete with the new nokia lumia 720 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.590
 sorry for a greeting from francesco colonna 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.590
 for an industry puntonet ciao a tutti
