 well here they were concrete what 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.310
 is that when we go to 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.560
 cut a tree with which we remove the 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.480
 first unit of tree we can throw the 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.609
 tree below and we can collect all 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.369

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.589
 the trunks and so we can go faster

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.580
 what bookstores are these and it's already 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.270
 once and download it in the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.430
 bookstores is the forge you have to create 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.289
 the mods folder to put these two 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.970
 files how the love folder is created 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.340
 because you have to start for the first time 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.120
 minecraft force even if we start what 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.510
 is the client with the forge and good 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.380
 here to edit profile and select what 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.350
 which is below the version of the 172 or 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.170
 the version that will install the phase 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.090
 comfort that like here about 72 conforming 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.310
 ok we give it there and we give it to save 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.410
 profile let's go here is that it's going to load 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.080
 the 172 with force and we give the play 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.750
 Ok now we wait for it to load 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.550
 all this so that the forge does not work 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.550
 and we believe what the mod folder is 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.069
 ok as we have here we have the three 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.340
 default modes of the forge as we see 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.690
 here and that 's it and it will open up to us to create 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.970
 what is the mods folder forge now 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.090
 where you have to copy this you have to go to 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.670
 minecraft directory that you have to 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.670
 press the windows + ere key and we 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.000
 comes out this run and here we put 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.150
 percent percentage data percentage and you 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 we give here accept accept once here 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
 let's go to minecraft point and here we go to 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.340
 the mods folder 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.909
 that the one in which we have created 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.390
 and well now is empty copy what 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.920
 is 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:35.099
 these two mods the ps and the tri capital and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.340
 we paste it first that facÃ­a is to install 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.530
 this would already be installed 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.780
 and now just what you have to do 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.220
 is to start what is the client with the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.590
 forge let's go here 172 from the farc and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.599
 we start to check that it is already 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.200
 installed what is the tri-capita and the 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.200
 psa also 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.090
 we put it big to make it look 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.230
 better this 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.819
 and it's worth here we see 5 better they are the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.489
 3 of the mini croft 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.090
 bs tric petit four is worth now let's 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.700
 a player a map that I have out there 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.640
 and good is going to prove it what there is 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.019
 to do is take a normal ax and 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.190
 current and we see that everything is cut down 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.860
 instantaneously with which we have a 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.260
 tree unit we drop the whole tree 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.440
 directly me how am I in creative 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.270
 it has been cut well quickly but good 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.570
 will go to normal mode what what 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.550
 I would be playing we put a path of 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.689
 zero 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.659
 and it's worth here we see 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:45.929
 that the ax is worth when we go to cut down 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:48.360
 this unit would be cutting this this 

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:51.329
 unit is up here and everything up 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.559
 above all good we will give the 

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:54.979
 unit of the trunk and it's as if 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:59.129
 we were cutting down the six units 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:02.909
 that is how long it would take like 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:05.039
 an ax this are wood we will wait 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.679
 and we would fall all that is the 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.959
 hardware and we will not have to go one by one 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:13.110
 to chopping the grass quotes the trunks and 

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:16.169
 looking up making steps and 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.139
 see, I'll have the heel what it is 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:23.969
 all the wood that yes if they want to go more 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.639
 fast we do not make a diamond ax and 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.789
 now thalamus faster and we will fall 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.610
 all the units of the tree we go here 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.559
 everything has been dropped and a sincerity or 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.670
 quickly installing all the 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.710
