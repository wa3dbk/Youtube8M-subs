and<00:01:58.610> forth<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.270> couple<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.689> times

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and forth like that a couple of times

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.510 
and forth like that a couple of times
that<00:02:00.770> will<00:02:00.950> bring<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.220> on

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.820 

it's<00:02:04.729> there<00:02:05.229> now

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's there now

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.920 
it's there now
you'll<00:02:07.310> know<00:02:07.460> when<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:07.760> on<00:02:07.910> center<00:02:08.360> you

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
you'll know when it's on center you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.630 
you'll know when it's on center you
won't<00:02:09.229> feel<00:02:09.380> that<00:02:09.440> flat<00:02:09.860> tire<00:02:10.160> with<00:02:10.490> them

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
won't feel that flat tire with them

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.850 
won't feel that flat tire with them
anymore

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
anymore

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.210 

so<00:02:13.860> after<00:02:14.130> centering<00:02:15.470> need<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> open<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> ball

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so after centering need to open the ball

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.070 
so after centering need to open the ball
play<00:02:18.560> opening<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:21.060> cupping<00:02:21.720> my<00:02:21.840> hands

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
play opening it's just cupping my hands

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.710 
play opening it's just cupping my hands
around<00:02:22.260> touching<00:02:23.160> my<00:02:23.459> thumbs<00:02:23.700> together<00:02:23.910> and

around touching my thumbs together and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.960 
around touching my thumbs together and
pressing<00:02:25.260> them<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.680> into<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.550> center<00:02:28.970> then

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
pressing them down into the center then

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.580 
pressing them down into the center then
I'm<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.300> bring<00:02:30.420> my<00:02:30.630> thumb's<00:02:30.900> upwards

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
I'm going to bring my thumb's upwards

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.270 
I'm going to bring my thumb's upwards
and<00:02:31.890> outwards<00:02:32.120> towards<00:02:33.120> my<00:02:33.450> hands<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:35.130> make

many to get the wall as soon as I want
it<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.530> there's<00:03:49.530> nothing<00:03:49.769> wrong<00:03:49.920> with

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
it to be there's nothing wrong with

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.009 
it to be there's nothing wrong with
doing<00:03:50.220> four<00:03:50.519> holes<00:03:50.790> five<00:03:51.180> holes<00:03:51.569> but<00:03:51.870> the

it's absorbing the weaker it's going to

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.190 
it's absorbing the weaker it's going to
be<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.340> sometimes<00:03:59.790> it<00:03:59.970> can<00:04:00.120> collapse<00:04:00.299> just

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
be so sometimes it can collapse just
