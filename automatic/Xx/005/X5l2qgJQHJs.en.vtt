00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
exciting and something that would just

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.900 
exciting and something that would just
make<00:00:47.470> my<00:00:47.649> running<00:00:47.920> even<00:00:48.070> better<00:00:48.280> than<00:00:48.579> what<00:00:48.880> it

was<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.500> polkas<00:00:50.500> were<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.890> one<00:00:51.430> could<00:00:51.730> choose

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
was and polkas were the one could choose

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.120 
was and polkas were the one could choose
to<00:00:52.329> change<00:00:52.510> my<00:00:52.720> life<00:00:52.930> for<00:00:53.140> sure<00:00:53.170> first<00:00:53.770> time<00:00:54.100> I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
to change my life for sure first time I

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.700 
to change my life for sure first time I
saw<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.520> hook<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.390> thought<00:00:55.960> there's<00:00:56.530> no<00:00:56.620> way

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
saw the hook is I thought there's no way

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.620 
saw the hook is I thought there's no way
these<00:00:57.010> things<00:00:57.070> will<00:00:57.370> work<00:00:57.550> but<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.120> put<00:00:58.390> them<00:00:58.480> on

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
these things will work but I put them on

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.110 
these things will work but I put them on
and<00:00:59.110> after<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.590> week<00:00:59.829> of<00:01:00.010> running<00:01:00.190> them<00:01:00.460> my

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
and after a week of running them my

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.740 
and after a week of running them my
running<00:01:01.870> just<00:01:02.309> completely<00:01:03.309> changed<00:01:03.879> entirely

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
running just completely changed entirely

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.919 
running just completely changed entirely
I<00:01:05.170> thought<00:01:05.619> it<00:01:05.680> was<00:01:05.920> running<00:01:06.929> recovering

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:07.929 
I thought it was running recovering

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.039 
I thought it was running recovering
faster<00:01:08.409> I<00:01:08.679> was<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:10.149> know<00:01:10.179> not<00:01:10.299> getting<00:01:10.929> beat

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
faster I was you know not getting beat

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.440 
faster I was you know not getting beat
up<00:01:11.079> and<00:01:11.590> my<00:01:11.950> performance<00:01:12.369> time<00:01:12.880> far<00:01:13.179> as<00:01:13.270> race

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
up and my performance time far as race

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.599 
up and my performance time far as race
and<00:01:13.659> I<00:01:13.719> started<00:01:14.020> using<00:01:14.229> them<00:01:14.439> or<00:01:14.979> even<00:01:15.069> faster

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
and I started using them or even faster

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.629 
and I started using them or even faster
I<00:01:15.789> got<00:01:15.999> alternate<00:01:16.329> of<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.539> year<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:18.490> was

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:18.639 
I got alternate of the year and I was

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.209 
I got alternate of the year and I was
winning<00:01:19.149> races<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:20.079> I<00:01:20.229> was<00:01:20.380> right<00:01:21.009> after

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
winning races and I was right after

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.800 
winning races and I was right after
trying<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.880> hook<00:01:22.029> is<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.420> really<00:01:22.539> getting

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
trying the hook is and really getting

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.959 
trying the hook is and really getting
into<00:01:22.990> them<00:01:23.289> I<00:01:23.469> used<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.859> run<00:01:24.069> in<00:01:24.310> in<00:01:24.700> very

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
into them I used to run in in very

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.769

lightweight pretty thin soled shoes and

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:29.849 
lightweight pretty thin soled shoes and
they're<00:01:28.899> pretty<00:01:29.049> fast<00:01:29.319> and<00:01:29.529> I<00:01:29.619> really<00:01:29.770> like

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
they're pretty fast and I really like

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.919 
they're pretty fast and I really like
their<00:01:29.979> performance<00:01:30.579> but<00:01:30.819> once<00:01:31.270> i<00:01:31.389> tried<00:01:31.659> hook

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
their performance but once i tried hook

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.499 
their performance but once i tried hook
is<00:01:32.109> i<00:01:32.319> found<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:33.429> know<00:01:33.459> i'll<00:01:33.999> never<00:01:34.060> go

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
is i found that you know i'll never go

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.419 
is i found that you know i'll never go
back<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.719> anything<00:01:35.079> else<00:01:35.349> because<00:01:35.740> i<00:01:36.369> know

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
back to anything else because i know

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.429 
back to anything else because i know
that<00:01:36.639> there's<00:01:37.029> pretty<00:01:37.689> much<00:01:37.749> nothing<00:01:37.990> as<00:01:38.259> good

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
that there's pretty much nothing as good

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.169 
that there's pretty much nothing as good
as<00:01:38.590> okay<00:01:38.859> your<00:01:39.219> body<00:01:39.399> won't<00:01:39.609> get<00:01:39.789> his<00:01:39.880> beat<00:01:40.060> up

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
as okay your body won't get his beat up

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.569 
as okay your body won't get his beat up
as<00:01:40.359> fast<00:01:40.539> you<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:40.929> run<00:01:41.079> more<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:42.219> can<00:01:42.369> recover

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
as fast you can run more you can recover

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.809 
as fast you can run more you can recover
faster<00:01:43.289> even<00:01:44.289> during<00:01:44.529> a<00:01:44.679> race<00:01:44.889> you<00:01:45.159> should<00:01:45.399> try

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
faster even during a race you should try

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.690 
faster even during a race you should try
them<00:01:46.060> because<00:01:46.419> you're<00:01:47.020> you're<00:01:47.679> gonna<00:01:48.520> be
