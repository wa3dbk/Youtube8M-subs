00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
home I've been to the gym I've been to

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.830 
home I've been to the gym I've been to
the<00:03:45.360> Costco<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:46.380> been<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> long<00:03:46.799> day<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
the Costco it's been a long day but the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.940 
the Costco it's been a long day but the
chips<00:03:49.170> are<00:03:49.410> get<00:03:49.680> it

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
chips are get it

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.259

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
I think they'd be crisp from a lot of

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.030 
I think they'd be crisp from a lot of
air<00:03:51.510> dry<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> little<00:03:51.959> bit<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.410> here's<00:03:52.739> what<00:03:52.950> it

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
air dry a little bit but here's what it
