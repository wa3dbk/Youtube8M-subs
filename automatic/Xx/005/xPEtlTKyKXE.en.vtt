00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.839
 find one finds oneself for the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.620
 unpacking number 2 with four packs 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.120
 we hope for heavy in any case it is the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.370
 second unpacking so maybe 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.500
 unfortunately will not have 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.869
 very heavy the players very rare but 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 I hope less to see I do not know 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.000
 me of the game 'change is really 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.010
 milk big tits big guys 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.449
 sound of this card game but we will 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 see anyway what we propose these 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.929
 three packs so I did not open I 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.880
 not look at the cards so just have them 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.610
 returned and I placed the cover 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.180
 on it so we'll see what's in store for me 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.820
 I will find out with you so good that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.180
 bassidj a high level midfielder 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.590
 with a gaming organization at 80.1 80 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.000
 in attack and more that they had 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 versatile enough for the expo both in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.129
 attack 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 finally if someone thinks we 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.719
 beat an interesting then steven 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.460
 who is a dynamo player 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.989
 so who is able to evolve a little 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.730
 everywhere on the ground can place in 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 defense in the middle or in attack 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.310
 on the other hand it is better to use it in 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 value of games organization as well 84 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.250
 it's rather interesting for the Belgian 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.320
 then italy + 5 at the level of the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.790
 game organization value for any 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.140
 the Italian team if we line up 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.520
 Italian players in his game 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.740
 I may have because a question game 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.530
 contest for for this draw of cards 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.780
 so we will see well analyzed what 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.130
 I propose you in video interesting there 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.680
 they are motivated the Italians then 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.940
 Turkish due with mehmet topal my 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.710
 interesting but hey it's true 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.110
 it's a little bit weak anyway 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.250
 level of the game I hope we see well 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.710
 anyway since do not know her 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.759
 a lot of brightness 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.979
 I should have activated the flash 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.670
 but I removed it ignace and beach 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.190
 Sergeant Ignatiev Rus 82nd in defense 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.060
 an interesting too but hey it's true 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.039
 that it's not yet a wolf 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.530
 unfortunately to a French one 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.259
 French more I had not manga 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.100
 there that has a defense note enough 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.860
 interesting too 86 earlier I'm waiting 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.200
 to have team cards to see 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 improved sector some sectors to 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.930
 plus 5 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.700
 it might be interesting to do 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.350
 a team a little bit French because 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.350
 they are not bad the French 2nd 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:26.980
 not a second pack of cards 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:29.500
 so who did you pavel kader with 1 82 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.730
 years defending be good i hope this 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.739
 is not very interesting 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:41.370
 oh oh oh papa papa daddy gueye 'change 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.840
 with cristiano ronaldo 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.560
 lalalalalalalalala it's worth all the gold 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.150
 of the world 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.820
 but someone who told me that he 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.320
 had four is the one to whom he has 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.440
 four times fucking but the huge sense in 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.209
 attack where I'll write it to you 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.160
 in the virtual game and I'll get it to you 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.540
 direct line 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:05.320
 cristiano ronaldo enormous enormous at 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.090
 fucking then +5 for belgium all 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.019
 Belgian players in all 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.730
 play areas 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.329
 but what if I had it already 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.510
 belgium no I do not think he continues 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:23.579
 to continue the album walter birsa valter 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:27.060
 birsa - the Slovenian player josÃ© holebas 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.060
 the Greek player 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.600
 czech fabregas yeah that's not so 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.160
 badly especially in attack and in the middle of 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.140
 terrain so worth organizational 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.590
 game it's pretty good the t1 finally 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.490
 interesting the very very spanish player 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.709
 well 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.230
 third package at ease in malaysia at 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.090
 it's a little bit over the water but 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.130
 I already had that I think so 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.239
 it's not new 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.410
 finally we wanted a little bit of 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.720
 best ratings for the same game 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.300
 king choice 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.720
 so it's a rising Norwegian star the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.850
 Notes 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.110
 yeah you have to have courage for them 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.269
 lines and him + 5 for the value 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.739
 of Swedish gaming organization 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.600
 ask them the tan lin I would like 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.350
 see tamla a second gain of 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.900
 change eur I do not like what is 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.260
 among the game 'change that and grind 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.030
 gza because the Swiss player 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.419
 interesting also especially in value 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.830
 of game organization and had to quickly that 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.180
 t hopping him hurts us 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.340
 the team of France look at me these 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.120
 notes he deserves even better there is 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.250
 open the mark 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.350
 he's pretty good midfielder 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.770
 it's clear at 81.2 saas etc and then we 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.910
 attack that deserves a see at 80 m 1 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:48.470
 our little axel witzel then from the adq 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.330
 to the Austrian player juno beach who has 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.600
 notes also of courage for 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.080
 align him but in random way is 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.090
 not a 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.260
 not terrible it's good players here 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.510
 what is it like everything in any game he 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.710
 there are players who are worse 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.180
 latest packs hoping maybe a 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:09.560
 second game change m with alan dzagoev 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.390
 end the russian which is a while notes 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.729
 been good at the euro 2012 we thought of them 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.710
 iweb but finally riad the notes 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.880
 sahara he has not he was not 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.240
 transcending lately so 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.770
 opaque oil gas r11 rising star it seems 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.600
 not young but young people wearing would say 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.120
 since he's rising storm and his notes 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.169
 are not are 18 in attack of which 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.789
 yet this is his favorite area 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.940
 turkey + 5 for the whole team so I 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.860
 believe that there is a lot of 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.320
 of interest align Turkish players 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.880
 since then press that I open them they 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.890
 are afraid of stratospheric notes 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.510
 reading so but it can be 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.390
 interesting for the collector that 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.800
 I am but but that's all I had 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.070
 maybe already I already had that one of 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.530
 turkey besides we see it here it is 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.760
 already there under the album we have trouble doing 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.680
 of the focus on the movies 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.870

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.460
 continue my album hand jan vertonghen 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.950
 to the messiah but how is this thing him? 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.840
 lol households the intrigues that now 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.390
 or double or double double I know 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.720
 more in any case I'll put it with 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.210

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:20.520
 then Russian fight to the ends mouais 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:24.990

 Romanian mayte razvan rat you who is I 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:33.270

 favorite women thanks van praet 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.110
 way he has been missed who also among the 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.910
 the fans this favoritism 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:46.140
 Well listen here we leave here 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:49.410

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.650
 this unpacking of who is it 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.650
