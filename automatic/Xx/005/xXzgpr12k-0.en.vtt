00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.780
 [Music] 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.780
 an order to carry 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.130
 but I'm real envying at least with 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.619
 us on television 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.950

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.079
 of asghar by font is stained as not 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.270
 I would think you can not do your trick 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.760
 magic and make it disappear clear that 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.220
 I can but that's not the point then 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.620
 what is the point to look amazing myself 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.450
 you have to respect the appearance this 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.400
 it took me years to put it together some are 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.680
 stolen some are bought and some 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.140
 I made them myself is the best disguise in 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.900
 this place and it's irreplaceable seriously 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.450
 the best then why are not you 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.750

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.970
 speaking if you know it's fine 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.190
 do not stop laughing 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.880

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.590

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.350
 that only you, by the way, wants to know 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.410

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.000

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.780

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.940

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.950
 magical there I already told you that my wand 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.590
 magic can not be replaced by a 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.290
 cheap plastic designed by a monkey 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.360
 talking about replacing things I have to 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.820
 say could serve a better 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.490
 hot appearance that what you 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.080

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.400
 Great fat tunics is what I already 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.770
 he said but so boring bored then 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.260
 what do you suggest the flakes are a 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.600
 good for start we are looking for 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.880
 functional sprint and me with your arms 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.640
 inexplicable accessories extras can 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.860
 be good the handlebar type mustache 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.840
 classic about a little fire 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.650
 changing your appearance is considered one 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.099
 more expensive 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:26.200
 hide in your heart your voice is like being 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.079
 completely incomprehensible that you're 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.480
 saying that is what you are saying 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:34.840
 so what do you say bald, at least not 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.530
 add a mask would help with you know 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.620
 that you are aware that no 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.400
 you have a nose, that's enough, that's 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.519
 all 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.349
 my appearance is evil and terrifying me 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.870
 caused adults to cow up 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.269
 fear I have children lie down in 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.579
 their beds awaiting nightmares and that 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.200
 shrink from every shadow on the wall all 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.250
 the living creatures fear me for the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.239
 death of their souls 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.200
 so the bar of the villains 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.200
 disaster 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.040
 I believe that the costumes are 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.890
 overrated because you look 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.459
 beautifully darling love darling you 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.459
 destroy 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.160
 next whiskey
