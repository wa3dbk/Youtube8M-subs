00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.959
 very good afternoon at this time 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.210
 we interrupted channel 6 programming 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.160
 to carry the information that is generated 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.290
 at this time from the vicinity 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 from the pretty village of alajuela where 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.289
 Unfortunately there was an accident 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.019
 transit between a car and a trailer 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.409
 that leaves the unfortunate balance of two 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:25.380
 dead people two women mother e 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.089
 daughter preliminarily died when 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.249
 the vehicle they were traveling in tried 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.589
 take a turn to enter the sector 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:35.010
 of pretty villa and a trailer doubts 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.359
 impact dragging the 100 meters me 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
 I find at this moment with gift 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.280
 Mauritius stone that will expand us more 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 the situation that happened in Mauritius 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.000
 you can explain the sequence 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.589
 of the accident very good afternoon very 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.329
 Good afternoon, good, unfortunately 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.900
 we are with this very painful situation 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.620
 true the loss of two lives 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.640
 to licenses unfortunately 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.130
 apparently the causes are a mirage 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.190
 undue due to comments made by the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.330
 witnesses and a relative of the victims 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 due to road congestion 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.110
 infected by the manifestation of the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.860
 porters they wanted to cut 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.660
 road running a turn not allowed 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.880
 impacts being impacted by the trailer 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.290
 Mauritius 100 meters of drag 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.270
 approximately according to the footprint of 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.130
 braking could be about 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.260
 100 meters of grace remember that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.670
 these articulated vehicles I ignore in 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.070
 this moment if this vehicle 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.750
 involved comes loaded but time 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.280
 of braking of these vehicles is very 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.470
 different where a motor vehicle 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 green to a Mauritian car maybe 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.250
 this explains why a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.979
 large mobilization of authorities 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.720
 there are even three minors if not 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.700
 I'm wrong injured and one of them 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.990
 moved by helicopter to the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
 national children's hospital so that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.770
 you explain to us are two minors of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.450
 age a male of about 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.880
 eleven years and a girl who could be 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.920
 Between the age of 14 the girl was transferred 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.200
 aerial by force helicopter 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.180
 public hospital of children and the minor 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.189
 he was transferred in more stable condition 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.509
 at the hospital mexico mauricio has achieved 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.400
 you talk to the driver of the 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.860
 trailer that he has shown them 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.890
 we have not particularly I can not 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.450
 dialogue with him what he expressed was that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.090
 the vehicles looked and he could not 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.590
 avoid the impact was made the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.910
 alcohol test the same saw negative 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.530

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.150
 normal to drive to shore 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.460

 transit officer who attended this 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.780

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.210

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.160
