00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.840
 money place 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.790
 I believe that Jesus also said this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.230
 I don't know if the second one has gone, maybe it has 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.300
 said the signature everyone thought uric of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.219
 rather elaborate and had one 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.110
 security that attracted me like one 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 magnet my father taught me to 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.020
 believe that everyone is good and that I have to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.020
 be good to everyone 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.090
 life is ridiculous and you know you don't 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.649

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.640
 in front of your father a great theme 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.859

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.619
 no longer has a homeland 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:10.970

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.970
 ok and you do 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.460
 have you ever had to find a way to 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.259
 survive and even if yours 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.539
 possibilities were 0 you had to 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.860
 survive we have been successful for 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.360
 so much time because we have 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.770
 kept a low profile if you had 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.659
 as successful as ever now 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.619

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.240

 you are wrong we must succeed in 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.119
 to deceive all those people is only to 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.250
 this we have to think about now 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.920
 we must be able to deceive everything 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.340
