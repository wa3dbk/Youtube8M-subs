very top this pad rests on the top of
the<00:00:45.539> yoke<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.860> pass<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.399> strap<00:00:47.760> around

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440

the<00:00:49.440> yolk<00:00:50.250> doesn't<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.590> perfect<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the yolk doesn't have to be perfect the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.069 
the yolk doesn't have to be perfect the
first<00:00:53.280> time<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.629> could<00:00:54.750> tighten<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
first time because we could tighten it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.779 
first time because we could tighten it
up<00:00:55.140> later<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.980> take<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> other<00:00:56.399> two

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
up later then you take the other two

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
up later then you take the other two
straps<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> pass<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.719> over<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> sides<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
straps and pass it over the sides of the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.709 
straps and pass it over the sides of the
yoke<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.250> you<00:01:00.239> crisscross<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.870> underneath

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
yoke and you crisscross them underneath

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.969 
yoke and you crisscross them underneath
that<00:01:03.719> was<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> tighten<00:01:04.589> things

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that was a good time to tighten things

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
that was a good time to tighten things
up<00:01:05.720> now<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.990> haven't<00:01:07.229> mounted<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.689> it's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
up now that you haven't mounted and it's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.460 
up now that you haven't mounted and it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
models my model is ipad 1 so it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.109 
models my model is ipad 1 so it's
thicker<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.610> need<00:01:29.790> these<00:01:29.939> these

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
thicker so I don't need these these

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.800 
thicker so I don't need these these
simply<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.840> removed<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.810> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
simply can be removed like that you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.090 
simply can be removed like that you
install<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> mount<00:01:34.500> now

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
right here with this one you're looking

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.600 
right here with this one you're looking

is the clamp on the column if you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.490 
is the clamp on the column if you

forward<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.220> could<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.430> could<00:02:11.820> actually

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
forward it could it could actually

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.990 
forward it could it could actually
inhibit<00:02:12.660> your<00:02:12.810> elevator<00:02:13.200> travel<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.000> cause

inhibit your elevator travel and cause

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.120 
inhibit your elevator travel and cause
problems<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:15.959> did<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.500> once<00:02:16.709> when<00:02:17.100> I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
problems I actually did that once when I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.360 
problems I actually did that once when I
was<00:02:17.340> adjusting<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.470> yoke<00:02:19.470> or<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.890> iPad<00:02:20.280> or

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
the RAM mount in flight and it actually

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.220 
the RAM mount in flight and it actually
restricted<00:02:23.910> my<00:02:24.030> elevator<00:02:24.420> travel<00:02:24.810> forward

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
restricted my elevator travel forward

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.630 
restricted my elevator travel forward
and<00:02:25.380> caused<00:02:25.650> problems<00:02:25.860> I'd<00:02:26.130> put<00:02:26.250> my<00:02:26.370> flaps

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and caused problems I'd put my flaps

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.750 
and caused problems I'd put my flaps
down<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:28.380> removing<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.040> even<00:02:29.430> easier

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
down and now removing is even easier

the<00:03:10.799> reason<00:03:11.070> why<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.730> iPad<00:03:12.030> yoke

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
the reason why I like the iPad yoke

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.479 
the reason why I like the iPad yoke
mount<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.690> much<00:03:12.810> better<00:03:13.019> is<00:03:13.380> it's<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:14.040> lot<00:03:14.280> less

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
mount so much better is it's a lot less

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.479 
mount so much better is it's a lot less
complicated<00:03:14.850> than<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.510> RAM<00:03:15.720> mount<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:17.280> ease

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
complicated than the RAM mount the ease

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.670 
complicated than the RAM mount the ease
of<00:03:17.519> mounting<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.329> similar<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.260> using<00:03:19.440> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
of mounting is similar to using the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.199 
of mounting is similar to using the
clamps<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.250> RAM<00:03:20.489> mount<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.060> have

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
clamps on the RAM mount you just have

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.479 
clamps on the RAM mount you just have
the<00:03:21.360> three<00:03:21.570> straps<00:03:21.870> it's<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:22.860> sturdy<00:03:23.220> it's

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
the three straps it's very sturdy it's

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.270 
the three straps it's very sturdy it's
just<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> sturdy<00:03:24.150> as<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.540> RAM<00:03:24.720> mount<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.890> it

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
just the sturdy as the RAM mount but it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.370 
just the sturdy as the RAM mount but it
has<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.670> advantage<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:27.299> not<00:03:27.390> blocking<00:03:28.170> your

instruments like the RAM mount does so

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.449 
instruments like the RAM mount does so
it's<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.170> great<00:03:37.350> improvement<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.920> will<00:03:38.070> never<00:03:38.250> go
