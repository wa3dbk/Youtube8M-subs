00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
everyone brian here from flood studios

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.940 
everyone brian here from flood studios
so<00:00:06.060> we've<00:00:06.210> received<00:00:06.629> our<00:00:06.750> second<00:00:07.109> c100<00:00:07.830> this

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
so we've received our second c100 this

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.009 
so we've received our second c100 this
week<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.490> thought<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.269> would<00:00:09.360> do<00:00:09.480> some<00:00:09.690> audio

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
week and thought it would do some audio

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.959 
week and thought it would do some audio
testing<00:00:10.679> test<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.130> few<00:00:11.280> different<00:00:11.550> shotgun

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
testing test a few different shotgun

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.690 
testing test a few different shotgun
mics<00:00:12.210> compared<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.530> built<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.009> shotgun

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
mics compared to the built in shotgun

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.720 
mics compared to the built in shotgun
mic<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.420> c100<00:00:16.049> handle<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.250> i<00:00:17.340> said<00:00:17.369> we

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
mic on the c100 handle so like i said we

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.939 
mic on the c100 handle so like i said we
wanted<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.210> some<00:00:18.480> audio<00:00:19.170> testing<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.859> we're

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
wanted to do some audio testing so we're

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.540 
wanted to do some audio testing so we're
going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> test<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:22.189> microphones<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.369> come

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
going to test the microphones that come

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.880 
going to test the microphones that come
with<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.240> canon<00:00:24.630> versus<00:00:25.470> our<00:00:26.340> old<00:00:26.789> DSLR

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
with the the canon versus our old DSLR

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.479 
with the the canon versus our old DSLR
rode<00:00:28.890> mic<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.480> i<00:00:30.480> picked<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
rode mic or i picked this one up this is

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.030 
rode mic or i picked this one up this is
the<00:00:32.610> ntg-2<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.010> that<00:00:35.010> allows<00:00:35.219> us<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.700> XLR

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
the ntg-2 and that allows us to go XLR

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
the ntg-2 and that allows us to go XLR
so<00:00:38.040> first<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.850> 100<00:00:39.059> microphones

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so first we have to see 100 microphones

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.430 
so first we have to see 100 microphones
that<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.020> built<00:00:40.260> into<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> handle<00:00:42.440> they

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that are built into the handle they

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.850 
that are built into the handle they
might<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.739> good<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:43.920> referencing<00:00:44.640> sound

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
might be good for referencing sound

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.110 
might be good for referencing sound
probably<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.180> good<00:00:48.180> enough<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:49.550> actual<00:00:50.550> use

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
probably not good enough for actual use

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
probably not good enough for actual use
of<00:00:51.149> audio<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.170> maybe<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.739> syncing<00:00:53.129> or

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of audio but maybe for syncing or

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.959 
of audio but maybe for syncing or
something<00:00:53.670> like<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> second<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
something like that so second up is a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.810 
something like that so second up is a
rode<00:00:57.390> videomic<00:00:57.960> which<00:00:58.289> runs<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.649> about<00:00:58.829> $150

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
rode videomic which runs for about $150

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.720 
rode videomic which runs for about $150
and<00:01:00.170> as<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.469> tell<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> step<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.550> from

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and as you can tell it is a step up from

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.429 
and as you can tell it is a step up from
the<00:01:03.090> c100<00:01:03.809> mics<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> handle<00:01:05.840> lastly<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the c100 mics on the handle lastly the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.280 
the c100 mics on the handle lastly the
rode<00:01:07.619> ntg-2<00:01:08.280> shotgun<00:01:09.000> microphone<00:01:09.479> which<00:01:10.020> runs

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
rode ntg-2 shotgun microphone which runs

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.450 
rode ntg-2 shotgun microphone which runs
for<00:01:10.439> about<00:01:10.530> 279<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.220> think

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
for about 279 so all in all we do think

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.370 
for about 279 so all in all we do think
this<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> best<00:01:15.180> sounding<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this one is the best sounding like it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
this one is the best sounding like it
has<00:01:16.560> less<00:01:16.799> hiss<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> less<00:01:17.580> background<00:01:17.850> noise

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
has less hiss and less background noise

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:28.340 
has less hiss and less background noise
out<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:18.930> three

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.340 

you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.090 

you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:53.710 

you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:15.280 

you

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.349 

you
