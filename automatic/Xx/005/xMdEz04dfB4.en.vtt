00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
actually I higher base speed than we

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.150 
actually I higher base speed than we
vile<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.770> I'm<00:00:17.060> faster<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.510> he<00:00:18.750> does<00:00:19.020> use<00:00:19.590> I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
shard so that's pretty bad for me but I

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.470 
shard so that's pretty bad for me but I
do<00:00:23.220> get<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> care<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.820> his<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.060> file<00:00:24.269> and

which<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> sucks<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.590> means<00:00:37.710> i

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
which kind of sucks because that means i

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.139 
which kind of sucks because that means i
could<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.160> set<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> stuff<00:00:38.760> rocks<00:00:39.350> but<00:00:40.350> um

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
could have set up the stuff rocks but um

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.900 
could have set up the stuff rocks but um
he<00:00:42.149> meteor<00:00:42.420> mash<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.260> he<00:00:44.190> gains<00:00:44.460> attack

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
he meteor mash me and he gains attack

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.240 
he meteor mash me and he gains attack
which<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.809> annoying<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.890> i<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.010> get

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
which is really annoying but i do get

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.490 
which is really annoying but i do get
the<00:00:47.340> lead<00:00:47.520> seat<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.879> them<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
the lead seat on them and now that I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.580 
the lead seat on them and now that I
don't<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.829> hippo<00:00:50.340> down<00:00:50.520> anymore<00:00:51.590> celebes

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
don't have hippo down anymore celebes

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
don't have hippo down anymore celebes
effectiveness<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:54.020> increased<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
effectiveness is increased because the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.599 
effectiveness is increased because the
leftovers<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> gate<00:00:58.559> by<00:00:58.800> sandstorm<00:00:59.430> so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
leftovers is in the gate by sandstorm so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
leftovers is in the gate by sandstorm so
that's<00:00:59.730> kind<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> cool<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> recover

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
that's kind of cool and I recover

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.110 
that's kind of cool and I recover
expecting<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> damage

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
expecting that to do a lot of damage

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.310 
expecting that to do a lot of damage
knows<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:05.420> at<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.689> point<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.049> really

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
knows right at this point I have really

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
knows right at this point I have really
high<00:01:07.439> GP<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.100> could<00:01:08.250> survive<00:01:08.630> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
high GP I think I could survive to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
high GP I think I could survive to
meteor<00:01:09.900> mashes<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> point<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.369> decided

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
meteor mashes at this point so I decided

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.910 
meteor mashes at this point so I decided
to<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> call<00:01:12.330> mines<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to go for the call mines here and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.999 
to go for the call mines here and
actually<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.250> hack<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.939> once<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:16.009> um

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
actually get hack see for once so um

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700 
actually get hack see for once so um
yeah<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.790> pretty<00:01:17.939> cool<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.450> me<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.500> cool

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
yeah it's pretty cool for me not so cool

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800

Celebi<00:02:20.800> luckily<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.860> don't<00:02:22.130> die<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.390> that's

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
Celebi luckily I don't die so that's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.590

was<00:02:30.709> predicting<00:02:31.069> a<00:02:31.100> switch<00:02:31.459> but<00:02:31.880> still<00:02:32.569> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
was predicting a switch but still I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.050 
was predicting a switch but still I
guess<00:02:34.580> he<00:02:34.820> /<00:02:35.030> predicted<00:02:35.480> they're<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:36.050> little

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
