door now I know you can get the so print

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.799 
door now I know you can get the so print
by<00:00:32.279> playing<00:00:32.640> around<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.450> special

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
by playing around a bit in this special

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.780 
by playing around a bit in this special
guest<00:00:33.989> referee<00:00:34.170> matches<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.430> other<00:00:35.610> than

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
guest referee matches but other than

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.700 
guest referee matches but other than
that<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.170> possible<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that way I don't think it's possible to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
that way I don't think it's possible to
do<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> recent<00:00:38.460> games<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.090> there's<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
do in the recent games and there's a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
do in the recent games and there's a
couple<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.140> reasons<00:00:40.320> why<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.950> might<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
couple of reasons why this might be a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.630 
couple of reasons why this might be a
good<00:00:41.700> addition<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:43.050> 15<00:00:43.430> firstly<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
good addition to to get 15 firstly it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.190 
good addition to to get 15 firstly it
just<00:00:44.850> might<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.180> nice<00:00:45.390> change<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
just might be a nice change from the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
just might be a nice change from the
normal<00:00:46.530> spare<00:00:46.950> powerbomb<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:47.789> slam<00:00:48.270> through

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
normal spare powerbomb or slam through

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
normal spare powerbomb or slam through
the<00:00:48.750> cell<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.200> order<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.500> exit<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:50.010> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the cell in order to exit from it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.880 
the cell in order to exit from it
secondly<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.539> door<00:00:51.719> now<00:00:51.899> off<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.739> would

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
secondly the door now off that would

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.950 
secondly the door now off that would
open<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> possibility<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.329> managed

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
open up the possibility of managed

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
open up the possibility of managed
interference<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:56.010> even<00:00:56.520> ally<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.030> rival

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
interference or even ally or rival

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
interference or even ally or rival
interference<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.620> isn't<00:00:58.890> necessarily<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
interference which isn't necessarily the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.069 
interference which isn't necessarily the
sort<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> thing<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> want<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> see<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
sort of thing you want to see all the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
sort of thing you want to see all the
time<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.890> would<00:01:01.980> definitely<00:01:02.489> it'd<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> nice

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
time but would definitely it'd be a nice

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
time but would definitely it'd be a nice
change<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.690> potentially<00:01:04.530> open<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.040> some<00:01:05.339> most

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
change and potentially open up some most

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.520 
change and potentially open up some most
storyline<00:01:05.939> developments<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.900> universe<00:01:07.260> mode

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
storyline developments for universe mode

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.070 
storyline developments for universe mode
and<00:01:07.710> custom<00:01:08.010> stories<00:01:08.780> second<00:01:09.780> improvement

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and custom stories second improvement

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.410 
and custom stories second improvement
would<00:01:10.500> beat<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> ability<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.670> actually<00:01:12.240> have

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
would beat the ability to actually have

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
would beat the ability to actually have
weapons<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.080> top<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> cell<00:01:13.830> itself<00:01:14.220> now<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
weapons on top of the cell itself now I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
weapons on top of the cell itself now I
don't<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.360> how<00:01:15.479> many<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.750> guys<00:01:16.020> would

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
don't know how many of you guys would

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.050 
don't know how many of you guys would
