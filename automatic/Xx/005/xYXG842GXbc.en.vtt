00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi to all those guys have 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.480
 Welcome to this place of assassin's 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.240
 creed robin whose boys harpoon oar 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.670
 two very powerful marine animals 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.469
 or the humpback whale and the sperm whale the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.269
 first animal already in front of us vi 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 show clearly on the map where it is 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 find but i can't be sure of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.539
 fact that you too will be here 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.609
 I found it precisely in this position 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.769
 so guys we approach him and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.119
 I remember I already made two videos of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.910
 hunting for marine animals 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.769
 then or already harpooned already four 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.170
 animals should be found links 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.090
 of these videos and description or vi 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 just click on the thumbnails now 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.200
 however you see on the screen now we are 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.270
 almost very close to this animal 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 let's see there it is already seen then 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.719
 guys we operate as usual the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.129
 Our CEI is raised towards the enemy 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.780
 incumbent, however, these two 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.460
 they should be a little more durable 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.649
 above the usual, especially the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.750
 sperm whale let's see where there it is not there 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.840
 I see it should be giant and indeed 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.559
 guys, don't tell me what it was like 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.090
 you miss it I really want to 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.229
 capture it in record time for which I have to 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 take a little care 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.000
 I remind you that at the moment my harpoon 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.090
 and that boosted to the maximum that end 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 did the humpback whale ok I see it missed 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 boys but how the hell is it possible 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 should be down here because of me 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.799
 is pulling if you could find yourself hitting 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.140
 here it is I see it missing or 25 actions if 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.210
 I miss this opportunity 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.880
 really just a fool and here is if 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 my humpback whale failed ok now though 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.200
 I took it and look at how much life 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.049
 take away my harpoon now it's almost a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.840
 earth voltage as soon as it appears of 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.180
 new guy with the tax, here she is if mine 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.549
 I've done it 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.200
 I know yes or maybe not succeeded in 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.659
 run away 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.149
 look at life is very low if you do 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.530
 assists charge at maximum the harpoon is 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.920
 then we catch him we try the failure 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.869
 wait up 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.450
 I don't know if you've noticed but to the actions 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.500
 let's see if it comes out from 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.310
 somewhere 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.350
 here I don't see you guys then let's turn around 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.750
 a little around I don't think it will appear 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.760
 here from below no yes guys here is the sta 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.780
 coming is mine 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.240
 if it is my hit, I took it, yes I have it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.100
 made us a nice trick of 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.340
 appear suddenly in front of us 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:32.610
 but because it doesn't appear, it's really huge 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.050
 so no staining happens well 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.240
 we got a beautiful humpback whale 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.670
 it is also a bone among other things I remind you 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.320
 that managing to get all type 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.420
 skins or you go there we can manufacture 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.650
 new clothes for shay by the way the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.900
 sperm whale is in this position 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.209
 so let's take a quick trip on 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.920
 sperm whale boys is now very close 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.020
 I remind you to leave a nice like 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.940
 we get to know how to 800 like per 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.510
 I recommend this video I trust 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.780
 you what it is 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.940
 here it is, it is very ready to face us 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.190
 and neither are we to face it 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.560
 she then starts harpoons 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 this is the sentence I just pronounced 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.060
 sheikh and I also cut for 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.840
 take away those useless seconds 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.700
 I'm not going to offer you dead times 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.120
 there it should be right in 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.739
 that area was a strange movement 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.080
 only appears but what moves 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.040
 suddenly it's the first time 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.110
 I face a sperm whale and therefore at least 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.730
 obviously in assassin's creed robben 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.500
 assassin's creed 4 black flag which 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.880
 we really caught a brothel of 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.940
 time and above all very individual 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.269
 old as I could not see it 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.880
 look at you huge cabbage guys it is but 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.400
 nice I miss but it's not possible 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.370
 ok the challenge is to keep us 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.620
 hit hold pro tr.it ie 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.970
 great ice 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.340
 look, we really took it away 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.040
 very little life continues to hit 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.170
 yes i took it this challenge really is 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.880
 much more complicated than those 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.760
 past 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.720
 ok hit again it looks almost moby 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 dick entitled cronies expose yourself 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.829
 they wait for me wrong or from a 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.390
 other side cabbage cabbage 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.350
 okay no need i thought i had to 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.790
 cover me I think it's coming, here it is 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.360
 no, boys , failure to do so 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.450
 we come but that's our ship ok 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.300
 guys are appearing here she is caught yes 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.240
 I made it now it should pull us out like that 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.850
 usual ok so keep it ready 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.040
 but the action is right below 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.770
 try to catch him they took you there 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.080
 I think ok it's pulling me going on 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.660
 to pull you we see to catch him now yes ce 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.280
 I did it but I was so destroyed 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.740
 against a block 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.650
 we have life around methane maybe a 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.850
 little more than the boat you have to resist yourself 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.290
 You are welcome 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.690
 let's see it comes out it's a challenge between man and 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.390
 the animal if you only understand where that is 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.040
 that is popping up if my market ok 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.480
 big and still pro hits now that 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.510
 right down here 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.140
 I did not make it look 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.240
 life is really very low where it is 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.890
 tension on ice I can't believe it 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.130
 is continuing to resist despite 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.830
 the very low life ok came night 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.530
 in the meantime, I don't believe what ends he has 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.570
 that comes out of the apple emerge from a6 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.000
 we did it guys it is 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.800
 it was a really fine catch and it is 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.220
 was a face more resistant than 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.220
 how much I expected 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.970
 in the little purse, gentleman harpoons and kills 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.470
