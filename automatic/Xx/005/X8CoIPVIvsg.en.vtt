it's only five minutes to enlightenment
from<00:05:33.169> this<00:05:33.440> experience<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:33.889> I've<00:05:34.009> learnt

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
from this experience that I've learnt

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.219 
from this experience that I've learnt
already<00:05:34.400> is<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:34.969> light<00:05:35.240> is<00:05:35.389> sound<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:36.110> mean

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
already is that light is sound I mean

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.899 
already is that light is sound I mean
light<00:05:36.469> is<00:05:36.620> faster<00:05:37.129> I<00:05:37.340> mean<00:05:37.639> when<00:05:37.789> you're

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
light is faster I mean when you're

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.879 
light is faster I mean when you're
dealing<00:05:38.150> with<00:05:38.180> fiber<00:05:38.389> optics<00:05:38.900> is<00:05:39.020> building<00:05:39.740> up

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
dealing with fiber optics is building up

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.830 
dealing with fiber optics is building up
everything<00:05:40.340> that<00:05:40.370> we're<00:05:40.610> trying<00:05:40.819> to<00:05:40.940> that's

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
everything that we're trying to that's

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.390 
everything that we're trying to that's
our<00:05:41.990> newest<00:05:42.199> technology<00:05:42.740> all<00:05:42.979> of<00:05:43.099> our<00:05:43.190> solar

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
our newest technology all of our solar

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.700 
our newest technology all of our solar
panels<00:05:43.879> all<00:05:44.089> the<00:05:44.599> think<00:05:44.810> green<00:05:44.870> technology<00:05:45.680> I

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
panels all the think green technology I

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.680 
panels all the think green technology I
mean<00:05:46.009> it's<00:05:46.190> you<00:05:46.490> know<00:05:46.520> coaxial<00:05:47.120> cable<00:05:47.479> it's

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
mean it's you know coaxial cable it's

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.930 
mean it's you know coaxial cable it's
obsolete<00:05:48.229> you<00:05:48.560> know<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:48.710> mean<00:05:48.949> I<00:05:49.159> look<00:05:49.490> at<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:49.759> as

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
obsolete you know I mean I look at it as

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.329 
obsolete you know I mean I look at it as
that<00:05:50.210> is<00:05:50.779> the<00:05:50.960> wave<00:05:51.139> of<00:05:51.169> the<00:05:51.409> future<00:05:51.440> and<00:05:52.009> light

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:52.339 
that is the wave of the future and light

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.540 
that is the wave of the future and light
is<00:05:52.520> sight<00:05:52.759> and<00:05:53.000> if<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.479> can<00:05:53.659> see<00:05:54.099> you<00:05:55.099> can<00:05:55.310> you

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
is sight and if you can see you can you

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.610 
is sight and if you can see you can you
pretty<00:05:55.819> much<00:05:56.000> function<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:56.599> know<00:05:56.719> I<00:05:57.199> think

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
pretty much function you know I think

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.409 
pretty much function you know I think
the<00:05:57.949> sight<00:05:58.190> is<00:05:58.310> one<00:05:58.490> of<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.699> main<00:05:58.879> things<00:05:59.300> that

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
the sight is one of the main things that

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.480 
the sight is one of the main things that
we<00:05:59.569> need<00:05:59.839> in<00:05:59.990> that<00:06:00.169> light<00:06:00.379> it<00:06:00.620> brings<00:06:00.919> that<00:06:01.190> and

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
we need in that light it brings that and

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.399 
we need in that light it brings that and
then<00:06:01.699> the<00:06:01.819> spectrum<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.569> the<00:06:02.900> lights<00:06:03.169> that

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
then the spectrum that the lights that

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.480 
then the spectrum that the lights that
are<00:06:03.500> having<00:06:03.650> if<00:06:03.860> some<00:06:04.009> of<00:06:04.099> these<00:06:04.159> beautiful

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
are having if some of these beautiful

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.430 
are having if some of these beautiful
exhibits<00:06:05.150> that<00:06:05.240> they<00:06:05.360> have<00:06:05.479> out<00:06:05.629> here<00:06:05.839> I<00:06:06.020> mean

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
exhibits that they have out here I mean

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.649 
exhibits that they have out here I mean
I'm<00:06:06.770> just<00:06:06.800> I'm<00:06:07.250> so<00:06:07.279> intrigued<00:06:07.729> about<00:06:08.000> what<00:06:08.150> I'm

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
I'm just I'm so intrigued about what I'm

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.019 
I'm just I'm so intrigued about what I'm
gonna<00:06:08.900> learn<00:06:09.080> today<00:06:09.349> and<00:06:09.740> what<00:06:10.430> my<00:06:10.699> future

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.029 
gonna learn today and what my future

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:13.240 
gonna learn today and what my future
holds<00:06:11.210> as<00:06:11.599> far<00:06:11.779> as<00:06:11.930> fiber<00:06:12.440> optics<00:06:12.830> lighting<00:06:13.159> is

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
holds as far as fiber optics lighting is

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.390 
holds as far as fiber optics lighting is
concerned<00:06:13.990> well<00:06:14.990> for<00:06:15.589> me<00:06:15.710> it's<00:06:15.830> fascinating

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
concerned well for me it's fascinating

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.659 
concerned well for me it's fascinating
because<00:06:16.699> it's<00:06:17.120> it's<00:06:17.750> not<00:06:17.930> only<00:06:18.110> a

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
because it's it's not only a

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.390 
because it's it's not only a
technological<00:06:19.669> it's<00:06:20.060> also<00:06:20.529> had<00:06:21.529> a<00:06:21.560> lot<00:06:22.099> to<00:06:22.129> do

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
technological it's also had a lot to do

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.570 
technological it's also had a lot to do
with<00:06:22.669> our<00:06:22.879> senses<00:06:23.599> it's<00:06:24.219> maybe<00:06:25.219> it's<00:06:25.310> it's

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
with our senses it's maybe it's it's

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.339 
with our senses it's maybe it's it's
it's<00:06:26.389> a<00:06:26.449> kind<00:06:26.690> of<00:06:26.779> emotional<00:06:27.469> so<00:06:28.750> yeah<00:06:29.750> that's

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.349 
it's a kind of emotional so yeah that's

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:36.159 
it's a kind of emotional so yeah that's
that<00:06:30.800> is<00:06:31.460> that's<00:06:32.360> and<00:06:34.539> well<00:06:35.539> what<00:06:35.930> what

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
that is that's and well what what

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.829 
that is that's and well what what
matters<00:06:36.529> is<00:06:36.680> that<00:06:37.099> light<00:06:37.310> is<00:06:37.550> a<00:06:37.839> fundamental

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:38.839 
matters is that light is a fundamental

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.260 
matters is that light is a fundamental
for<00:06:39.020> every<00:06:39.349> information<00:06:39.979> process<00:06:40.729> for<00:06:41.000> for

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
maybe if you want to get in a philosophy

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.640 
maybe if you want to get in a philosophy
way<00:06:47.099> it's<00:06:47.819> it's<00:06:48.270> important<00:06:49.080> for<00:06:49.199> every
