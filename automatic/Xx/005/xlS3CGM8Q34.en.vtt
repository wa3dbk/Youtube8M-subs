00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
so that gives me a lot of hope I say

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.170 
so that gives me a lot of hope I say
those<00:02:09.810> two<00:02:10.080> things<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:11.580> first<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.000> was

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
those two things the first one that was

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.550 
those two things the first one that was
here<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.780> jam<00:02:13.020> voltage

region is coming into full strength and

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.860 
region is coming into full strength and
that's<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.430> very<00:02:17.610> hopeful<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.480> future<00:02:18.540> of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
