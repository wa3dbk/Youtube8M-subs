00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and also an estimate of what you might

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.170 
and also an estimate of what you might
expect<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.230> pay<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> repair<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.090> is

that's a regulation to have the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.020 
that's a regulation to have the
standardized<00:02:19.469> dock<00:02:20.099> connector<00:02:20.519> here<00:02:20.700> for

standardized dock connector here for
doing<00:02:21.540> Diagnostics<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.980> know<00:02:23.069> there<00:02:23.159> are

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
doing Diagnostics and you know there are

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.550 
doing Diagnostics and you know there are
a<00:02:23.280> few<00:02:23.459> cars<00:02:23.730> out<00:02:23.969> there<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
a few cars out there that that have a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.759 
a few cars out there that that have a
little<00:02:25.769> non-standard<00:02:27.500> accessibility<00:02:28.500> for<00:02:28.650> it

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
little non-standard accessibility for it

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.899 
little non-standard accessibility for it

people<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.780> know<00:02:54.840> maybe<00:02:54.989> think<00:02:55.439> about

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
people you know maybe think about

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.280 
people you know maybe think about
picking<00:02:55.829> this<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.099> anyways<00:02:56.519> because<00:02:57.169> you<00:02:58.169> know

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
picking this up anyways because you know

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.080 
picking this up anyways because you know
it's<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:59.219> kind<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.459> nice<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.790> able<00:03:00.030> to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
it's a it's kind of nice to be able to

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.030 
it's a it's kind of nice to be able to
hold<00:03:00.359> this<00:03:00.540> up<00:03:00.689> rather<00:03:01.260> than<00:03:01.409> having<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> crawl

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
hold this up rather than having to crawl

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.440 
hold this up rather than having to crawl
underneath<00:03:02.310> your<00:03:02.549> dash<00:03:02.669> and<00:03:03.030> try<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.209> read

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
underneath your dash and try to read

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.550 
underneath your dash and try to read
this<00:03:03.629> or<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.870> don't<00:03:03.959> know<00:03:04.109> what<00:03:04.139> it's<00:03:04.379> done

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
this or you don't know what it's done

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.080 
this or you don't know what it's done
essentially<00:03:05.189> what<00:03:05.370> happens<00:03:05.639> is<00:03:05.669> you<00:03:05.790> plug<00:03:05.939> it

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
essentially what happens is you plug it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.759 
essentially what happens is you plug it
in<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.389> it<00:03:06.480> beeps<00:03:06.689> when<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.019> done<00:03:07.169> but<00:03:07.379> it's

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
in and it beeps when it's done but it's

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.809 
in and it beeps when it's done but it's
still<00:03:07.889> nice<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.189> be<00:03:08.280> able<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.430> look<00:03:08.519> at<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
still nice to be able to look at the

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.490 
still nice to be able to look at the
readout<00:03:09.060> know<00:03:09.299> what's<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.840> what's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
readout know what's going on what's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.459 
readout know what's going on what's
actually<00:03:10.650> power<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.189> up<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.139> what<00:03:13.439> I

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
actually power it up here so I what I

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.399 
actually power it up here so I what I
did<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.919> exactly<00:03:14.489> pretty<00:03:14.760> much<00:03:14.909> as<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.269> as<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:16.169> as

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
eventually yeah I got an error some some

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.640 
eventually yeah I got an error some some
air<00:03:33.239> came<00:03:33.419> up<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.629> my<00:03:33.720> dash<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> plugged<00:03:34.530> it

as a potential issue for you know it may

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.890 
as a potential issue for you know it may
not<00:03:40.590> pass<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:41.250> spec<00:03:41.879> ssin<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.269> know<00:03:42.389> for<00:03:42.689> like

that's how I described it and I did I

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.409 
that's how I described it and I did I
plugged<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.639> I'll<00:03:56.819> show<00:03:56.849> you<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.269> in

know gives you a little readout and it
gives<00:04:01.409> you<00:04:01.500> some<00:04:01.650> ideas<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.099> what<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.639> issue

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
gives you some ideas of what the issue

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.399 
gives you some ideas of what the issue
might<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.329> now<00:04:03.659> if<00:04:03.750> it<00:04:03.840> was<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:03.989> bigger<00:04:04.229> issue

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
might be now if it was a bigger issue

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.920 
might be now if it was a bigger issue
you'd<00:04:04.769> get<00:04:04.949> this<00:04:05.129> this<00:04:05.849> cut<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.540> red<00:04:06.689> coat<00:04:06.900> and

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
you'd get this this cut the red coat and

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.509 
you'd get this this cut the red coat and
it<00:04:07.229> could<00:04:07.439> tell<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.769> know<00:04:08.040> what's<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
it could tell you you know what's the

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.550 
it could tell you you know what's the
deal<00:04:08.669> is<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:09.000> what's<00:04:09.569> cool<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:10.229> gives<00:04:10.379> you<00:04:10.500> a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
deal is so what's cool is it gives you a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.899 
deal is so what's cool is it gives you a
little<00:04:10.709> instant<00:04:11.099> readout<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:11.669> you<00:04:11.729> know

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
little instant readout so you know

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.059 
little instant readout so you know
what's<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.329> on<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.780> then<00:04:13.560> like<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:13.949> does

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
what's going on and then like it does

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.649 
what's going on and then like it does
give<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.370> code<00:04:14.609> some<00:04:14.909> information<00:04:15.419> here

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
give you a code some information here

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.029 
give you a code some information here
but<00:04:15.810> once<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.470> plug<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.769> into<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:16.979> computer

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
but once you plug it into the computer

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.680 
but once you plug it into the computer
it<00:04:17.370> gives<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.609> even<00:04:17.759> some<00:04:18.060> more<00:04:18.180> information

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
it gives you even some more information

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.180 
it gives you even some more information
so<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.900> gives<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.139> some<00:04:19.320> basic<00:04:19.349> info<00:04:19.919> right

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
so it gives you some basic info right

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.229 
so it gives you some basic info right
here<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.400> then<00:04:20.489> when<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:20.639> actually<00:04:20.759> do<00:04:21.030> plug

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
here and then when you actually do plug

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.610 
here and then when you actually do plug
it<00:04:21.359> into<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.599> computer<00:04:21.719> it<00:04:22.320> gives<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
it into the computer it gives you a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.170 
it into the computer it gives you a
little<00:04:22.740> more<00:04:22.919> detail<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.669> point<00:04:23.909> this<00:04:24.000> up

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
little more detail and I point this up

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.459 
little more detail and I point this up
to<00:04:24.300> down<00:04:24.510> here<00:04:24.659> on<00:04:24.779> the<00:04:24.840> bottom<00:04:24.960> that's<00:04:25.320> where

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.619 
kit that comes with it ok so here we are
on<00:04:52.849> the<00:04:53.060> application<00:04:53.719> this<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.139> CarMD

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
on the application this is the CarMD

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.879 
on the application this is the CarMD
application<00:04:56.629> and<00:04:56.870> we<00:04:57.199> actually<00:04:57.499> start<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.830> you

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
application and we actually start it you

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.170 
application and we actually start it you
have<00:04:58.009> a<00:04:58.069> few<00:04:58.219> options<00:04:58.249> here<00:04:58.669> just<00:04:58.879> tells<00:04:59.029> you<00:04:59.150> a

have a few options here just tells you a
little<00:04:59.360> bit<00:04:59.449> about<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.779> application<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.469> how

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
little bit about the application and how

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.350 
little bit about the application and how
it<00:05:00.680> works<00:05:00.830> but<00:05:01.069> this<00:05:01.189> is<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.610> snapshot<00:05:02.120> here

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
it works but this is the snapshot here

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.119 
it works but this is the snapshot here
and<00:05:02.539> what<00:05:02.719> it<00:05:02.810> tells<00:05:02.930> me<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.349> yeah<00:05:03.889> there's<00:05:04.069> a

problem<00:05:09.379> with<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.979> system<00:05:10.159> and<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:11.360> gives<00:05:11.479> me

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
problem with the system and it gives me

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.760 
problem with the system and it gives me
a<00:05:11.599> little<00:05:11.719> more<00:05:11.870> information<00:05:12.110> what<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.529> could

a little more information what I could

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.409 
a little more information what I could
do<00:05:12.919> but<00:05:13.430> tells<00:05:13.639> me<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:13.819> check<00:05:14.000> engine<00:05:14.270> light

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
do but tells me the check engine light

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.809 
do but tells me the check engine light
is<00:05:14.449> off<00:05:14.830> basically<00:05:15.830> there's<00:05:16.129> no<00:05:16.250> code<00:05:16.520> has<00:05:16.789> a

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
is off basically there's no code has a

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.820 
is off basically there's no code has a
secondary<00:05:17.360> code<00:05:17.569> which<00:05:17.870> is<00:05:17.990> what<00:05:18.110> we<00:05:18.229> saw<00:05:18.650> on

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
secondary code which is what we saw on

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.409 
secondary code which is what we saw on
the<00:05:18.979> screen<00:05:19.219> right<00:05:19.370> there<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.210> tells<00:05:20.330> me

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
the screen right there and it tells me

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.629 
the screen right there and it tells me
I'm<00:05:20.599> most<00:05:20.810> likely<00:05:21.199> I'm<00:05:21.529> not<00:05:21.680> going<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:22.099> pass<00:05:22.370> an

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
I'm most likely I'm not going to pass an

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.879 
I'm most likely I'm not going to pass an
emission<00:05:22.969> test<00:05:23.180> alright<00:05:23.449> so<00:05:24.139> when<00:05:24.529> I<00:05:24.560> go<00:05:24.770> in

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
emission test alright so when I go in

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.489 
emission test alright so when I go in
here<00:05:25.069> and<00:05:25.219> I<00:05:25.279> click<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.870> actual<00:05:26.870> code<00:05:27.169> it

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:27.499 
here and I click the actual code it

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:29.050 
here and I click the actual code it
gives<00:05:27.529> me<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.129> diagnostic<00:05:28.699> and<00:05:28.819> a<00:05:28.879> little

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
gives me the diagnostic and a little

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.390 
gives me the diagnostic and a little
more<00:05:29.150> information<00:05:29.419> so<00:05:30.050> tells<00:05:30.289> us<00:05:30.469> that<00:05:30.680> this

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
more information so tells us that this

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.249 
more information so tells us that this
fault<00:05:31.639> code<00:05:31.849> indicates<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.509> evaporative

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
loose or missing fuel cap so how about

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.119 
loose or missing fuel cap so how about
that<00:05:41.750> that's<00:05:42.080> exactly<00:05:42.500> what<00:05:42.649> was<00:05:42.770> wrong<00:05:42.830> with

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
that that's exactly what was wrong with

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.350 
that that's exactly what was wrong with
it<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.639> it<00:05:43.849> gives<00:05:43.969> you<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.089> little<00:05:44.180> more

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
it and it gives you a little more

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.059 
it and it gives you a little more
information<00:05:44.569> on<00:05:44.870> what<00:05:45.050> that<00:05:45.169> means<00:05:45.379> and<00:05:45.770> how

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
information on what that means and how

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:47.950 
information on what that means and how
that<00:05:46.099> works<00:05:46.520> ok<00:05:46.819> so<00:05:47.360> it's<00:05:47.479> pretty<00:05:47.599> cool<00:05:47.779> it

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
that works ok so it's pretty cool it

computer seen something that that's a

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.559 
computer seen something that that's a
little<00:06:00.500> peculiar<00:06:00.889> but<00:06:01.219> it<00:06:01.909> either<00:06:02.060> hasn't

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
little peculiar but it either hasn't

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.689 
little peculiar but it either hasn't
happened<00:06:02.899> enough<00:06:03.169> or<00:06:03.469> it<00:06:04.129> hasn't<00:06:04.310> actually

become<00:06:05.300> a<00:06:05.330> full<00:06:05.659> fault<00:06:05.990> it<00:06:06.889> just<00:06:06.919> based<00:06:07.189> a

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
become a full fault it just based a

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.740 
become a full fault it just based a
little<00:06:07.339> bit<00:06:07.460> of<00:06:07.580> a<00:06:07.610> warning<00:06:08.029> maybe<00:06:08.360> something

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
little bit of a warning maybe something

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.689 
little bit of a warning maybe something
to<00:06:08.810> keep<00:06:08.960> an<00:06:09.139> eye<00:06:09.259> on<00:06:09.289> so<00:06:10.250> there<00:06:10.370> isn't<00:06:10.490> really

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
to keep an eye on so there isn't really

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.269 
to keep an eye on so there isn't really
any<00:06:11.149> cure<00:06:11.659> a<00:06:11.870> list<00:06:12.169> I<00:06:12.289> mean<00:06:12.439> it<00:06:12.500> should<00:06:12.680> say<00:06:12.919> you

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279 
any cure a list I mean it should say you

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.529 
any cure a list I mean it should say you
know<00:06:13.370> hey<00:06:13.639> dummy<00:06:13.849> you<00:06:14.000> put<00:06:14.149> your<00:06:14.270> put<00:06:14.479> your

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
know hey dummy you put your put your

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.959 
know hey dummy you put your put your
fuel<00:06:14.779> cap<00:06:14.960> on<00:06:15.310> but<00:06:16.310> it<00:06:16.430> doesn't<00:06:16.699> actually<00:06:16.789> say

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:16.969 
fuel cap on but it doesn't actually say

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.050 
fuel cap on but it doesn't actually say
that<00:06:17.300> necessarily<00:06:17.839> in<00:06:18.710> here<00:06:19.039> so<00:06:19.250> you<00:06:19.939> I<00:06:19.969> think

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
that necessarily in here so you I think

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.820 
that necessarily in here so you I think
if<00:06:20.240> it<00:06:20.330> was<00:06:20.419> a<00:06:20.449> red<00:06:20.810> a<00:06:21.050> red<00:06:21.349> it<00:06:21.500> would<00:06:21.589> give<00:06:21.680> me<00:06:21.770> a

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
if it was a red a red it would give me a

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.139 
if it was a red a red it would give me a
little<00:06:22.009> more<00:06:22.129> information<00:06:22.729> where<00:06:22.879> was<00:06:23.029> that

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:23.149 
little more information where was that

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.760 
little more information where was that
where<00:06:23.330> was<00:06:23.569> more<00:06:23.779> of<00:06:23.839> a<00:06:23.899> hard<00:06:24.139> fault<00:06:24.439> I<00:06:24.620> could

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
where was more of a hard fault I could

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.350 
where was more of a hard fault I could
tell<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.069> you<00:06:25.339> know<00:06:25.460> I<00:06:25.490> you<00:06:25.969> know<00:06:26.089> I<00:06:26.120> don't
