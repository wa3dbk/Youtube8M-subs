00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.549
 hi youtuber are hyper plus 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.199
 welcome to this brand new one 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.850
 review today we talk again about 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.520
 an nvidia video card 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.369
 in this case my future 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.050
 video card and now let's see for a moment 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.349
 because we calmly rattle off at 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.480
 speech and I want you to understand just 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.320
 what I thought of in this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.450
 process of choosing my future gpu 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 unlike the card we have 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.140
 seen the last time it was a bit for 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.390
 satisfy those who did not have too much money from 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.789
 spend well today we seek the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 performance the best price quality 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.680
 to play at the big battlefield 4 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.260
 so let's see why they are like that 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.629
 we say self confident in affirming 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.090
 we have already seen all this in my own 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.109
 video a few days ago the comparison between 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 the 7 77 80 which in my opinion was the best 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.100
 buy we saw that la7 80 was going 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 really cannon but also the price 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.490
 he was not joking, but for la7 70 we have 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.830
 noticed a simple trivial thing 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 comparing it with gtx6 80 costs 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.270
 something less but it is stronger indeed 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.060
 it looks like an improved version 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.610
 of a 6 80 and I say it with good reason 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.290
 because the benchmarks show how they are 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.170
 always always always on the same band 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.799
 competing but perpetually the average 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.990
 it goes in favor of the 770 but as it already is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.240
 said in that video with some good 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 research can also be found at 5 10 15 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 euro less and who knows in the future when 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.740
 this card will surely take one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 nice slice of the market what will happen 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.630
 after this brief introduction and before 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.460
 but to get the real benchmarks e 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.320
 subsequently my gameplay of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 battlefield 3 in the same way 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.090
 of the other reviews in which I will do 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.240
 see how many 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.789
 pps makes the tab on mine 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.259
 configuration let's see for a moment how it is 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.770
 presents from outside 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.569
 in fact the gt 770 proposed by nvidia is 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.940
 really nice 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.750
 we saw on tia tastes like 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.330
 reference heat sink kept some 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.760
 contained aesthetic qualities while 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.580
 here we are at the extreme tamarri e 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.920
 you know that I go crazy for these things 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.510
 all this sink with a 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.209
 radiator that was inside 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.420
 in fact, it is much larger 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.709
 evident comparing it with my gt 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.780
 660 of the language is that it always mounts a 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.670
 reference heatsink as precisely the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.720
 heat exchange battery inside 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.810
 of the 770 is more massive 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.989
 also this beautiful detail in 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.400
 where we can see the sink 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.940
 from the outside thanks to this small panel 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.819
 in plexiglass and really pleasant all 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.920
 eye the look is completed by all 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.420
 this metallic appearance that the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.280
 love card that makes it look like 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.530
 really titan and therefore gives us 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.720
 the idea of a bad product of a 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.660
 you see the gaming product here 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.340
 compared with my gtx and 60 lo 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.130
 I repeat produced by the fine wine 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.620
 xlr8 edition 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.359
 Well the dimensions are different 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.459
 in fact the gtx 770 measures 2 cm more than 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.010
 length but will make it stay 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.410
 however in practically all the keys for 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.019
 conclude by talking about the aesthetic part 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.150
 of the card look when and mount 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.220
 the kers and when they light these 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.410
 writings really equipped me 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.090
 all the hair but now let's talk about the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.560
 serious things we talk about how this is going 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.530
 card let's start by looking at some 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.599
 benchmark proposed by the principals and more 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.849
 authoritative sites obviously I start from 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.680
 tom's hardware and here you see i 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.660
 benchmark results made on 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.590
 battlefield 3 I recommend eye to 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.870
 resolution which is a 2005 60 per thousand e 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.280
 440 details in three sets on the 3 then with 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.150
 four to resign the anti-the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.300
 post up see how the gtx 7 card 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.840
 70 is very quickly behind the 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.140
 radeon hd 79 70 gigahertz edition but with 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.270
 only one frame b2 of difference per 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.169
 understand us to go beyond these cards 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.630
 there goes a 79 90 a sect 80 a titan o 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.450
 a 690 and therefore we are always above i 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.180
 500 600 euros spent 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.220
 let's say they are the two cards to which 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.700
 I could aspire to play beats 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.300
 four films have fallen on the 770 for 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.100
 in fact history preference reasons is 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.590
 always up had nvidia card for 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.960
 regarding the price the gtx 7 70 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.260
 it costs something less with the number 79 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.760
 70 g thanks says I know there are gods 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.610
 interesting bundles of games to me not 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.710
 they are interested therefore aimed at the card and al 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.570
 value for money that I repeat I have 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.370
 found on this tab 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.250
 now let's quickly see the card from 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.130
 behind with the hdmi input and displayport 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.020
 the two stars ai and we go immediately to 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.760
 try it in battery 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.260
 let's start immediately with observing how it is 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.729
 involves the card on the right bottom 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.070
 because I want to make it fly and 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.040
 in fact it goes a few seconds 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.780
 we know that battlefield from every saint 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.240
 problems when changing on the 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.100
 flight video settings there is a drop 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.180
 of instantaneous frames indeed one speaks of the 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.310
 60 70 and then boom above 120 frames per 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.110
 second, however, this clearly sets 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.480
 load is far too light for 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.770
 a card like that 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.120
 let's go straight to settings alto settings 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.240
 on which the card is located 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.250
 definitely at ease it doesn't heat or a 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.390
 own temperature sensor placed 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.880
 above the gpu and the card has remained 55 58 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.700
 60 degrees now that he has me in the room 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.110
 it really fries so let's go 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.400
 immediately to mind his ultra e 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.260
 we use the very bottom 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.150
 see how the card also on 7 in 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.220
 socially ultrÃ  does not result 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.250
 absolutely overloaded yes 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.290
 behave well and for all those who 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.180
 they also look for some more rewards for 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.100
 the competitive because they want the best 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.030
 let's say you just take off some 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.520
 filter and in any case always simulates above 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.970
 75 frames 73 frames for what I have 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.640
 noticed myself on a personal setup 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.620
 let's say with a perfect ultras set 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.870
 only with regard to those filters 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.210
 which we say weighs down the most 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.570
 game but we notice more 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.150
 hardly while we play youtubers 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.520
 this will be my card to beat you 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.950
 four I 'm sure I won't regret it 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.900
 see you in the next commented video 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.900
 and vote if you want to sign up 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.810
