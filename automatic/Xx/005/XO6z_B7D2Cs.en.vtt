00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
then I use the food processor and that

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.390 
then I use the food processor and that
keeps<00:03:28.690> everything<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.769> can<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.100> three

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
different devices that is a grill I

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.650 
different devices that is a grill I
don't<00:03:56.840> even<00:03:56.990> use<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:58.120> might<00:03:59.120> heat<00:03:59.480> up

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
don't even use that I might heat up

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.840 
don't even use that I might heat up
something<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> had<00:04:00.770> warm<00:04:01.100> already<00:04:01.370> on<00:04:01.730> the

top of it which is the bun heater and
that's<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:04.970> only<00:04:05.000> reason<00:04:05.270> why<00:04:05.600> so<00:04:05.810> on<00:04:05.870> the
