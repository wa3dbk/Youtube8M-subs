hello<00:00:04.840> welcome<00:00:05.080> to<00:00:05.200> simple<00:00:05.500> scuba<00:00:05.740> comm<00:00:06.100> in

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
hello welcome to simple scuba comm in

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.620 
hello welcome to simple scuba comm in
this<00:00:06.670> session<00:00:06.880> we're<00:00:07.090> going<00:00:07.210> to<00:00:07.270> look<00:00:07.359> at<00:00:07.510> my

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:07.630 
this session we're going to look at my

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.360 
this session we're going to look at my
flexpays<00:00:08.109> and<00:00:08.530> the<00:00:08.800> difference<00:00:09.070> between<00:00:09.250> a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
flexpays and the difference between a

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.750 
flexpays and the difference between a
standard<00:00:09.640> hose<00:00:10.390> and<00:00:10.750> the<00:00:10.870> my<00:00:10.990> flex<00:00:11.290> hose<00:00:11.760> okay

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
standard hose and the my flex hose okay

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.800 
standard hose and the my flex hose okay
so<00:00:12.940> we<00:00:13.090> have<00:00:13.270> a<00:00:13.300> look<00:00:13.420> at<00:00:13.540> some<00:00:13.660> of<00:00:13.720> the

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:13.810 
so we have a look at some of the

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.700 
so we have a look at some of the
features<00:00:14.080> on<00:00:14.200> the<00:00:14.260> my<00:00:14.380> flex<00:00:14.620> hose<00:00:14.800> first<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
features on the my flex hose first the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.140 
features on the my flex hose first the
external<00:00:17.710> of<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.980> hose<00:00:18.189> is<00:00:18.520> actually<00:00:18.789> braided

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
external of the hose is actually braided

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.679 
external of the hose is actually braided
by<00:00:19.269> nylon<00:00:19.749> so<00:00:20.400> added<00:00:21.400> safety<00:00:21.669> feature<00:00:21.849> it's

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
by nylon so added safety feature it's

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.150 
by nylon so added safety feature it's
great<00:00:23.050> for<00:00:23.230> protecting<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.710> hose<00:00:23.859> against

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
great for protecting the hose against

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.900 
great for protecting the hose against
abrasion

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
abrasion

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.579 
abrasion
it<00:00:25.150> also<00:00:25.300> helps<00:00:25.810> resist<00:00:26.109> UV<00:00:26.619> rays<00:00:26.859> and<00:00:27.220> their

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
it also helps resist UV rays and their

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.979 
it also helps resist UV rays and their
interaction<00:00:29.589> with<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.829> rubber<00:00:30.039> itself<00:00:30.989> the

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
interaction with the rubber itself the

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.270 
interaction with the rubber itself the
burst<00:00:32.200> pressure<00:00:32.439> on<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.770> hose<00:00:32.950> is

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
burst pressure on the hose is

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.250 
burst pressure on the hose is
significantly<00:00:34.239> higher<00:00:34.480> than<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.840> stand<00:00:35.109> and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
significantly higher than the stand and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.410 
significantly higher than the stand and
hose<00:00:35.500> so<00:00:36.280> are<00:00:36.399> you<00:00:36.640> getting<00:00:36.760> extra<00:00:37.210> safety

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
hose so are you getting extra safety

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.810 
hose so are you getting extra safety
feature<00:00:37.780> from<00:00:38.020> that<00:00:38.230> as<00:00:38.350> well<00:00:38.559> as<00:00:38.800> again<00:00:39.640> the

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
feature from that as well as again the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.180 
feature from that as well as again the
abrasive<00:00:40.780> protection<00:00:41.199> that<00:00:41.469> the<00:00:41.590> nylon<00:00:41.949> gives

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
abrasive protection that the nylon gives

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.250 
abrasive protection that the nylon gives
is<00:00:42.460> fantastic<00:00:43.149> it<00:00:43.239> stops<00:00:43.449> any<00:00:43.660> cuts<00:00:43.989> and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
is fantastic it stops any cuts and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.509 
is fantastic it stops any cuts and
things<00:00:44.410> that<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.800> can<00:00:44.890> might<00:00:45.129> get<00:00:45.340> on<00:00:45.430> the

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
things that you can might get on the

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.099 
things that you can might get on the
hose<00:00:46.679> the<00:00:47.679> design<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.760> hose<00:00:48.940> also<00:00:49.750> means

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
hose the design of the hose also means

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.580 
hose the design of the hose also means
that<00:00:50.170> it's<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.710> much<00:00:51.129> larger<00:00:51.550> bore<00:00:51.760> inside<00:00:52.590> but

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
that it's a much larger bore inside but

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.740 
that it's a much larger bore inside but
the<00:00:53.679> actual<00:00:53.949> bore<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.460> protected<00:00:55.329> so<00:00:55.600> it's

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
the actual bore is protected so it's

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.619 
the actual bore is protected so it's
always<00:00:56.140> going<00:00:56.289> to<00:00:56.350> give<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.829> same<00:00:57.629> flow

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
always going to give you the same flow

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.900 
always going to give you the same flow
capacity<00:00:58.839> no<00:00:59.379> matter<00:00:59.530> what<00:00:59.679> you<00:00:59.769> do<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.850> you

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
capacity no matter what you do it so you

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.290 
capacity no matter what you do it so you
can<00:01:01.120> tie<00:01:02.010> nice<00:01:03.010> tight<00:01:03.399> knot<00:01:03.640> in<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.150> you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
can tie nice tight knot in it and you

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300 
can tie nice tight knot in it and you
still<00:01:04.600> get<00:01:04.870> the<00:01:05.050> same<00:01:05.260> flow<00:01:05.590> through<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:05.950> top

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
still get the same flow through that top

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.870 
still get the same flow through that top
of<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.520> hose<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:09.040> we<00:01:09.189> compare<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.729> a

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
of that hose so we compare that to a

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.140 
of that hose so we compare that to a
standard<00:01:10.659> hose<00:01:10.810> they<00:01:11.710> do<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.979> same<00:01:12.189> knot<00:01:12.460> you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
standard hose they do the same knot you

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.300 
standard hose they do the same knot you
can't<00:01:13.450> do<00:01:13.659> it<00:01:13.780> anywhere<00:01:14.200> near<00:01:14.530> as<00:01:14.710> tight<00:01:14.979> and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
can't do it anywhere near as tight and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.880 
can't do it anywhere near as tight and
if<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.490> did<00:01:15.759> that<00:01:16.000> hose<00:01:16.450> would<00:01:16.659> just<00:01:16.930> crunch

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
if you did that hose would just crunch

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.710 
if you did that hose would just crunch
up<00:01:18.100> inside<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:18.759> ain't<00:01:18.970> get<00:01:19.090> any<00:01:19.210> flow<00:01:19.479> for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
up inside and you ain't get any flow for

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.410 
up inside and you ain't get any flow for
it<00:01:19.810> at<00:01:19.930> all<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> end<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.729> each<00:01:24.850> connector

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
it at all at the end of each connector

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.389 
it at all at the end of each connector
the<00:01:26.020> braiding<00:01:26.409> actually<00:01:26.680> loops<00:01:26.860> back<00:01:27.100> through

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
the braiding actually loops back through

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.249 
the braiding actually loops back through
the<00:01:27.909> connector<00:01:28.420> rather<00:01:28.750> than<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:28.930> just<00:01:29.079> been

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
the connector rather than it just been

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.679 
the connector rather than it just been
put<00:01:29.829> underneath<00:01:30.159> and<00:01:30.549> just<00:01:30.640> clamp<00:01:30.909> down<00:01:31.030> its

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
put underneath and just clamp down its

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.870 
put underneath and just clamp down its
loop<00:01:31.899> back<00:01:32.110> through<00:01:32.140> delayers<00:01:32.740> helping<00:01:33.729> to

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
loop back through delayers helping to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.670 
loop back through delayers helping to
protect<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.659> stop<00:01:34.899> it<00:01:35.049> coming<00:01:35.380> undone

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
protect that and stop it coming undone

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.249 
protect that and stop it coming undone
so<00:01:36.280> it's<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:36.700> was<00:01:37.119> he<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.479> extend<00:01:38.110> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
so it's so was he going to extend the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.870 
so it's so was he going to extend the
life<00:01:38.469> of<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.890> end<00:01:39.219> of<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.369> hose<00:01:39.520> as<00:01:39.700> well

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
life of the end of the hose as well

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.440 
life of the end of the hose as well
unlike<00:01:40.719> on<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> standard<00:01:41.560> hose<00:01:41.710> where<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.100> bends

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
unlike on a standard hose where it bends

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.819 
unlike on a standard hose where it bends
like<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.659> this<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.350> also<00:01:44.500> you're<00:01:44.680> going<00:01:44.770> to

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
like that this is also you're going to

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.740 
like that this is also you're going to
stop<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.100> perishing<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.759> cracking<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.360> lot

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
stop that perishing and cracking a lot

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.609 
stop that perishing and cracking a lot
sooner<00:01:47.369> again<00:01:48.369> cause<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:49.570> fitted<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.380> same

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
sooner again cause it's fitted the same

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.819 
sooner again cause it's fitted the same
way<00:01:50.829> at<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.579> first<00:01:51.820> age<00:01:52.030> end<00:01:52.299> as<00:01:52.390> well<00:01:52.829> hose

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
way at the first age end as well hose

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.580 
way at the first age end as well hose
itself<00:01:54.210> comes<00:01:55.210> in<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:56.009> very<00:01:57.009> large<00:01:57.250> number<00:01:58.000> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
itself comes in a very large number of
