everything else in the world today we're

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.920 
everything else in the world today we're
doing<00:00:26.849> lighting<00:00:27.180> because<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.660> haven't<00:00:27.810> done

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
doing lighting because we haven't done

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
doing lighting because we haven't done
this<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> while<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.710> we're<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> be

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
this in a while and we're going to be

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.859 
this in a while and we're going to be
switching<00:00:29.789> things<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.330> making<00:00:30.480> sure<00:00:30.720> we

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
switching things up and making sure we

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.110 
switching things up and making sure we
hit<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> bunch<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> different<00:00:31.800> things<00:00:31.830> so

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
hit on a bunch of different things so

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.340 
hit on a bunch of different things so
one<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> biggest<00:00:33.480> questions<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:33.930> get<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
one of the biggest questions we get is

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.200 
one of the biggest questions we get is
about<00:00:34.829> lighting<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.730> we're<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> do

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
about lighting and we're going to do

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.639 
about lighting and we're going to do
some<00:00:36.420> clamshell<00:00:36.930> lighting<00:00:37.200> today<00:00:37.410> now

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
some clamshell lighting today now

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
some clamshell lighting today now
basically<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.640> whole<00:00:38.760> idea<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.149> clamshell

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
basically the whole idea with clamshell

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
basically the whole idea with clamshell
lighting<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.020> quick<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.440> easy<00:00:40.829> light<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
lighting it's quick and easy light that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.240 
lighting it's quick and easy light that
looks<00:00:42.030> good<00:00:42.480> pretty<00:00:42.930> much<00:00:43.110> all<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.530> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
looks good pretty much all the time this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.830 
looks good pretty much all the time this
is<00:00:44.430> light<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.660> don't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
is light you want to use if you don't

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690 
is light you want to use if you don't
want<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> show<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.469> subjects<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.100> for

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
want to show your subjects like for

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.209 
want to show your subjects like for
subjects<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.690> slightly<00:00:48.960> older<00:00:49.800> maybe<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
subjects that are slightly older maybe a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.830 
subjects that are slightly older maybe a
little<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.579> overweight<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
little bit overweight this is going to

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.660 
little bit overweight this is going to
help<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.800> wrinkles<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.309> their<00:00:53.430> face

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
help the like the wrinkles in their face

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.310 
help the like the wrinkles in their face
or<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.360> areas<00:00:54.719> under<00:00:54.960> their<00:00:55.050> chin<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
or you know areas under their chin and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.260 
or you know areas under their chin and
things<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> blend<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.030> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
things like that kind of blend in so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.790 
things like that kind of blend in so
this<00:00:57.449> isn't<00:00:57.600> necessarily<00:00:58.260> something<00:00:58.559> you'd

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this isn't necessarily something you'd

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
this isn't necessarily something you'd
want<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> use<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.520> beauty<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
want to use for like beauty but if you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599 
want to use for like beauty but if you
were<00:01:00.840> photographing<00:01:01.410> say<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.340> wanted

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
were photographing say like if I wanted

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.429 
were photographing say like if I wanted
to<00:01:02.730> photograph<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> members<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> my

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
to photograph one of the members of my

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.260 
to photograph one of the members of my
family<00:01:04.890> I'd<00:01:05.070> probably<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.549> clamshell

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
family I'd probably use clamshell

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.070 
family I'd probably use clamshell
lighting<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> make

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
lighting because it's going to make

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
lighting because it's going to make
everyone<00:01:07.409> look<00:01:07.560> good<00:01:07.860> basically<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.180> idea

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
everyone look good basically the idea

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.850 
everyone look good basically the idea
for<00:01:09.750> clamshell<00:01:10.110> lighting<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
for clamshell lighting is you have a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
for clamshell lighting is you have a
light<00:01:11.130> right<00:01:11.490> above<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.939> subject<00:01:12.299> Amelie<00:01:12.630> could

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
light right above a subject Amelie could

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.080 
light right above a subject Amelie could
would<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> mind<00:01:13.350> zooming<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
would you mind zooming out so you have a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.760 
would you mind zooming out so you have a
light<00:01:15.420> right<00:01:15.630> above<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.080> subject<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
light right above your subject and a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.520 
light right above your subject and a
light<00:01:17.280> right<00:01:17.790> below<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.299> subject<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
light right below your subject and the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
light right below your subject and the
camera<00:01:19.890> looks<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.759> between<00:01:20.909> two<00:01:21.270> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
camera looks right in between two so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
camera looks right in between two so
we're<00:01:21.689> using<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.159> regular<00:01:23.490> white

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
we're using a just a regular white

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660 
we're using a just a regular white
umbrella<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> black

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
umbrella here so it's a it's a black

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.130 
umbrella here so it's a it's a black
it's<00:01:26.939> got<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> black<00:01:27.330> side<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.049> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it's got a black side on it so it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's got a black side on it so it
reflects<00:01:28.530> back<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.159> we're<00:01:30.030> using<00:01:30.210> an

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
reflects back more we're using an

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.910 
reflects back more we're using an
umbrella<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> we've<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.500> softbox

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
umbrella here and we've got a softbox

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.580 
umbrella here and we've got a softbox
here<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.390> video<00:01:33.720> cameras<00:01:34.049> off<00:01:34.200> access

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
here and so the video cameras off access

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.780 
here and so the video cameras off access
a<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.799> bit<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.130> amelia<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> be

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
a little bit but amelia is going to be

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.980 
a little bit but amelia is going to be
standing<00:01:36.030> right<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.240> taking<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> picture

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
standing right here taking a picture

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
standing right here taking a picture
right<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.009> basically<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.150> subject

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
right here so basically the your subject

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.749 
right here so basically the your subject
looks<00:01:39.750> directly<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.409> both<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:41.579> lights

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
looks directly into both of your lights

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.300 
looks directly into both of your lights
and<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.960> does<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.890> top

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and what this does is you want your top

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.010 
and what this does is you want your top
light<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:45.090> bit<00:01:45.270> stronger<00:01:45.689> than

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
light to be a little bit stronger than

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.210 
light to be a little bit stronger than
your<00:01:46.170> bottom<00:01:46.409> light<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> three-to-one

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
your bottom light like a three-to-one

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.389 
your bottom light like a three-to-one
ratio<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.140> normally<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.619> talked<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> lot<00:01:50.280> about

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
ratio and normally we talked a lot about

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.249 
ratio and normally we talked a lot about
in<00:01:50.670> photography<00:01:51.210> using<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> key<00:01:52.049> light

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
in photography using like a key light

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.929 
in photography using like a key light
and<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.829> would<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.100> your<00:01:53.220> key<00:01:53.460> light<00:01:53.670> here

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and so this would be your key light here

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.609 
and so this would be your key light here
and<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.899> light<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.259> comes<00:01:55.500> from

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and it's just the light that comes from

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.649 
and it's just the light that comes from
usually<00:01:56.189> above<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.149> want<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
usually above is what you want to be

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.450 
usually above is what you want to be
more<00:01:57.840> powerful<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.829> always<00:01:58.950> break<00:01:59.219> rules

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
more powerful you can always break rules

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.889 
more powerful you can always break rules
but<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.969> general<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.479> want<00:02:00.540> something<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
but in general if you want something to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
but in general if you want something to
look<00:02:00.990> good<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> more<00:02:02.159> powerful<00:02:02.460> light

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
look good make the more powerful light

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.819 
look good make the more powerful light
come<00:02:02.909> from<00:02:02.939> above<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.930> light<00:02:04.110> down<00:02:04.350> below

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
come from above the light down below

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.469 
come from above the light down below
this<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> what's<00:02:05.640> called<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.969> fill<00:02:06.149> light<00:02:06.329> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
this is what's called a fill light and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.630 
this is what's called a fill light and
because<00:02:06.810> they're<00:02:06.990> both<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.860> close<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.429> camera

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
because they're both so close the camera

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.949 
because they're both so close the camera
is<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.569> peek

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
is just really going to like peek

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.530 
is just really going to like peek
through<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.879> we're<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> studio<00:02:12.360> here

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
through these now we're in a studio here

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.190 
through these now we're in a studio here
we've<00:02:12.690> got<00:02:12.840> light

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
we've got light

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.990 
we've got light
fifteen<00:02:13.770> foot<00:02:13.950> ceilings<00:02:14.459> which<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.760> great

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
fifteen foot ceilings which is great

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.970 
fifteen foot ceilings which is great
I've<00:02:15.660> done<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.080> plenty<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.500> times<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:16.830> my

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
I've done this plenty of times in my

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.320 
I've done this plenty of times in my
house<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.670> bit<00:02:17.849> harder<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.270> your

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
house and it's a bit harder in your

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.370 
house and it's a bit harder in your
house<00:02:18.510> because<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.840> don't<00:02:19.020> have<00:02:19.140> as<00:02:19.290> much

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
house because you don't have as much

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.199 
house because you don't have as much
room<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.370> can't<00:02:20.580> use<00:02:20.730> such<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.940> large

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
room so if you can't use such a large

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.390 
room so if you can't use such a large
umbrella<00:02:21.420> maybe<00:02:21.959> try<00:02:22.290> using<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> small

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
umbrella maybe try using like a small

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.630 
umbrella maybe try using like a small
softbox<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.720> 24<00:02:25.170> by<00:02:25.290> 36

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
softbox like this is just a 24 by 36

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.710 
softbox like this is just a 24 by 36
softbox<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.849> we're<00:02:27.000> using<00:02:27.209> here<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
softbox that we're using here and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.020 
softbox that we're using here and
that'll<00:02:28.709> help<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.280> space<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.910> bit

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
that'll help out with space a little bit

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.440 
that'll help out with space a little bit
more<00:02:30.319> another<00:02:31.319> trick<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.830> instead<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.270> can

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
more another trick is instead of you can

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.449 
more another trick is instead of you can
see<00:02:33.569> there's<00:02:33.780> no<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.590> light<00:02:34.920> stands<00:02:35.250> right

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
see there's no like light stands right

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.280 
see there's no like light stands right
here<00:02:35.610> we've<00:02:35.760> got<00:02:35.790> we've<00:02:36.569> got<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.780> light<00:02:37.020> here

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
here we've got we've got a light here

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.199 
here we've got we've got a light here
and<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.560> light<00:02:37.709> here<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.459> we've<00:02:38.790> actually<00:02:38.880> got<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
and a light here so we've actually got a

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.300 
and a light here so we've actually got a
boom<00:02:39.420> could<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.050> come<00:02:40.200> around<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.650> show<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
boom could you come around and show the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.210 
boom could you come around and show the
show<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.030> boom<00:02:42.209> here<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.660> they<00:02:42.750> see<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.050> boom

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
show the boom here can they see the boom

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.300 
show the boom here can they see the boom
all<00:02:44.220> right<00:02:45.200> there<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:46.319> go<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.920> we've<00:02:47.100> got<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
all right there we go so we've got a

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.340 
all right there we go so we've got a
boom<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.120> light<00:02:48.150> stand<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:49.140> right

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
boom the light stand is actually right

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.320 
boom the light stand is actually right
over<00:02:49.380> here<00:02:49.739> we've<00:02:49.950> got<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.220> boomed<00:02:50.519> out<00:02:50.819> so

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
over here we've got it boomed out so

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.229 
over here we've got it boomed out so
there's<00:02:51.930> no<00:02:52.350> light<00:02:52.620> stand<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.459> in<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.790> way<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
there's no light stand right in a way of

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.070 
you guys are curious so the light stand
is<00:03:02.670> actually<00:03:02.970> off<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.299> side<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.840> got<00:03:04.049> a

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
is actually off to the side it's got a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.320 
is actually off to the side it's got a
sandbag<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.190> weighted<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.850> either

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
sandbag on it it's weighted on either

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.150 
sandbag on it it's weighted on either
side<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:06.959> got<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.140> sandbag<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.739> bottom<00:03:08.069> of

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
side it's got a sandbag on the bottom of

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.920 
side it's got a sandbag on the bottom of
the<00:03:08.250> blight<00:03:08.459> stand<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.330> got<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> sandbag

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the blight stand and it's got a sandbag

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.330 
the blight stand and it's got a sandbag
at<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> end<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.440> boom<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.040> it's

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
at the end of the boom so it's it's

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.100 
at the end of the boom so it's it's
weighted<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.000> that's<00:03:12.450> what's<00:03:12.660> keeping<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
weighted and that's what's keeping the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.620 
weighted and that's what's keeping the
light<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.850> reason<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.480> use

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
light here so the reason you have to use

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.330 
light here so the reason you have to use
a<00:03:15.660> boom<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:16.049> this<00:03:16.080> just<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.680> keep<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.190> light

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
a boom like this just to keep the light

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
a boom like this just to keep the light
stands<00:03:17.609> out<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.880> play<00:03:18.090> because<00:03:18.420> we've<00:03:18.720> got

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
stands out of play because we've got

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.680 
stands out of play because we've got
lights<00:03:19.140> literally<00:03:19.650> right<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.190> axis<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:20.970> let's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
lights literally right on axis so let's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.599 
lights literally right on axis so let's
go<00:03:22.410> ahead<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.709> start<00:03:22.829> taking<00:03:22.950> pictures<00:03:23.220> this

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
go ahead and start taking pictures this

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.610 
go ahead and start taking pictures this
is<00:03:23.670> clamshell<00:03:24.630> lighting<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.049> again<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.440> is

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
is clamshell lighting and again this is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.229 
is clamshell lighting and again this is
it's<00:03:25.950> perfect<00:03:26.310> lighting<00:03:26.459> for<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:27.090> about

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
it's perfect lighting for just about

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.390 
it's perfect lighting for just about
every<00:03:27.660> scene<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.019> it's<00:03:28.109> it's<00:03:28.739> relatively

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
every scene and it's it's relatively

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.699 
every scene and it's it's relatively
simple<00:03:29.720> besides<00:03:30.720> from<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.019> like<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.320> rigging

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
simple besides from all like the rigging

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.650 
simple besides from all like the rigging
and<00:03:31.769> stuff<00:03:31.980> like<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:33.239> two<00:03:33.390> lights

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
and stuff like that it's just two lights

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.030 
and stuff like that it's just two lights
and<00:03:33.900> people<00:03:33.989> are<00:03:34.200> mostly<00:03:34.500> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.709> look<00:03:34.890> good

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and people are mostly going to look good

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.069 
and people are mostly going to look good
and<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.000> Amelia<00:03:36.329> would<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.540> mind<00:03:36.690> taking<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
and so Amelia would you mind taking a

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.780 
and so Amelia would you mind taking a
picture<00:03:37.109> I'm<00:03:37.680> just<00:03:37.890> going<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.070> actually<00:03:38.280> I'm

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
picture I'm just going to actually I'm

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.539 
picture I'm just going to actually I'm
going<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.060> throw<00:03:39.299> off<00:03:39.570> or<00:03:40.130> I'm<00:03:41.130> going<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.370> throw

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
going to throw off or I'm going to throw

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.640 
going to throw off or I'm going to throw
off<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.730> ratio<00:03:42.060> here<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.079> we<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.320> have<00:03:43.470> to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
off a ratio here just so we can have to

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.650 
off a ratio here just so we can have to
fix<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.070> camera<00:03:44.549> that's<00:03:44.850> out<00:03:45.030> when<00:03:45.570> you're

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
fix it on camera that's out when you're

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.270 
fix it on camera that's out when you're
doing<00:03:45.840> something<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.320> guys<00:03:46.530> try<00:03:47.220> to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
doing something like this guys try to

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.979 
doing something like this guys try to
stay<00:03:47.579> in<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.820> without<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.120> same<00:03:48.269> time<00:03:48.750> in

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
stay in it without the same time in

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.660 
stay in it without the same time in
about<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> same<00:03:49.739> place<00:03:49.980> every<00:03:50.160> time<00:03:50.430> and

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
about the same place every time and

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.490 
about the same place every time and
lighting<00:03:51.600> like<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:51.989> relatively

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
lighting like this is relatively

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.020 
lighting like this is relatively
specific<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.070> if<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.310> guys<00:03:53.400> are<00:03:53.579> doing<00:03:53.670> test

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
specific so if you guys are doing test

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.580 
specific so if you guys are doing test
lighting<00:03:54.359> with<00:03:54.450> something<00:03:54.840> like<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:54.959> put

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
lighting with something like that put

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.080 
lighting with something like that put
maybe<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:55.859> a<00:03:56.010> mark<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.489> floor<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.000> then

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
maybe like a mark on the floor and then

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.370 
maybe like a mark on the floor and then
when<00:03:57.239> you<00:03:57.359> have<00:03:57.480> your<00:03:57.600> subject<00:03:57.750> here<00:03:58.079> just<00:03:58.290> say

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
when you have your subject here just say

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.470 
when you have your subject here just say
like<00:03:58.530> put<00:03:58.709> your<00:03:58.829> toes<00:03:59.010> on<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.760> mark<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.329> lo

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
like put your toes on the mark in the lo

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.150 
like put your toes on the mark in the lo
exactly<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.959> word<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.230> tan<00:04:01.440> because<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:01.950> I'm

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
exactly the word is tan because if I'm

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.309 
exactly the word is tan because if I'm
you<00:04:02.700> know<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.850> couple<00:04:03.120> feedback<00:04:03.660> or<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> couple

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
you know a couple feedback or a couple

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.559 
you know a couple feedback or a couple
feet<00:04:04.739> forward<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.850> really<00:04:06.150> changes<00:04:06.450> how

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
feet forward that really changes how

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.819 
feet forward that really changes how
much<00:04:06.720> light<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.049> going<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> hit<00:04:07.380> my<00:04:07.470> face<00:04:07.680> so

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
much light is going to hit my face so

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.050 
much light is going to hit my face so
I'm<00:04:07.890> going<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.069> try<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.250> get<00:04:08.609> in<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.850> same

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
I'm going to try to get in the same

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.000 
I'm going to try to get in the same
place<00:04:09.329> every<00:04:09.569> single<00:04:10.230> time<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.530> actually<00:04:10.950> I'm

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
place every single time and actually I'm

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.379 
place every single time and actually I'm
going<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.160> have<00:04:11.310> Amelia<00:04:11.670> just<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.000> power<00:04:12.180> that

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
going to have Amelia just the power that

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.970 
going to have Amelia just the power that
one<00:04:12.690> down<00:04:13.139> below<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.769> just<00:04:13.889> this

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
one down below and all it's just this

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.729 
one down below and all it's just this
one<00:04:14.160> because<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.549> reach<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.420> um<00:04:15.739> let's

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
one because I can reach it so um let's

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.870 
one because I can reach it so um let's
rock<00:04:16.889> it<00:04:16.919> out<00:04:17.100> take<00:04:17.220> a<00:04:17.280> picture<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.579> me<00:04:17.700> and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
rock it out take a picture of me and

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.120 
rock it out take a picture of me and
we'll<00:04:18.090> see<00:04:18.209> how<00:04:18.299> it<00:04:18.419> looks<00:04:18.450> okay<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.919> what<00:04:20.039> you

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
we'll see how it looks okay so what you

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.190 
we'll see how it looks okay so what you
want<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.370> do<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.539> always<00:04:21.870> use<00:04:22.019> light

don't want it to be as strong as your
main<00:04:34.389> light<00:04:34.570> or<00:04:34.810> else<00:04:34.930> you'll<00:04:35.110> get<00:04:35.229> something

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
main light or else you'll get something

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.110 
main light or else you'll get something
that<00:04:35.650> like<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:36.070> look<00:04:36.550> horrible<00:04:36.699> in<00:04:37.000> this

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
that like I look horrible in this

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
you really don't want to do that so

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.700 
you really don't want to do that so
Amelia<00:04:40.810> would<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.020> mind<00:04:41.199> lowering<00:04:41.410> that

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
Amelia would you mind lowering that

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.920 
Amelia would you mind lowering that
about<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.070> stop<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.610> there's<00:04:43.210> some<00:04:43.360> sliders<00:04:43.780> on

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
about a stop and there's some sliders on

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.780 
about a stop and there's some sliders on
the<00:04:43.960> back<00:04:44.169> of<00:04:44.290> these<00:04:44.380> lights<00:04:44.860> we're<00:04:45.610> using

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
the back of these lights we're using

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.490 
the back of these lights we're using
just<00:04:45.940> alien<00:04:46.540> bees<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:46.960> white<00:04:47.080> lightnings

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
just alien bees and white lightnings

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.010 
just alien bees and white lightnings
very<00:04:47.830> simple<00:04:48.130> lights<00:04:48.419> but<00:04:49.419> you<00:04:49.510> can<00:04:49.660> just<00:04:49.840> kind

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
very simple lights but you can just kind

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.689 
very simple lights but you can just kind
of<00:04:50.050> like<00:04:50.229> lower<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.949> power<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.400> your<00:04:51.520> light

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
of like lower the power of your light

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.820 
of like lower the power of your light
and<00:04:51.970> then<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.180> won't<00:04:52.449> get<00:04:52.600> as<00:04:52.780> much<00:04:52.900> so<00:04:53.680> what

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
and then you won't get as much so what

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.439 
and then you won't get as much so what
we're<00:04:53.979> trying<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.520> get<00:04:54.669> here<00:04:54.880> is<00:04:55.030> we're<00:04:55.300> trying

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
we're trying to get here is we're trying

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.909 
we're trying to get here is we're trying
to<00:04:55.540> get<00:04:55.690> this<00:04:55.870> light<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.260> fill<00:04:56.470> in<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.710> shadow

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
to get this light to fill in the shadow

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.110 
to get this light to fill in the shadow
so<00:04:57.160> we<00:04:57.280> don't<00:04:57.430> want<00:04:57.580> our<00:04:57.669> shadows<00:04:57.940> going

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
so we don't want our shadows going

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.300 
so we don't want our shadows going
completely<00:04:58.690> black<00:04:58.990> but<00:04:59.260> we<00:04:59.889> don't<00:05:00.100> want<00:05:00.250> our

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
completely black but we don't want our

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.610 
completely black but we don't want our
shadows<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.940> be<00:05:01.090> brighter<00:05:01.900> than<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.380> light

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
shadows to be brighter than the light

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.879 
shadows to be brighter than the light
coming<00:05:02.919> from<00:05:02.949> above<00:05:03.160> either<00:05:03.960> right<00:05:04.960> on<00:05:05.080> so

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
coming from above either right on so

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.290 
coming from above either right on so
there<00:05:06.039> we<00:05:06.190> go<00:05:06.220> that<00:05:06.520> does<00:05:06.850> look<00:05:07.000> better<00:05:07.210> I

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
there we go that does look better I

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.550 
there we go that does look better I
think<00:05:07.570> we<00:05:07.690> could<00:05:07.840> even<00:05:07.960> lower<00:05:08.139> the<00:05:08.289> power<00:05:08.410> of

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
think we could even lower the power of

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.659 
think we could even lower the power of
this<00:05:08.620> a<00:05:08.680> little<00:05:08.949> bit<00:05:09.070> more<00:05:09.190> so<00:05:09.310> if<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.460> want<00:05:09.610> to

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
this a little bit more so if you want to

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.040 
this a little bit more so if you want to
lower<00:05:09.789> it<00:05:09.910> about<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.090> half<00:05:10.270> stop<00:05:10.570> more<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.960> think

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
lower it about a half stop more I think

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.810 
lower it about a half stop more I think
that'll<00:05:11.410> get<00:05:11.500> us<00:05:11.560> what<00:05:11.860> what<00:05:12.160> we<00:05:12.280> want<00:05:12.460> there

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
that'll get us what what we want there

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.580 
that'll get us what what we want there

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
thing about these this light is because

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.060 
thing about these this light is because
both<00:05:22.690> your<00:05:22.900> lights<00:05:23.110> are<00:05:23.289> so<00:05:23.500> close<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:24.039> the

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
both your lights are so close to the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.350 
both your lights are so close to the
camera<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:24.520> mean<00:05:24.729> they're<00:05:24.850> like<00:05:25.000> they're

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
camera I mean they're like they're

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.210 
camera I mean they're like they're
literally<00:05:25.660> in<00:05:25.780> between<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.560> camera<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:26.949> the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
literally in between the camera and the

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.909 
literally in between the camera and the
subject<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.990> because<00:05:28.990> they're<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.139> close<00:05:29.440> you

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
subject and because they're so close you

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.520 
subject and because they're so close you
can<00:05:30.099> see<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.669> there's<00:05:31.599> a<00:05:31.660> lot<00:05:31.930> of<00:05:32.020> reflection

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
can see that there's a lot of reflection

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.500 
can see that there's a lot of reflection
in<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:33.340> eyes<00:05:33.520> of<00:05:33.729> the<00:05:33.849> subjects<00:05:34.210> what's

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
in the eyes of the subjects what's

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.940 
in the eyes of the subjects what's
called<00:05:34.750> catch<00:05:34.990> lights<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.470> can<00:05:35.620> see<00:05:35.650> like<00:05:35.919> a

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
called catch lights you can see like a

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.500 
called catch lights you can see like a
huge<00:05:36.250> catch<00:05:36.460> light<00:05:36.639> up<00:05:36.760> there<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.150> a<00:05:37.180> large

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
huge catch light up there and a large

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.850 
huge catch light up there and a large
capture<00:05:37.930> light<00:05:38.050> down<00:05:38.289> there<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.680> it's<00:05:38.770> going

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
capture light down there and it's going

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.440 
capture light down there and it's going
to<00:05:38.919> make<00:05:39.070> your<00:05:39.220> subject<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.580> was<00:05:39.729> like<00:05:39.880> glow<00:05:40.180> and
