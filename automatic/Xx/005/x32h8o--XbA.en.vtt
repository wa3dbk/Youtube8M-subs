00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.840 
screen for the expiring dream dragon
came<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.109> game<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.160> later<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
came up on my game but later on in the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.679 
came up on my game but later on in the
day<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.570> gone<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:05.030> they<00:01:06.030> probably<00:01:06.270> gonna

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
day it was gone so they probably gonna

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.710 
day it was gone so they probably gonna
set<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.740> expire<00:01:08.430> starting<00:01:09.030> tomorrow<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.600 
think there's about one day maybe two
days<00:01:13.110> apart<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.650> don't<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.920> maybe<00:01:14.159> three<00:01:14.490> days

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
days apart I don't know maybe three days
