00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
in like that and here's what the top

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.900 
in like that and here's what the top
looks<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.710> I<00:03:48.270> got<00:03:49.270> this<00:03:49.450> from<00:03:49.660> eBay<00:03:50.110> I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
looks like I got this from eBay I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.770 
looks like I got this from eBay I
believe<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.150> was<00:03:52.330> um<00:03:54.330> like<00:03:55.330> forty<00:03:55.720> five

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
believe it was um like forty five

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.780 
believe it was um like forty five
dollars<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:58.330> what<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.810> does<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.640> obviously<00:04:00.640> on

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
dollars and what it does is obviously on

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.670 
dollars and what it does is obviously on
one<00:04:01.000> side<00:04:01.210> it<00:04:01.390> turns<00:04:01.600> on<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.200> then<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.470> turn

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
one side it turns on and then you turn

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.650 
one side it turns on and then you turn
it<00:04:02.770> on<00:04:02.890> with<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.040> light<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:04.150> think<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.420> put

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
it on with the light and I think you put

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.290 
it on with the light and I think you put
it<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.990> others<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.560> other<00:04:05.800> side<00:04:09.300> it's

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
it the others to the other side it's

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.690 
it the others to the other side it's
basically<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:11.050> arts<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.830> move<00:04:12.100> so<00:04:12.430> you

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
basically like arts and I move so you

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.190 
basically like arts and I move so you
can<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.240> take<00:04:13.390> your<00:04:13.420> hand<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.750> there<00:04:13.870> and

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
can just take your hand in there and

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.330 
can just take your hand in there and
I'll<00:04:14.620> turn<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:15.269> which<00:04:16.269> is<00:04:16.450> really<00:04:16.780> cool<00:04:17.049> I
