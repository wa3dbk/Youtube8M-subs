know I've done a lot of research and I

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.660 
know I've done a lot of research and I
come<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.409> conclusion<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.979> when<00:01:09.460> you

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
come to the conclusion that when you

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.000 
come to the conclusion that when you
heat<00:01:09.970> things<00:01:10.240> up<00:01:10.570> it<00:01:10.810> loses<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.500> lot<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.799> its

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
heat things up it loses a lot of its

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.060 
heat things up it loses a lot of its
value<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.820> lot<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.360> its<00:01:13.479> nutritional<00:01:13.869> value<00:01:14.170> so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
value a lot of its nutritional value so

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.330 
value a lot of its nutritional value so
I<00:01:15.460> throw<00:01:16.420> them<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:16.689> I'll<00:01:16.900> cook<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.350> eggs<00:01:17.560> and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
I throw them in I'll cook the eggs and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.440 
I throw them in I'll cook the eggs and
then<00:01:19.240> once<00:01:19.450> they're<00:01:19.630> done<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:21.030> throw<00:01:22.030> my<00:01:22.270> red

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
then once they're done I throw my red

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.410 
then once they're done I throw my red
peppers<00:01:22.869> on<00:01:23.020> top<00:01:23.049> my<00:01:23.530> green<00:01:23.740> peppers<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.280> top

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
