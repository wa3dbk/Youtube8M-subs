flexible<00:00:32.850> due<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> silicon<00:00:34.110> material

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
flexible due to the silicon material

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.680 
flexible due to the silicon material
it's<00:00:34.770> made<00:00:34.829> out<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.360> gives

it's made out of and with that it gives

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.959 
it's made out of and with that it gives
it<00:00:36.809> some<00:00:37.110> great<00:00:37.469> water-resistant<00:00:38.430> properties

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
choose from besides red secondly you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
choose from besides red secondly you
have<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> heart<00:01:58.950> rate<00:01:59.100> sensor<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.850> its

have the heart rate sensor on its

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
the top button for a few seconds it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.540 
the top button for a few seconds it
places<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> into<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.320> mode<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:53.130> from<00:02:53.340> here

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
places it into that mode then from here

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.730 
places it into that mode then from here
it's<00:02:53.820> it's<00:02:54.450> tracking<00:02:54.990> your<00:02:55.110> heart<00:02:55.380> rate<00:02:55.590> in

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
now other other trackers out there have

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.090 
now other other trackers out there have
real<00:03:03.180> time<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:03.930> always<00:03:04.290> constantly<00:03:04.860> on

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
real time so it's always constantly on

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.610 
real time so it's always constantly on
to<00:03:05.490> get<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> really<00:03:06.120> good<00:03:06.270> active<00:03:06.750> reading<00:03:07.020> but

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
to get a really good active reading but

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.320 
to get a really good active reading but
this<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.860> primarily<00:03:08.070> meant<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.910> be<00:03:09.030> used<00:03:09.180> with

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
this is primarily meant to be used with

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330 
this is primarily meant to be used with
workouts<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.830> about<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
workouts and what I like about the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.920 
workouts and what I like about the
workout<00:03:11.700> mode<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.360> you'll<00:03:12.600> have<00:03:12.750> this

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
workout mode is that you'll have this

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.220 
workout mode is that you'll have this
another<00:03:13.560> LED<00:03:14.100> lighting<00:03:14.580> up<00:03:14.730> here<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.570> so

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
another LED lighting up here so and so

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.480 
another LED lighting up here so and so
if<00:03:16.380> you're<00:03:16.560> working<00:03:16.800> out<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.250> you're

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
if you're working out and you're

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.400 
if you're working out and you're
increasing<00:03:17.910> your<00:03:18.180> heart<00:03:18.239> rate<00:03:18.450> it'll<00:03:19.050> change

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
increasing your heart rate it'll change

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.140 
increasing your heart rate it'll change
colors<00:03:19.890> accordingly<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.850> know<00:03:21.000> where

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
colors accordingly so you know where

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.640 
colors accordingly so you know where
you're<00:03:21.270> at<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.810> thought<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.380> you'll<00:03:22.500> also

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
you're at I thought that you'll also

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.370 
you're at I thought that you'll also
feel<00:03:22.920> some<00:03:23.130> vibrations<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.390> indicate<00:03:24.930> your

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
feel some vibrations to indicate your
