00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
pushes about that so I decide to make a

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.700

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.350 
second week for example then you had to
count<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.710> breath<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.670> whenever<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.240> would

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
count your breath so whenever you would

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.070 
count your breath so whenever you would
exhale<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.649> count<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.299> 221<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.600> then

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
exhale you would count that 221 and then

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.859 
exhale you would count that 221 and then
back<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.920> whenever<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.490> last<00:01:50.789> cab<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.689> have

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
back and whenever you last cab you have

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
back and whenever you last cab you have
to<00:01:52.020> start<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.320> over<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.310> luckily<00:01:53.549> almost

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to start all over which I luckily almost

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.609 
to start all over which I luckily almost
never<00:01:54.270> had<00:01:54.509> from<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> beginning<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.350> that's<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
never had from the beginning so that's a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.630 
never had from the beginning so that's a
good<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.220> think<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.429> would

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
good thing because I think that would

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
good thing because I think that would
really<00:01:56.670> frustrate<00:01:57.420> me<00:01:57.539> but<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.409> way<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
really frustrate me but in a way that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
really frustrate me but in a way that
side<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.220> really<00:01:59.490> help<00:01:59.610> me<00:01:59.850> out<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.720> also

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.289 
depends I guess if you start meditating
you<00:02:52.680> do<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:52.920> for<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.160> certain<00:02:53.370> reason<00:02:53.609> like<00:02:54.120> I

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
you do it for a certain reason like I
