done as you can see blood squirts out

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.560 
done as you can see blood squirts out
the<00:01:11.399> bodies<00:01:11.729> fall<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> ground<00:01:12.149> you<00:01:12.450> can

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the bodies fall on the ground you can

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.209 
the bodies fall on the ground you can
push<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:12.899> around<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:14.039> don't

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
push them around actually they don't

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.520 
push them around actually they don't
have<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.460> time<00:01:14.670> until<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.030> fade<00:01:15.210> away<00:01:15.539> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
have much time until they fade away the

have much time until they fade away the
blood<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.100> guess<00:01:17.340> supposed<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> be

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
blood is I guess supposed to be

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.120 
blood is I guess supposed to be
splattered<00:01:18.479> kind<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.439> fences<00:01:19.920> but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
splattered kind of on the fences but

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.469 
splattered kind of on the fences but
since<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> fence<00:01:20.609> is<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> whole<00:01:21.030> block<00:01:21.240> its

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
since the fence is not a whole block its

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.910 
since the fence is not a whole block its
kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> messing<00:01:22.799> itself<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:24.859> so<00:01:26.090> that's<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
kind of messing itself up so that's that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.149 
kind of messing itself up so that's that
then<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.939> skeleton<00:01:30.600> which<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.590> can

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
then we have the skeleton which I can

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.680 
then we have the skeleton which I can
have<00:01:32.969> them<00:01:33.179> guys

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
have them guys

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.830 
have them guys
the<00:01:35.290> fire<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:36.370> fire<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.940> dark<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.360> there<00:01:37.570> so

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
the fire the fire the dark is there so

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.350 
the fire the fire the dark is there so
it<00:01:38.080> brings<00:01:38.290> them<00:01:38.560> into<00:01:38.740> eternity<00:01:39.400> no<00:01:40.090> um

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
it brings them into eternity no um

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.440 
it brings them into eternity no um
actually<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:42.280> just<00:01:42.310> duck<00:01:42.700> cuz<00:01:43.090> they're

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
actually they just duck cuz they're

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.230 
actually they just duck cuz they're
noobs<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.860> slowly<00:01:48.280> die<00:01:48.730> out<00:01:49.180> there

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
noobs so as they slowly die out there

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.030 
noobs so as they slowly die out there
they<00:01:49.540> go<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.930> there's<00:01:50.170> one<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.500> push<00:01:50.920> them

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
they go and there's one I push them

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.950 
they go and there's one I push them
around<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.340> push<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.610> zombie<00:01:51.940> around<00:01:52.180> now<00:01:52.810> of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
around and push the zombie around now of

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.290 
around and push the zombie around now of
course<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.230> skeletons<00:01:53.590> don't<00:01:53.770> have<00:01:53.920> blood

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
course the skeletons don't have blood

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.110 
course the skeletons don't have blood
because<00:01:55.300> they<00:01:55.720> don't<00:01:56.050> have<00:01:56.110> blood<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.970> no

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
because they don't have blood so no

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.580 
because they don't have blood so no
blood<00:01:58.330> squirts<00:01:58.630> out<00:01:58.750> for<00:01:58.930> them<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.230> push<00:01:59.470> the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
blood squirts out for them and push the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.330 
blood squirts out for them and push the
bones<00:01:59.830> route<00:02:01.260> so<00:02:02.260> there's<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.860> then<00:02:03.010> the

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
bones route so there's that and then the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.610 
bones route so there's that and then the
creepers<00:02:03.820> which<00:02:04.240> are<00:02:04.900> annoying<00:02:05.290> because<00:02:05.440> when

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
creepers which are annoying because when

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.230 
creepers which are annoying because when
you<00:02:06.010> hit<00:02:06.160> them<00:02:06.250> sometimes<00:02:06.730> they<00:02:06.850> don't<00:02:06.940> always

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
you hit them sometimes they don't always

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.270 
you hit them sometimes they don't always
die<00:02:07.450> right<00:02:07.720> away<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.440> there<00:02:08.830> they<00:02:08.920> go<00:02:08.950> he's
