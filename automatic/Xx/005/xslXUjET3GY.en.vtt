oh yeah we're just gonna look over some

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920 
oh yeah we're just gonna look over some
of<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> features<00:00:20.180> at<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> top<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.869> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
of the features at the top here you can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.900 
of the features at the top here you can
see<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.800> just<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.400> power<00:00:23.550> plus

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
see I you have just a little power plus

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.310 
see I you have just a little power plus
or<00:00:24.060> minus<00:00:24.330> command<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.869> pretty<00:00:25.050> much<00:00:25.140> what

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
or minus command and pretty much what

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.400 
or minus command and pretty much what
they're<00:00:25.439> trying<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> tell<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
they're trying to tell you here is a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.380 
they're trying to tell you here is a
faster<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> speed<00:00:29.039> set<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
faster you have the speed set to the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.569 
faster you have the speed set to the
more<00:00:30.660> batter<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.340> there

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
more batter you're going to use so there

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.020 
more batter you're going to use so there
you<00:00:32.669> go<00:00:32.840> completely<00:00:34.190> just<00:00:35.190> complete<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you go completely just complete a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.990 
you go completely just complete a
variable<00:00:36.590> speed<00:00:37.590> control<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.820> can

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
variable speed control there so you can

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
variable speed control there so you can
have<00:00:39.149> one<00:00:39.420> obviously<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.899> most<00:00:40.200> power<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
have one obviously for most power and

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.459 
have one obviously for most power and
six<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> most<00:00:41.280> speed<00:00:42.200> right<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
six for the most speed right here is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
six for the most speed right here is
where<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.680> takes<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.950> 36<00:00:44.460> volt<00:00:44.730> lithium<00:00:45.300> battery

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
where it takes a 36 volt lithium battery

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.709 
where it takes a 36 volt lithium battery

parts there's just wiring so you can now

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
parts there's just wiring so you can now
today<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.180> try<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.590> hand<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
today I'm try to this with one hand you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.960 
today I'm try to this with one hand you
can<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.460> either<00:01:32.460> shorten

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
can now go like this and either shorten

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.440 
can now go like this and either shorten
or<00:01:33.210> lengthen<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:37.020> length<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:39.270> yeah<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
or lengthen the length of it so yeah I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
or lengthen the length of it so yeah I
guess<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> feel<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.500> short<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.950> have

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
guess you feel really short you can have

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.679 
guess you feel really short you can have
it<00:01:41.250> keep<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.479> long<00:01:42.720> or<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:44.390> pull<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> out

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it keep that long or you can pull it out

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.490 
it keep that long or you can pull it out
like<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.759> for<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.899> different<00:01:48.899> height<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.229> also

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
like so for a different height and also

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.359 
like so for a different height and also
makes<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.710> nice<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> throw

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
makes it nice if you're going to throw

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.190 
makes it nice if you're going to throw
it<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> trunk<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.090> something<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:52.110> know

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it in a trunk or something you know

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.160 
it in a trunk or something you know
worried<00:01:52.470> about<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.829> taking<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.250> much<00:01:53.340> space

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
worried about it taking up much space

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.069 
worried about it taking up much space
here<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.470> see<00:01:56.030> 10<00:01:57.030> use<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.570> actually<00:01:58.049> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
here you can see 10 use it's actually a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.289 
here you can see 10 use it's actually a
few<00:01:58.259> days<00:01:58.409> old<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.070> been<00:01:59.219> used<00:01:59.460> quite<00:01:59.759> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
few days old but it's been used quite a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.109 
few days old but it's been used quite a
bit<00:02:00.450> already<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.460> this<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.640> actually<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
bit already and this is actually the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.200 
bit already and this is actually the
motor<00:02:03.329> here<00:02:03.659> 36<00:02:04.229> volt<00:02:04.439> motor<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.000> it's<00:02:06.000> got<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
motor here 36 volt motor and it's got a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.830 
motor here 36 volt motor and it's got a
what<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.259> call<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.680> gear<00:02:08.099> drive<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
what they call a gear drive so it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.740 
what they call a gear drive so it
reduces<00:02:10.259> slightly<00:02:11.129> from<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.910> pinion<00:02:12.720> gear

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
reduces slightly from the pinion gear

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.700 
reduces slightly from the pinion gear
off<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.140> motor

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
off the motor

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.670 
off the motor
to<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.160> slightly<00:02:14.970> larger<00:02:15.240> year<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.140> it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
to a slightly larger year here so it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.990 
to a slightly larger year here so it
doesn't<00:02:16.710> bog<00:02:17.070> down<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.520> much<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:17.880> you're

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
doesn't bog down as much when you're

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.460 
doesn't bog down as much when you're
going<00:02:18.180> through<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> weeds<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.290> that's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
going through the weeds and that's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.140 
going through the weeds and that's
actually<00:02:19.860> one<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.160> their<00:02:20.310> selling<00:02:20.580> points<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
actually one of their selling points I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.250 
actually one of their selling points I
guess<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:22.400> 13<00:02:23.400> inch<00:02:23.550> cut<00:02:23.790> but<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> worst<00:02:25.050> part

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
guess and 13 inch cut but the worst part

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.120 
guess and 13 inch cut but the worst part
of<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.010> fact<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.610> uses<00:02:28.130> point

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
of it is is the fact that it uses point

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.650 
of it is is the fact that it uses point
zero<00:02:29.520> six<00:02:29.940> five<00:02:30.210> line<00:02:31.460> see<00:02:32.460> if<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.820> show<00:02:33.570> you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
zero six five line see if I can show you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.360 
zero six five line see if I can show you
that<00:02:33.870> okay<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:36.090> says<00:02:36.330> use<00:02:36.540> only<00:02:37.010> point<00:02:38.010> zero

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that okay but says use only point zero

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.720 
that okay but says use only point zero
six<00:02:38.670> five<00:02:38.880> line<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:41.280> that's<00:02:41.400> kind<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
six five line so that's kind of a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.050 
six five line so that's kind of a
downside<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:43.470> um<00:02:43.620> obviously<00:02:44.250> here<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
downside to it but um obviously here you

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.540 
downside to it but um obviously here you
go<00:02:45.210> um<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> if<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.100> wanna<00:02:47.220> use<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.370> as<00:02:47.490> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
go um this is a if you wanna use it as a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.340 
go um this is a if you wanna use it as a
trimmer<00:02:47.880> that's<00:02:48.210> what<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.390> bar<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:48.960> it

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
trimmer that's what this bar is for it

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.080 
trimmer that's what this bar is for it
goes<00:02:49.530> up<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.310> sorry<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:50.760> trimmer

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
goes up like that or sorry now trimmer

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.150 
goes up like that or sorry now trimmer
and<00:02:51.180> edger<00:02:51.300> then<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.350> can<00:02:52.530> flip<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.920> right

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and edger then you can flip it right

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.390 
and edger then you can flip it right
over<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.650> then<00:02:55.650> when<00:02:55.770> you're<00:02:55.890> holding<00:02:56.250> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
over like so then when you're holding it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.740 
over like so then when you're holding it
you<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.440> trim<00:02:58.440> using<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:59.070> bar<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:00.270> go<00:03:00.450> along

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
you can trim using that bar and go along

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.800 
you can trim using that bar and go along
and<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:02.090> kind<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.210> seems<00:03:03.360> more<00:03:03.600> like<00:03:03.780> a

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and that's a kind of seems more like a

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.980 
and that's a kind of seems more like a
gimmick<00:03:04.080> than<00:03:04.320> anything<00:03:04.530> because<00:03:05.570> I'd<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.630> just

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
gimmick than anything because I'd I just

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.420 
gimmick than anything because I'd I just
don't<00:03:07.110> see<00:03:07.260> us<00:03:07.290> being<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.680> very<00:03:07.860> good<00:03:07.890> trimmer

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
don't see us being a very good trimmer

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.900 
don't see us being a very good trimmer
edger<00:03:08.690> sorry<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.380> 36<00:03:11.310> volts<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:11.760> got

so<00:03:58.650> right<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:59.070> I'm<00:03:59.160> going<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.340> be<00:03:59.430> doing<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.760> on

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
so right now I'm going to be doing it on

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.580 
so right now I'm going to be doing it on
the<00:04:00.350> fastest<00:04:01.350> speed<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.460> six<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.140> also<00:04:04.320> give

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
the fastest speed of six so I also give

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.110 
the fastest speed of six so I also give
you<00:04:04.680> at<00:04:04.770> least<00:04:04.920> run<00:04:05.130> time<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.670> most<00:04:05.850> power

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
you at least run time to the most power

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.260 
you at least run time to the most power
so<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.220> an<00:04:08.400> excuse<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.940> road<00:04:09.090> noise

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
so this is it an excuse the road noise

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.540 
so this is it an excuse the road noise
