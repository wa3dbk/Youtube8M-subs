00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.310
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.280
 a little old man called the 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.790
 journalist expecting players is 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.220
 tiny 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.590
 there's no obscene talk no no it's 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.880
 just white cards 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.880
 the judge of the white cards look 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 daydren on someone white yes a 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.309
 white game so I asked you to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.829
 what serves a certain white game 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.760
 people will tell us nothing and well me 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.520
 I tell you all about a star 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.309
 if it's for something a game a game 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:50.000
 white it serves and a magician it serves to 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:54.350
 to do and be careful because you know 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.120
 if it is a gamble of a card pie 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.230
 thick like that because nothing is 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.680
 played shows the map is started the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.680
 make sure nothing 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 is she finished greens wanted to see 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.729
 inside we do not trust 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.570
 do not trust you say he is 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.040
 white knee it's a huge loss 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.200
 frankly you imagine a 52 game 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.420
 cards with cards like that it's 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.490
 impossible 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 just imagine mixing the game it's 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.149
 too complicated then what can be done 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.090
 is make smaller cards 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:38.890
 like that with two cards back then 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 close like that we can do another 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:52.420
 map another then another name 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.869
 and then to say at that moment the little ones 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.000
 problems 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.770
 he does not like the time again we whistle 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.500
 not full and here you are 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.830
 sarenza in white game so now 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.479
 to play ask imagine to do 52 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.709
 how many cards will there be 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.299
 inside there I made a small area 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.709
 of faith but no I do it ten times 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.060
 how much is the kart inside 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:25.079
 how do you say no do not trust the thing 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:26.950
 there the game is totally white he has nothing 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.989
 that we make the cards appear 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.110
 simple just press the button 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.110
 the better you 'll get it here right here 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:54.120
 and there I see the noble with a day 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.470
 like that you know we can do some 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.670
 games the belote of magic tricks 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.140
 some Haitians like me took 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:11.610
 used to have each turn to cut 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:15.720
 their mouths they took bad because 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.739
 with a white game coupal white game that 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.950
 eventually disappear all the cards 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.060

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.739
 imagine that I 'm going to give you 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.980
 the explanation 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:32.040
 unfortunately no because this turn 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.000
 is a pretty good trick as you can 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.019
 to see it is a good effect I guess 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.209
