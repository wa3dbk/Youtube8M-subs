again<00:06:08.509> we're<00:06:09.469> going<00:06:09.620> to<00:06:09.830> undulate<00:06:10.219> it

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
again we're going to undulate it

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.850 
again we're going to undulate it
basically<00:06:11.300> undulation<00:06:11.810> is<00:06:12.139> just<00:06:12.379> smoothing

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
basically undulation is just smoothing

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.860 
basically undulation is just smoothing
out<00:06:13.009> a<00:06:13.069> broken<00:06:13.610> movement<00:06:14.029> so<00:06:14.599> we're<00:06:14.689> going<00:06:14.779> to

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
out a broken movement so we're going to

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.779 
out a broken movement so we're going to
put<00:06:15.020> this<00:06:15.110> all<00:06:15.379> together<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:16.099> we're<00:06:16.550> going<00:06:16.729> to

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
put this all together and we're going to

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.730 
put this all together and we're going to
start<00:06:17.029> by<00:06:17.210> undulating<00:06:17.569> our<00:06:17.900> upper<00:06:18.229> body<00:06:18.469> to

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
start by undulating our upper body to
