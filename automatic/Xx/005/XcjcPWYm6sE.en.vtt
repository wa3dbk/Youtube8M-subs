it's just I don't know it's such a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.270 
it's just I don't know it's such a
satisfying<00:02:27.600> game<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> vehicles<00:02:29.100> are

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
satisfying game like the vehicles are

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.400 
satisfying game like the vehicles are
sketchy<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.950> whole<00:02:33.290> sensitivity<00:02:34.290> in

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
sketchy the whole sensitivity in

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.680 
sketchy the whole sensitivity in
vehicles<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:35.010> pretty<00:02:35.250> sketchy<00:02:35.580> but<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
vehicles is pretty sketchy but the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.250 
vehicles is pretty sketchy but the
gunplay<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.760> bunny<00:02:39.450> hopping<00:02:39.959> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
gunplay and the the bunny hopping I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.400 
gunplay and the the bunny hopping I
guess<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.680> aza<00:02:40.980> bail<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:42.000> takes<00:02:42.750> me<00:02:42.900> out<00:02:43.110> he

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
guess it aza bail just takes me out he

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.320 
guess it aza bail just takes me out he
said<00:02:43.590> he's<00:02:43.770> hurting<00:02:44.040> after<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.670> hip

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
switch the SMG which has the better hips

homefront<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:30.320> stops<00:03:31.320> people<00:03:31.709> from<00:03:31.860> camping

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
homefront it stops people from camping

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.740 
homefront it stops people from camping
as<00:03:34.099> in<00:03:35.319> you<00:03:36.319> can<00:03:36.349> more<00:03:36.709> people<00:03:37.040> snout<00:03:37.310> seeing

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
as in you can more people snout seeing

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.039 
as in you can more people snout seeing
almost<00:03:38.750> my<00:03:38.989> shotgun<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.329> means<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.689> need<00:03:41.750> one

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
almost my shotgun so it means I need one

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.339 
almost my shotgun so it means I need one
more<00:03:42.200> kill<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:43.069> go<00:03:43.189> up<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:44.349> star-streak

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
more kill to go up to you to star-streak

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.110 
more kill to go up to you to star-streak
so<00:03:45.620> that's<00:03:45.769> basically<00:03:45.859> a<00:03:46.099> wanted<00:03:46.670> level<00:03:46.700> with

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
so that's basically a wanted level with

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.710 
so that's basically a wanted level with
the<00:03:47.239> old<00:03:47.420> GTA<00:03:47.959> style<00:03:48.579> so<00:03:49.579> and<00:03:50.000> then<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.299> marks

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
the old GTA style so and then you marks

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.690 
the old GTA style so and then you marks
enemies<00:03:51.230> if<00:03:51.560> you<00:03:51.650> got<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.799> one-star<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.310> believe

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
enemies if you got a one-star I believe

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.550 
enemies if you got a one-star I believe
it<00:03:52.849> marks<00:03:53.209> like<00:03:53.420> two<00:03:53.689> enemies<00:03:54.109> or<00:03:54.290> something

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
it marks like two enemies or something

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.069 
it marks like two enemies or something
like<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.709> if<00:03:55.099> you're<00:03:55.220> at<00:03:55.340> three<00:03:55.730> star<00:03:56.079> our

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
like that if you're at three star our

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.229 
like that if you're at three star our
two<00:03:57.379> star<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:58.129> get<00:03:58.250> like<00:03:58.400> four<00:03:58.670> enemies<00:03:59.090> and

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
two star you get like four enemies and

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.879 
two star you get like four enemies and
then<00:03:59.359> if<00:03:59.450> you<00:03:59.510> have<00:03:59.720> five<00:03:59.930> starts<00:04:00.409> every

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
then if you have five starts every

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.319 
then if you have five starts every
element<00:04:01.159> buddy<00:04:01.430> on<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.639> map<00:04:01.819> there's<00:04:02.060> a<00:04:02.120> big
