 you have the map has already gone up well once 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.729
 good for example we climb two fingers 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.840
 long there is on the map it is already in the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.300

 let's go to mx x 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.380

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.950
 down up 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.560
 let's put down 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:36.959

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.610

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.520
 Market Stall 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.520
 besides the cs 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.250
 one thing when you upload maps by 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.489
 example how to look for those maps back in 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 models you have to upload them complete if 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.210
 a model comes to you, put the model folder 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.930
 that is there by maps 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.880
 if we had one when the map changes 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.250
 to the map that oficilista is going to grow a 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.910
 little bit applies the model so you do not 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.280

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.410
 full 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.410
 well then we will enter to observe 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.170
 and we want you to be 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.030
 for example to show you the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.220
 room and I'm Saudi I put maps and 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.220
 nor do you have to change the map 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.379
 we are going to change to long since we just 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.379
 I put him will change me 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.660

 we change the map 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.610
 and she is not going to correctly give that 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.230
 map is uploaded on the good server and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.140
 it will also look like when you search 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.070
