00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.970

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.560
 in a final stretch of the festival 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.450
 You have to choose a song that 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.740
 be the writer in the sea you are 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.870
 feeling the rivers in the rest of the jury 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.520
 exactly what my opinion is for 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.160
 the king's master wants to say something 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.450
 Not only did he want to know who the author is 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.550
 of this song 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.620
 do you know who sings fernanda brum is the 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.780
 author of this song you marquinhos 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.340

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.760
 Congratulations, Marquinhos Gomes, your music. 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:11.740

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.740
