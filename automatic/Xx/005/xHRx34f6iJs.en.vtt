was painted and it was stripped now you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
was painted and it was stripped now you
can<00:00:20.550> see<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.449> almost<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.020> hundred

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
can see that we have almost a hundred

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.340 
can see that we have almost a hundred
percent<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.859> paint<00:00:23.670> removed<00:00:24.359> from<00:00:25.080> this

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
percent of this paint removed from this

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.160 
percent of this paint removed from this
product<00:00:26.240> but<00:00:27.240> at<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> same<00:00:27.630> time<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.050> can

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
product but at the same time you can

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.779 
product but at the same time you can
also<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.890> some<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.340> veneer<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
also see that some of the veneer is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.810 
also see that some of the veneer is
coming<00:00:30.150> loose<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.710> reason<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.369> veneer

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
coming loose the reason that this veneer

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.610 
coming loose the reason that this veneer
is<00:00:32.940> coming<00:00:33.329> loose<00:00:33.600> there's<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> couple<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
is coming loose there's a couple of

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370 
is coming loose there's a couple of
different<00:00:34.920> reasons<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.750> age<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
different reasons the age of the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.910 
different reasons the age of the
furniture<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.129> one<00:00:38.629> after<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> long<00:00:39.920> periods

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
furniture for one after a long periods

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.200 
furniture for one after a long periods
of<00:00:41.010> time<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.850> glues<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:43.309> dry<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.520> basically

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
of time the glues can dry out basically

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.580 
of time the glues can dry out basically
and<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:47.100> veneer<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.700> start<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> pop<00:00:48.270> loose

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
and the veneer will start to pop loose

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.310 
and the veneer will start to pop loose
on<00:00:49.590> these<00:00:49.800> pieces<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.340> furniture<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> can

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
on these pieces of furniture and you can

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.130 
on these pieces of furniture and you can
see<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.840> during<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> stripping

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
see here that during the stripping

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.279 
see here that during the stripping
process<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.100> will<00:00:56.610> remove<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:57.629> more<00:00:57.660> veneer

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
process it will remove even more veneer

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.310 
process it will remove even more veneer
the<00:00:59.149> problems<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.870> veneer

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the problems that you have with veneer

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.210 
the problems that you have with veneer
is<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.920> too<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.489> moisture<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:04.010> make<00:01:05.010> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
is that too much moisture will make this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.010 
is that too much moisture will make this
veneer<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.360> glue<00:01:06.869> become<00:01:07.710> less<00:01:08.100> adhesive

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
veneer the glue become less adhesive

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.750 
veneer the glue become less adhesive
properties<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:10.920> start<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> work<00:01:11.580> its

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
properties and it will start to work its

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.219 
properties and it will start to work its
way<00:01:11.909> loose<00:01:12.170> also<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.830> too<00:01:14.100> dry<00:01:14.869> that<00:01:15.869> glue

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
way loose also if it's too dry that glue

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.740 
way loose also if it's too dry that glue
will<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.619> dry<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.460> turn<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.119> dust<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
will just dry out and turn to dust and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
will just dry out and turn to dust and
this<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.130> veneer<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.640> start<00:01:20.880> popping<00:01:21.090> loose

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
this the veneer will start popping loose

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.010 
this the veneer will start popping loose
that<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:22.020> well<00:01:23.150> one<00:01:24.150> other<00:01:24.330> problem<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that way as well one other problem is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
that way as well one other problem is
that<00:01:25.350> during<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> stripping<00:01:26.369> process<00:01:26.400> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that during the stripping process this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.289 
that during the stripping process this
has<00:01:27.180> been<00:01:27.439> stripped<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.270> during<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
has been stripped and during that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.859 
has been stripped and during that
process<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:31.259> will<00:01:31.680> also<00:01:32.390> loosen<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.509> some<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
process it will also loosen up some of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.890 
process it will also loosen up some of
this<00:01:33.930> veneer<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:35.189> typically<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.479> homeowner

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this veneer now typically the homeowner

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.859 
this veneer now typically the homeowner
can<00:01:37.640> glue<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.689> simple

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
can glue this down with just a simple

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.560 
can glue this down with just a simple
piece<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.320> glue<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.030> I'll<00:01:42.030> show<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
piece of glue and I'll show you that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
piece of glue and I'll show you that
later<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.939> able<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> be

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
later on that this will be able to be

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.480 
later on that this will be able to be
glued<00:01:45.630> right<00:01:45.659> back<00:01:46.020> down<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.070> sand<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
glued right back down you can sand it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.310 
glued right back down you can sand it
stain<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.090> polyurethane<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> once<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
stain it and polyurethane it once you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
stain it and polyurethane it once you
get<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> veneer<00:01:50.009> back<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
get all the veneer back down now if you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
get all the veneer back down now if you
have<00:01:51.810> small<00:01:52.229> areas<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.369> wood<00:01:53.729> veneer

that's<00:01:54.360> being<00:01:54.710> loosened<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.070> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that's being loosened up like this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.370 
that's being loosened up like this
you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.119> take<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> small<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.960> spatula

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you can take a small little spatula
