process that the psychologist follows

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.450 
process that the psychologist follows
where<00:00:36.190> they<00:00:36.310> gather<00:00:36.580> information<00:00:37.350> from

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
where they gather information from

where they gather information from
parents<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.640> teachers<00:00:40.060> and<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.450> students

and and then they also get various kinds
of<00:00:45.940> tests<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.770> idea<00:00:48.130> of<00:00:48.370> figuring<00:00:49.120> out

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
of tests with the idea of figuring out

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.479 
of tests with the idea of figuring out
how<00:00:50.980> is<00:00:51.130> a<00:00:51.160> student<00:00:51.700> learn<00:00:52.000> best<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:53.489> what

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
might make them be more successful or

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:06.620 
might make them be more successful or
help<00:00:56.920> them<00:00:57.100> be<00:00:57.220> more<00:00:57.400> successful

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.930 

well<00:01:07.340> here's<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.520> happened<00:01:09.440> sometimes<00:01:10.440> a

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
well here's what happened sometimes a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.190 
well here's what happened sometimes a
student<00:01:11.940> is<00:01:12.300> having<00:01:13.880> some<00:01:14.880> kind<00:01:14.910> of

student is having some kind of
unpredicted<00:01:17.270> learning<00:01:18.270> problem<00:01:18.870> so<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> could

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
unpredicted learning problem so it could

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.640 
unpredicted learning problem so it could
be<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.300> like<00:01:21.300> an<00:01:21.420> early<00:01:21.780> elementary<00:01:21.930> school

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
be that like an early elementary school

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.680 
be that like an early elementary school
the<00:01:23.130> kid<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.640> having<00:01:24.090> difficulty

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
the kid is really having difficulty

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.719 
the kid is really having difficulty
learning<00:01:25.050> how<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.260> read<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.009> instance<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
learning how to read for instance and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.100 
learning how to read for instance and
it's<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.660> just<00:01:27.930> surprises<00:01:28.470> everyone<00:01:29.040> or

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
it's like it just surprises everyone or

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's like it just surprises everyone or
they're<00:01:31.110> having<00:01:31.410> trouble<00:01:31.860> following

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
they're having trouble following

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.540 
they're having trouble following
directions<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.330> classroom<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:35.130> kind

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
directions in the classroom or they kind

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.359 
directions in the classroom or they kind
of<00:01:35.640> seem<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:37.080> lost<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.250> with

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
of seem to just get lost a lot and with

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.880 
of seem to just get lost a lot and with
it<00:01:38.550> with<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.720> follow<00:01:40.020> through<00:01:40.440> it<00:01:40.680> just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it with with follow through it just

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.090 
it with with follow through it just
takes<00:01:41.070> me<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:42.180> long<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:43.080> complete<00:01:43.530> work<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
takes me really long to complete work so

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.300 
takes me really long to complete work so
I<00:01:44.130> mean<00:01:44.369> that's<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> best<00:01:44.910> with<00:01:45.869> younger<00:01:46.140> kids

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
I mean that's the best with younger kids

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.270 
I mean that's the best with younger kids
but<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.810> parents<00:01:49.289> often<00:01:49.440> will<00:01:49.710> want

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
but so that what parents often will want

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.340 
but so that what parents often will want
to<00:01:50.550> figure<00:01:51.090> out<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> schools<00:01:51.750> will<00:01:52.080> suggest

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
to figure out and schools will suggest

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.340 
to figure out and schools will suggest
this<00:01:52.800> too<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.190> well<00:01:53.640> what's<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.270> here

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
this too is well what's going on here

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.950 
this too is well what's going on here
because<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.680> kid<00:01:55.890> seems<00:01:56.160> really<00:01:56.550> capable<00:01:56.960> but

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
because the kid seems really capable but

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810 
because the kid seems really capable but
this<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.470> doesn't<00:01:58.560> add<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
this just doesn't add up that this is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.570 
this just doesn't add up that this is
taking<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.420> long<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.800> that's<00:02:02.009> that's<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
taking so long so that's that's the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.550 
taking so long so that's that's the
reason<00:02:02.789> usually<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> people<00:02:03.960> come<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.320> for

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
reason usually that people come in for

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.320 
reason usually that people come in for
testing

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.910 

okay<00:02:14.330> well<00:02:14.540> depends<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.110> that<00:02:15.350> their<00:02:15.680> age

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
okay well depends on that their age

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.390 
okay well depends on that their age
level<00:02:17.290> because<00:02:18.290> there's<00:02:18.650> tons<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.040> different

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
level because there's tons of different

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.320 
level because there's tons of different
questions<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:20.710> what<00:02:21.710> would<00:02:21.860> help<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.550> nursery

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
questions like what would help a nursery

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.020 
questions like what would help a nursery
school<00:02:23.420> kid<00:02:24.230> for<00:02:24.560> instance<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.520> better<00:02:25.760> with

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
school kid for instance do better with

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.120 
school kid for instance do better with
transitions<00:02:26.870> that's<00:02:27.230> one<00:02:27.530> set<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.950> things

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
transitions that's one set of things

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.640 
transitions that's one set of things
that<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.550> might<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.880> doing<00:02:29.210> but<00:02:29.450> also<00:02:29.750> I'll

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
that you might be doing but also I'll

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.830 
that you might be doing but also I'll
have<00:02:31.220> like<00:02:31.640> kids<00:02:32.030> who<00:02:32.270> are<00:02:32.330> going<00:02:32.630> off<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
have like kids who are going off to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.570 
have like kids who are going off to
college<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.650> university<00:02:34.460> and<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:37.070> they

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
college of university and and so they

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.460 
college of university and and so they
may<00:02:37.790> benefit<00:02:38.240> from<00:02:38.300> things<00:02:38.900> like<00:02:41.290> having<00:02:42.290> a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
may benefit from things like having a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.380 
may benefit from things like having a
note-taker<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.550> help<00:02:43.790> them<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.150> classrooms<00:02:44.870> or

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
note-taker to help them in classrooms or

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.880 
note-taker to help them in classrooms or
being<00:02:47.390> able<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.750> test<00:02:48.230> someplace<00:02:48.710> that's

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
being able to test someplace that's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.010 
being able to test someplace that's
relatively<00:02:49.460> quiet<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.330> they're<00:02:50.480> not<00:02:50.630> going<00:02:50.930> to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
relatively quiet so they're not going to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.340 
relatively quiet so they're not going to
get<00:02:51.170> distracted<00:02:51.680> or<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:53.180> lot<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.900> colleges<00:02:54.290> and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
get distracted or a lot of colleges and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.430 
get distracted or a lot of colleges and
universities<00:02:54.560> now<00:02:55.310> have<00:02:55.550> text<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.440> audible

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
universities now have text in audible

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.830 
universities now have text in audible
format<00:02:57.950> or<00:02:58.280> digital<00:02:58.640> format<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.300> sometimes<00:02:59.690> it

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
format or digital format so sometimes it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.290 
format or digital format so sometimes it
just<00:02:59.960> helps<00:03:00.170> people<00:03:00.710> to<00:03:00.950> hear<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.910> hear<00:03:02.150> it

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
just helps people to hear that hear it

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.180 
just helps people to hear that hear it
rather<00:03:02.570> than<00:03:02.870> an<00:03:03.110> read<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.680> at<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:03.860> same<00:03:04.130> time

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
rather than an read it at the same time

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.280 
rather than an read it at the same time
rather<00:03:04.610> than<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:04.970> slog<00:03:05.780> through<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
rather than just slog through the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.670 
rather than just slog through the
readings

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.220 

okay<00:03:15.519> well<00:03:15.849> here's<00:03:16.269> what<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.599> involves<00:03:17.049> it

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
okay well here's what it involves it

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.160 
okay well here's what it involves it
involves<00:03:18.239> first<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.450> all<00:03:19.540> taking<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.989> really

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
involves first of all taking a really

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.160 
involves first of all taking a really
careful<00:03:20.769> history<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.840> because<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.930> want<00:03:23.140> to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
careful history and because I want to

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.190 
careful history and because I want to
see<00:03:23.409> a<00:03:24.030> farther<00:03:25.030> similar<00:03:25.450> problems<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.080> the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
see a farther similar problems in the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.710 
see a farther similar problems in the
family<00:03:26.440> because<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.370> lot<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.940> its<00:03:28.090> genetic

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
family because a lot of it its genetic

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.530 
family because a lot of it its genetic
or<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.140> be<00:03:29.260> genetic<00:03:29.709> or<00:03:29.860> whether

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
or can be genetic or whether

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.970 
or can be genetic or whether
difficulties<00:03:31.540> at<00:03:31.900> birth<00:03:32.200> that's<00:03:32.620> that's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
difficulties at birth that's that's

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.180 
difficulties at birth that's that's
related<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.849> later<00:03:34.720> learning<00:03:35.260> problems<00:03:35.829> and

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
related to later learning problems and

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.670 
related to later learning problems and
then<00:03:37.030> parents<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.049> teachers<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:38.590> the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
then parents and the teachers and the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.580 
then parents and the teachers and the
kids<00:03:38.890> fill<00:03:39.220> out<00:03:39.370> rating<00:03:39.819> scales<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.629> rating

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
kids fill out rating scales and rating

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.009 
kids fill out rating scales and rating
skills<00:03:41.860> basically<00:03:42.540> there<00:03:43.540> are<00:03:43.569> different

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
skills basically there are different

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.440 
skills basically there are different
topics<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.799> what<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.340> allows<00:03:45.519> me<00:03:45.909> to<00:03:45.940> do<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.209> to

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
topics and what it allows me to do is to

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.960 
topics and what it allows me to do is to
like<00:03:46.810> look<00:03:47.200> at<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.470> responses<00:03:48.129> and<00:03:48.340> see<00:03:48.730> how

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
like look at the responses and see how

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.180 
like look at the responses and see how
they<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.209> compare<00:03:49.840> with<00:03:50.590> like<00:03:50.829> let's<00:03:51.040> say

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
they can compare with like let's say

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.069 
they can compare with like let's say
it's<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.430> twelve<00:03:51.730> year<00:03:51.910> old<00:03:52.090> boy<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.569> how<00:03:53.019> does

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
it's a twelve year old boy so how does

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.970 
it's a twelve year old boy so how does
his<00:03:53.650> teachers<00:03:54.239> responses<00:03:55.239> compared<00:03:55.660> with

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
his teachers responses compared with

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.380 
his teachers responses compared with
other<00:03:56.980> teachers<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.760> United<00:03:57.790> States

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
other teachers in the United States

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.680 
other teachers in the United States
about<00:03:59.280> expected<00:04:00.280> behavior<00:04:00.819> for<00:04:01.090> instance<00:04:01.450> for

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
about expected behavior for instance for

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.210 
about expected behavior for instance for
a<00:04:01.720> twelve-year-old<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.530> that's<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.859> rating

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
a twelve-year-old so that's the rating

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.699 
a twelve-year-old so that's the rating
skills<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:04.569> then<00:04:04.930> there's<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.440> tests

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
skills and then there's the tests

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.250 
skills and then there's the tests
themselves<00:04:05.920> which<00:04:06.370> Canaries<00:04:07.090> are<00:04:07.260> memory

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
themselves which Canaries are memory

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.470 
themselves which Canaries are memory
reasoning<00:04:10.079> processing<00:04:11.079> information

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
reasoning processing information

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.939 
reasoning processing information
executive<00:04:13.480> functioning<00:04:14.489> handwriting<00:04:15.489> and

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
executive functioning handwriting and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.560 
executive functioning handwriting and
attention<00:04:17.949> so<00:04:18.340> that's<00:04:18.519> that's<00:04:18.849> basically<00:04:19.090> the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
attention so that's that's basically the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.710 
attention so that's that's basically the
area<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.260> course<00:04:20.530> their<00:04:20.709> academic<00:04:21.340> work

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
area and of course their academic work

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.240 
area and of course their academic work
right<00:04:22.720> like<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.050> have<00:04:23.260> kids<00:04:23.560> do<00:04:23.800> things<00:04:24.070> like

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
right like I have kids do things like

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.670 
right like I have kids do things like
take<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:24.820> reading<00:04:25.090> test<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.810> see<00:04:26.020> how<00:04:26.260> they

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
take a reading test and see how they

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:35.090 
take a reading test and see how they
doing<00:04:27.070> reading

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.550 

okay<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.000> outcome<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.390> all<00:04:37.600> this<00:04:37.840> work<00:04:38.170> it

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
okay so the outcome of all this work it

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.530 
okay so the outcome of all this work it
would<00:04:38.680> be<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:41.760> really<00:04:42.760> carefully<00:04:43.240> look<00:04:43.450> at

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
would be that I really carefully look at

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.970 
would be that I really carefully look at
all<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:43.900> data<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:45.610> I've<00:04:46.120> gathered<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:47.470> then

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
all the data that I've gathered and then

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.680 
all the data that I've gathered and then
I<00:04:48.220> can<00:04:48.460> see<00:04:48.730> where<00:04:48.910> it<00:04:49.030> kind<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.330> groups

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
I can see where it kind of groups

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.310 
I can see where it kind of groups
together<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.160> helps<00:04:51.400> me<00:04:51.550> understand

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
together and it helps me understand

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.090 
together and it helps me understand
where<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.530> students<00:04:54.180> strengths<00:04:55.180> are<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:56.100> how

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
where the students strengths are and how

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.510 
where the students strengths are and how
they<00:04:57.460> can<00:04:57.520> use<00:04:58.000> those<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:59.650> help<00:04:59.950> overcome

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
they can use those to help overcome

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.630 
they can use those to help overcome
areas<00:05:01.240> where<00:05:01.510> they<00:05:01.630> have<00:05:01.870> weakness<00:05:02.440> now<00:05:03.400> so

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
areas where they have weakness now so

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.700 
areas where they have weakness now so
that's<00:05:03.820> one<00:05:04.150> of<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.360> outcomes<00:05:04.840> from<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.260> so<00:05:05.530> it

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
that's one of the outcomes from it so it

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.350 
that's one of the outcomes from it so it
could<00:05:05.920> be<00:05:05.950> like<00:05:06.040> you<00:05:06.490> know<00:05:06.580> sometimes<00:05:07.060> kids

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
could be like you know sometimes kids

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.650 
could be like you know sometimes kids
are<00:05:08.520> they've<00:05:09.520> just<00:05:09.760> developed<00:05:10.210> these<00:05:10.300> really

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
are they've just developed these really

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.370 
are they've just developed these really
cool<00:05:11.110> memory<00:05:11.620> strategies<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.820> so<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:14.230> can

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
cool memory strategies and so that can

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.090 
cool memory strategies and so that can
be<00:05:14.620> useful<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:15.760> know<00:05:16.470> so<00:05:17.470> that<00:05:17.650> they<00:05:17.800> keep

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
be useful to know so that they keep

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.710 
be useful to know so that they keep
using<00:05:18.460> them<00:05:18.760> where<00:05:18.880> we're<00:05:19.000> going<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.210> increase

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
using them where we're going to increase

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.440 
using them where we're going to increase
them<00:05:20.020> or<00:05:20.230> whatever<00:05:20.770> I<00:05:20.860> can<00:05:21.040> also<00:05:21.160> look<00:05:21.490> at<00:05:21.700> what

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
them or whatever I can also look at what

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.780 
them or whatever I can also look at what
they're<00:05:22.600> not<00:05:22.870> doing<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.620> then<00:05:24.580> make
