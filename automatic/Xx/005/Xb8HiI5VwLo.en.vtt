00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.089
 story that will be we already told the weekend three shootings that left three 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:06.800
 dead and one wounded 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.330
 in Madrid it looks like an American movie but it did not happen in Spain and 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.139
 It's surprising that there are so many guns 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.489
 circulating around 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.670
 it's easy to get them and what is their price on the black market 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
 moss is investigating 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.240
 three deaths by firearm 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.370
 in 15 hours it is more only in the community where they have happened in madrid 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.390
 also french early in the year 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.720
 so a step more sabella we pass the knife the cone carries the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.710
 of that knife's drink 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200
 you may like it more or less 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.640
 but gun is simply to pull a trigger and it's nothing and with 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.470
 that kills a person 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.070
 percent and with a simple a simple art the effort a finger 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.900
 that's what's worrying because I'm saying that the deck that circulates 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.360
 someone 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.840
 down the street murcia de tapie plus a weapon a function that is very very very 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.160
 worrying because 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.200
 per hundred percent the same block can produce much more 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.090
 the policeman alfredo retriever tells us that by a gun like this one in 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.100
 the black market 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.820
 You can pay between 250 and 500 euros 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.620
 and if you think you bought is complicated, you are totally wrong 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.570
 an offender 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.820
 he usually knows where they sell, he knows who sells it 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.010
 and that's when it's easy to follow that track because if you go to a point 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.040
 in pedro abad 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.090
 they will always tell you where a gun is sold there 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.810
 with which easy reference if the gun could be seen at 20m a robbery 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.280
 a hundred with a condom shot with which we have a review of satisfied 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.890
 the tensite is used 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.000
 p in a criminal act can be baptize a murder with which 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.100
 equally remained is already made record of zárate will satisfy to remain 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.960
 prepare them for any possible 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.240
 arrest and seizure of a subsequent weapon 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.899
 if it is has more browns it is almost easier to place because what they want 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.370
 that have already been measured 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.359
 p therefore cheaper 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.010
 private flats and crowded places 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.010
 they are the most common sites to carry out the transaction 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.169
 if that is impossible to calculate the number of illegal firearms that 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:21.849
 they circulate around the country 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.439
 we do not know where they come from, we know that the faucets have been closed 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.329
 international level because they bring 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.629
 percent these gangs organized 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.860
 these foreign percent that are not all grace of god is very minimal 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.499
 percentage of foreigners who bring 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.719
 then the firearms expert 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.509
 and then within the country ep two pistols that are the result of robberies 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:45.699
 art theft armories of gunsmiths of weapons factory 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:50.709
 sps percent perform these these robberies that stay with them even in 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.129
 some case then when before robbers the van what a 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.249
 police that takes advantage of your seize weapons p is more worrying almost wool 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.249
 organized because the guns are organized 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.269
 wing aloe borders at the same level internationally 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.090

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.629
 percent recently an aggression with a weapon a weapon of war 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.609
 is the towels May is more worrying even travolta see more but not so 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.359
 there is 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.830
 while the use of illegal guns increases, the legal ones are restricted 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.380
 the conseller a gun license is no longer so easy 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.860
 because it has resisted a lot lately in the access doors to them 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.860
 businessmen judges eye yero 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.119
 juan quirós who have very 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.719
 min very proven and proven that they really have 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.100
 a cougar said very big money

 it is inoperative it is in danger of being threatened by percent really by hundred 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.259
 percent for a group 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:53.529
 in this case it would be eta oooh a criminal grandma 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.389
 to those if it is shown really believes that those who have that danger have 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.549
 he grants them 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.349
 you started years ago to remove those guns these people 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.149
 i percent and ip 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.529
 it will be searched is very restricted and very very very controlled which is why it is not 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:09.099
 the ocean on normal foot 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.989
 although it has a lot of use it is habitual of the lack many has seen the un of a 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:13.539

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.159
 not be like that 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.250
 As you can see it is amazingly easy to acquire an illegal gun in this 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.059
 country 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:24.509
 the homicides with firearm increase and in addition end account of every hundred 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.509
