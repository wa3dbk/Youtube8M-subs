they're<00:01:04.399> so<00:01:04.550> effective<00:01:04.850> these<00:01:05.630> same

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960

20<00:01:32.659> minute<00:01:32.930> segments<00:01:33.439> people<00:01:34.009> enjoyed<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
20 minute segments people enjoyed the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.999 
20 minute segments people enjoyed the
presentation<00:01:34.850> more<00:01:35.570> they<00:01:36.049> learned<00:01:36.380> more<00:01:36.799> and

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
presentation more they learned more and

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.249 
presentation more they learned more and
they<00:01:37.670> retained<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.299> information<00:01:38.810> longer

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
they retained the information longer

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.550 
they retained the information longer
most<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.490> us<00:01:40.640> give<00:01:41.509> presentations<00:01:42.290> that<00:01:42.500> are

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
most of us give presentations that are

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.980 
most of us give presentations that are
often<00:01:42.890> longer<00:01:43.579> than<00:01:43.729> 20<00:01:44.060> minutes<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:44.600> if<00:01:44.840> you

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
often longer than 20 minutes so if you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.899 
often longer than 20 minutes so if you
have<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.259> presentation<00:01:45.770> that's<00:01:46.070> longer<00:01:46.310> see<00:01:46.850> if

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
have a presentation that's longer see if

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.310 
have a presentation that's longer see if
you<00:01:47.030> can<00:01:47.180> build<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.570> some<00:01:47.720> kind<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:48.020> change

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
you can build in some kind of change

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.800 
you can build in some kind of change
every<00:01:48.650> 20<00:01:48.979> minutes<00:01:49.159> maybe<00:01:49.820> take<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.180> break<00:01:50.509> a
