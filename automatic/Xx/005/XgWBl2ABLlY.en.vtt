and staging imaginary operas one of the
things<00:00:27.460> I<00:00:27.579> find<00:00:27.790> appealing<00:00:28.000> about<00:00:28.180> up<00:00:28.509> earth

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
things I find appealing about up earth

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.190 
things I find appealing about up earth
is<00:00:29.320> this<00:00:29.439> kind<00:00:29.710> of<00:00:29.800> a<00:00:29.950> ludicrous<00:00:31.110> proposition

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500 

it's<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.290> convention<00:00:35.680> that<00:00:36.130> we<00:00:36.250> all<00:00:36.430> read<00:00:37.270> is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
it's a convention that we all read is

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.979 
it's a convention that we all read is
normal<00:00:37.930> but<00:00:38.140> it's<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.410> funny<00:00:38.649> convention<00:00:39.399> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
normal but it's a funny convention I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.680 
normal but it's a funny convention I
like<00:00:40.989> how<00:00:41.199> artificial<00:00:41.829> it<00:00:41.949> is<00:00:42.269> but<00:00:43.269> being<00:00:43.510> so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
like how artificial it is but being so

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.660 
like how artificial it is but being so
artificial<00:00:44.079> it<00:00:44.440> definitely<00:00:45.010> strives<00:00:45.399> to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
artificial it definitely strives to

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.130 
artificial it definitely strives to
evoke<00:00:45.940> strong<00:00:46.530> emotions<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.480> music<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:49.989> the

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
evoke strong emotions the music is the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.619 
evoke strong emotions the music is the
vehicle<00:00:50.170> for<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:50.920> intensity<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.090> emotion

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
vehicle for the intensity of the emotion

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.009 
vehicle for the intensity of the emotion
and<00:00:53.219> that's<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.489> priority<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:55.089> think<00:00:55.420> that's

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
and that's the priority I think that's

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:04.200 
and that's the priority I think that's
definitely<00:00:56.320> my<00:00:56.859> goal<00:01:02.579> creating<00:01:03.579> some<00:01:03.940> sort<00:01:04.089> of

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
definitely my goal creating some sort of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.980 
definitely my goal creating some sort of
emotional<00:01:04.870> response<00:01:05.970> from<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.570> work<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.780> I

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
emotional response from the work that I

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:18.370 
emotional response from the work that I
make<00:01:08.790> absolutely

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.740 

during<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> day<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.649> spend<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.610> time<00:01:20.750> selecting

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
during the day I spend my time selecting

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.800 
during the day I spend my time selecting
all<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.229> stuff<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.420> with

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
all of this stuff and that I can do with

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.859 
all of this stuff and that I can do with
help<00:01:27.380> it's<00:01:28.380> easier<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> work<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.310> I'm<00:01:29.869> by

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
help it's easier to work when I'm by

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.669 
help it's easier to work when I'm by
myself<00:01:35.840> when<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:36.990> quiet

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
myself when it's quiet

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.399 
myself when it's quiet
and<00:01:37.770> there's<00:01:38.640> also<00:01:38.789> no<00:01:39.149> time<00:01:39.750> limit<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.289> know

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
and there's also no time limit you know

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.249 
and there's also no time limit you know
and<00:01:40.830> when<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> work<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> evening<00:01:45.259> collage

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and when you work in the evening collage

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.310 
and when you work in the evening collage
has<00:01:46.289> been<00:01:46.679> one<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.549> most<00:01:47.729> relevant<00:01:48.390> forms

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
has been one of the most relevant forms

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.389 
has been one of the most relevant forms
of<00:01:49.560> art<00:01:49.950> making

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
of art making

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.559 
of art making
I<00:01:50.720> think<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:51.840> resonant<00:01:52.319> because<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:53.459> is<00:01:53.850> made

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
I think it's resonant because it is made

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.719 
I think it's resonant because it is made
of<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.929> stuff<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.770> every<00:01:56.130> day<00:01:56.159> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of the stuff that we see every day so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.580 
of the stuff that we see every day so
it's<00:01:56.850> familiar<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.720> it<00:01:57.840> reflects<00:01:58.229> our

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it's familiar that it reflects our

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.419 
it's familiar that it reflects our
reality<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.590> self-evident

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
reality and it's self-evident

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.990 
reality and it's self-evident
there's<00:02:02.670> no<00:02:03.920> esoteric<00:02:04.920> technique<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.819> make<00:02:05.970> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
there's no esoteric technique to make a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.990 
there's no esoteric technique to make a
collage

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300 

because<00:02:13.510> some<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.840> my<00:02:14.080> subjects<00:02:14.710> or<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
because some of my subjects or the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.580 
because some of my subjects or the
things<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:15.940> I'm<00:02:16.090> trying<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> make<00:02:16.660> or<00:02:16.900> maybe

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
things that I'm trying to make or maybe

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.690 
things that I'm trying to make or maybe
trying<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.160> at<00:02:18.310> something<00:02:18.340> mysterious<00:02:19.200> or

trying to get at something mysterious or

trying to get at something mysterious or
something<00:02:21.700> unknown<00:02:22.060> or<00:02:23.010> something<00:02:24.010> emotional

something unknown or something emotional

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.820 
something unknown or something emotional
I<00:02:24.910> think<00:02:25.840> what's<00:02:25.990> appealing<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.500> me<00:02:26.650> about

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
I think what's appealing to me about

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.190 
I think what's appealing to me about
collage<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.480> fact<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:29.020> so

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
collage is the fact that it's so

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.910 
collage is the fact that it's so
straightforward<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.210> good<00:02:31.420> foil<00:02:31.920> to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
straightforward that it's a good foil to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:47.040 
straightforward that it's a good foil to
my<00:02:33.130> subject<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:43.620> use<00:02:44.620> stories<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.930> get<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
my subject I use stories to get the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.590 
my subject I use stories to get the
picture<00:02:47.350> started<00:02:47.920> or<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> find<00:02:48.760> components<00:02:49.480> or

to locate a compelling narrative or a

to locate a compelling narrative or a
compelling<00:02:52.959> situation<00:02:53.650> maybe<00:02:53.890> that's<00:02:54.130> even<00:02:54.430> a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
compelling situation maybe that's even a

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.690 
compelling situation maybe that's even a
better<00:02:54.670> word<00:02:55.170> or<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.230> compelling<00:02:56.650> psychology

you<00:04:11.639> know<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:14.959> think<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.410> if<00:04:16.949> someone

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
you know I think that if someone

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.060 
you know I think that if someone
encountered<00:04:18.180> my<00:04:18.359> work<00:04:18.959> they<00:04:19.709> would<00:04:19.889> not

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
encountered my work they would not

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.870 
encountered my work they would not
necessarily<00:04:20.849> know<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.979> model<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.580> my

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
necessarily know that the model in my

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.830 
necessarily know that the model in my
photograph<00:04:24.479> or<00:04:24.810> painting<00:04:25.550> was<00:04:26.840> someone

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
photograph or painting was someone

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.620 
photograph or painting was someone
important<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.380> me<00:04:28.820> but<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:29.880> do<00:04:30.000> think<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.419> it

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
important to me but I do think that it

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.839 
important to me but I do think that it
changes<00:04:31.080> my<00:04:31.260> attitude<00:04:31.770> towards<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.370> subject

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
changes my attitude towards the subject

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.870 
changes my attitude towards the subject
and<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.960> think<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.530> ultimately<00:04:35.250> that's<00:04:35.550> what

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
and I think that ultimately that's what

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:50.930 
and I think that ultimately that's what
changes<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.419> picture

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.000
