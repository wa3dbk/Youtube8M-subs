00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
it was way too warm this winter for a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.510 
it was way too warm this winter for a
lot<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.640> things<00:01:26.320> i'm<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.979> little<00:01:28.219> concerned

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
lot of things i'm a little concerned

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.399 
lot of things i'm a little concerned
that<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.240> bug<00:01:29.450> pressure<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:30.020> going<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.289> be

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
that the bug pressure is going to be

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.620 
that the bug pressure is going to be
really<00:01:30.710> high<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:30.979> year<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.329> herbs

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
really high this year and in the herbs

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.870 
really high this year and in the herbs
particularly<00:01:33.439> because<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.009> greenhouses<00:01:34.460> are

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
particularly because the greenhouses are

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.700 
particularly because the greenhouses are
even<00:01:35.299> more<00:01:35.479> protected<00:01:36.109> than<00:01:36.320> the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
even more protected than the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.910 
even more protected than the
out-of-doors<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.810> bugs<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.380> flourish<00:01:39.649> in

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
out-of-doors so the bugs can flourish in

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.560 
out-of-doors so the bugs can flourish in
here<00:01:40.100> even<00:01:40.340> more<00:01:40.369> if<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:40.820> not<00:01:41.000> if<00:01:41.240> it's<00:01:41.359> not

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
here even more if it's not if it's not

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.279 
here even more if it's not if it's not
cold<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:42.469> don't<00:01:42.619> lose<00:01:42.740> any<00:01:43.329> so<00:01:44.329> that<00:01:44.899> I'm<00:01:45.259> a

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
cold and we don't lose any so that I'm a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.469 
cold and we don't lose any so that I'm a
little<00:01:45.680> concerned<00:01:45.829> about<00:01:46.310> other<00:01:47.000> than<00:01:47.329> that

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
little concerned about other than that

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.849 
little concerned about other than that
it's<00:01:47.840> great<00:01:48.079> that<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.320> grass<00:01:48.500> started

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
it's great that the grass started

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.160
