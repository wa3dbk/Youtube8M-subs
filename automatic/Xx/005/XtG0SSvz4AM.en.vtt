simultaneously so I feel you know it's
all<00:04:32.380> about<00:04:32.590> your<00:04:32.710> approach<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:34.210> need<00:04:34.479> to

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
all about your approach and you need to

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.809

be positive every time you are growing

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.550 
be positive every time you are growing
up<00:04:37.060> in<00:04:37.330> an<00:04:37.419> era<00:04:37.599> where<00:04:37.990> there<00:04:38.139> are<00:04:38.289> three

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
up in an era where there are three

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.469 
up in an era where there are three
different<00:04:38.919> formats<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.699> test<00:04:39.940> circuit<00:04:40.330> the

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
different formats the test circuit the

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.379 
different formats the test circuit the
one<00:04:40.660> layers<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.259> T<00:04:41.410> 20s<00:04:41.919> how<00:04:42.639> difficult

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
one layers and the T 20s how difficult

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.140 
one layers and the T 20s how difficult
is<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.810> adjust<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.530> three<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:45.039> think<00:04:45.910> it's

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
is it to adjust to three I think it's

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.120 
is it to adjust to three I think it's
all<00:04:46.300> about<00:04:46.330> adapting<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.199> situations<00:04:47.800> I

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
all about adapting to the situations I

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.159 
all about adapting to the situations I
don't<00:04:48.849> find<00:04:49.060> it<00:04:49.180> difficult<00:04:49.599> yes<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.050> a

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
don't find it difficult yes it's a

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.650 
don't find it difficult yes it's a
challenge<00:04:50.590> but<00:04:50.889> you<00:04:51.280> know<00:04:51.400> that's<00:04:51.520> all<00:04:51.759> t20

at<00:05:11.949> all<00:05:12.009> different<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.580> know<00:05:12.699> it's<00:05:12.849> just

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
at all different you know it's just

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.029 
at all different you know it's just
about<00:05:13.270> being<00:05:13.659> more<00:05:14.229> aggressive<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.979> know

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
about being more aggressive you know

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.370 
about being more aggressive you know
because<00:05:15.520> because<00:05:15.789> you<00:05:15.909> need<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.270> take<00:05:17.139> on

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
because because you need to take on

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.170 
because because you need to take on
bowlers<00:05:17.979> you<00:05:18.220> know<00:05:18.340> need<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:18.699> be<00:05:18.940> really

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
bowlers you know need to be really

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.659 
bowlers you know need to be really
positive<00:05:19.389> every<00:05:20.020> ball<00:05:20.229> and<00:05:20.560> really<00:05:21.280> look<00:05:21.460> for

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
positive every ball and really look for

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.670 
positive every ball and really look for
runs<00:05:21.849> every<00:05:22.180> every<00:05:22.599> ball<00:05:22.810> so<00:05:23.199> it's<00:05:23.319> all<00:05:23.470> about

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
runs every every ball so it's all about

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.879 
runs every every ball so it's all about
changing<00:05:24.669> a<00:05:25.060> bit<00:05:25.389> of<00:05:25.509> approach<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.110> being<00:05:26.770> a

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
changing a bit of approach and being a

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.129 
changing a bit of approach and being a
bit<00:05:27.039> more<00:05:27.400> positive<00:05:27.840> whether<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:29.020> have

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
bit more positive whether you have
