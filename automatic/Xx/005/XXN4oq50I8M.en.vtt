did research and nanoparticles and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
did research and nanoparticles and
explosives<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.070> they're<00:01:17.399> just<00:01:17.550> eager<00:01:17.820> about

Boston is just a really great laboratory
to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.140> exploring<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.399> issues<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.910> cities

today<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.140> think<00:01:37.289> for<00:01:37.619> me<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.430> has

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
today I think for me it really has

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.090 
today I think for me it really has
become<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.300> finding<00:01:40.110> solutions<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
become about finding solutions to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.370 
become about finding solutions to
problems<00:01:41.580> in<00:01:41.850> creative<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:42.750> practical<00:01:43.229> ways

problems in creative and practical ways

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.930

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
and then being able to get those ideas

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.139 
and then being able to get those ideas
across<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.140> only<00:01:46.619> about<00:01:46.920> math<00:01:47.819> and

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
across it's not only about math and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.139 
across it's not only about math and
science<00:01:48.569> skills<00:01:48.860> but<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.009> also<00:01:50.280> about

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
science skills but it's also about
