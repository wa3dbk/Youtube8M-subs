00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 various plants and animal species 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 it needs to be protected and preserved 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.640

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.809
 Uphill has become diverse 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.970
 tasks of a hunter apart 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.100
 set too close to those in contrast 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.110
 not only opinions spread that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 but also succumbed to animals 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.390

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.770
 We have a young professional hunter 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.649
 accompanied and accompanied all year long 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 four stations of his work experienced as 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.460
 our young professional hunter his 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.289
 She has completed her education 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.660
 from steyr mannlicher with his 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:33.740

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:36.750
 working life to his main tasks 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.520
 It was important to wear that one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.530
 natural development and a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.569
 controlled growth of the wild 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.240
 are possible in the Gesäuse he has a lot 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.410
 because this area is teeming 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.259
 of animal species 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.899
 some of them are extremely shy so 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.759
 a lot of time and observation of the animals 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:03.440
 devotion requires one and black grouse 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.440
 begin their palatinate in march 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.380
 These animals are extremely shy and heavy 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.380
 to get to face 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.820
 for the interested nature lover 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.500
 it is therefore recommended to one 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.540
 to contact experienced hunters 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.640

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.520
 Do not have to behave around the animals 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.520
 deter 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.360
 if you're lucky you can do it too 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.110
 on those and black grouses at the courtship 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.110

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.940
 In the summer again are the marmots 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.470
 active due to its sophisticated 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.720
 Efficient rail system is also the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.020
 observation of these animals only possible 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.090
 if you are familiar with nature then 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.980
 but you can have fun doing it 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.350
 have the cute little animals 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.640
 vary game and in the foraging 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.640
 to observe 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.860
 another show etihad located in the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.670
 colorful fauna of the housing finds is the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.680
 goose here it is recommended 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.350
 to find so-called forced change 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.850
 So a place the animals on their 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.370
 then we have to witness the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.230
 Foraging for dealing with the young 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.480
 as well as her ranking an older spirit 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.110
 leads the pack and the other animals 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.630
 he will jump over obstacles 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.630
 only when the headmaster has proceeded 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.620
 magnificent elegant animals with big ones 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.560
 noble and branched are the consecrated 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.050
 Rothirsche also in the Gesäuse too 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.239
 Find 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.239
 his rutting season is the late autumn 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.689
 It can be too intense here 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.430
 battles between the deer 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:13.340
 come up to a place deer 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.340
 interspersed the girls fogged 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.590
 So there is enough to do for ours 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.750
 career hunter but even if someone only 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.500
 the nature wants to take effect on itself 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.330
 is it worth the housing to visit 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.770
 the landscape invites everyone 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.770
 stay and enjoy 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.380
 and who knows, maybe you get that 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.610
 but a red deer or a whole 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.610
 goat to face
