00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello here in front of you in the picture 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.670
 two patrons and one and the other patron 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.170
 called so here 762 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.240
 54 762 is the caliber of the trunk for which 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 we have to move a bullet three tenths 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.570
 inches or as in the old Rus said 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.480
 three lines 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 and 54 is the length of the sleeve in which the bullets 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.740
 inserted so here it is two bullets for 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.029
 the same rifle for rifle 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.820
 Mosina ask for two bullets but right 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.010
 cartridge old cartridge that was here 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.370
 in the era of the first world war and revolution 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 and civil war in the twenties a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.469
 on the left is a cartridge that appeared in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.070
 thirties what's the matter the thing is that 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.399
 bullet 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.879
 this rifle fly with speed 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.410
 superior sound speed 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.969
 supersonic motion is not at all 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.070
 that the motion is up to sound and that's it in time 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.230
 which has passed since the time of appearance 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.190
 Mosin rifles and respectively two 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.600
 patron and this 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.260
 The 90s of the 19th century were very deep. 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 performance aerodynamics in about 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.939
 supersonic and supersonic movement 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.820
 body and here is such a rounded shape 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.950
 so slightly teardrop was 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.350
 not the most optimal thing 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.979
 that when you move your body with a big 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.439
 by speed 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.330
 sits on its tip as they say 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.119
 aerodynamics shock pack 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 there is a shock wave here when 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.860
 bullets are so round little shock do not understand 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.200
 how where do i sit down and so here's the movement 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 the field becomes much less stable 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 what is supposed to be this here and invented 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.610
 such a surface surface for 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.590
 bullet fairings which is called 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.390
 reviving the surface is very simple on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.920
 picture on him look how would 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 in two 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.880
 the arrow 2 is the final marked diameter 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.320
 bullets yes and look 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.630
 held two and two arcs they like this when 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 currently this is now, and there 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.320
 surface of a bullet 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 rotate it will turn out chewing 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.670
 chuck surface that's how it is under 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.229
 what cartridge is such 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.390
 chewing surface i'm perfect 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.260
 common place that's what I thought of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.290
 recite 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:22.890
 namiko all shells are made like this 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.200
 surface bullet for those gunshot 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.060
 weapons whose movement exceeds 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.269
 sound speed and rome gun on 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.579
 revolver on in them up sonic bullets yes 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.709
 matter so here's the form and they can be 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.930
 such naughty is not necessarily 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.989
 chewing surface of this is now 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.370
 very so popular in the world of cartridge 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.530
 called 762 for 39 cartridge for automatic 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.780
 Kalashnikov here rejoices huge 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.730
 quantity drops in store for 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.519
 hunters it is sold for 10 rubles 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.359
 a thing before nature what a cheap massive 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.519
 patron so here is the fiftieth year 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:02.220
 happened very interesting for the first time in 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.129
 our Russian history let's say 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.840
 so military industrial complex 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:10.049
 decided to develop a cartridge specifically for 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.780
 civilian application based cartridges 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.359
 from this for a Kalashnikov assault rifle 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.180
 which already existed at that time 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:20.669
 decided to make a cartridge for hunters 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.340
 caliber 5,6 millimeter that is compress 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.079
 Dulce stronger and insert such here 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.900
 small bullet pay attention to 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.639
 this bullet set what she 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.489
 tidy truth tidy bullet then 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:36.959
 yes she has a round tip she is completely 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.849
 not like that's supposed to be not 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.699
 chewing surface need to say 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.040
 what is the speed of flight of this bullet 1200 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.260
 meters per second shoot like that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.169
 cartridges are a pleasure to shuffle 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.629
 targets because very very few 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.699
 fails bullets while flying to the target 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:57.239
 fifty second year at the Olympiad 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.549
 our shooters who did the shooter 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.639
 ask for such bullets took gold 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.989
 medals yes it was a success furore this patron 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.209
 became very popular in the world 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.310
 on the hunter's fishermen have not 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.190
 the very thing is that this field 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.760
 turns out to be very damaging game 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.039
 rips off the skin they told me under 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.620
 big secret the 70s is that 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.049
 berlin arsenal this in the usa conducted 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.900
 studies of various bullets yes which one 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.850
 They have a great effect slaughter 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.919
 allen soap block and shot bullets 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.759
 compared the inlet and outlet 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.979
 and like 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.650
 and a cavity cavity that bullets knocked out of 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.070
 soap block had the most slaughter bullets 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.580
 in the world this is now here and so wish you 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.840
 good luck
