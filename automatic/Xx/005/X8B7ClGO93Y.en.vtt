00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
there will be the regular win stuff

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.340 
there will be the regular win stuff
which<00:00:15.089> there<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.509> link<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> description

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
of how to get a regular wind staff once

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.460 
of how to get a regular wind staff once
you've<00:00:18.600> got<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> wind<00:00:18.930> stuff<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> want<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
you've got the wind stuff you want to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.410 
you've got the wind stuff you want to
change<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> symbols<00:00:20.369> by<00:00:20.490> shooting<00:00:21.060> them<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
change the symbols by shooting them to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
change the symbols by shooting them to
these<00:00:21.779> exact<00:00:22.470> symbols<00:00:22.890> guys<00:00:23.600> and<00:00:24.980> once<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.130> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
these exact symbols guys and once it is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310 
these exact symbols guys and once it is
these<00:00:26.430> exact<00:00:26.820> symbols<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.109> if

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
these exact symbols and if you know if

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.509 
these exact symbols and if you know if
it<00:00:28.470> changes<00:00:28.500> because<00:00:29.070> I'm<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.310> sure<00:00:29.429> for

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it changes because I'm not sure for

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
it changes because I'm not sure for
change<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> doesn't<00:00:30.619> right

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
change but I think it doesn't right

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.260 
change but I think it doesn't right
below<00:00:31.890> where<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.369> symbol<00:00:32.730> should<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:33.059> there

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
below where the symbol should be there

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.459 
below where the symbol should be there
should<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> stone<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.020> symbol<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.440> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
should be a stone with the symbol on it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.810 
should be a stone with the symbol on it
users<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.980> match<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> symbols<00:00:35.640> it's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
users have to match the symbols it's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.190 
users have to match the symbols it's
really<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.329> easy<00:00:36.390> but<00:00:36.660> basically<00:00:36.960> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
really really easy but basically that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280 
really really easy but basically that
should<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.920> guys<00:00:38.700> once<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.870> done

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
should be it guys once you have done

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.530 
should be it guys once you have done
that<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.770> will<00:00:40.920> need<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.280> topside<00:00:42.059> into

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that you will need to go topside into

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540 
that you will need to go topside into
normal<00:00:42.930> area<00:00:43.200> you'll<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.010> need<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> shoot

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
normal area you'll then need to shoot

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
normal area you'll then need to shoot
each<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.030> these<00:00:45.149> three<00:00:45.210> stones<00:00:46.050> probably

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
each of these three stones probably

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500 
each of these three stones probably
about<00:00:46.980> three<00:00:47.280> times<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.820> had<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.090> problems
