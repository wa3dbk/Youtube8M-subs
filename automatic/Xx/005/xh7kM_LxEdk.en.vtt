yeah<00:00:44.479> now<00:00:45.019> I<00:00:45.050> had<00:00:45.350> only<00:00:45.499> played<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:46.039> game<00:00:46.219> a

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
yeah now I had only played the game a

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.279 
yeah now I had only played the game a
couple<00:00:46.729> of<00:00:46.819> times<00:00:47.030> when<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.659> was<00:00:47.690> Holmes<00:00:48.050> man

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
couple of times when I was Holmes man

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.069 
couple of times when I was Holmes man
and<00:00:48.710> when<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:48.949> first<00:00:49.309> got<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.550> copy<00:00:49.819> on<00:00:49.999> SNES<00:00:50.510> I

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
and when I first got a copy on SNES I

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.039 
and when I first got a copy on SNES I
played<00:00:51.589> it<00:00:51.739> for<00:00:51.769> days<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.059> think<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:53.780> mass

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
played it for days I think the mass

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:55.869 
played it for days I think the mass
appeal<00:00:54.530> was<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.769> action<00:00:55.309> blood<00:00:55.639> and

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
appeal was the action blood and

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.309 
appeal was the action blood and
fatalities<00:00:56.479> all<00:00:56.659> right<00:00:56.809> let's<00:00:56.989> not<00:00:57.049> beat
