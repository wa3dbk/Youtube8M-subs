00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.730
 to cut back on poor food 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.490
 Do not have time to eat healthily. 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.519
 People wake up early to fans arriving from 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.549
 suppliers are washed and chopped 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.199
 then everything goes to pack a 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.289
 lot of work and so much so we prefer 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.060
 start at the moment but four in the morning 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.510
 We follow until about a few 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.359
 eight hours of preparation 8 to 11 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.099
 We already make deliveries and one 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.170
 so much so that we already do the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.239
 afternoon deliveries the idea came from the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.700
 gustavo he realized through research 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.210
 market that many people needed and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.690
 wanted to eat fruit but the time to time 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.870
 did not let him decide to sell 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.520
 facility 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.989
 the staff has no more time to do 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.480
 with no more time to mess with 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.940
 fruit does not have time but is for the market 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.160
 buy it so we take it straight 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.140
 in service as with all 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.170
 practicality and it's ready for you to eat 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.760
 there are no need you peeled and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.070
 do anything already sees all ready , and is 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.559
 balanced with our nutritionist 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.760
 very menu in the fruit already goes 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.710
 a combination that has nutrients 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.869
 different for you to enjoy all the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.119
 days in the oven better make sun or make 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.909
 rain from Monday to Friday the businessman 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.009
 delivery two types of fruit per customer 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.689
 here the first one received his lauro 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.759
 works in two jobs, right? 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.470
 and then I 'm finally going home 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.030
 early morning and he brings me everything 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.400
 prepared for me here 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.920
 so between the love of God rather than 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.110
 follow the sun, and then there's the sun. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.560
 gustavo sector by sector leaving health 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.060
 by the way 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.150
 only this company are serviced on average 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 40 customers every day were not to 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.009
 practicality of receiving food 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.990
 so the fruits would certainly not be 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.869
 included in the menu and eat some 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.840
 thing - longing for a loaf here 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.880
 I just gotta get caught just not only 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 help in food as well as in the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.409
 production is because you will not get in the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180
 lunchtime extremely full of 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.880
 hungry because you've been trying to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.189
 take until you get there and then the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.990
 afternoon also better include 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.959
 fruit on the menu is not good only the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.590
 income but mainly for the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.690
 Cheers 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.440
 The fruit is rich in carbohydrates and rich in 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.900
 fibers 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.510
 minerals are in the middle of the morning as a 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.760
 in the middle of the afternoon. 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.760
 needs the energy, right?
