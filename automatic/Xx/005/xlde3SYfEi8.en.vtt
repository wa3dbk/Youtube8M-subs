00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.910 
quality multi-touch display with a 294
PPI<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.480> definitely<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:58.199> close<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> retina

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
PPI so definitely very close to retina

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.490 
PPI so definitely very close to retina
quality<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.760> has<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> micro<00:01:00.449> SD<00:01:00.480> card<00:01:01.079> expansion
