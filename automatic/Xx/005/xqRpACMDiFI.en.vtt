00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.610 
just one note or just two notes but you
really<00:02:52.250> can<00:02:52.630> increase<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.990> number<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.320> notes

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
really can increase the number of notes

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.980 
really can increase the number of notes
you<00:02:54.800> use<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.370> your<00:02:55.400> improvisation

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.440 
right-hand fingers but I continue to use
just<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.959> basic<00:03:20.439> steady<00:03:21.189> pulse<00:03:21.489> using<00:03:22.090> my<00:03:22.239> left

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
pulse using Fingers 1 and 5 and in this

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.899 
pulse using Fingers 1 and 5 and in this
case<00:03:33.819> I'm<00:03:34.180> playing<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.139> key<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.409> C<00:03:35.620> major

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
case I'm playing in the key of C major

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.949 
case I'm playing in the key of C major
so<00:03:36.909> I'm<00:03:37.060> using<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.480> c<00:03:37.659> major<00:03:37.810> pentascale

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959

so I'm using the c major pentascale
notes<00:03:38.739> now<00:03:39.400> my<00:03:39.579> right<00:03:39.790> hand<00:03:39.849> is<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:41.859> playing

it's it's having some fun and if you
don't<00:03:45.849> know<00:03:45.969> what<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.420> want<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.720> play<00:03:46.930> here

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
don't know what you want to play here

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.830 
don't know what you want to play here
just<00:03:48.069> let<00:03:48.250> your<00:03:48.370> fingers<00:03:48.730> decide<00:03:49.090> let<00:03:49.659> them

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
just let your fingers decide let them

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.110 
just let your fingers decide let them
dance<00:03:50.079> but<00:03:50.739> one<00:03:50.889> of<00:03:50.919> the<00:03:51.099> secrets<00:03:51.549> with<00:03:51.760> rhythm

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
dance but one of the secrets with rhythm

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.750 
dance but one of the secrets with rhythm
with<00:03:52.540> with<00:03:52.810> music<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.349> guess<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.859> that<00:03:54.519> it

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
with with music I guess is that it

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.170 
with with music I guess is that it
people's<00:03:55.720> ears<00:03:56.109> enjoy<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:57.189> hear<00:03:57.549> something

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
people's ears enjoy to hear something

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.259 
people's ears enjoy to hear something
that<00:03:58.510> resembles<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.200> pattern<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.639> it's<00:04:00.969> nice<00:04:01.239> to

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
that resembles a pattern so it's nice to

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.240 
that resembles a pattern so it's nice to
have<00:04:01.510> something<00:04:01.930> that<00:04:02.109> joins<00:04:02.590> all<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.129> your

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
have something that joins all of your

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.550 
have something that joins all of your
improvisation<00:04:03.669> together<00:04:04.389> your<00:04:04.930> pattern<00:04:05.349> can

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
improvisation together your pattern can

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.420 
improvisation together your pattern can
be<00:04:05.590> made<00:04:05.889> up<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.189> repeating<00:04:06.700> notes<00:04:07.120> or<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> note

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
be made up of repeating notes or a note

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.580 
be made up of repeating notes or a note
that<00:04:09.430> is<00:04:09.549> featured<00:04:10.349> frequently<00:04:11.349> in<00:04:11.560> your

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
that is featured frequently in your

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.190 
that is featured frequently in your
improvisation<00:04:12.489> or<00:04:12.669> your<00:04:13.419> pattern<00:04:13.780> could<00:04:14.049> be

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
improvisation or your pattern could be

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.099 
improvisation or your pattern could be
made<00:04:14.439> up<00:04:14.590> more<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.250> rhythm<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.449> I'm<00:04:16.810> going<00:04:17.019> to

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
made up more of rhythm so I'm going to

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.629 
made up more of rhythm so I'm going to
give<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.320> an<00:04:17.410> example<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:18.009> a<00:04:18.070> pattern<00:04:18.459> now

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
give you an example of a pattern now

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.550 
give you an example of a pattern now
that's<00:04:18.849> made<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.269> rhythm<00:04:19.659> and<00:04:19.900> what<00:04:20.440> I'm

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
that's made up of rhythm and what I'm

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.110 
that's made up of rhythm and what I'm
going<00:04:20.829> to<00:04:20.859> do<00:04:21.099> is<00:04:21.250> I'm<00:04:21.370> going<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.549> use<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.880> same

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
going to do is I'm going to use the same

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.140 
going to do is I'm going to use the same
note<00:04:22.710> for<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.830> rhythm<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.280> then<00:04:24.610> I'm<00:04:24.880> going

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
note for the rhythm and then I'm going

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.460 
note for the rhythm and then I'm going
to<00:04:25.240> repeat<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.570> rhythm<00:04:25.900> with<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.080> different

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
to repeat the rhythm with a different

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.570 
to repeat the rhythm with a different
note<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.159> here's<00:04:27.610> my<00:04:27.820> basic<00:04:28.169> left-hand<00:04:29.169> pulse

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
note so here's my basic left-hand pulse

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.510 
note so here's my basic left-hand pulse
and<00:04:30.580> I'm<00:04:31.360> going<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.630> play<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:32.050> simple<00:04:32.409> rhythm

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
and I'm going to play this simple rhythm

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.230 
and I'm going to play this simple rhythm
goes<00:04:34.479> like<00:04:34.720> this

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.050 

there<00:04:41.199> it<00:04:41.289> was<00:04:41.470> I'm<00:04:41.740> going<00:04:41.919> to<00:04:42.009> do<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.280> again

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.580 

I'm<00:04:46.300> on<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.600> new<00:04:46.840> note

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.529 

so<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.620> started<00:04:52.250> off<00:04:52.400> on<00:04:52.430> D<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.240> then<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.419> went

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
so I started off on D and then I went

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.330 
so I started off on D and then I went
back<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.930> see<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.410> can<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.830> same<00:04:55.009> rhythm

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
back to see I can do the same rhythm

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.700 
back to see I can do the same rhythm
again

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.280 

that<00:05:00.250> time<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.490> started<00:05:00.910> on<00:05:01.000> D<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.540> went<00:05:01.750> over

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
that time I started on D and I went over

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.040 
that time I started on D and I went over
to<00:05:02.320> e<00:05:02.440> for<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.830> second<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:06.520> then<00:05:07.390> I<00:05:07.420> repeated<00:05:07.930> my

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
to e for a second and then I repeated my

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.890 
to e for a second and then I repeated my
basic<00:05:08.440> rhythm<00:05:08.710> back<00:05:08.980> on<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.400> note<00:05:09.580> C<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.840> to

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
basic rhythm back on the note C so to

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.320 
basic rhythm back on the note C so to
