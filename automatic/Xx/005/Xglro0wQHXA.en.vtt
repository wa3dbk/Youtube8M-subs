00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.530
 or the acquired people friends subscribers 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.250
 of youtube on how well I am and good 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.279
 this other new boom video tutorial 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.260
 minecraft and good in this tutorial les them 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.510
 I will teach how to minecraft crystals 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.820
 It was very simple and short I'm going to do 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.580
 because they are going to upload a video and that the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.500
 people see it well, the first thing that 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.820
 we will need to make the crystals 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.390
 would be 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.220
 a furnace that I have already taught in tutor 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:43.660
 as 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:46.660
 how to create it we are going to put it well 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.150
 the next element would be the one 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.770
 you have is a shovel or they followed 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.809
 good hand action directly with a 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.809
 shovel to show them and 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.440
 let's change the game 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:10.630
 to god to pick up some sand 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.630
 to make the crystals 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280
 all right 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.310
 we pick it up a bit of sand what 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.570
 enough to stop him for 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.080
 be a good house home so that they are going 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 to use 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.780
 all right 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.760
 he does not feel that we are going to do is 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.130
 we need a source of energy to 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.870
 the furnace if you want wood what 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.850
 they want but I 'm going to use 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.850
 this is this material as you see 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.360
 to see criminal 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.880
 a bucket of lava the buckets 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.850
 they are the best source of energy for a 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.620
 oven since they last much longer than 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.700
 any other material like coal 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.780
 we achieve much more 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.800
 what is good we wait for it to warm up 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.800
 in the sand 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.700
 and how they see crystal glass like you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.700
 want to tell you to decorate their houses 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.990
 and everything you need to 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.410
 so it's good that we 're going to try 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.410
 glass 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.560
 as you will see I am in version 1.3 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.850
 minecraft points the last here came out 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 so far not good 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.260
 every time we pick up 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.170
 something that we heat from the oven like that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.460
 the experience a little bit on a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.210
 little but 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.770
