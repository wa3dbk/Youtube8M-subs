00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
all because I think that would just be

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.390 
all because I think that would just be
super<00:03:22.440> super<00:03:22.709> boring

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
super super boring

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.100 
super super boring
but<00:03:23.790> this<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.209> one<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> decks<00:03:24.750> he<00:03:24.900> gets

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
but this is one of the decks he gets

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.610 
but this is one of the decks he gets
that's<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.220> lot<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.400> cards<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.150> then<00:03:30.620> this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
that's a lot of cards and then this

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830 
that's a lot of cards and then this
would<00:03:31.860> be<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.250> other<00:03:33.030> deck<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.660> get

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
would be the other deck that you get

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.430 
would be the other deck that you get
also<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> lot<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.280> cards<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> hell<00:03:37.410> of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
also a lot of cards so you get a hell of

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.500 
also a lot of cards so you get a hell of
a<00:03:37.530> lot<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.860> box<00:03:38.070> as<00:03:38.850> far<00:03:39.060> as<00:03:39.150> cards
