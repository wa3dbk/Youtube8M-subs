00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.659
 but 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.460
 so welcome to our with you 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.800
 first lecture if you read and watched 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.970
 the description for the first week you already know 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 that in the first week we are not at all 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.289
 touch no three-dimensional package 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.800
 because in the first week it matters to us 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:40.359
 analyze the character but because 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:44.579
 when we come across 3d 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:47.409
 abandoned with 3ds max and we with others 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.069
 raster editors in front of us 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.409
 will face many technical problems and 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:57.879
 despite the fact that I assume that you 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:00.100
 still familiar with the basics of the interface 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.339
 these packages are still defined 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.000
 technical things I will have for you 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 explain here we will try to understand 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.150
 our hero try to anticipate 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.580
 technological complexity times 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.120
 which we will face when we go to 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.910
 modeling and animation and we will 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.670
 learn to work and collect references we 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.980
 talk about anatomical reference ah 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.680
 and about other important things that 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.650
 immediately preceded by production 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.830
 well, that is, we are now so small 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.070
 study period small period 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.080
 pre-production 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.860
 here on my monitor 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.710
 directly depicts the character and me 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.710
 I suggest to start studying it 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.350
 what we see we see the character who 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.140
 looks like a typical role-playing character 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.289
 Game of the characters is a description I am now 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.619
 I look at him another monitor character 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.200
 called master of the blade and he has 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.230
 a small short description which 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 guys I wrote here now read out 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.760
 two-sword fight pro one sword 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.489
 red second sword blue 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.709
 magic glow clothes a little 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.220
 leather bandages and straps 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.030
 in pants under a belt with a sash hair 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.879
 long sets of little braids 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.459
 light-skinned dark hair 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.260
 physique physique athletic 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.459
 slim decoration piercing tattoos 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 some bone and teeth 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.910
 animals so here now i will show you 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.269
 this file here it is this description 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.790
 Here are some reference pictures which 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.739
 here the guys offered us prince of persia 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.730
 which basically served as the main 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.970
 guide for this character 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.519
 always usually when made 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:10.750
 character or is there any other piece of art 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.870
 always used some landmarks 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.340
 something that already exists reason for 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.230
 which I decided to choose this 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.910
 character I could choose different 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.190
 characters is precisely that 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.819
 we have a lot of different elements here 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.069
 we can say 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.410
 anatomy we can hair separately 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.810
 complex topic that I now 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.000
 writing this lecture I don't even know until 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.730
 of the end, how will I solve it ? 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.370
 interesting for me is not interesting either 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.410
 solving problems is one of the most 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.660
 interesting things in general in our business 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.919
 we have complex elements like 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.790
 mittens I don't even know what to call it 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:50.530
 the belt is a lot of complicated elements west 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.640
 interesting 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.120
 and various piercing gadgets are wrong 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.940
 further description that I read it to you 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.940
 the description that the artist received 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.130
 if we talk about absolutely perfect 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.230
 situations and the perfect concept for 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.770
 modeling we would have a character so 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.440
 called t-pose ie it would be 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.709
 forehead forehead with straightened arms 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.480
 that would be a side view from the back plus 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.280
 separate some elements which 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.640
 require special attention they would 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.380
 approximated and drawn in more detail in 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.290
 in this case as you can see with us 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.510
 the character is in a dynamic pose they 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.350
 in t-pose plus we have a small 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.280
 additional 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.450
 illustration this is a back view she is not 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.250
 traced it serves exclusively for 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.770
 so that I understand what is behind u 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.000
 character happens according to plan 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.940
 artist so me in principle this 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.350
 enough information to 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.620
 start modeling it depends on 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.910
 project some projects allow 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.610
 artist models ru think out something 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.680
 the work process is just one of them 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.680
 plus 10
