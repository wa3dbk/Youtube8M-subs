00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.590
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.000
 I will explain how to adjust 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:11.780
 your watch there are two methods 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.240
 according to your watch strap 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 to the functions if it is metal oscillate 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.230
 plastic rubber to the leather i'm going 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.720
 explain to you the first method with 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.919
 the metal bracelet 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.649
 so I ask if you'll see 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:36.600
 you see four small wheels 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:37.980
 here are four small wheels so my 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.260
 watch is set on this one 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.879
 so to enlarge you rule and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.649
 outward and to tighten towards 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.570
 inside so was your wrist 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.260
 tends to swell so you have to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.170
 spread it outward then you 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.949
 go with a pen with a fine tip 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.640
 you're not going to push him into the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.750
 little hole and your ride 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:16.050
 this is going to dislocate so for the euro m 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:19.310
 you put it down so the flat bottom 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.930
 in the desired hole and for the top 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.580
 put in front of the hole you so I use 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.710
 a cutter because the blade is over 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.070
 fine and it's very advantageous 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.580
 you will come to push on the small by 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:37.260
 tonio and come slap the management so 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.810
 you force it well it goes as soon as your 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.790
 world is very serious so as you 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 can see it I 'm going to place on the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.710
 the right thing so there will be too large 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.770
 for me and I do not really like the world 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.310
 So that flageolent Nocolas that was 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.010
 the first step for bracelets in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 plastic material or leather there you 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.320
 you will need an object like this 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.600
 so this is the same as to do the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.780
 holes in the belt 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.070
 it also exists at hand with a small 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.060
 wheel that change according to the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.010
 size that you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.739
 also exists by hand so I did not 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.400
 a hammer so you put in 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.500
 alignment 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.680
 so if you want tightened by 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.690
 example to was a little bit a little too much 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.860
 great for me so I had to make a 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.110
 hole a little bit higher when 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.069
 you have seen here so you put your 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.950
 object like these in the hole and the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.239
 hammer you will type with plenty of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.739
 good shots I do not do it because that 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.069
 will my grow my hole it's not the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.170
 goal 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.810
 so you type and you will do a 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.989
 hole vote at the end of plastic or 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.989
 leather there rest inside and your 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.500
 world will be adjusted to your basket 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.870
 so I hope this explanatory video 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.670
 how to adjust your watch will have pleased you 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.180
