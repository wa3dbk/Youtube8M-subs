00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello hi guys girls all I am 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.639
 faithful to 22 welcome to a new video 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.920
 of the channel we are with the challenge when 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.959
 they played from my team and I'm going to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.510
 try to explain a little and give some 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.460
 useful tips to raise this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
 good challenge well as you see them 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 they have silvers and bronzes and a partner and a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.539
 ruby that are more powerful than karima 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.449
 hayley and for you win we have 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.550
 five silver holders as much and the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 bronze rest is worth so let's go 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.610
 put the silver to which we have 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.700
 and in my case goran dragic klay thompson 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.520
 reaches the green for water sun and power 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.830
 high voucher with high arms here you have 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.360
 the one to one tips defend the area 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.340
 to the cpu to post most of the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 twice two times given a fruity a bit to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.570
 doc rivers not only throw many details 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.950
 and if it comes in you can make a broken 3 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 take advantage of the released shots already 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.600
 your cyclists very important 4 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.970
 counterattack and 5 sep in taiz do it with 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.230
 someone who knows not with anyone here 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.600
 let's see some examples of people from the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.159
 area you see as holding the jump up 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 the last moment we will be able to defend 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.650
 successfully attempts the cpu 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 you see 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.870
 and jumping there are times that the basket goes to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 enter because they are blond and sapphires and they 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.920
 note the quality and will end up entering 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.330
 like here from mccain but good if 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.650
 we hold until the beige end with the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.480
 tall men like cover by roy hibbert 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.130
 it is preferable in this challenge to put 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.740
 people with long arms that before 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.430
 pivot corpulent and short that is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.260
 better to have people who are bronze to 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.350
 jeans to run 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.550
 receive will accept as said andrÃ© here 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.730
 see here we have a disadvantage 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.930
 we try to go with ping to help with 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.810
 other players but it is not possible 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.790
 stop it here painted with with kevin 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.490
 here also defends him and good very 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.020
 important is not to jump to the first of 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.310
 changes but to endure until 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.060
 let's see what the last one does 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.190
 jump movement and annoy him 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.040
 quite this we go to point 2 rubbing 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.170
 a little I love doc rivers is a player 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.580
 you can not throw much away but 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.890
 that if we leave a little space for 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.550
 inside as you can see we can get the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.230
 easily missing or you can put a 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.880
 tray or you can bend the ball towards 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.940
 outside and cause a triple a basket 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.880
 easy to oil important rub a 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.400
 little to see what he's going to do and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.920
 have the virgin watched from afar like that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.800
 As you can see, you set a script piece of pass 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.540
 and triple the machine so a lot 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120
 beware of two rivers 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.549
 what to set ad limina web painted form 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.829
 inside and very carefully with the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.900
 benefits of rivers number 3 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.819
 take advantage of the released shots already 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.439
 your cyclists very clearly 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.239
 uncheck handles from the point of a 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.680
 transistor and as you see when 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.810
 let's have a little space that we 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.310
 leave a little touch also strips 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.560
 over with the patch is easier to do 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.670
 green and the turn is pretty much improved 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.379
 is 3 and we can give many baskets 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.540
 easy and many quick points to fix 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.950
 here they should leave a little bit of space 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.989
 the machine go too fort 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.970
 because I think I'm going to penetrate and I 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.250
 he took advantage of it and shot from afar with 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.750
 shooters like clayton are one drug it 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.549
 that is not a shooter but has 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.019
 always something of triples those fixes 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.909
 here is that although they are not possessions of 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.329
 five seconds but you have to throw 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.389
 because you are only here to set the triple 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.609
 over the corner of clayton just does not know 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.930
 very important to take advantage of the shooters 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.459
 that we have on the team either those of 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.660
 silver the bronze ones I also have in the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.150
 dock 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.770
 the bench as people like fine mor 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.900
 bronze roig also as has the 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.990
 in front of you that has 90 and some triple 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.700
 and it is highly recommended to use cyclists 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.319
 and good average shooters 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.349
 distance 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.219
 let's go with the four countercoup point 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.739
 take advantage of the rebounds in defense and 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:55.900
 run out to leave thinking so much 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.340
 if we take a bounce in defense of a shot 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.280
 in suspension capable of the machine or 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.219
 like and two free that the machine fails and 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.859
 let's go running here rogues go 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.719
 Border plug patrick and wing and ready 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.719
 to the front without thinking it came out and for 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:13.540
 then they go down very slowly, 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:15.400
 pivots weigh them a lot ass at the time of 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.829
 download you will see if the players 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.320
 what's in the rest are not very high and 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.600
 it's pretty weird that I plugged you in 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.330
 halibut 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.240
 notice here that the rebounding demolitions 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.220
 and triples in less than five seconds not 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.960
 important to the failures of winne felt 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.730
 free because he is not a good shooter and 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.330
 we can take advantage of the rebounds for 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.830
 do this 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.000
 kickback and two very fast points 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.610
 here another example another free throw 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.460
 roy hibbert for morro anthony morro 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.220
 to get there without two fast baskets 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.350
 little dots, so little by little we're going 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.930
 dominating 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.840
 to the rival team another rebound pau for 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.180
 Morro a dio for green almost the same 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.250
 play that before number 5 if you allow to 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.700
 basket do it with a matador do not enter 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.960
 with bases because you can give 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.550
 of hills here set an easy basket 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.080
 and here it ends up split but with land 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.290
 the gringo to play the central basket 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.990
 because you can do very well objects 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.640
 that you will get most of the 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.320
 times so guys these are the 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.730
 tips here you have the challenge won 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.330
 quite easy does not have much 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.670
 complication challenge when they 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.740
 wendy played plate so no one will 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.660
 have liked guys there are favorites and we 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.660
 we see in future videos of the channel chao
