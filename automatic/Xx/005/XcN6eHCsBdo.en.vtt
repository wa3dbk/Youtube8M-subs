00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
of Bissell pompous helix it does not I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.490 
of Bissell pompous helix it does not I
am<00:02:28.120> Not<00:02:28.300> sure<00:02:28.330> me<00:02:28.750> me<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.959> Bissell<00:02:29.260> Powerforce

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
am Not sure me me the Bissell Powerforce

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.580 
am Not sure me me the Bissell Powerforce
helix<00:02:30.069> turbo<00:02:30.520> version<00:02:30.670> does<00:02:31.060> also<00:02:31.930> at<00:02:32.440> one

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
helix turbo version does also at one

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.960 
helix turbo version does also at one
difference<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.340> does<00:02:33.520> not<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:33.819> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
difference is this does not have the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.809 
difference is this does not have the
turbo<00:02:34.150> brush<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:35.530> power<00:02:35.800> force<00:02:36.069> helix<00:02:36.400> turbo

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
turbo brush the power force helix turbo

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.170 
turbo brush the power force helix turbo
would<00:02:36.970> obviously<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:38.940> comes<00:02:39.940> up<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
would obviously have that comes up the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.490 
would obviously have that comes up the
same<00:02:40.530> extension<00:02:41.530> tubes<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.040> crevice<00:02:42.700> tool<00:02:42.910> as
