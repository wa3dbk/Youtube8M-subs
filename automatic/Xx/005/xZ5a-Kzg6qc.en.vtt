00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.240
 pricing is a way to see the true nature 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.120
 and the meaning of everything around 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.780
 even the laptop and asus knowingly called their 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.210
 best zenbook ultrabooks 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.030
 After all, the usual ultrabook is just thin and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.300
 lungs 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.550
 this is completely wrong oh no scratching it 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.120
 protects the gorilla voice the body is made of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.830
 aluminum sound from the bank it should 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.310
 zenbook clearly created without looking at 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.320
 other 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.320
 these ultrabooks went their way 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.320
 laptop looks just great he 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.050
 all aluminum on materials 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.820
 in general here did not save the cap is covered 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.980
 branded circular grinding 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.350
 and that all this beauty in a month is not 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.730
 wiped you a mustache decided to close the pattern 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.940
 glass gorilla glass 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.350
 Well, at the same time they also protected the screen 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.810
 the surface around the keyboard is made 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.910
 brushed aluminum and that's cool 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.820
 fingerprints on her are just not 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.740
 remain sorry this is not true as glass 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.170
 in here of course it is necessary or microfiber 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.070
 a bearers remember zen practice and 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.990
 come to terms with and totally the family of the world 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.240
 assembled ultrabook for four plus is 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.369
 just not a big claim to the small 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.740
 sagging the back cover in the center and 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.810
 quite minimal on the touchpad but this 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.260
 can be attributed to a test pre-sale 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.720
 sample 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.759
 another ultrabook u attached cool 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.590
 magnetic buckle case is a pity 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.270
 charging space not available 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.280
 self-loading too with her chip she 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.920
 very small and light especially 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.429
 compared to ordinary dinosaurs like 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.560
 this here charge indicator now 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.630
 it is orange means zenbook is charging 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.300
 as soon as the battery is full he 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.830
 change color to green 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.550
 connectors and ports are traditionally a bit 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.090
 on the left two usb and card reader on the right port 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.700
 headphone hdmi and usb mini 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.710
 displayport and food 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.450
 if you need a normal lan port or VJ 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.940
 you can use these 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 the adapters they come with 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.920
 really have to sacrifice yusbi 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.040
 connector in general with zenbook design 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.600
 complete harmony and order run 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.280
 motor 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.590
 Immediately like the keyboard like 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.710
 It is supposed to be an island type key travel 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.020
 very soft touchpad big supports 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.790
 multitouch sensitivity on decent 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.690
 level is better than most 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.300
 laptops 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.150
 what is special about it 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.950
 keyboard backlight when not very comfortable 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.020
 that even with the backlight turned off and 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.280
 the power button continues to glow and 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.410
 for some reason wi-fi 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.840
 in addition to manual adjustment of the screen brightness 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.190
 have auto mode activated 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.350
 this button 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.480
 by simultaneously pressing the fn button and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.260
 spaces on the screen displays the application 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.050
 performance management is now about 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.209
 The screen here is installed ips-matrix with 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.120
 full hd resolution to her questions 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.780
 just no great color rendering and 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.540
 contrast 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.910
 the image on the 13 inch display is not 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.890
 It seems small site and easy to read when 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.990
 necessary interface elements and 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.170
 windows fonts can always be enlarged 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.810
 multi touch works very well screen 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.000
 adequately responds to each click in 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.120
 As a result, we have a good multitouch and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 touchpad and on screen such happiness 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.550
 far from every day 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.400
 go to the main gland brain you x 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.510
 302 is a dual core i5 or i7 core 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.300
 depending on the model 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.690
 options for video cards 2 or built 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.540
 intel hd 4000 400 or in the appendage to it 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.910
 ji x 730 with two gigabytes of memory 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.709
 This option should be considered by those who 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.430
 going to play from time to time 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.590
 ultrabooks 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.019
 true battery for that thank you not 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.120
 will say the amount of RAM too 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.959
 can choose either four or eight 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.330
 gigabyte 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.310
 with Lanka 2 or 4 gigabytes 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.650
 soldered on the motherboard and for 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.320
 Expansion is one slot where it is put 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.650
 normal zenbook hard drive strip 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.200
 I also chose my path two of them one 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.739
 small ssd for 16 gigabytes and 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.600
 go for 500 or 750 gigabytes our model 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.250
 with oh all the integrated video card 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.900
 scored in 3d mark vantage 4140 one point 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.150
 Taiwanese hero trump card can be called 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.100
 wi-fi module it supports the most 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.960
 modern standard from 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.760
 so if the router allows that 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.760
 Internet speed will basically be 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.950
 limited to internet channels only 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.210
 last killer feature and x 302 has become 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.280
 audio system 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.240
 and it's not only and not so much 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.300
 fascinating title bang and olufsen 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.060
 there is really high-quality sound 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.740
 first surprised by the volume from 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.740
 13-inch baby is clearly not waiting for this 

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:05.159
 then listen and understand what 

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:08.709
 the sound is not only loud but clear 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:11.109
 now about the battery here zenbook more than once 

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.129
 surprised showed himself the most ordinary 

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:14.529
 middling 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.809
 two two and a half hours in the game 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.509
 mode 3 when watching movies and about 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.129
 seven in typewriter mode numerals 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.049
 standard for all modern 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.109
 ultrabooks on windows 

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:29.949
 here get something such a pity 

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:31.839
 yet zenbook ux31a root them device in 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.599
 in its class this is definitely one of 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:37.329
 best ultrabooks but in terms of design to him 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:39.489
 in general there is hardly a competitor looking 

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:41.559
 you understand what asus is asking for 

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:45.389
 A lot of money such ultrabooks on 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:45.389
 the market is very very small 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.659
