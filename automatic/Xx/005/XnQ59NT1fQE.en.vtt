it's<00:07:25.770> good<00:07:25.890> enough<00:07:26.070> for<00:07:26.190> me<00:07:26.340> I<00:07:26.520> believe<00:07:26.700> it<00:07:26.880> has

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
it's good enough for me I believe it has

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.950 
it's good enough for me I believe it has
a<00:07:27.030> 60<00:07:27.660> liter<00:07:27.840> tank<00:07:28.230> I<00:07:28.590> think<00:07:29.100> gets<00:07:29.669> like<00:07:29.910> 23<00:07:30.600> 24

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960

miles to the gallon
my<00:07:33.719> amazon<00:07:34.199> got<00:07:34.500> somewhat<00:07:35.310> better<00:07:35.460> than<00:07:35.610> that

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
my amazon got somewhat better than that

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.469 
my amazon got somewhat better than that
but<00:07:37.080> this<00:07:37.289> mean<00:07:37.800> being<00:07:38.250> a<00:07:38.340> heavier<00:07:38.580> car<00:07:38.789> it

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 
but this mean being a heavier car it

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.119 
but this mean being a heavier car it
still<00:07:39.689> that's<00:07:39.900> pretty<00:07:39.990> good<00:07:40.259> for<00:07:40.530> an<00:07:40.620> old<00:07:40.650> old

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:41.129 
still that's pretty good for an old old

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:43.429
