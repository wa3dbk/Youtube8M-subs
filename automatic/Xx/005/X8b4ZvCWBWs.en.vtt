a close up of the LED light tubes i am

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.600 
a close up of the LED light tubes i am
using<00:02:40.060> well<00:02:41.060> temporarily<00:02:42.430> because<00:02:43.430> i've

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
using well temporarily because i've

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.080 
using well temporarily because i've
decided<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.769> camper<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:46.549> goes

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
decided that this camper you goes

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.800 
decided that this camper you goes
through<00:02:47.450> far<00:02:47.810> too<00:02:48.140> much<00:02:48.319> energy<00:02:49.840> okay<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:52.810> this

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
through far too much energy okay so this

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.569 
through far too much energy okay so this
is<00:02:54.049> what<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.410> light<00:02:54.590> tube<00:02:54.829> looks<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.370> that

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
is what the light tube looks like that

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:04.809 
is what the light tube looks like that
I'm<00:02:55.700> using<00:02:56.030> I<00:03:00.129> put<00:03:01.129> these<00:03:01.310> lights<00:03:01.670> in<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:03.819> fake

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
I'm using I put these lights in the fake

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.800 
I'm using I put these lights in the fake
cupboards<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.560> overhead<00:03:07.160> bunk<00:03:07.519> so<00:03:07.970> they

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
cupboards of the overhead bunk so they

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.180 
cupboards of the overhead bunk so they
wouldn't<00:03:09.019> be<00:03:09.200> noticed<00:03:10.209> anyways<00:03:11.769> here<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:12.799> the

they<00:03:38.239> use<00:03:38.480> these<00:03:39.010> like<00:03:40.010> sort<00:03:40.639> of<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:40.880> signal

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
they use these like sort of like signal

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.780 
they use these like sort of like signal
light<00:03:41.569> bulbs<00:03:42.410> now<00:03:44.049> let's<00:03:45.049> turn<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.590> on<00:03:45.859> get

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
light bulbs now let's turn this on get

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.350 
light bulbs now let's turn this on get
ready<00:03:46.910> for<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.239> light<00:03:49.299> wrong<00:03:50.299> way

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.280 

okay<00:03:54.360> three<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.620> those<00:03:56.390> little<00:03:57.390> incandescent

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
okay three of those little incandescent

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.560 
okay three of those little incandescent
light<00:03:58.860> bulbs<00:03:59.310> let's<00:03:59.730> see<00:03:59.910> how<00:04:00.060> much<00:04:00.240> energy

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
light bulbs let's see how much energy

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:15.160 
light bulbs let's see how much energy
this<00:04:01.380> thing<00:04:01.650> is<00:04:01.800> using<00:04:09.770> ho<00:04:11.840> now<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:12.900> went<00:04:13.440> from

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
this thing is using ho now we went from

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:23.510 
this thing is using ho now we went from
150<00:04:16.170> to<00:04:17.090> 150<00:04:18.090> 4<00:04:18.360> watts<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:20.310> using<00:04:21.140> 203<00:04:22.140> or<00:04:22.520> 204

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
150 to 150 4 watts to using 203 or 204

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.210 
150 to 150 4 watts to using 203 or 204
watts<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:25.440> that's<00:04:25.710> about<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.370> 50<00:04:27.030> watt<00:04:27.270> increase

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
watts so that's about a 50 watt increase

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.870 
watts so that's about a 50 watt increase
for<00:04:29.220> those<00:04:29.460> three<00:04:30.000> little<00:04:31.880> incandescent

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
for those three little incandescent

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.950 
for those three little incandescent
bulbs<00:04:33.680> now<00:04:34.680> let's<00:04:35.010> see<00:04:35.370> what<00:04:36.270> will<00:04:36.480> happen<00:04:36.510> if

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
bulbs now let's see what will happen if

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.440 
bulbs now let's see what will happen if
we<00:04:37.140> turn<00:04:37.380> those<00:04:37.590> off<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:38.190> turn<00:04:38.610> on<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:39.540> LED

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
we turn those off and turn on the LED

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:50.360 
we turn those off and turn on the LED
light<00:04:42.450> strips<00:04:46.160> okay<00:04:47.160> off<00:04:47.840> goes<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.370> built-in

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
light strips okay off goes the built-in

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.870 
light strips okay off goes the built-in
light<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:51.240> original<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:53.360> let's<00:04:54.360> turn<00:04:54.840> on<00:04:55.110> the

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
light the original and let's turn on the

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.460 
light the original and let's turn on the
I<00:04:56.880> have<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.930> put<00:04:58.110> this<00:04:58.230> down<00:04:59.810> let's<00:05:00.810> plug<00:05:01.230> in

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
I have to put this down let's plug in

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.290 
I have to put this down let's plug in
the<00:05:01.950> three<00:05:02.990> LED<00:05:03.990> light<00:05:04.710> strips<00:05:06.530> now<00:05:08.060> this<00:05:09.060> will

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
the three LED light strips now this will

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.390 
the three LED light strips now this will
be<00:05:09.480> much<00:05:09.690> brighter<00:05:09.990> as<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.500> becomes<00:05:10.770> darker

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
be much brighter as it becomes darker

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.440 
be much brighter as it becomes darker
but<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.390> course<00:05:13.170> I<00:05:13.460> need<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.700> light<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:15.150> film

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
but of course I need the light to film

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.500 
but of course I need the light to film
outside<00:05:15.860> anyways<00:05:16.860> let's<00:05:17.070> go<00:05:17.640> outside<00:05:18.150> and

take a look at the at our energy usage
keep<00:05:22.350> in<00:05:22.530> mind<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:23.130> our<00:05:23.850> basic<00:05:24.480> usage<00:05:24.900> with

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
keep in mind that our basic usage with

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:32.710 
keep in mind that our basic usage with
everything<00:05:25.710> off<00:05:25.920> is<00:05:26.570> about<00:05:27.680> 150<00:05:28.680> watts
