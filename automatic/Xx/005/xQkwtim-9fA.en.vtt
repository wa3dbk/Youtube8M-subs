today I'm going to show you how to make
spiderweb<00:00:06.270> earrings<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:08.220> three

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
spiderweb earrings so I have three

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.490 
spiderweb earrings so I have three
pieces<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.490> hard<00:00:11.490> wire<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.840> German

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
pieces of hard wire so this is German

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.829 
pieces of hard wire so this is German
wire<00:00:13.679> silver-plated<00:00:14.250> German<00:00:14.820> wire<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.240> 24

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
wire silver-plated German wire in 24

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.970 
wire silver-plated German wire in 24
gauge<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:17.070> also<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> spool<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.980> 24

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
gauge and I also have a spool of 24

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.460 
gauge and I also have a spool of 24
gauge<00:00:20.310> craft<00:00:20.760> wire<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.320> bead

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
gauge craft wire so this is the bead

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.279 
gauge craft wire so this is the bead
place<00:00:22.680> brand<00:00:23.220> craft<00:00:23.640> wire<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.420> also<00:00:24.630> 24

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
place brand craft wire and it's also 24

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.710 
place brand craft wire and it's also 24
gauge<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:27.210> bit<00:00:27.300> different

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
gauge this is a little bit different

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.990 
gauge this is a little bit different
than<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.560> German<00:00:29.039> wire<00:00:29.220> because<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
than the German wire because this is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120 
than the German wire because this is
more<00:00:30.179> flexible<00:00:30.960> whereas<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
more flexible whereas this is going to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
more flexible whereas this is going to
hold<00:00:32.279> its<00:00:32.520> own<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.090> better<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.780> also

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
hold its own a little bit better I also

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.569 
hold its own a little bit better I also
have<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.829> pair<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.280> earring<00:00:35.700> findings<00:00:37.579> round

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
have a pair of earring findings round

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
have a pair of earring findings round
nose<00:00:38.760> pliers<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.540> those<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.170> ones<00:00:40.350> with

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
nose pliers so those are the ones with

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
nose pliers so those are the ones with
the<00:00:40.590> round<00:00:41.129> nose<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:43.070> then<00:00:44.070> chain<00:00:45.030> nose

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the round nose and then chain nose

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630

surface<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.629> inside<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:50.809> flush

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
surface to the inside and then flush

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.529 
surface to the inside and then flush
cutter<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> start<00:00:54.510> by<00:00:56.539> pulling

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
cutter so I'm going to start by pulling

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.029 
cutter so I'm going to start by pulling
off<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.460> little<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.789> my<00:01:00.289> 24<00:01:01.289> gauge<00:01:01.469> craft

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
off a little bit of my 24 gauge craft

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.960 
off a little bit of my 24 gauge craft
wire<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.379> hold<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.309> three

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
wire and I'm going to hold all three

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.130 
wire and I'm going to hold all three
pieces<00:01:06.920> together<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.860> then

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
pieces together so I'm going to then

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.090 
pieces together so I'm going to then
wrap<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> center<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:16.500> those<00:01:16.860> three

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
wrap around the center of those three

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.370

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and you want to get it as tight as you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
and you want to get it as tight as you
can<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> tools<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.320> necessary

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
can you can use the tools if necessary

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.880 
can you can use the tools if necessary
in<00:01:26.549> order<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> tight<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:28.560> worry<00:01:28.740> if

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
in order to get it tight don't worry if

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.840 
in order to get it tight don't worry if
the<00:01:29.159> pieces<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> slipping<00:01:31.850> so

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the pieces are kind of slipping so

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.870 
the pieces are kind of slipping so
you're<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> wrap<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> small

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you're going to wrap and kind of small

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
you're going to wrap and kind of small
show<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.240> bit<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.840> tight<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
show a little bit to get it tight and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.560 
show a little bit to get it tight and
then<00:01:38.540> I'm<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> bend<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.619> into<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
then I'm going to bend them out into a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:51.139 
then I'm going to bend them out into a
web<00:01:42.570> shape

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.859 

so<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.649> fine<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.210> what<00:01:55.390> I'm<00:01:55.630> going

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
so like that is fine so what I'm going

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.240 
so like that is fine so what I'm going
to<00:01:55.930> do<00:01:56.170> then<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.950> take<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.670> craft<00:01:58.000> wire<00:01:58.299> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to do then is take the craft wire and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.450 
to do then is take the craft wire and
wrap<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.490> around<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:01.869> spoke<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.920> do<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
wrap it around one spoke and then do the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.400 
wrap it around one spoke and then do the
same<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.210> next<00:02:07.390> spoke<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.840> same<00:02:11.080> for

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
same for the next spoke and the same for

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.370 
same for the next spoke and the same for
the<00:02:11.500> next<00:02:11.830> book<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.569> I'm<00:02:13.690> just<00:02:13.900> going<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.230> be

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.640 
the next book and I'm just going to be
working<00:02:14.830> around<00:02:15.760> each<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.890> spokes<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.560> I'm

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
working around each of the spokes so I'm

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.370 
working around each of the spokes so I'm
going<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.890> bring<00:02:21.069> it<00:02:21.190> around<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:23.500> wrap<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
going to bring it around and wrap and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.470 
going to bring it around and wrap and
I'm<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.680> going<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.920> keep<00:02:27.100> working<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.880> in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
I'm just going to keep working it in

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:42.710 
I'm just going to keep working it in
this<00:02:28.930> way

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.470 

to<00:02:43.650> see<00:02:43.860> how<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.250> starting<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.120> spiral

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
to see how it's starting to spiral

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:55.330 
to see how it's starting to spiral
around<00:02:52.340> you're<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.370> gonna<00:02:53.610> keep<00:02:53.880> working

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
around you're just gonna keep working

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:05.260 
around you're just gonna keep working
around<00:02:57.350> in<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.530> circle

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.440 

and<00:03:06.270> try<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.080> keep<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.710> even<00:03:07.890> if<00:03:08.460> it's<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:08.880> even

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and try to keep it even if it's not even

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.610 
and try to keep it even if it's not even
that's<00:03:09.840> ok<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:11.900> we<00:03:12.900> want<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.170> piece<00:03:13.410> to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that's ok because we want it piece to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.250 
that's ok because we want it piece to
look<00:03:13.800> spooky<00:03:17.780> we're<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.959> gonna<00:03:19.110> work<00:03:19.880> around

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
look spooky we're just gonna work around

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.320 
look spooky we're just gonna work around
see<00:03:22.260> how<00:03:22.290> we're<00:03:22.590> starting<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.370> kind<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.730> build

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
see how we're starting to kind of build

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.690 
see how we're starting to kind of build
out<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:27.510> keep<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.250> try<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.520> keep

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
out just keep that up and try to keep

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.910 
out just keep that up and try to keep
your<00:03:29.760> spokes<00:03:30.270> as<00:03:30.600> straight<00:03:31.020> as<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.640 

for<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.480> video<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.720> sake<00:03:39.990> I'm<00:03:40.200> gonna<00:03:40.410> make

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
for the video is sake I'm gonna make

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.330 
for the video is sake I'm gonna make
this<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:41.040> kind<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.580> short<00:03:42.320> spiderweb<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.680> small

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
this a kind of short spiderweb a small

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.880 
this a kind of short spiderweb a small
one<00:03:44.610> but<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.570> could<00:03:45.750> obviously<00:03:45.900> make<00:03:46.590> yours

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
one but you could obviously make yours

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.710 
one but you could obviously make yours
any<00:03:47.820> length<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:49.050> want<00:03:49.970> as<00:03:50.970> we're

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
any length that you want as we're

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.259 
any length that you want as we're
wrapping<00:03:51.900> around<00:03:52.260> keep<00:03:52.920> it<00:03:53.100> consistent<00:03:53.519> so

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
wrapping around keep it consistent so

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.630 
wrapping around keep it consistent so
like<00:03:54.690> if<00:03:54.840> I'm<00:03:55.019> going<00:03:55.260> over<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.680> top<00:03:55.980> like<00:03:56.310> in

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
like if I'm going over the top like in

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.170 
like if I'm going over the top like in
the<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.540> front<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.930> one<00:03:58.110> spoke<00:03:58.970> don't<00:03:59.970> go

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
the in the front of one spoke don't go

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.600 
the in the front of one spoke don't go
around<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.080> back<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.680> next<00:04:01.980> one<00:04:02.190> you're

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
around the back of the next one you're

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:12.830 
around the back of the next one you're
gonna<00:04:02.730> keep<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:03.570> consistent<00:04:11.600> once<00:04:12.600> you're

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
gonna keep it consistent once you're

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.000 
gonna keep it consistent once you're
around<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.480> get<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.049> size<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.470> you

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
around and you get to a size that you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.530 
around and you get to a size that you
like<00:04:17.220> I'm<00:04:17.489> gonna<00:04:17.640> go<00:04:17.820> around<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.090> couple<00:04:18.239> more

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
like I'm gonna go around a couple more

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:51.990 
like I'm gonna go around a couple more
times

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.770 

okay<00:04:53.410> so<00:04:54.490> once<00:04:55.490> you're<00:04:55.700> around<00:04:56.090> a<00:04:56.300> good<00:04:56.570> number

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
okay so once you're around a good number

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.410 
okay so once you're around a good number
of<00:04:56.900> times<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.770> think<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.550> your<00:04:59.150> webs

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
of times and you think that your webs

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.040 
of times and you think that your webs
look<00:04:59.960> pretty<00:05:00.500> even<00:05:00.980> what<00:05:01.670> you<00:05:01.790> can<00:05:01.970> do<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.450> just

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
look pretty even what you can do is just

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.560 
look pretty even what you can do is just
on<00:05:03.230> your<00:05:03.380> last<00:05:03.620> pass<00:05:04.010> around<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.670> spiral<00:05:05.330> it

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
on your last pass around and spiral it

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:13.170 
on your last pass around and spiral it
around<00:05:07.120> about<00:05:08.120> two<00:05:08.780> times<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.760> then<00:05:11.720> trim<00:05:12.500> off

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
around about two times and then trim off

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.210 
around about two times and then trim off
flush<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:15.140> your<00:05:15.610> coils<00:05:17.110> if<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:18.440> need<00:05:18.650> to<00:05:18.860> you

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
flush to your coils if you need to you

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.160 
flush to your coils if you need to you
can<00:05:19.370> tuck<00:05:19.640> it<00:05:19.820> down<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.030> little<00:05:20.300> bit<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.900> we're

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
can tuck it down a little bit and we're

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.730 
can tuck it down a little bit and we're
going<00:05:24.350> to<00:05:25.060> trim<00:05:26.060> all<00:05:26.360> of<00:05:26.540> these<00:05:26.720> just<00:05:27.320> so<00:05:27.500> we

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
going to trim all of these just so we

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.930 
going to trim all of these just so we
have<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.750> ends<00:05:30.260> just<00:05:30.560> long<00:05:30.800> enough<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:31.340> fold

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
have the ends just long enough to fold

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.670 
have the ends just long enough to fold
over<00:05:35.860> so<00:05:37.240> four<00:05:38.240> or<00:05:38.420> five<00:05:38.600> millimeters<00:05:39.140> is<00:05:39.350> just

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
over so four or five millimeters is just

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.140 
over so four or five millimeters is just
fine

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.060 

and<00:05:44.470> then<00:05:45.470> we're<00:05:45.680> going<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:45.950> fold<00:05:46.510> them<00:05:47.510> over

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
and then we're going to fold them over

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.920 
and then we're going to fold them over
with<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.250> round<00:05:49.490> nose<00:05:49.580> pliers<00:05:50.030> so<00:05:50.660> you<00:05:50.750> want

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
with the round nose pliers so you want

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.150 
with the round nose pliers so you want
to<00:05:50.990> use<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.200> very<00:05:51.380> tip<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.800> round<00:05:52.040> nose

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
to use the very tip of the round nose

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.110 
to use the very tip of the round nose
pliers<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:53.330> just<00:05:53.390> kind<00:05:53.960> of<00:05:54.020> fold<00:05:54.320> them<00:05:54.820> back

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.670 

just<00:06:00.120> bend<00:06:00.449> it<00:06:00.659> back<00:06:01.999> and<00:06:03.560> depending<00:06:04.560> on

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
just bend it back and depending on

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.679 
just bend it back and depending on
whether<00:06:04.919> or<00:06:05.039> not<00:06:05.159> you<00:06:05.340> want<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.639> loops<00:06:05.909> to

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:06.689 
whether or not you want the loops to

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:13.429 
whether or not you want the loops to
show<00:06:07.370> forward<00:06:09.349> or<00:06:10.349> sideways<00:06:11.569> you<00:06:12.569> can<00:06:12.599> bend

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
show forward or sideways you can bend

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.540 
show forward or sideways you can bend
them<00:06:13.740> either<00:06:14.419> this<00:06:15.419> direction<00:06:16.259> or<00:06:17.039> this

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
them either this direction or this

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.320 
them either this direction or this
direction<00:06:18.740> so<00:06:19.740> you<00:06:20.669> need<00:06:20.849> to<00:06:20.939> make<00:06:21.090> sure<00:06:21.120> that

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
direction so you need to make sure that

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.619 
direction so you need to make sure that
you<00:06:21.569> have<00:06:21.840> at<00:06:22.110> least<00:06:22.439> one<00:06:23.370> that's<00:06:23.999> sideways

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
you have at least one that's sideways

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.149 
you have at least one that's sideways
because<00:06:24.990> that's<00:06:25.379> the<00:06:25.620> one<00:06:25.740> that's<00:06:25.889> going<00:06:26.099> to

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
because that's the one that's going to

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:33.649 
because that's the one that's going to
go<00:06:26.310> through<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:27.539> earring<00:06:27.900> finding<00:06:29.090> so<00:06:32.479> if<00:06:33.479> you

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
go through the earring finding so if you

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.830 
go through the earring finding so if you
have<00:06:33.810> them<00:06:33.960> all<00:06:34.169> bent<00:06:34.409> backwards<00:06:35.479> except<00:06:36.479> for

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
have them all bent backwards except for

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.559 
have them all bent backwards except for
one<00:06:37.680> I'm<00:06:38.310> gonna<00:06:38.460> straighten<00:06:38.909> that<00:06:39.120> one<00:06:39.330> out<00:06:39.539> a

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
one I'm gonna straighten that one out a

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:46.689 
one I'm gonna straighten that one out a
little<00:06:39.960> bit<00:06:42.830> and<00:06:43.830> then<00:06:44.719> we<00:06:45.719> have<00:06:45.870> a<00:06:45.900> spiderweb

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
little bit and then we have a spiderweb

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.490 
little bit and then we have a spiderweb
and<00:06:47.699> kind<00:06:47.939> of<00:06:48.060> straighten<00:06:48.449> out<00:06:48.539> any<00:06:48.659> spokes<00:06:49.139> if

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
and kind of straighten out any spokes if

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.619 
and kind of straighten out any spokes if
