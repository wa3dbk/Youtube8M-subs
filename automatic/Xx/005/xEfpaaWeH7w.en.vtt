00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.410
 In this video we take care of now 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.420
 the rear installation and what we do about it 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.880
 I'll need everything right now 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:24.720
 show we need our main turn 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:33.600
 hector that support the hector the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:41.940
 rear rotor the servo bracket rod 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:46.289
 guidance was due to horizontal linkage 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.620
 and find the vertical and the fastening 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.289
 Ironing for sector and of course ours 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.969
 small screws bag the the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.249
 complete tail motto unit and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.530
 Check if everything is preassembled correctly 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:03.170
 be careful that the stock exchange 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.640
 easy to move back and forth 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 if that is not the case you can 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 on the rear engine shaft a small 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.549
 drop fine mechanics oil attach to the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.969
 whole a bit smoother too 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.829
 do 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:18.689
 you should also screw those 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.130
 check if the secured with loctite 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.109
 are 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.539
 that should not be the case better 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.969
 but be careful that you are 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:31.799
 not at the moving parts somewhere 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:33.539
 so loctite around or lubricates that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.880
 the whole thing stuck together and not afterwards 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.030
 more smoothly works just like that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.399
 at the main rotor applies rear rotor must 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.259
 be right smoothly 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.659
 I have the rotor blades here 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.219
 You can fix it later 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.049
 have now made it easy times equal 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.689
 make sure that you do not have the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.119
 tightening must be easy 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.380
 align 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.789
 we take now that was rear-front 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.909
 the rear one place on the one hand 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.850
 little nut this will later in the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.340
 Rear part of the main ram introduced 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.730
 that in the small nipples there must have 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.090
 snap this little glasses in later 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.670
 so now we take the first 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.450
 guide and push each other 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.050
 page 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:28.260
 a go up a bit hard though 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:32.879
 must be like that so the first one 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:38.130
 second from the back does not play any 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:42.870
 role where things are now sitting then that 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.940
 you can change later so then 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.819
 namely a salve holder 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:57.720
 put this on the second as well 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:59.780
 afterwards we have now 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.000
 Everything on it what we need so if 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:09.140
 you have not done that yet relaxes 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.769
 screw the rear eight a bit 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.870
 from the main room for the bracket 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.310
 otherwise you will get problems 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.790
 rear pipe right back in there too 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.970
 to get 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.970
 Now take the clock with the tap 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.329
 you have to go back and forth a bit 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.130
 wiggle 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.160
 and if the front of the bracket 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.049
 comes out then you are just right 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.389
 and have met the tap you notice 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.799
 also you can not do that afterwards 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.209
 more represented so the screws can 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.109
 its a bit tight there but pull 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.609
 not too tight 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.440
 because we still have ours 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:52.079
 rear rotor install but next 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.730
 Let's take the tail first 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:04:01.410
 support and screw these already 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.959
 times in the main room so that's what I have 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.630
 already done but not yet 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.260
 pull tight because we have to go here 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.880
 afterwards our parts fix the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.760
 You can fix it as well 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:20.160
 take on the horizontal 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:23.849
 Fin two screws and two of them 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.610
 special washers and mounted 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.830
 the hedge support ever but how 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.650
 said not yet tighten first 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.470
 provisionally stuck 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.440
 and that's how it should look like 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.970
 as I said no screw from the rear 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.980
 really tight because we still have the 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.260
 rear rotor unit install and also 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.690
 still the hack rain tension to 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.060
 install the rear rotor unit 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.830
 I built myself a small tool and that 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.960
 I took the tubes 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.730
 since I do not need it anyway and have on 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.530
 one side a paperclip 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.410
 bent up and these with seconds glue 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.880
 So I stuck in little like that 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:10.480
 a kind of enterhaken took it then 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.670
 you hack it and that without it 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.480
 he is twisted hanging on them 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:19.920
 Paper clip on and slide the antennae 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.360
 tube from behind through the rear ra 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.950
 now you can front of the antennas 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:33.520
 pull the tubes and thus the vine 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:40.540
 Convenient to the front drive gear 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:46.140
 move tail rotor plug on so that 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:48.520
 we align everything later and 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.960
 I do not know if you recognize that now 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.800
 Now you can do the paperclip 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:58.180
 Reopen the belt here in front 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:02.200
 hang over the drive gear and 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:06.100
 Although so biased that himself 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.240
 the small drive gear against the 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:15.100
 clockwise moves and your tail rotor 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:17.820
 moves backwards to tension the 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.840
 stern riems pulls her back out 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:27.750
 this bracket just out and that 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.750
 so far that you have the strap 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:39.400
 without great effort 23 mm 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:43.689
 could squeeze afterwards 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.689
 you pull all screws 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:56.049
 firmly and especially with them 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.119
 this will be the tail rotor unit with 

00:06:56.049 --> 00:07:00.219
 the tail is connected 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:01.089
 tighten all the beautiful and loctite 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.099
 do not forget 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:05.289
 I have everything already 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:08.969
 prepared so what means prepared 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:13.259
 finished you can see it 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.259
 Slowly our heli shapes are taking on
