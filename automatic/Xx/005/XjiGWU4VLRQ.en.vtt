00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.580
 Hello today I want to show you how to do without us the authentic studio 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.960
 Sandokan compile come 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
 Train there is the program the Earth Reus pixels AXA 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.659
 and we find that 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.659
 Voltmer from Bea and her car Michi Studio 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.669
 the 91 points to it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.130
 underneath and percent bindi 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.510
 then there is the Pierre Roy 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 Pixel AXA 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.700
 and here can not 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
 via command line call 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.290
 complete the program 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.980
 in which 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 And recently, the important test 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.500
 TS forgive 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.450
 on to the program 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.610
 not quite easy to worry about with this percentage points 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 copied with the Portas 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
 Insert MTG 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.290
 that's why it's Tom Brake Assist 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.530
 that moved 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.450
 Point also Pia j 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.930
 and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.600
 as an additional parameter, I still have to 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 specify the compilation Wismar pull with the construction of the middle 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.010
 and a complication is called that 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.740
 good noise Theo 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.400
 Simon people 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 the weight of Iran 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.120
 and 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 Now I can compile nonexistent Syke 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 please come stuttering 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 IZ copied 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.689
 There is still a subsidy parameter which is important to us when I go to 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.779
 Example compile everything world 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.789
 then there is the 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.389
 Parameter Ooyen so the RHE image so all new do not ask too 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.409
 via the menu 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.409
 to compile complications can reach 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.849
 Milk lakes works the whole thing too 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.289
 There are still parameters that the polar bear Knut has 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.289
 can you picture how suddenly make transfer to the project Comeback Flash 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.379
 However, it does not work that way, this function does not work that way 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.619
 quite optimal 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:45.619
 it means if you pass here a few meters 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.009
 nothing happens 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.169
 addressed Alexa Chung thus triggered 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.179
 that may come in the future, but 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:58.619
 Unfortunately this does not work yet 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:02.899
 but it is enough to first compile com and come the whole project new 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.059
 apprenticeships 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.359
 as we see 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.049
 yes in this video he has learned that we are in 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.249
 without a happy ending the automatic studio 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.509
 compiled via the command line in the program
