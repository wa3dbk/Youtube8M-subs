00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.220
 hi hello girls how are you greeting 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.500
 all of them and I hope they are well and 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.280
 I bring you this good tutorial that is 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.950
 my new set and well this time I 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.860
 I did it in pink tone too but it's a 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.110
 little stronger than the last set that 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.239
 it was baby pink and well let's 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.210
 start here as you see her I'm 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.460
 putting or placing the sculptural shape 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.920
 look at these are the ways of me to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.890
 secret that I mentioned in the video 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.979
 this is how they are complete here 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.750
 I did not cut anything for him to see him and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.330
 well then I will apply my 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:18.050
 first only one one pass since 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.600
 This is not double adhesion and good 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.409
 let's start doing the technique of 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.440
 reverse with this acrylic that is not 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.000
 I remember the exact name of this 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.850
 acrylic but it's as if it were the pin the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.270
 crystal the pink crystal of the organ more or 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.159
 less well like this is it but from the is 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.100
 Oh 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.840
 well here we are going to apply a second 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.979
 Pearl and our dam is now 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.469
 we are going to take care not to hit particular and 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.170
 good and nothing else for the bed of the nail 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.390
 What is it 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.049
 he's going to be almost all the design of the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.590
 mind let's take the rose that I tell you 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.360
 and I'm going to lead towards tension anchors 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.060
 You can try to keep me to the same 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.790
 height of the anchors of kun city and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.180
 well I also want to tell you that this 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.209
 set is not going to be my stiletto nor 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.670
 stiletto or square or anything that's going to 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:27.230
 to be pointed oval 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.230
 and that 's that he accepted a ballad 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:38.400
 and let's put it aside from the pink tone 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:41.490
 let's put a bell to allow 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.820
 this glitter that makes a tone look 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.350
 violeta do very nice this leader is from 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.450
 visual 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.390
 it's really beautiful and we're going to 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.110
 put some tail sequins on 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.230
 translucent siren in pink tone that's going to 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.200
 be everything I did on the set really 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.030
 it was not much and here as I saw with this 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.020
 single pearl that I took from acrylic 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.330
 It encapsulates the nail very easy do not forget 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.280
 to compact as much as they can to 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.420
 avoid 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.520
 eliminate a lot and that's how they see it already 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.790
 just wait to load a little 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.160
 and we are going to give him a puncture with the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.450
 hands that you have with me 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.450
 I have these that are from nike factory and 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.150
 Well we are going to remove the form here and 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.120
 so the whole set is here 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.810
 I show how I stay and how it will stay 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.260
 after the pampered and the polished it is 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.440
 as it is already we are going to clean with a 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.320
 wet wipe for white or 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.420
 as many compaÃ±eras do when not 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:01.050
 we have this product with alcohol ok 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.690
 get it or with alcohol this one good 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.209
 here we will start with what is the 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.050
 third dimension roses in third 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.880
 dimension that's the only thing that I 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.690
 complicates a little bit because it's been a long time 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.930
 that I did not do not put this third 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.200
 dimension in what are my nails 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.630
 so good for my right hand to 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.169
 doing it with the left complicated me 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.020
 little bit but it already ascends accounts and I could 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.660
 no and good here as they see nothing more and they 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.419
 a cazuelita of a perlite that 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.919
 I took or nuanced in with the same rose that 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.270
 I put in the base with kawai acrylic 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.070
 organ 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.470
 this is the acrylic that I occupy 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.270
 and well here I extended it and we go with 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.200
 the second pearl let's do 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:58.590
 exactly the same 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:02.880
 and I'm learning and I'm 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.630
 pulling the outward rather 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.630
 I'm not 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.220
 stretching the acrylic and finally we're going 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.620
 to take a third pearl 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.080
 obviously they are diminishing a bit 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.960
 the size of the pearls eye with that 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.990
 because if we put them equal good to me 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.670
 I do not like that it is very big 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.560
 Third dimension 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.310
 then I prefer all miniature 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.230
 here as you see I put a very little pearl 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.570
 small for the center but I was 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.900
 the pearl sank the little stone that I put 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.030
 sorry then I did it again and here 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.350
 and to wipe it again right now 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.390
 use 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.380
 then we are going to put back a 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:50.470
 little white acrylic too small 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.890
 but that is not wet at all 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.440
 As you can see, I do not want so much anymore and here 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.740
 I will place with my wax pencil that 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.160
 I did by the way there is also a 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.070
 pebble and well well we continue and until 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.830
 get here and it's the last thing I'm 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.350
 applying two very small pearls 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:14.050
 here look 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.750
 we are also going to hit them with a 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.930
 acrylic pearlite here is the other 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.000
 It was everything I put to his nails 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.150
 obviously mark the smile with some 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.490
 classic dots and good girls like that 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.000
 I hope you like this one 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:33.670
 I also liked it a lot and good at 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.540
 Any question question or comment by

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.880
