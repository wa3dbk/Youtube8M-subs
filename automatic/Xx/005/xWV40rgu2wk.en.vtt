00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
a stock price right now but if we take a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.369 
a stock price right now but if we take a

big<00:01:13.920> pop<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.990> next<00:01:16.110> quarter<00:01:16.409> if

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
big pop you know in the next quarter if

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.219

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.480 
ambarella right and i think that this is
probably<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.329> better<00:01:57.540> way<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.560> play<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.040> idea

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
probably the better way to play the idea

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.789 
probably the better way to play the idea
of<00:01:59.790> these<00:02:00.119> ultra<00:02:00.659> HD<00:02:01.079> cameras<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.770> know

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
of these ultra HD cameras you know

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
of these ultra HD cameras you know
obviously<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.460> GoPro<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:02.970> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> get

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
obviously a GoPro is going to get

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.679 
obviously a GoPro is going to get
competition<00:02:04.049> from<00:02:04.259> Samsung<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.250> HTC<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
competition from Samsung and HTC you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.479 
competition from Samsung and HTC you
know<00:02:07.049> about<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.680> time<00:02:07.920> next<00:02:08.100> week<00:02:08.280> you'll

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
know about this time next week you'll

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.330 
know about this time next week you'll
see<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.540> HTC<00:02:10.259> unveiling<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.310> brand-new

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
see that HTC unveiling a brand-new

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.030 
see that HTC unveiling a brand-new
product<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:13.079> there's<00:02:13.350> going<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.769> sorts

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
product so there's going to be all sorts

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.759 
product so there's going to be all sorts
of<00:02:14.100> competition<00:02:14.700> coming<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.690> GoPro<00:02:16.200> but

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
of competition coming in for a GoPro but

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.260 
of competition coming in for a GoPro but
the<00:02:16.890> end<00:02:17.040> idea<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.489> all<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.090> use

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the end idea is that all going to use

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.320 
the end idea is that all going to use
the<00:02:18.450> chipset<00:02:18.959> from<00:02:19.800> ambarella<00:02:20.430> they<00:02:20.790> are<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the chipset from ambarella they are the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.850 
the chipset from ambarella they are the
ones<00:02:21.450> they<00:02:21.720> are<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> Kalos<00:02:22.200> behind<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
ones they are the Kalos behind the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.850 
ones they are the Kalos behind the
ultra-high-definition<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:25.410> know<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.710> we're

growth here you know this is the idea
behind<00:02:29.990> ambarella<00:02:30.990> if<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.410> take<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.590> look<00:02:31.830> at

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
behind ambarella if we take a look at

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
for revenue so one year forward estimate

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.720 
for revenue so one year forward estimate

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
consensus and you can see three big

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.700 
consensus and you can see three big
jumps<00:02:41.850> here<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.870> line<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> green

jumps here in the line of the green

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.970 
jumps here in the line of the green
lines<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.390> each<00:02:45.390> time<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.990> those<00:02:46.200> big

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
lines here each time that those big

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
lines here each time that those big
jumps<00:02:47.400> occurs<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.940> saw<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> stock<00:02:48.510> get
