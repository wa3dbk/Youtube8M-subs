00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.549
 will come days virtual public 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.549
 to explain to you how to make the acquisition millions 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.769
 in the entire Europe 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.109
 it takes a ps3 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.679
 once renamed acquisitions 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.599
 if wasquehal the iasb and it happens 2 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.619
 pumping 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.169
 it works pretty well 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.779
 but three years ago 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.310
 three tertiary cables 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.580
 and the entrance is free 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.560
 you need 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.600
 a ps3 output 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.810
 with rc cables arras 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.000
 the following 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.370
 you must not overwhelm him scart 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.370
 heyer three times in the tertiary 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.110
 we are going to start 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 we must connect the capital 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 ben stiller 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.420
 then 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.930
 tune in 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.710
 the prison l'Ã¨s troyes 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 who is crazy laugh like every ps3 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.570
 for the franchise 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.540
 then 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.100
 connected 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 these clubs 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.540
 yes that remain 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.580
 this day 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.580
 the hipsters like that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.320
 and this northern part 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 so these lines mystical strings branch on the computer 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.869
 where she always shows in the field and denial 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.149
 and when I want to do video acquisition 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.759
 i'm plugging the fnsea into actually m 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.829
 so you turn on your console must rely on it until then in the 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.829
 debit 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.859
 when you heard bis 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.899
 you plug on them the father and some enemies 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.899
 the anguished for both 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.169
 so the money to enchant with her would have asked to be able to play the 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.169
 acquire 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.249
 so then 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.249
 on the pc 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.779
 a device 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.779
 10:10 too 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.889
 the fbi the s2 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.889
 so these two friends in poker 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.689
 that it costs about 40 euros -8 bought at the fnac 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:47.989
 so once 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.989
 everything is plugged into the computer 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.489
 provided with you a small software 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.259
 so this but another series 7 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.009
 therefore to launch 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.449
 so it has to change a bit 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.489
 huge surprise 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.309
 so after you place your ps3 and wii 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.749
 when you enemy those recordings 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:28.080
 it's you who choose as in history 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080
 we also want to catch 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.319
 it's pretty simple 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.319
 we waters because I do not know if you like on the alert 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.150
 the dimensions are not too bearded that we are in scart 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.689
 so when you want to play normally to patients 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.590
 as said stone 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.590
 in the golden bowl I hope to have helped you 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.720
