00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
it's it's theoretically it works

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.970 
it's it's theoretically it works
yeah<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:30.600> agree<00:02:30.989> that's<00:02:31.170> one<00:02:31.350> yeah<00:02:31.530> one<00:02:31.829> of<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
things that drew me to the song was that

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.430 
things that drew me to the song was that
we<00:02:33.630> don't<00:02:33.870> may<00:02:33.959> think<00:02:34.170> of

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.899

actually<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.730> when<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.239> think<00:02:45.330> about<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.659> sunny

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
actually I when I think about a sunny

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.039 
actually I when I think about a sunny
boy<00:02:46.230> would<00:02:46.739> use<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.400> note<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.030> 5<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.870> 5

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
boy would use that note for a 5 out of 5

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.780 
boy would use that note for a 5 out of 5
chord<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.709> he's<00:02:49.950> probably<00:02:50.220> one<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> few

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
chord and he's probably one of the few

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.289 
chord and he's probably one of the few
