taste now more so I if final spike so
it's<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.369> triple<00:01:29.700> spikes<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.750> he

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it's got triple spikes now and he

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
it's got triple spikes now and he
finished<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> off<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.290> Thunderbolt<00:01:31.860> that's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
finished it off with Thunderbolt that's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.219 
finished it off with Thunderbolt that's
basically<00:01:32.700> klefki<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.390> therefore<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.049> just

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
basically klefki is therefore it's just

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
basically klefki is therefore it's just
effort<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> set<00:01:34.829> spikes<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:35.610> die<00:01:35.790> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
effort to set spikes up and then die so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.550 
effort to set spikes up and then die so
i<00:01:36.329> gave<00:01:36.450> my<00:01:36.600> chest<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> take<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.439> the

my<00:02:08.190> speed<00:02:08.459> low<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.700> obviously<00:02:09.060> from<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.390> my

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
my speed low is obviously from that my

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.480 
my speed low is obviously from that my
leftovers<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> leech<00:02:11.340> seed<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.910> then

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
leftovers and leech seed and then

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.850 
leftovers and leech seed and then
see<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> burn<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.210> does<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.840> then<00:02:14.410> I
