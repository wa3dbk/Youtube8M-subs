 Do you have any idea about the effects of TreShift? 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:31.289
 KATE SHIFT adjusts the aperture on the aperture so that it differs from ordinary camera lenses 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:32.190
 Reflects light vertically, horizontally and vertically in the lens to produce a very thin depth of field 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.680
 It is. 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:42.930
 4 Because the depth is very thin, the focus area narrows , 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:49.079
 There is also a miniature- like feeling that seems to have taken a closer look at the toys 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 Oh, I ssalrae I've come to be a rattling effect is so yum eg discounts

 Because it is possible to catch a very small nutrition point in the field, 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:04.559

 The default is the default horizontal shape, and the shape of the circle is the new shape.

 Three kinds of blur mode may be arranged to fit the screen size and composition, and distance 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.810
