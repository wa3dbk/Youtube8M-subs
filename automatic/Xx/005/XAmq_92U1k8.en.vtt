00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.609
 with that played 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.869
 starting 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.869
 of the final quadrangular of the Paulista championship 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 and then it's good to point that out, huh? 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.969
 everybody says that the first team is formed and she is that 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.279
 team with the team and she goes through transformations from us 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620
 to play that way 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.730
 we made 15 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.730
 working a relatively long period 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.020
 for the team to gain confidence that that way was reliable 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.010
 to the point that you can 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.230
 placed a semifinal of São Paulo championship with são paulo 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 but nothing less but nothing less than Sao Paulo 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.250
 she played with 4 3 3 with a variant 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.820
 almost all the ways to play pennsylvania jorge henrique was variant 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.820
 What were you doing? 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.060
 two lines of four will put two lines of four and two attackers 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 and worse to even allow the game to play with three-line 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.640
 behind defend year depending on the opponent who throws himself doing 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.950
 class 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.100
 because it has the capacity to inject 1 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.370
 obey players' characteristics 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.760
 it is fundamental that if we put together a way to play the team that its variants 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.280
 jessica noutel that i do is in no secret at all 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.630
 the question of resumption of ball the type of work that is made the bet in the market 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.630
 the same 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.720
 paulo autuori 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.230
 not once 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.310
 she asked me a question that they handle this we have one 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.010
 a very big decision pride you can take 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.800
 and then the paulo asked me why I was paying 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 not only of the estate he heard he could not answer 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.570
 and footprint is nothing more than 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.999
 a good initial tactical positioning 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.999
 because if you have poorly positioned tactically will not catch anyone 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.119
 When I go to catch a wave, it's gone. 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.359
 not the ball 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.069
 so it's because you take the time 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.680
 tactical positioning works with this characteristic and yes 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.249
 repetitive 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.219
 if you will you will get caught if you can double the marking do 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.629
 two against a little one can make two against a fit 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.769
 you have to come define as if you want to make two against one 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.869
 who will be the second player within each sector of the ball to make the second 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.409
 player 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.099
 so I think it's relatively easy that kind of work sure 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.729
 I can arm the team on the same field is between the redoubt spaces 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.439
 This is a job that I was 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.799
 that the defense can not broadband mark even made it today this morning 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.749
 the defense can not score within the area 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.749
 and the attack can play within the current defense 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:14.839
 so if you do not press the man's ball all the time the ball will enter the 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:15.979
 your sexless life 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.419
 so this is creating 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.899
 pressure mentality 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:25.919
 This is not the way to work, I always work, but with a 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.269
 common goal 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.229
 I think the fundamental 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.069
 for the coach 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.449
 is when he will perform the work explains on one hand the objectives of the 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.539
 tract 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.969
 Why do I see one often do the work to be done 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.849
 I'll do the work to do. 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.130
 nobody's stuck in the mouth 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.800
 and every time the ball goes there in its defensive system, the objective for the 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.219
 which your own work will not be achieved at the end 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.879
 you must first have this understanding 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.889
 d 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.639
 other work can develop technical field difference yes but all 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.359
 inside a glass of a line david di repetition 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:13.779
