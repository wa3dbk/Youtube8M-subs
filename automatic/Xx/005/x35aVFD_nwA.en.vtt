 that going down the Seneca road 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 as you can see here admiral boat insulating tape 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 other 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.300
 Latest generation alloy bail 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880

 and as you can see here is broken 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010
 it is broken and the paint falls 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.799
 why 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.689
 to steal the radio that I do not have a radio, they took it with other things 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.170
 they folded the whole door then to put the skin 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.510
 I know the base 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.710
 As you can see how is the other car's key 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.390
 I do not trust so much testing that enters through the passenger door 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 to enter when pointing 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.729
 as the pilot continues 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.729
 the powerbar entries without another hit here 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.009
 of less importance 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.009
 but important hundred do not open doors 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.679

 I have been touching the ground but 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.529
 I got and put a bomb at any moment 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.189

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.079
 by consensus 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.439
 car is breaking is rotting everything 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.149
 and we carry a rope 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.149
 to be able to on the bumper when it falls 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.479

 the side of the car 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.979
 and loudspeakers from the speakers try to put 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.869
 and we go in there 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.869
 as you see here until serious and that works here 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.459
 yes it is true 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.839
 the insulating tape as you will understand is is basic of this car stated 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.209
 Followed min in the middle of the dry road he 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.749
 the bumper after 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.209
 the only way to tell 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.209

 here at the doors of mos 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.289
 here the doors inside 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.289
 we see that there are no handles on the sides 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.419
 to open the door 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.989
 the basis of strength 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.809
 also die 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.809
 and spokespersons 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.809
 on the floor 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:26.349
 I made a plan to go to a rugby match 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.809
 that is left unintentional 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.909
 I think I built in Carlos Carlos Paz 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:36.699
 he tried it with everything and there is no way he leaves the smell of his masters 18 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.240
 cobeÃ±o and radio 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.539
 and there the best of the car 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.050
 who presides over my car 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.610
 sufrer aymond 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.050
 this the best the car 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.389
 clear of the interior 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.289
 he quietly ignored he is falling like 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.080
 step 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.729
 on the other side 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.449
 I cant go up 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.680
 I can not raise the green window check the subidor 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.990
 not there to catch tic 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.219
 as you see behind his death 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.460
 in eighths is also in tatters 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.050
 because there is no way to tell 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.800
 and good lawyers their lyrics hold up pretty well 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.770
 with the simpson 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.160
 but good I do is to see who was this pretty funny car 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.809
 declared 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:23.949
 on legal highway 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.279
 the bumper this one passes all 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.839
 so he meant that tomorrow will be ugly
