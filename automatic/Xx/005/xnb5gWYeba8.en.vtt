is coming out now you know the way it's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.790 
is coming out now you know the way it's
fusing<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.350> contemporary<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.470> if<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.619> were

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
fusing with contemporary but if I were

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.350

to wear anything out on an average day

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
to wear anything out on an average day

would be something from that well from
the<00:02:12.090> actresses<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.680> are<00:02:13.860> many<00:02:14.100> but

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
that I did not like and probably i don't

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.350 
that I did not like and probably i don't
like<00:03:02.920> till<00:03:03.220> today<00:03:03.400> or<00:03:03.610> something<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:04.150> when

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
like till today or something that when

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.750 
like till today or something that when
when<00:03:04.630> men<00:03:04.840> wear<00:03:05.080> bell-bottoms<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:06.100> think<00:03:06.640> it's

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
when men wear bell-bottoms I think it's

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.810 
when men wear bell-bottoms I think it's
just<00:03:06.850> not<00:03:07.720> something<00:03:07.900> for<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.260> man<00:03:08.580> so<00:03:09.580> that

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
just not something for the man so that

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.420 
just not something for the man so that
is<00:03:10.000> something<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.330> did<00:03:10.510> disagree<00:03:10.840> with<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:12.070> I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
is something I did disagree with but I

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.600 
is something I did disagree with but I
think<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:14.320> know<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.710> leather<00:03:14.920> jackets<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
think you know the leather jackets the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.880 
think you know the leather jackets the
cuts<00:03:15.820> for<00:03:16.000> jackets<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.660> shirts<00:03:17.230> at<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.620> time

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
cuts for jackets and shirts at that time

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.020 
cuts for jackets and shirts at that time
did<00:03:18.730> sort<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.240> define<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.870> age<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:21.820> think

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
did sort of define that age and I think

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.660 
did sort of define that age and I think
it<00:03:22.120> has<00:03:22.210> evolved<00:03:22.960> over<00:03:23.080> time<00:03:23.400> there's<00:03:24.400> been<00:03:24.640> a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it has evolved over time there's been a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.070 
it has evolved over time there's been a
clear<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.510> know<00:03:25.630> there's<00:03:25.840> clear

like a meet and greet I I feel it's a

importance<00:04:22.420> but<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.170> think<00:04:23.440> what<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.860> at<00:04:24.100> the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
importance but I think what it is at the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.840 
importance but I think what it is at the
core<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.120> actually<00:04:26.050> just<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:27.010> would<00:04:27.670> say

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
core of it is actually just I would say

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.610

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
with people here in that time it's an

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.730 
with people here in that time it's an
