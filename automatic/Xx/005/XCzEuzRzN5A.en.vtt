northshore nails I am playing some TDM

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.430 
northshore nails I am playing some TDM
with<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.259> spares<00:00:13.730> and<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:15.570> gameplay<00:00:15.809> kind

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
with the spares and this gameplay kind

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
with the spares and this gameplay kind
of<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.220> jumped<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.880> before<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.449> recorded

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
of I just jumped in before and recorded

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560 
of I just jumped in before and recorded
it's<00:00:19.140> nothing<00:00:19.470> spectacular<00:00:19.970> but<00:00:20.970> i<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.359> like

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
it's nothing spectacular but i do like

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.240 
it's nothing spectacular but i do like
using<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.960> spares<00:00:22.170> i<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.380> prefer<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.010> over<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
using the spares i do prefer it over the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.519 
using the spares i do prefer it over the
870<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> think<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.900> finds<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.350> bit

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
870 I think it's it finds a little bit

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
870 I think it's it finds a little bit
faster<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> does<00:00:26.849> less<00:00:27.029> damage<00:00:27.060> but

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
faster I think it does less damage but

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.240 
faster I think it does less damage but
at<00:00:27.960> close<00:00:28.260> range<00:00:28.529> you're<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
at close range you're not going to I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.259 
at close range you're not going to I
don't<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.490> you'll<00:00:29.670> notice<00:00:29.910> too<00:00:30.029> much<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
don't think you'll notice too much of a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.550 
don't think you'll notice too much of a
difference<00:00:30.539> i<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.289> better

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
difference i think it's the better

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
difference i think it's the better
choice<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> two<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.870> yeah<00:00:33.960> i<00:00:33.989> wanted

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
choice out of the two but yeah i wanted

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.299 
choice out of the two but yeah i wanted
to<00:00:34.290> talk<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.440> little<00:00:34.620> bit<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:34.920> better<00:00:35.160> feel

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to talk a little bit about better feel

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.670 
to talk a little bit about better feel
for<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.420> i<00:00:36.510> wanted<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.899> talk<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.500> bit

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
for and i wanted to talk a little bit

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.950 
for and i wanted to talk a little bit
about<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.489> think<00:00:39.090> needs<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.690> changed

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
about what I think needs to be changed

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
about what I think needs to be changed
from<00:00:40.320> battlefield<00:00:40.739> 3<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.219> make<00:00:41.370> better<00:00:41.550> food

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
from battlefield 3 to make better food

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.729 
from battlefield 3 to make better food
for<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.270> better<00:00:42.570> game<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.000> think

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
for a better game so first off I think

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.529 
for a better game so first off I think
battlefield<00:00:46.739> 4<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.950> set<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.879> modern<00:00:48.420> day

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
battlefield 4 is set in the modern day

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.940 
battlefield 4 is set in the modern day
they've<00:00:48.989> already<00:00:49.200> said<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
they've already said that it's going to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
they've already said that it's going to
be<00:00:50.039> set<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> similar<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.600> similar

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
be set in the similar in a similar

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.979 
be set in the similar in a similar
setting<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> battlefield<00:00:53.070> 3<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> whether<00:00:54.840> or

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
setting to battlefield 3 so whether or

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.720 
setting to battlefield 3 so whether or
not<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.800> Russians<00:00:56.190> again<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
not it's you know Russians again I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.360 
not it's you know Russians again I
probably<00:00:57.719> doubt<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.170> imagine<00:00:58.559> them<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:59.190> might

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
probably doubt I imagine them they might

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
probably doubt I imagine them they might
go<00:00:59.609> China<00:01:00.359> possibly<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:02.039> waiver<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.619> yes<00:01:04.619> so

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
go China possibly but waiver and yes so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070 
go China possibly but waiver and yes so
better<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.700> 3<00:01:05.880> better<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.780> set<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
better for 3 better for will be set in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.130 
better for 3 better for will be set in
the<00:01:07.170> modern<00:01:07.409> day<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> I've<00:01:08.790> said<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.390> it's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
the modern day and I've said that it's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
the modern day and I've said that it's
gonna<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.710> implement<00:01:11.130> battle<00:01:11.340> recorder

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
gonna you know implement battle recorder

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
gonna you know implement battle recorder
and<00:01:11.939> spectate<00:01:12.390> mode<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> body<00:01:13.049> said<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and spectate mode and the body said that

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.390 
and spectate mode and the body said that
these<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.710> things<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
these are things that they want to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.630 
these are things that they want to
introduce<00:01:14.670> into<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> game<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
introduce into the game and I think that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.609 
introduce into the game and I think that
is<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> huge<00:01:18.240> huge<00:01:18.689> issue<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.110> battlefield<00:01:19.560> 3

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
is a huge huge issue in battlefield 3

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.149 
is a huge huge issue in battlefield 3
the<00:01:20.340> fact<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.640> there's<00:01:20.820> no<00:01:20.939> spectate<00:01:21.360> mode

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
the fact that there's no spectate mode

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.590 
the fact that there's no spectate mode
makes<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.400> massive<00:01:23.700> difference<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.330> amount<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
makes a massive difference the amount of

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.710 
makes a massive difference the amount of
hackers<00:01:24.960> who<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.950> servers<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> jump

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
hackers who are in servers if you jump

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.590 
hackers who are in servers if you jump
into<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> server<00:01:28.140> nowadays<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.650> PC<00:01:28.950> anyway

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
into a server nowadays on PC anyway

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.060 
into a server nowadays on PC anyway
every<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.650> three

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
every you know one in one in three

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.520 
every you know one in one in three
servers<00:01:32.430> there's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.060> hacker<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
servers there's a hacker on and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.020 
servers there's a hacker on and
sometimes<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.100> even<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.579> worse<00:01:35.850> than

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
sometimes it's even you know worse than

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
sometimes it's even you know worse than
that<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.470> yeah<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.520> bad<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that so yeah it's it's pretty bad at the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
that so yeah it's it's pretty bad at the
moment<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:39.329> spectate<00:01:39.720> mode<00:01:39.900> would<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
moment I think spectate mode would do a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.469 
moment I think spectate mode would do a
pretty<00:01:40.560> good<00:01:40.650> job<00:01:40.770> at<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.430> getting<00:01:42.150> rid<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
pretty good job at just getting rid of a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.149 
pretty good job at just getting rid of a
whole<00:01:42.659> bunch<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.020> them<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> lot<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
whole bunch of them because a lot of the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.850 
whole bunch of them because a lot of the
times<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.450> super<00:01:46.020> hard<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.380> catch<00:01:46.560> them

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
times it's just super hard to catch them

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.139 
times it's just super hard to catch them
they<00:01:47.189> run<00:01:47.430> hacks<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.860> basically

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
they run hacks that just basically

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
they run hacks that just basically

something<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.719> need<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.590> definitely

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
something here that I need it definitely

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.219 
something here that I need it definitely
needs<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.280> changed<00:01:59.780> something<00:02:00.780> else<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
needs to be changed something else I

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.870 
needs to be changed something else I
think<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.619> needs<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.009> put<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.729> his

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
think that needs to be put in his

think that needs to be put in his
obviously<00:02:03.390> battle<00:02:03.540> recorder<00:02:04.049> better

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
obviously battle recorder better

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.150 
obviously battle recorder better
recorder<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.420> something<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:07.079> would<00:02:07.920> make<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
recorder is something that would make a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400 
recorder is something that would make a
massive<00:02:08.700> difference<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.959> quality<00:02:09.989> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
massive difference to the quality of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.740 
massive difference to the quality of
videos<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
videos and and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.780 
videos and and
and<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.770> really<00:02:13.950> want<00:02:14.220> better<00:02:14.370> reporter

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and I just really want better reporter

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.960 
and I just really want better reporter
it's<00:02:15.920> yeah<00:02:16.920> unfortunately<00:02:17.580> they<00:02:17.670> don't<00:02:17.760> have

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
it's yeah unfortunately they don't have

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.340 
it's yeah unfortunately they don't have
it<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.120> bf3<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.870> think<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.080> would<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.290> an

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
it in bf3 and I think it would be an

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.350 
it in bf3 and I think it would be an
awesome<00:02:19.440> BF<00:02:19.860> 3<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:20.760> they<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:21.000> said<00:02:21.240> that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
awesome BF 3 but they have said that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.150 
awesome BF 3 but they have said that
they<00:02:21.480> want<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> put<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:21.990> bf4<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.770> fingers

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
they want to put it in bf4 so fingers

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.990 
they want to put it in bf4 so fingers
crossed<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.460> they<00:02:23.640> will<00:02:23.850> add<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.830> and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
crossed that they will add that in and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.860 
crossed that they will add that in and
there's<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.060> couple<00:02:27.180> other<00:02:27.360> things<00:02:27.510> like

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
there's a couple other things like

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.370 
there's a couple other things like
suppression<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.620> think<00:02:28.800> suppression<00:02:29.280> maquette

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
suppression I think suppression maquette

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.140 
suppression I think suppression maquette
suppression<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.500> an<00:02:31.590> idea<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.040> good<00:02:32.250> but<00:02:32.760> in

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
suppression is an idea is good but in

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.330 
suppression is an idea is good but in
battlefield<00:02:33.660> 3<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:34.200> my<00:02:34.709> opinion<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.190> doesn't

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
battlefield 3 in my opinion it doesn't

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.910 
battlefield 3 in my opinion it doesn't
work<00:02:35.580> very<00:02:35.610> well<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.990> fact<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.530> affects

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
work very well the fact that it affects

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.910 
work very well the fact that it affects
your<00:02:38.160> guns<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:40.050> know<00:02:40.140> you're<00:02:40.350> actually<00:02:40.530> your

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
your guns you know you're actually your

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.090 
your guns you know you're actually your
gun<00:02:41.160> shoots<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.240> not<00:02:42.390> aiming<00:02:43.100> makes

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
gun shoots we are not aiming makes

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.490 
gun shoots we are not aiming makes
absolutely<00:02:44.580> no<00:02:44.670> sense<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.209> me<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.630> think<00:02:46.380> that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
absolutely no sense to me I think that

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.140 
absolutely no sense to me I think that
if<00:02:46.770> they<00:02:47.160> changed<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.760> battlefield

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
if they changed it in battlefield

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.210 
if they changed it in battlefield
forward<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.230> visual<00:02:49.830> thing<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
forward to just be a visual thing and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.680 
forward to just be a visual thing and
not<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.730> affect<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.209> mechanics<00:02:51.600> of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
not you know affect the mechanics of

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.560 
not you know affect the mechanics of
your<00:02:51.870> weapon<00:02:52.020> then<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:53.100> would<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.820> thousand

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
your weapon then it would be a thousand

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.020 
your weapon then it would be a thousand
times<00:02:54.690> better<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.310> would<00:02:56.489> like<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.670> see<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
times better so I would like to see that

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.370 
times better so I would like to see that
changed<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.260> also<00:02:59.100> weapons<00:02:59.580> wise<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:01.200> thing

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
changed and also weapons wise the thing

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.680 
changed and also weapons wise the thing
about<00:03:01.410> battlefield<00:03:01.860> 3<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:03.209> are<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.450> few

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
about battlefield 3 is there are a few

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.630 
about battlefield 3 is there are a few
whip<00:03:03.840> instead<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.350> best<00:03:04.530> weapons<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
whip instead of the best weapons and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.360 
whip instead of the best weapons and
this<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> bad<00:03:06.180> thing<00:03:06.209> because<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:07.830> lot<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
this is a bad thing because a lot of the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.979 
this is a bad thing because a lot of the
weapons<00:03:08.640> don't<00:03:08.760> get<00:03:08.940> used<00:03:09.150> because<00:03:09.480> they're

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
weapons don't get used because they're

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.960 
weapons don't get used because they're
not<00:03:10.110> as<00:03:10.260> good<00:03:10.290> as<00:03:10.560> others<00:03:10.830> for<00:03:11.340> example<00:03:11.370> jump

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
not as good as others for example jump

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.910 
not as good as others for example jump

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.680 
was balanced but everything felt like it
was<00:03:37.920> different<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.269> battlefield<00:03:39.660> 3

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
was different and in battlefield 3

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.780 
was different and in battlefield 3
unfortunately<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:41.130> almost<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:41.610> there's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
unfortunately it's almost like there's

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.729 
unfortunately it's almost like there's
this<00:03:41.910> base<00:03:42.150> design<00:03:42.630> for<00:03:42.840> assault<00:03:43.110> rifles<00:03:43.470> and

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
this base design for assault rifles and

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.940 
this base design for assault rifles and
then<00:03:44.280> what<00:03:44.700> what<00:03:44.970> they<00:03:45.060> do<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.420> they<00:03:46.410> just<00:03:46.709> add

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
then what what they do is they just add

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.420 
then what what they do is they just add
these<00:03:47.250> little<00:03:47.700> changes<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:49.470> make<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
these little changes to it to make the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.190 
these little changes to it to make the
gun<00:03:50.610> slightly<00:03:51.030> different<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:51.720> still<00:03:52.049> very

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
gun slightly different but still very

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.660 
gun slightly different but still very
similar<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:55.019> hope<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.950> they<00:03:56.130> address

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
similar and I hope that they address

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.610 
similar and I hope that they address
this<00:03:56.850> issue<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:57.390> battlefield<00:03:57.959> 4<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.260> try<00:03:58.470> and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
this issue in battlefield 4 and try and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.590 
this issue in battlefield 4 and try and
balance<00:03:59.519> out<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.850> weapons<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.299> little<00:04:00.510> bit

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
balance out the weapons a little bit

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.300 
balance out the weapons a little bit
more<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.930> also<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.769> don't<00:04:02.070> know<00:04:02.160> what

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
more and also I I don't know what

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.740 
more and also I I don't know what
they're<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.579> do<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.940> terms<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.540> adding

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
they're going to do in terms of adding

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
they're going to do in terms of adding
weapons<00:04:04.200> because<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> feels<00:04:04.709> like<00:04:04.950> they<00:04:05.130> have

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
weapons because it feels like they have

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.250 
weapons because it feels like they have
a<00:04:05.519> shit<00:04:06.000> ton<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.209> weapons<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.840> battlefield<00:04:07.200> 3

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
a shit ton of weapons in battlefield 3

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.060 
a shit ton of weapons in battlefield 3
and<00:04:07.760> there's<00:04:08.760> not<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.209> huge<00:04:09.690> amount<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:10.350> guns

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
and there's not a huge amount of guns

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.180 
and there's not a huge amount of guns
they<00:04:11.250> can<00:04:11.400> add<00:04:11.549> in<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.540> mean<00:04:13.410> there<00:04:13.709> are<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:13.860> few

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
they can add in I mean there are a few

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.770 
they can add in I mean there are a few
but<00:04:15.500> overall<00:04:16.500> we've<00:04:17.250> pretty<00:04:17.640> much<00:04:17.729> got<00:04:17.940> all

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
but overall we've pretty much got all

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.060 
but overall we've pretty much got all
the<00:04:19.169> main<00:04:19.380> military<00:04:19.739> weapons

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070

absolutely<00:04:40.540> no<00:04:40.750> support<00:04:41.100> competitive<00:04:42.100> games

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
absolutely no support competitive games

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.600 
absolutely no support competitive games
wise<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.530> really<00:04:44.980> really<00:04:45.070> does<00:04:45.430> need

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
wise and it really really does need

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.090 
wise and it really really does need
something<00:04:46.000> like<00:04:46.540> spectate<00:04:47.080> or<00:04:47.290> similar<00:04:47.890> to

something like spectate or similar to
call<00:04:48.760> judy's<00:04:49.060> cod<00:04:49.270> caster<00:04:49.720> which<00:04:49.900> is<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.110> think

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
call judy's cod caster which is I think

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.160 
call judy's cod caster which is I think
fucking<00:04:51.010> amazing<00:04:51.070> i<00:04:51.610> think<00:04:51.790> podcaster<00:04:52.540> is<00:04:52.630> one

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
fucking amazing i think podcaster is one

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.630 
fucking amazing i think podcaster is one
of<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.350> best<00:04:53.530> things<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:53.890> call<00:04:54.280> duty<00:04:54.460> is

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
of the best things that call duty is

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.040 
of the best things that call duty is
done<00:04:54.900> and<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:57.790> I<00:04:58.180> think<00:04:58.510> for<00:04:58.630> better<00:04:58.780> fit<00:04:58.960> for

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
done and it I think for better fit for

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.470 
done and it I think for better fit for
to<00:04:59.410> push<00:04:59.650> into<00:04:59.860> that<00:05:00.100> top<00:05:00.460> level<00:05:00.880> competitive

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
to push into that top level competitive

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.250 
to push into that top level competitive
shooter<00:05:01.840> area<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.680> needs<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:03.250> definitely

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
shooter area it needs to definitely

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.540 
shooter area it needs to definitely
supply<00:05:05.260> some<00:05:05.560> tools<00:05:05.770> for<00:05:06.070> people<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.400> be<00:05:06.430> able
