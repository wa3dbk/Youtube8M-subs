very impressed with the amplifier and
wanted<00:00:27.870> to<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.110> a<00:00:28.290> custom<00:00:28.740> version<00:00:29.930> because<00:00:30.930> he

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
wanted to do a custom version because he

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.470 
wanted to do a custom version because he
was<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.380> impressed<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> engineers<00:00:32.970> flew

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
was so impressed so the engineers flew

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.189 
was so impressed so the engineers flew
to<00:00:33.660> his<00:00:33.809> hopes<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:35.570> took<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
process of making the custom changes

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.590 
process of making the custom changes
that<00:00:40.440> he<00:00:40.620> was<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:40.980> interested<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.480> they

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that he was really interested in so they

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.040 
that he was really interested in so they
spent<00:00:42.900> many<00:00:43.110> days<00:00:43.260> doing<00:00:44.159> this<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.180> hence

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
spent many days doing this and hence

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.810 
spent many days doing this and hence
this<00:00:46.290> tone<00:00:46.589> capture<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.159> born<00:00:47.400> and<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.699> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this tone capture was born and if you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.469 
this tone capture was born and if you
see<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.989> wall<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.519> simply<00:00:50.760> attach

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
see on the wall here you simply attach

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.829 
see on the wall here you simply attach
it<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.140> either<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.650> 60<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.729> the<00:00:53.909> 80<00:00:54.420> watt

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
it to either the 60 or the 80 watt

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.990 
it to either the 60 or the 80 watt
version<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.559> you'll<00:00:55.769> get<00:00:55.979> exactly<00:00:56.220> it

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
version and you'll get exactly it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.710 
version and you'll get exactly it
reverses<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.620> his<00:00:58.800> personal

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
reverses the out to his personal

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.149 
reverses the out to his personal
specification<00:01:00.720> so<00:01:00.960> simply<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.010> going

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
to give you some comparison this is the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.270 
to give you some comparison this is the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
one with Aang the capsule and it's very

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.730 
one with Aang the capsule and it's very
nice<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.240> go

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
nice so here we go

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:27.950 
nice so here we go
nice<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.950> lean<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> crunch<00:01:26.960> very

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
nice and lean and be of crunch very

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.980 
nice and lean and be of crunch very
responsive<00:01:28.619> feeling<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.539> I'm<00:01:30.539> going<00:01:30.899> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
responsive feeling to that I'm going to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.349 
responsive feeling to that I'm going to
go<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.109> the<00:01:31.350> tone<00:01:31.950> capsule<00:01:32.460> one<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> in

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
go to the tone capsule one this is in

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.840 
go to the tone capsule one this is in
the<00:01:33.479> 80<00:01:33.659> watt<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:35.070> first<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.700> bit

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the 80 watt here get first a little bit

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:46.690 
the 80 watt here get first a little bit
of<00:01:35.909> clean<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.509> comparison

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.670 

and<00:01:47.390> then<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.630> more<00:01:47.780> famous<00:01:48.050> turn<00:01:48.440> which<00:01:48.650> is

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
and then the more famous turn which is

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:59.500 
and then the more famous turn which is
his<00:01:48.920> Drive<00:01:49.159> Channel

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.640 

now<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.570> other<00:02:00.810> thing<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.440> apps

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
now the other thing is with these apps

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.580 
now the other thing is with these apps
you<00:02:01.800> can<00:02:02.070> use<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.910> dual<00:02:03.150> tone<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.230> that<00:02:04.380> means

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you can use the dual tone so that means

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.770 
you can use the dual tone so that means
that<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.100> clean<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> drive<00:02:06.060> together

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that the clean and the drive together

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389 
that the clean and the drive together
and<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.320> sounds<00:02:07.620> very<00:02:07.680> nice<00:02:07.980> you<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and that sounds very nice you get a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:24.020 
and that sounds very nice you get a
little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.729> more<00:02:08.970> attack<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.920> finally<00:02:23.370> you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
little bit more attack and finally you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.760 
little bit more attack and finally you
know<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.300> really<00:02:24.450> takes<00:02:24.810> pedals<00:02:25.290> very<00:02:25.530> well

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
know it really takes pedals very well

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.910 
know it really takes pedals very well
I've<00:02:26.250> got<00:02:26.520> some<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.880> new<00:02:27.080> boss<00:02:28.080> wise<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
I've got some of the new boss wise and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.520 
I've got some of the new boss wise and
craft<00:02:29.130> pedals<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.810> Blues<00:02:31.020> driver<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
craft pedals the the Blues driver and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.560 
craft pedals the the Blues driver and
the<00:02:31.590> super<00:02:31.830> overdrive<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.910> example<00:02:33.330> here's

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
the super overdrive for example here's

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.310 
the super overdrive for example here's
the<00:02:33.780> clean<00:02:33.960> time<00:02:34.640> with<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> British<00:02:35.970> driver

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.510 

super<00:02:43.320> overdrive<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.250> even<00:02:47.370> use

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
super overdrive and you can even use

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.809 
super overdrive and you can even use
them<00:02:47.640> together<00:02:47.820> works<00:02:48.240> well

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.729 

so<00:02:54.819> we're<00:02:54.939> together<00:02:55.060> real<00:02:55.659> expressive<00:02:56.409> arm

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
so we're together real expressive arm

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.469 
so we're together real expressive arm
feels<00:02:57.370> good<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.730> play<00:02:58.140> that's<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.290> really
