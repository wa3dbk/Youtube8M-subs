unfortunately<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.330> old<00:00:06.480> door<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.839> a

unfortunately the old door is a

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.020 
unfortunately the old door is a
non-standard<00:00:07.410> height<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:08.490> had<00:00:08.639> carpenter

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
non-standard height so we had carpenter

non-standard height so we had carpenter
Andy<00:00:09.360> angle<00:00:09.660> cut<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.960> down<00:00:10.139> let's<00:00:10.769> see<00:00:10.889> how<00:00:10.980> we

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
Andy angle cut it down let's see how we

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.029 
Andy angle cut it down let's see how we

generally<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:26.039> easier<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> cut<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> door<00:00:26.939> from

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
generally it's easier to cut a door from

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.029 
generally it's easier to cut a door from
the<00:00:27.180> top<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.080> won't<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> remove<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the top as you won't have to remove the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.460 
the top as you won't have to remove the
weatherstrip<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.480> case<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:31.170> need<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
weatherstrip but in this case we need to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
weatherstrip but in this case we need to
remove<00:00:31.710> about<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> half<00:00:32.550> inches<00:00:32.960> more

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
remove about one and a half inches more

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.750 
remove about one and a half inches more
than<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.320> safely<00:00:34.800> removed<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> top

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
than can be safely removed from the top

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.410 
than can be safely removed from the top
so<00:00:36.570> we're<00:00:36.719> cutting<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.079> bottom<00:00:38.300> take<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so we're cutting the bottom take the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
so we're cutting the bottom take the
door<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.780> its<00:00:39.989> frame<00:00:40.170> by<00:00:40.800> removing<00:00:41.250> any

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
hinge pins place the door on a surface

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
hinge pins place the door on a surface
that<00:00:46.200> won't<00:00:46.530> scratch<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> exterior<00:00:48.329> of

then cut the jams to length the next

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.620 
then cut the jams to length the next
step<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.310> notch<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.520> jamb<00:02:37.970> legs<00:02:38.210> to
