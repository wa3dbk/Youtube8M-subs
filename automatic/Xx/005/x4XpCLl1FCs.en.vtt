mystery to this Phoenix corporation but

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.669 
mystery to this Phoenix corporation but
the<00:02:00.700> build-up<00:02:01.030> isn't<00:02:01.509> as<00:02:01.630> good<00:02:01.899> thus<00:02:02.140> far<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:02.649> I

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
the build-up isn't as good thus far so I

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.550 
the build-up isn't as good thus far so I
don't<00:02:02.979> quite<00:02:03.189> really<00:02:03.579> care<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:05.079> also<00:02:05.259> learned

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
don't quite really care we also learned

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.499 
don't quite really care we also learned
that<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.829> mysterious<00:02:06.369> man's<00:02:06.640> name<00:02:06.939> is<00:02:07.149> John

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
that the mysterious man's name is John

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.389 
that the mysterious man's name is John
now<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.289> guy<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.619> bit<00:02:08.829> more<00:02:08.979> interesting

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
now this guy is a bit more interesting

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.069 
now this guy is a bit more interesting
to<00:02:09.519> me<00:02:09.640> he<00:02:10.060> says<00:02:10.299> that<00:02:10.539> he<00:02:10.630> is<00:02:10.660> one<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
to me he says that he is one of the

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.080 
to me he says that he is one of the
students<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.709> Jean<00:02:11.920> Grey<00:02:11.950> school<00:02:12.190> it's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
students of the Jean Grey school it's

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.479 
students of the Jean Grey school it's
not<00:02:13.269> choir<00:02:13.630> it's<00:02:14.019> not<00:02:14.200> Evan<00:02:14.680> none<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
not choir it's not Evan none of the

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.100 
not choir it's not Evan none of the
other<00:02:15.610> students<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.150> much<00:02:16.360> face<00:02:16.660> time<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.079> I

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
other students have much face time so I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.050 
other students have much face time so I
honestly<00:02:17.349> can't<00:02:17.829> figure<00:02:18.040> out<00:02:18.130> who<00:02:18.430> he<00:02:18.700> can<00:02:18.880> be

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
honestly can't figure out who he can be

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.319 
honestly can't figure out who he can be
maybe<00:02:20.019> he's<00:02:20.380> rock<00:02:20.980> slide<00:02:21.340> from<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> future<00:02:22.090> in

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
maybe he's rock slide from the future in

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.410 
maybe he's rock slide from the future in
his<00:02:22.540> human<00:02:22.989> form<00:02:23.170> that's<00:02:24.010> my<00:02:24.190> best<00:02:24.370> guess<00:02:24.489> this

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
his human form that's my best guess this

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.270 
his human form that's my best guess this
issue<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.079> last<00:02:26.319> one<00:02:26.530> it's<00:02:27.160> just

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
issue is like the last one it's just

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.729 
issue is like the last one it's just
mediocre<00:02:27.760> at<00:02:28.060> best<00:02:28.090> all<00:02:28.959> I'm<00:02:29.200> waiting<00:02:29.349> for<00:02:29.530> is

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
mediocre at best all I'm waiting for is

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.770 
mediocre at best all I'm waiting for is
a<00:02:29.769> moment<00:02:30.130> where<00:02:30.250> Evan<00:02:30.640> goes<00:02:30.849> Darth<00:02:31.239> Vader<00:02:31.599> and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
a moment where Evan goes Darth Vader and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.080 
a moment where Evan goes Darth Vader and
starts<00:02:32.079> beating<00:02:32.379> on<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.709> good<00:02:32.920> guys<00:02:33.129> but<00:02:33.400> my

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
starts beating on the good guys but my

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.880 
starts beating on the good guys but my
