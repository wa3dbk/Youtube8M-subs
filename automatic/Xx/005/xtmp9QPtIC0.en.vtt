00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.330 
its way 2,500 pounds that have 10,000
horsepower<00:05:47.810> but<00:05:48.590> we<00:05:48.830> think<00:05:49.040> that<00:05:49.160> we've

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
horsepower but we think that we've

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.120 
horsepower but we think that we've
pretty<00:05:49.580> much<00:05:49.670> nailed<00:05:50.420> it<00:05:50.630> and<00:05:50.840> it<00:05:51.740> doesn't

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
pretty much nailed it and it doesn't

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.000 
pretty much nailed it and it doesn't
matter<00:05:52.310> what<00:05:52.610> age<00:05:52.820> they're<00:05:53.660> lovin<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:54.140> what<00:05:54.920> do

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.200 
matter what age they're lovin it what do
you<00:05:55.130> think<00:05:55.370> is<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.520> biggest<00:05:55.700> difference
