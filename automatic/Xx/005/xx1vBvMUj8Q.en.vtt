because there's no ventilation and they

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.749 
because there's no ventilation and they
can<00:00:11.759> actually<00:00:11.910> rot<00:00:12.360> even<00:00:12.840> more<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.889> specially

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759

that<00:00:16.440> require<00:00:16.949> more<00:00:17.279> moisture<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.910> designed

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
that require more moisture I designed

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.840 
that require more moisture I designed
something<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.010> like<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.279> call<00:00:20.609> the

too<00:01:10.260> thick<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.950> found<00:01:11.220> something<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.119> think

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
too thick and I found something I think

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.520 
too thick and I found something I think
this<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> sheet

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
this was a sheet

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.850 
this was a sheet
I'm<00:01:13.590> not<00:01:14.310> sure<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.939> anyway<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.409> too<00:01:16.619> big

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
I'm not sure but anyway it's not too big

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
I'm not sure but anyway it's not too big
unfortunately<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> could<00:01:18.000> look<00:01:18.150> better<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
unfortunately it could look better if it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140 
unfortunately it could look better if it
was<00:01:19.320> bigger<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
was bigger but it will do for now so

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.490 
was bigger but it will do for now so
what<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
what you want to do with this now is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
what you want to do with this now is
actually<00:01:22.860> soak<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> water<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> try<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
actually soak it in water and try to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
actually soak it in water and try to
remove<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> excess<00:01:25.560> water<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> doesn't

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
remove the excess water so it doesn't

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.249 
remove the excess water so it doesn't
actually<00:01:26.700> drip<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.450> I'll<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
actually drip so I'll go do that and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.700 
actually drip so I'll go do that and
I'll<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.799> back<00:01:29.540> okay<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.930> soaked<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.350> cloth

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
I'll come back okay so I soaked my cloth

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
I'll come back okay so I soaked my cloth
and<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.369> actually<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.930> on

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and here is actually how you put it on

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.710

the tent open so that ventilation can

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.999 
the tent open so that ventilation can
occur<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.509> also<00:01:42.509> because<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.470> sheet<00:01:43.829> is

white<00:01:44.490> some<00:01:45.149> light<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.590> able<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.220> pass

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
white some light will be able to pass

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.399 
white some light will be able to pass
through<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.329> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.259> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
through but you do want to have one of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.859 
through but you do want to have one of
the<00:01:49.530> sides<00:01:49.770> open<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.850> light<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.689> come

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the sides open so that light can come

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
the sides open so that light can come
through<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.890> orchid<00:01:53.280> will<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.610> light

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
through and your orchid will have light

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.420 
through and your orchid will have light
as<00:01:54.180> much<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.659> ventilation<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:56.040> side<00:01:56.250> will

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
as much as ventilation so this side will

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.260 
as much as ventilation so this side will
actually<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:57.710> facing<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:59.070> light<00:01:59.340> source<00:01:59.640> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
actually be facing your light source so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.940 
actually be facing your light source so
that<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> orchid<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.350> has<00:02:01.530> some<00:02:01.740> light

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that the orchid actually has some light

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.770 
that the orchid actually has some light
now<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> course<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.090> told<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> didn't

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
now of course as I told you I didn't

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.300 
now of course as I told you I didn't
find<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.079> bigger<00:02:04.259> class<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.159> actually

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
find a bigger class so I can actually

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.809 
find a bigger class so I can actually
cover<00:02:06.060> all<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.689> sides<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> can

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
cover all the sides but I think you can

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.230 
cover all the sides but I think you can
get<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.209> gist<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> just

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
get the gist of it I just

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.540 
get the gist of it I just
I wanted<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.110> show<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.500> idea<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.250> can

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
I wanted to show you the idea you can

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.480 
I wanted to show you the idea you can
make<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.940> much<00:02:13.450> much<00:02:13.690> better<00:02:13.960> than<00:02:14.320> me<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:14.860> you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
make it much much better than me so you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.480 
make it much much better than me so you
can<00:02:15.940> place<00:02:16.480> your<00:02:16.510> kit<00:02:17.080> inside<00:02:17.410> make<00:02:18.040> sure<00:02:18.280> that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
can place your kit inside make sure that

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.350 
can place your kit inside make sure that
the<00:02:18.700> actual<00:02:18.970> leaves<00:02:19.270> don't<00:02:19.720> touch<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.800> wet

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
the actual leaves don't touch the wet

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.790 
the actual leaves don't touch the wet
material<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.570> also<00:02:22.840> if<00:02:23.140> you're<00:02:23.320> doing<00:02:23.350> this

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
material and also if you're doing this

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.430 
material and also if you're doing this
on<00:02:23.980> wooden<00:02:24.700> furniture<00:02:25.270> it's<00:02:25.840> not<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.110> good<00:02:26.380> idea

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
on wooden furniture it's not a good idea

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.440 
on wooden furniture it's not a good idea
try<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.040> place<00:02:27.340> everything<00:02:27.820> in<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> tray

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
try to place everything in a tray

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.270 
try to place everything in a tray
because<00:02:29.080> these<00:02:29.320> sides<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.920> will<00:02:30.070> actually

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
because these sides that will actually

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.850 
because these sides that will actually
touch<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.390> surface<00:02:31.600> you're<00:02:31.960> on<00:02:32.110> they're

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
touch the surface you're on they're

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.820 
touch the surface you're on they're
really<00:02:33.160> wet<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.750> my<00:02:34.900> actually<00:02:35.320> if<00:02:35.560> it's

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
really wet so it's my actually if it's

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.310 
really wet so it's my actually if it's
wood<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.430> can<00:02:36.700> ruin<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:37.420> maybe<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.170> can

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
wood it can ruin it so maybe you can

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.620 
wood it can ruin it so maybe you can
find<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.650> sort<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.070> tray<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.090> course<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.480> can

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
find a sort of a tray of course you can

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.260 
find a sort of a tray of course you can
do<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.930> tent<00:02:41.230> smaller<00:02:41.710> or<00:02:42.100> bigger<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:43.090> can

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
do this tent smaller or bigger you can

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.420 
do this tent smaller or bigger you can
actually<00:02:43.390> adjust<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.050> size<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.010> told<00:02:45.250> you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
actually adjust the size as I told you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.130 
actually adjust the size as I told you
if<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.850> have<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> better<00:02:46.210> cost<00:02:46.570> than<00:02:46.780> meat<00:02:46.960> it

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
if you have a better cost than meat it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.530 
if you have a better cost than meat it
could<00:02:47.290> actually<00:02:47.410> work<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.010> okay<00:02:48.850> let's<00:02:49.210> test

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
could actually work so okay let's test

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.070 
could actually work so okay let's test
it<00:02:49.810> out<00:02:49.990> all<00:02:50.590> right<00:02:50.710> now<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:51.220> 55<00:02:52.150> percent

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
it out all right now I have 55 percent

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.770 
it out all right now I have 55 percent
relative<00:02:53.470> humidity<00:02:54.130> in<00:02:54.340> my<00:02:54.640> balcony<00:02:54.940> just

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
relative humidity in my balcony just

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.440 
relative humidity in my balcony just
going<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.050> leave<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.740> guy<00:02:56.950> here<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.490> see<00:02:58.120> how

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
going to leave this guy here and see how

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.280 
going to leave this guy here and see how
much<00:02:58.810> humidity<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.920> come<00:03:00.130> up<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:01.290> using

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
much humidity I can come up with using

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.180 
much humidity I can come up with using
the<00:03:02.590> tent<00:03:03.510> okay<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.570> about<00:03:04.810> five<00:03:05.320> minutes<00:03:05.860> have

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
the tent okay so about five minutes have

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.030 
the tent okay so about five minutes have
passed<00:03:06.520> actually<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:08.530> are<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.890> results

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
passed actually and here are the results

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.480 
passed actually and here are the results
humidity<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.320> 67%<00:03:11.320> I<00:03:11.440> would<00:03:11.800> say<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.250> is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
humidity is 67% I would say this is

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.330 
humidity is 67% I would say this is
better<00:03:12.610> than<00:03:12.940> any<00:03:13.240> humidity<00:03:13.630> tray<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.560> has<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
better than any humidity tray and has a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.030 
better than any humidity tray and has a
lot<00:03:15.550> of<00:03:15.580> benefits<00:03:16.210> benefits<00:03:16.600> now<00:03:17.170> as<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:17.920> can

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
lot of benefits benefits now as you can

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.130 
lot of benefits benefits now as you can
see<00:03:18.100> my<00:03:18.520> temperature<00:03:19.210> is<00:03:19.330> really<00:03:19.660> really<00:03:19.990> low

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
see my temperature is really really low

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.680 
see my temperature is really really low
is<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.740> dead<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.100> winter<00:03:21.130> it's<00:03:21.730> blizzarding

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
is the dead of winter it's blizzarding

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.110 
is the dead of winter it's blizzarding
outside<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.740> wouldn't<00:03:24.430> do<00:03:24.550> this<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.940> these

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
outside I wouldn't do this in these

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.820 
outside I wouldn't do this in these
temperatures<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.110> keep<00:03:26.290> your<00:03:26.440> orchid<00:03:26.740> in

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
temperatures if you keep your orchid in

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.190 
temperatures if you keep your orchid in
the<00:03:26.950> house<00:03:27.130> then<00:03:27.850> yeah<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.420> okay<00:03:28.780> if<00:03:29.020> it's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
the house then yeah it's okay if it's

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.560 
the house then yeah it's okay if it's
summer<00:03:29.440> again<00:03:29.770> it's<00:03:30.280> okay<00:03:30.610> but<00:03:31.060> if<00:03:31.150> you're<00:03:31.450> in

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
summer again it's okay but if you're in

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.480 
summer again it's okay but if you're in
very<00:03:31.810> low<00:03:32.020> conditions<00:03:32.590> fifty<00:03:33.250> percent

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
very low conditions fifty percent

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.910 
very low conditions fifty percent
humidity<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:34.150> all<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.960> need<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.380> wouldn't

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
humidity is all that you need I wouldn't

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.650 
humidity is all that you need I wouldn't
go<00:03:35.980> any<00:03:36.190> higher<00:03:36.280> than<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.790> but<00:03:37.090> anyway<00:03:37.480> I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
go any higher than this but anyway I

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.420 
go any higher than this but anyway I
hope<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.960> got<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.260> idea<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:39.040> thing<00:03:39.100> was

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
hope you got the idea this thing was

shadows anyway that stuff is not
important<00:03:59.080> but<00:03:59.200> do<00:03:59.470> check<00:03:59.530> for<00:04:00.040> light<00:04:00.610> boxes

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
important but do check for light boxes

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.880

maybe<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.720> can<00:04:01.900> get<00:04:02.020> some<00:04:02.170> inspiration<00:04:02.410> on

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
maybe you can get some inspiration on

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.760 
maybe you can get some inspiration on
how<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.220> properly<00:04:03.910> build<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.780> or<00:04:05.350> how<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.530> can

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
how to properly build it or how you can

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.860 
how to properly build it or how you can
make<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:05.980> prettier<00:04:06.610> than<00:04:06.880> me<00:04:07.060> anyway<00:04:07.690> it's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
make it prettier than me anyway it's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.570 
make it prettier than me anyway it's
something<00:04:07.990> to<00:04:08.260> work<00:04:08.350> about<00:04:08.650> on<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.310> would

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
something to work about on it I would

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.130 
something to work about on it I would
say<00:04:09.700> it's<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.910> good<00:04:10.060> idea<00:04:10.150> benefits<00:04:10.810> are<00:04:10.959> it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
say it's a good idea benefits are it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.949 
say it's a good idea benefits are it
doesn't<00:04:11.530> hold<00:04:12.190> humidity<00:04:12.550> as<00:04:13.000> much<00:04:13.330> as<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.720> bag

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
doesn't hold humidity as much as the bag

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.440 
doesn't hold humidity as much as the bag
if<00:04:14.230> there<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:14.980> any<00:04:15.130> condensation<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.090> will<00:04:16.209> not

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
if there is any condensation it will not

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.360 
if there is any condensation it will not
drop<00:04:16.750> because<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.170> is<00:04:17.290> cloth<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.950> actually

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
drop because this is cloth and actually

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.250 
drop because this is cloth and actually
it<00:04:18.520> absorbs<00:04:19.000> if<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.330> get<00:04:19.510> rid<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.930> excess

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
it absorbs if you get rid of the excess

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.629 
it absorbs if you get rid of the excess
water<00:04:20.320> properly<00:04:20.890> it

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
water properly it

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.450 
water properly it
not<00:04:21.759> droop<00:04:22.300> down<00:04:23.110> anywhere<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.949> it<00:04:24.219> will<00:04:24.310> not

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
not droop down anywhere and it will not

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.570 
not droop down anywhere and it will not
create<00:04:24.699> any<00:04:24.969> crown<00:04:25.479> rot<00:04:25.689> whatsoever<00:04:26.680> also<00:04:27.490> it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
create any crown rot whatsoever also it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.330 
create any crown rot whatsoever also it
has<00:04:27.699> ventilation<00:04:28.330> from<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:29.590> side<00:04:29.860> also

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
has ventilation from this side also

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.760 
has ventilation from this side also
light<00:04:30.969> can<00:04:31.240> come<00:04:31.539> on<00:04:31.810> this<00:04:32.020> side<00:04:32.259> if<00:04:32.439> you<00:04:32.529> face

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
light can come on this side if you face

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.219 
light can come on this side if you face
it<00:04:32.800> towards<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.759> light<00:04:33.909> source<00:04:33.939> anyway<00:04:34.749> but

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
it towards the light source anyway but

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.929 
it towards the light source anyway but
the<00:04:35.499> only<00:04:35.740> problem<00:04:36.099> with<00:04:36.189> this<00:04:36.370> thing<00:04:36.610> is<00:04:36.759> it

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
the only problem with this thing is it

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.550 
the only problem with this thing is it
doesn't<00:04:37.210> look<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.419> pretty<00:04:37.599> I'll<00:04:38.199> give<00:04:38.409> it<00:04:38.529> that

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
doesn't look so pretty I'll give it that

humidity you can water the class I think
once<00:05:00.939> or<00:05:01.090> twice<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.300> day<00:05:01.539> depending<00:05:01.960> on<00:05:02.050> your
