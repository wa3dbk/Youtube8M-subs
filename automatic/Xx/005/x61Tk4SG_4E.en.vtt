envisioned<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:08.280> think<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:09.450> starts<00:00:09.809> off

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
envisioned for I think it starts off

envisioned for I think it starts off
with<00:00:09.960> sailing<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.889> Aquila<00:00:11.269> Aquila<00:00:12.269> Aquila

with sailing the Aquila Aquila Aquila
through<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.590> narrow<00:00:13.950> channel<00:00:14.040> which<00:00:14.460> isn't<00:00:14.610> too

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
through a narrow channel which isn't too

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.820 
through a narrow channel which isn't too
bad<00:00:14.820> if<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.570> need<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.839> turn<00:00:15.990> sharply<00:00:16.410> dropped

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
bad if you need to turn sharply dropped

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.420 
bad if you need to turn sharply dropped
a<00:00:17.039> full<00:00:17.340> sail<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.000> split<00:00:18.210> second<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.750> then

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
a full sail for a split second and then

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
a full sail for a split second and then
come<00:00:20.430> back<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:21.090> drop<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> heart<00:00:21.660> out<00:00:21.920> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
come back up to drop the heart out to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.500 
come back up to drop the heart out to
half<00:00:23.100> saris<00:00:23.340> plus<00:00:23.760> second<00:00:24.000> then<00:00:24.090> come<00:00:24.240> back<00:00:24.390> up

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
half saris plus second then come back up

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.150 
half saris plus second then come back up
to<00:00:24.539> full<00:00:24.779> sail<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.289> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> power<00:00:25.830> slide

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
to full sail and you kind of power slide

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.769 
to full sail and you kind of power slide
around<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.490> corners<00:00:26.820> although<00:00:27.420> here<00:00:27.689> are

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
around the corners although here are

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
around the corners although here are
your<00:00:27.930> major<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.320> didn't<00:00:28.529> even<00:00:28.650> crop<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.699> half

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
your major so didn't even crop to half

your major so didn't even crop to half
salmon<00:00:30.210> or<00:00:30.529> if<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.710> being<00:00:31.890> said<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.730> got<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
salmon or if a being said I have got the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.639 
salmon or if a being said I have got the
rudder<00:00:33.360> upgrade<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> boat<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.320> in

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
rudder upgrade for the boat which in

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.319 
rudder upgrade for the boat which in
vibe<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.040> next<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.489> captain<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
vibe from next to the captain in the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.420 
vibe from next to the captain in the
homestead<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.950> mission<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
homestead and so for this mission that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.950 
homestead and so for this mission that
might<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.820> worth<00:00:38.969> grabbing<00:00:39.239> although<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
might be worth grabbing although it is

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 
might be worth grabbing although it is
somewhat<00:00:40.170> expensive<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:41.190> might<00:00:41.370> also<00:00:41.520> want

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
somewhat expensive you might also want

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.190 
somewhat expensive you might also want
to<00:00:41.760> come<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.000> at<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> shallower<00:00:42.510> angle<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to come in at a shallower angle to that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.170 
to come in at a shallower angle to that
boat<00:00:43.440> because<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> watch<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.760> cutscene

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
boat because if you watch the cutscene

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.910 
boat because if you watch the cutscene
it'll<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.570> leave<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> facing<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> same<00:00:46.860> way

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
it'll just leave you facing the same way

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.369 
it'll just leave you facing the same way
so<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.340> had<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> cut<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.420> my<00:00:48.450> sails<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> avoid

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
so I had to cut all my sails to avoid

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.130 
so I had to cut all my sails to avoid
that<00:00:49.559> rock<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:50.700> let<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.300> boat<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.930> quite

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that rock which let this boat get quite

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
that rock which let this boat get quite
a<00:00:52.170> lean<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.530> me<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.370> from<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.940> basically

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
a lean on me but from here I'm basically

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.779 
a lean on me but from here I'm basically
full<00:00:54.750> sail<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> whole<00:00:55.410> time<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.430> only<00:00:56.579> time<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
full sail the whole time the only time I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.380 
full sail the whole time the only time I
drop<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.899> rogue<00:00:58.140> wind<00:00:58.410> comes<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.390> I

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
drop is if a rogue wind comes up and I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.229 
drop is if a rogue wind comes up and I
need<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:02.219> back<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.579> course<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.090> then

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
need to get back on course and then

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
need to get back on course and then
you'll<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> drop<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> second<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.369> two

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
you'll see I drop it for a second or two

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.100 
you'll see I drop it for a second or two
and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.970> comes<00:01:06.150> straight<00:01:06.420> back<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.930> full

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and then it comes straight back to full

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.320 
and then it comes straight back to full
sail<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.220> again<00:01:08.430> four<00:01:08.580> turns<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:09.119> I've<00:01:09.210> got

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
sail and again four turns when I've got

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.510 
sail and again four turns when I've got
a<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.600> sharp<00:01:09.869> turn<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.500> I'll<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.159> cut

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
a really sharp turn what I'll do is cut

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.210 
a really sharp turn what I'll do is cut
a<00:01:11.549> half<00:01:11.790> sail<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> second<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.920> power

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a half sail for a second and then power

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.899 
a half sail for a second and then power
slide<00:01:14.520> around<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> corner<00:01:16.430> but<00:01:17.430> hey<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> can

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
slide around the corner but hey you can

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.999 
slide around the corner but hey you can
go<00:01:18.060> straight<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.990> isn't<00:01:19.439> too<00:01:19.680> tricky

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
go straight this bit isn't too tricky

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.160 
go straight this bit isn't too tricky
and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> tried<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.119> super<00:01:21.509> sneaky<00:01:21.570> up

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and then I tried to be super sneaky up

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.240 
and then I tried to be super sneaky up
here<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> rogue<00:01:23.250> wind<00:01:23.580> kind<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.000> threw<00:01:24.270> me<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
here a rogue wind kind of threw me and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.819 
here a rogue wind kind of threw me and
it<00:01:26.880> didn't<00:01:27.390> entirely<00:01:27.869> work<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.350> I'd<00:01:28.500> hoped

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it didn't entirely work as I'd hoped

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.340 
it didn't entirely work as I'd hoped
I<00:01:29.360> smashed<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.479> thing<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> left<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
I smashed this thing on the left but you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
I smashed this thing on the left but you
see<00:01:31.560> how<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.860> damage<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.369> take<00:01:32.549> even<00:01:32.850> though

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
see how little damage I take even though

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
see how little damage I take even though
I've<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.180> upgraded<00:01:33.720> hull<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.100> still

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I've got upgraded hull you can still

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
I've got upgraded hull you can still
afford<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> take<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.060> hit<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.900> doing

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
afford to take one hit in so doing

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.420 
afford to take one hit in so doing
that's<00:01:37.380> gonna<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.650> absolutely<00:01:37.950> fine<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> by

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that's gonna be absolutely fine and by

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.370 
that's gonna be absolutely fine and by

the right bumper we're just pushing
right<00:02:19.659> on<00:02:19.989> your<00:02:20.140> d-pad<00:02:20.409> to<00:02:20.799> change<00:02:21.099> shop<00:02:21.340> type

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
right on your d-pad to change shop type

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.880 
right on your d-pad to change shop type
and<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:22.659> pretty<00:02:23.019> forgiving

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and it's pretty forgiving

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.910 
and it's pretty forgiving
I<00:02:23.980> missed<00:02:24.580> there<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.200> change<00:02:26.200> shop<00:02:26.379> shoots<00:02:26.739> a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
I missed there the change shop shoots a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.250 
I missed there the change shop shoots a
lot<00:02:27.220> slower<00:02:27.700> than<00:02:28.030> round<00:02:28.510> shop<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.019> you<00:02:29.049> need

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
lot slower than round shop so you need

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.899 
lot slower than round shop so you need
to<00:02:29.349> lead<00:02:29.560> your<00:02:29.680> target<00:02:29.920> little<00:02:30.340> more<00:02:30.519> but<00:02:30.730> I

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
to lead your target little more but I

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.280 
to lead your target little more but I
like<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.360> get<00:02:31.480> around<00:02:31.540> in<00:02:31.780> front<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.079> it<00:02:32.170> like

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
like to get around in front of it like

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.530 
like to get around in front of it like
this<00:02:32.970> because<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:34.239> it's<00:02:34.360> easier<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.810> hit

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
this because then it's easier to hit

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.660 
this because then it's easier to hit
flying<00:02:37.540> drive<00:02:38.140> hanging<00:02:38.560> sailing<00:02:39.190> straight<00:02:39.489> to

flying drive hanging sailing straight to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.220 
flying drive hanging sailing straight to
Ortiz<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.299> you<00:02:40.390> get<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> better<00:02:40.720> line<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.140> it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
Ortiz so you get a better line on it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.809 
Ortiz so you get a better line on it
anyway<00:02:41.950> once<00:02:42.129> there<00:02:42.280> double<00:02:42.610> take<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
anyway once there double take the

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.220 
anyway once there double take the
controls<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.359> charge<00:02:43.599> you<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.959> need<00:02:44.109> to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
controls and charge you and you need to

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.780 
controls and charge you and you need to
get<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.650> or<00:02:44.920> tries<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.099> boat<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.489> need<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.670> get<00:02:45.760> a

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
get a or tries to boat you need to get a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.660 
get a or tries to boat you need to get a
streak<00:02:46.090> your<00:02:46.359> kills<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.900> three<00:02:47.379> streak<00:02:48.220> killed

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
streak your kills a three streak killed

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.690 
streak your kills a three streak killed
streak<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.799> easiest<00:02:51.069> way<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.489> come<00:02:51.609> up

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
streak so the easiest way is to come up

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.250 
streak so the easiest way is to come up
here<00:02:52.030> where<00:02:52.209> there's<00:02:52.359> a<00:02:52.390> lot<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.629> guys<00:02:52.720> or<00:02:53.140> to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
also a lot of guys there should be three

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.140 
also a lot of guys there should be three
