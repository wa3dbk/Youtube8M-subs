some of the examples of sweet picking
that<00:00:02.399> I<00:00:02.460> do<00:00:02.580> are<00:00:03.560> pretty<00:00:04.560> basic<00:00:04.740> actually<00:00:05.310> but

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
that I do are pretty basic actually but

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.920 
that I do are pretty basic actually but
I<00:00:05.490> like<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.730> change<00:00:05.940> things<00:00:06.180> up<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.540> little<00:00:06.720> bit

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
I like to change things up a little bit

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.240 
I like to change things up a little bit
to<00:00:07.410> make<00:00:07.529> them<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.740> little<00:00:07.950> bit<00:00:08.099> more

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
to make them a little bit more

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.680 
to make them a little bit more
interesting<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.000> if<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.269> were<00:00:09.360> using<00:00:09.599> an

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
interesting so if we were using an

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
interesting so if we were using an
arpeggio<00:00:10.080> like<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:19.400> there's<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.460> lot<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
arpeggio like this there's a lot of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.130 
arpeggio like this there's a lot of
things<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.970> could<00:00:21.090> really<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.900> um

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
things you could really do with that um

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
things you could really do with that um
one<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.130> those<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> particular<00:00:23.910> would<00:00:24.000> be

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
one of those in particular would be

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570 
one of those in particular would be
something<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.510> this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
something like this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.940 
something like this

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and you can take that and move that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.000 
and you can take that and move that
around<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.140> neck<00:00:43.289> a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.620> bit<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.860> make<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
around the neck a little bit to make it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.530 
around the neck a little bit to make it
even<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.280> interesting<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.329> as

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
even more interesting or just use it as

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.990 
even more interesting or just use it as
a<00:00:45.570> warm-up<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.290> page<00:00:46.710> views<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
a warm-up for your page views so it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.260 
a warm-up for your page views so it
would<00:00:48.120> sound<00:00:48.269> like<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.510> slow

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270
