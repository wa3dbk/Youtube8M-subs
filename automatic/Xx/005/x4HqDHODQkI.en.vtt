00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the background I'm starting to grow a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
the background I'm starting to grow a
little<00:00:33.660> bit<00:00:33.899> algae<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.040> tank<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
little bit algae on the tank and at the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.430 
little bit algae on the tank and at the
bottom<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.840> that's<00:00:37.170> them<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.410> there<00:00:39.440> they

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
bottom but that's them right there they

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.410 
bottom but that's them right there they
ran<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:40.920> days<00:00:41.070> without<00:00:41.219> eating<00:00:41.579> anything<00:00:42.000> but

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
ran two days without eating anything but

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.000 
ran two days without eating anything but
I<00:00:42.450> mean<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:43.020> tell<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.530> didn't<00:00:43.890> really

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I mean as you can tell it didn't really

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.920 
I mean as you can tell it didn't really
seem<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.460> affect<00:00:44.550> their<00:00:45.090> growth<00:00:47.329> I'm<00:00:48.329> feeding

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
seem to affect their growth I'm feeding

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
seem to affect their growth I'm feeding
them<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.289> crazy<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.160> seems<00:00:50.430> like

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
them like crazy but it just seems like

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
them like crazy but it just seems like
they're<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.850> getting<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.329> round<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:52.050> they

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
they're not getting as round as they

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
they're not getting as round as they
were<00:00:52.289> earlier<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.760> mean<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.390> might<00:00:54.600> be

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
were earlier so I mean they might be

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.670 
were earlier so I mean they might be
around<00:00:55.340> all<00:00:56.340> right<00:00:56.809> that's<00:00:57.809> quickl<00:00:58.260> update<00:00:58.530> on
