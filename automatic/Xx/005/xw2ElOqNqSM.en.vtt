evasion<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.930> i<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.290> say<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.560> myself<00:01:10.710> oh<00:01:11.250> except

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
evasion if i do say so myself oh except

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320 
evasion if i do say so myself oh except
that<00:01:12.240> person<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.140> team<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:14.330> yeah

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

that person was on my team or they yeah
i<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.479> wondering<00:01:15.840> why<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> wouldn't<00:01:16.350> have

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
i was wondering why that wouldn't have

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
i was wondering why that wouldn't have
splattered<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> roller<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
splattered me because the roller can

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.270 
splattered me because the roller can
roll<00:01:18.600> over<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.229> squid<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:19.950> even<00:01:20.100> if

then<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.079> has<00:01:34.229> its<00:01:34.470> melee<00:01:34.829> capabilities<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
then it has its melee capabilities of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
then it has its melee capabilities of
just<00:01:35.700> rolling<00:01:36.030> over<00:01:36.150> people<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.110> i<00:01:37.140> think

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
just rolling over people so i think

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.770 
just rolling over people so i think
personally<00:01:38.250> love<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.090> i'm<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.450> so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
personally love it you know i'm not so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.999 
personally love it you know i'm not so
great<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.320> gun<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> i'm<00:01:40.740> using<00:01:40.979> right

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
great with this gun that i'm using right

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
great with this gun that i'm using right
now<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.670> splatter<00:01:42.030> shot<00:01:42.270> jr<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.750> i

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
now this is the splatter shot jr as i

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.899 
now this is the splatter shot jr as i
said<00:01:43.049> at<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> beginning<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:44.220> thing<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
said at the beginning my thing about it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.370 
said at the beginning my thing about it
is<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> i<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.360> feel<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.229> so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
is that i just feel like it's so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.170 
is that i just feel like it's so
inefficient<00:01:47.009> after<00:01:47.250> using<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> roller<00:01:47.850> at

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
inefficient after using the roller at

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.880 
inefficient after using the roller at
spreading<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.899> ink<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:49.860> here

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
spreading the ink but look right here

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.469 
spreading the ink but look right here
you<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:51.329> was<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
you know you can see that there was a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.450 
you know you can see that there was a
good<00:01:51.600> chance<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.960> me<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> splatter<00:01:52.920> somebody

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
good chance for me to splatter somebody

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
good chance for me to splatter somebody
because<00:01:54.390> i<00:01:54.420> had<00:01:54.659> obvious<00:01:55.079> range<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.740> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
because i had obvious range on them you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.969 
because i had obvious range on them you
know<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.850> helps<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.390> UM<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.320> bombs<00:01:58.799> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
know so that helps to UM the bombs that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.440 
know so that helps to UM the bombs that
we<00:01:59.100> actually<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.820> i<00:01:59.850> believe<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
we actually have here i believe is the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.359 
we actually have here i believe is the
splat<00:02:00.780> bomb<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.409> basically<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
splat bomb and basically it's just you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.459 
splat bomb and basically it's just you
know<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.670> has<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> set<00:02:03.420> time<00:02:03.659> after<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> throw

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
know it has a set time after you throw

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.770 
know it has a set time after you throw
it<00:02:04.619> where<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.920> coats<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> area<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.000> ink<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.570> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
it where it coats the area in ink and so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.540 
it where it coats the area in ink and so
you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.259> course<00:02:07.290> use<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> grenade

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you can of course use it like a grenade

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can of course use it like a grenade
and<00:02:08.970> explode<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> other<00:02:09.660> Inklings<00:02:10.170> that's

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
and explode the other Inklings that's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.960 
and explode the other Inklings that's
these<00:02:10.649> characters<00:02:11.099> names<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.730> called

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
these characters names they are called

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.160 
these characters names they are called
Inklings

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
Inklings

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.510 
Inklings
we<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.410> got<00:02:13.560> somebody<00:02:13.920> else<00:02:13.980> right<00:02:14.310> there

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
we just got somebody else right there

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.460 
we just got somebody else right there
splattered<00:02:15.060> another<00:02:15.360> person<00:02:15.780> doing<00:02:16.170> pretty

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
splattered another person doing pretty

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.930 
splattered another person doing pretty
good<00:02:16.709> now<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:17.130> course<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.610> don't<00:02:17.640> know

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
good now of course if you don't know

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.910 
good now of course if you don't know
about<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.390> mechanics<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.930> splatoon<00:02:19.349> one<00:02:19.830> of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
about the mechanics of splatoon one of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.320 
about the mechanics of splatoon one of
the<00:02:19.980> things<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.790> ink<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.180> you're

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the things is that the ink that you're

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.059 
the things is that the ink that you're
spreading<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.170> only<00:02:22.290> effective

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
spreading you know it's only effective

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.430 
spreading you know it's only effective
on<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> ground<00:02:23.819> as<00:02:24.150> far<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.599> counting<00:02:25.140> towards

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
on the ground as far as counting towards

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.320 
on the ground as far as counting towards
your<00:02:25.530> team's<00:02:25.770> score<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.849> can<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.300> course

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
your team's score now you can of course

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.910 
your team's score now you can of course
shoot<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.959> walls<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.410> things<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.739> so

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
shoot the walls and things like that so

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.490 
shoot the walls and things like that so
that<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.310> team<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.970> can<00:02:30.239> squid<00:02:30.989> up<00:02:31.200> them

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
that your team and you can squid up them

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530 
that your team and you can squid up them
you<00:02:32.010> know<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.459> essence<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.910> climb<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.360> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
you know so in essence to climb up to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.630 
you know so in essence to climb up to
different<00:02:33.690> places<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.830> level<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.430> of

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
different places in the level you can of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.370 
different places in the level you can of
course<00:02:35.850> shoot<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.150> walls<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.110> won't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
course shoot the walls but that won't

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.410 
course shoot the walls but that won't
really<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> points<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.940> can

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
really get you the points that you can

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.540 
really get you the points that you can
see<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> top<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.170> know<00:02:40.230> I've<00:02:40.410> earned<00:02:40.650> 521

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
see at the top you know I've earned 521

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.729 
see at the top you know I've earned 521
points<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.150> our<00:02:42.239> team<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.500> for

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
points for our team so you know for

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.580 
points for our team so you know for
instance<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> we're<00:02:46.080> getting<00:02:46.350> close<00:02:46.560> to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
instance that so we're getting close to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.860 
instance that so we're getting close to
the<00:02:46.830> last<00:02:47.040> 30<00:02:47.400> seconds<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.269> feel<00:02:48.630> where

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the last 30 seconds this is I feel where

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.840 
the last 30 seconds this is I feel where
a<00:02:48.900> lot<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.470> action<00:02:49.890> kind<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.370> happens<00:02:50.670> at<00:02:50.790> a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
a lot of the action kind of happens at a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.490 
a lot of the action kind of happens at a
lot<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.239> deciding<00:02:51.600> factors<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:52.290> guess

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
lot of the deciding factors I guess

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.460 
lot of the deciding factors I guess
within<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:53.100> turf<00:02:53.760> war<00:02:53.790> match<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.660> lot<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
within this turf war match a lot of the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.900 
within this turf war match a lot of the
matches<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.950> know<00:02:56.069> they<00:02:56.190> are<00:02:56.340> decided<00:02:56.850> in

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
matches you know they are decided in

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.059 
matches you know they are decided in
this<00:02:57.090> last<00:02:57.420> little<00:02:57.630> bit<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:57.989> time<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.769> my

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
this last little bit of time so my

kind<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.080> came<00:03:07.230> up<00:03:07.290> right<00:03:07.530> behind<00:03:07.709> me<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.160> it's

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
kind of came up right behind me and it's

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.729 
kind of came up right behind me and it's
still<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:09.000> someone's<00:03:09.420> there<00:03:09.569> if<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.959> just

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
still I think someone's there if I just

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.860 
still I think someone's there if I just
got<00:03:10.920> rolled<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.480> looks<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.690> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
got rolled so it looks like the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.870 
got rolled so it looks like the
countdown<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.769> ten<00:03:14.010> seconds<00:03:14.340> left<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
countdown is going ten seconds left and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.120 
countdown is going ten seconds left and
you<00:03:15.750> know<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.870> don't<00:03:16.170> really<00:03:16.470> know<00:03:16.769> I'm<00:03:16.980> not

splatter<00:03:45.180> shot<00:03:45.420> jr<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.810> feel<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.440> was<00:03:46.650> probably

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
splatter shot jr I feel it was probably

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.710 
splatter shot jr I feel it was probably
pretty<00:03:47.340> good<00:03:47.609> in<00:03:47.730> some<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.120> matches<00:03:48.299> but<00:03:48.660> I

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
pretty good in some of the matches but I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.599 
pretty good in some of the matches but I
still<00:03:49.049> died<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> fair<00:03:49.950> amount<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.430> it

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
still died a fair amount with it

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.979 
still died a fair amount with it
compared<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.120> when<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.299> was<00:03:51.390> using<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.780> roller

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
compared to when I was using the roller

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.080 
compared to when I was using the roller
I<00:03:52.200> pretty<00:03:52.709> much<00:03:52.799> didn't<00:03:53.190> die<00:03:53.280> at<00:03:53.430> all<00:03:53.579> now<00:03:53.940> it

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
I pretty much didn't die at all now it

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.090 
I pretty much didn't die at all now it
also<00:03:54.209> matters<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.930> makeup<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.590> their<00:03:55.829> team

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
also matters the makeup of their team

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.559 
also matters the makeup of their team

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
it's not just picking the right web

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.550 
it's not just picking the right web
you<00:04:26.910> have<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.120> be<00:04:27.240> able<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.540> flank<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.200> attack

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
you have to be able to flank and attack

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.290 
you have to be able to flank and attack
and<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:29.040> when<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.220> defend<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.940> know<00:04:30.090> when<00:04:30.270> to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
go off and get away from the battles and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.220 
go off and get away from the battles and
spread<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.970> ink<00:04:33.180> because<00:04:33.390> ultimately<00:04:33.840> that's

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
spread the ink because ultimately that's

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.660 
spread the ink because ultimately that's
what<00:04:34.380> gets<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.860> victory<00:04:35.130> it's<00:04:35.340> not<00:04:35.520> the

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
what gets you the victory it's not the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.520 
what gets you the victory it's not the
kills<00:04:35.940> now<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.390> will<00:04:36.690> say<00:04:36.900> of<00:04:36.930> course<00:04:37.200> when<00:04:37.440> you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
kills now I will say of course when you

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.020 
kills now I will say of course when you
kill<00:04:37.740> them<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:38.010> obviously<00:04:38.400> stop<00:04:38.670> them<00:04:38.910> from

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
kill them you obviously stop them from

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.880 
kill them you obviously stop them from
spreading<00:04:39.240> ink<00:04:39.660> momentarily<00:04:40.350> but<00:04:40.620> they<00:04:40.740> can

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
spreading ink momentarily but they can

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.110 
spreading ink momentarily but they can
just<00:04:41.040> jump<00:04:41.220> right<00:04:41.310> back<00:04:41.460> into<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.940> game<00:04:42.060> but

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
just jump right back into the game but

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.600 
just jump right back into the game but
it<00:04:42.390> also<00:04:42.540> makes<00:04:43.320> a<00:04:43.470> big<00:04:43.650> splatter<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.310> your

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
it also makes a big splatter of your

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.670 
it also makes a big splatter of your
color<00:04:44.850> when<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.330> kill<00:04:45.750> off<00:04:45.900> another<00:04:46.170> inkling

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
color when you kill off another inkling

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.770 
color when you kill off another inkling
so<00:04:46.920> basically<00:04:47.520> there<00:04:47.700> are<00:04:47.730> advantages<00:04:48.420> and

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
so basically there are advantages and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.600 
so basically there are advantages and
disadvantages<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.500> every<00:04:49.770> play<00:04:49.980> style<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
disadvantages to every play style and

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.670 
disadvantages to every play style and
this<00:04:50.730> is<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.880> very<00:04:51.090> strategic<00:04:51.510> shooter<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.500> I

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
this is a very strategic shooter and I

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.200 
this is a very strategic shooter and I
think<00:04:52.920> Nintendo<00:04:53.400> has<00:04:53.550> hit<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.880> shooter<00:04:54.180> genre

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
think Nintendo has hit the shooter genre

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.660 
think Nintendo has hit the shooter genre
