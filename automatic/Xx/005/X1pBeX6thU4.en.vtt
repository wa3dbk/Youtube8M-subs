00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 so dear blog community we have ourselves 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.189
 gathered here to find out if you 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.960
 skylink processors against the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 rumors 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:20.070
 nevertheless safe with the baton 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:24.830
 can behead method you can see here the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.140
 pcb has become much thinner and 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.520
 various experience reports and 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 It is no longer rumored that it is rumored 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.590
 to head the cdu the pcb could break 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.309
 or anything else I have to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.950
 honestly I'm still a bit 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.480
 I'm excited about 100 or 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.910
 hessel processors here in the vise 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.539
 describes how this method without 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.199
 losses so far but rather makes the pcb 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.399
 a really fragile impression 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.359
 nevertheless, hopes to be natural i have 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.300
 this is an extremely soft wood too 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.860
 not totally resistant affords 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.119
 but also something gives way and yes me 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.470
 I'm also a bit nervous 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.960
 I say if I equal four and euro 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.939
 Electro-scrap or successfully trimmed 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 cpu or at least a mechanical one 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.340
 successfully beheaded biopsy works 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.509
 and, of course, later on, yes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.140
 Excited because I do not have to go for a long time 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.140
 To be honest we are live 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.580
 yes, so far it looks good on the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.580
 first look 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:00.480
 that was the impact here I'm shaking 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.950
 easily agitated then if we again 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.950
 see if the thing works the same
