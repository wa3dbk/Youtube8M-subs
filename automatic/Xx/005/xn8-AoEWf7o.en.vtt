00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.730
 video of minecraft and psychics we are 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.960
 in what guaguas already saw it after 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.059
 that this place is a modern house 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400
 that a subscriber sent me though 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.980
 it really seems like a good way to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.199
 your channel but you are grateful for the gesture of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.769
 send me to the channel so I can upload it 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.630
 so here we are doing the review 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.210
 and with nothing more to start a cut and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 we started something less already we are here to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.489
 whatever it is wood house entrance and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.770
 Buddhism which your channel will be in the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.629
 description of the video since it did not put 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 no sign or anything like that 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.550
 how good will it be in the description of 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.640
 video and we start with these beautiful and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.950
 succulent potato crops and here 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.960
 we have a small pool with a 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.910
 wall and squid 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.449
 with everything is not as tiny as me 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.480
 I thought we continue to see what we have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.100
 around here we have this beautiful and succulent 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 plant 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.799
 that really there is not everything in the degree 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.570
 but it looks super cool I would have 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.659
 put a little hand there to make it look like 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.540
 a tree but it's super cool the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.060
 design of your house is this jungle like this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.460
 that good 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.159
 here we have a work area that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.930
 well I do not see the case without tables but it's 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.940
 very good there 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.550
 always says that you have to look towards 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.870
 up and that's what they should do 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.990
 we continue with your sleeping room the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.240
 which I'm going to go to bed do not create a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.160
 asleep in his bed but good here 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.560
 we have a block of travelers and one of 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.990
 diamond I do not see it 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.840
 good is that the salt is very empty but 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.280
 that you can not do anything else 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.640
 contributes to this I love 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 great I will use for my houses here 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.590
 we have the lady cow well a 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.460
 martial arts movie or by god and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.570
 now I hit him 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.909
 or god that agile is a whole line 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.489
 mime against a samurai and who will win 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:12.430
 this decisive battle 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:15.790
 you have to kill him or he hides he hides 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.450
 wall endured a lover spray four 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.200
 touches 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.390
 come good at saying things to 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.690
 survival 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.850
 and a tense rival 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.100
 you will not have interesting things like that 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.319
 that right now we are going to check it, I think 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.090
 they have more things so let's go 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.060
 I'm getting used to the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.219
 controls and says special 50 sub and as 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.450
 I am a subscriber, I have the 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.819
 review of your map 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.170
 and in fact it's going to be that your channel has 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.680
 already with the 53 points that good 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.739
 and here we have to support the sea with 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.330
 little things so a cut so you do not 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.580
 put survival to see if it is that 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.930
 has some flakes and good guys already 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.940
 I'm back here and I know 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.220
 survival is that we're going to see that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.350
 I put these cultural controls 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.730
 wow 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.670
 I am becoming a dog 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.140
 I guess there 's nothing we go down and have 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.950
 what is good lacks the charms 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.170
 so let's go up 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.260
 and let's see what things for 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.709
 survival to finish the map 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.660
 because it is very long 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.660
 in fact I'm going to start a series more 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.790
 go ahead and meet the final version or 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.760
 when you can play normal in the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.150
 wheels keys the seed that I have is 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.370
 similar to this one so good said to 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.370
 see things for survival here 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.810
 it's hard to say that he played in which if 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.540
 can now with all that is the leader 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.980
 you can continue the thing well 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.980
 is everything he has in earnest 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.100
 well, it seems like it's good 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.770
 it's an area of all the guys I hope 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.240
 that you liked while I'm going 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.920
 finish the video while I was left 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.940
 watching here on television 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.640
 I'm southeast 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.030
 no one, let's stop the boogers and 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.030
 goodbye 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.100
 I'll lock you in the goodbye but good 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.580
 guys we see you a hug a greeting and 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.580
 goodbye 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.219
 that I think is not wrong pixel denies 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 humanist 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.530
 never 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.509
 nothing happens here
