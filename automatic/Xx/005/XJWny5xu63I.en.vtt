00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
position maybe 93 Quincy to let's try

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.389 
position maybe 93 Quincy to let's try
that<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.170> how<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.379> usually<00:00:52.920> play<00:00:53.100> this

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that it's not how I usually play this

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.380 
that it's not how I usually play this
but<00:00:53.699> interesting<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:57.120> i<00:00:57.149> have

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
but interesting so just know i have

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.320 
but interesting so just know i have
three<00:00:57.660> here

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.220 

yeah<00:01:09.330> white<00:01:09.570> has<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.640> good<00:01:11.640> central<00:01:12.240> control

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
yeah white has a good central control

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.140 
yeah white has a good central control
him<00:01:15.230> didn't<00:01:16.230> want<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.560> take<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.700> c5

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
him didn't want to take that on on c5

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.560 
him didn't want to take that on on c5
but<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.140> idea<00:01:19.320> comes<00:01:20.130> into<00:01:20.490> into<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.150> plane

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
but this idea comes into into the plane

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
but this idea comes into into the plane
um<00:01:22.100> in<00:01:23.100> case<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.670> black<00:01:24.200> oops<00:01:25.200> what's<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
um in case of black oops what's this I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.410 
um in case of black oops what's this I
can<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.760> d5<00:01:27.210> now<00:01:28.430> don't<00:01:29.430> understand<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.240> move

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
can go d5 now don't understand to move

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.990 
can go d5 now don't understand to move
on<00:01:30.950> t5<00:01:33.260> can<00:01:34.260> also<00:01:34.440> take<00:01:34.830> it<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.970> bad

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
on t5 can also take it which is not bad

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.840 
on t5 can also take it which is not bad
but<00:01:39.619> let's<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.710> about<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.280> fire<00:01:41.550> for<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
but let's think about the fire for a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
but let's think about the fire for a
moment<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.300> g5<00:01:42.810> what<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.200> she<00:01:43.320> doing<00:01:43.619> queen

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
moment like g5 what is she doing queen

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.560 
moment like g5 what is she doing queen
sorry<00:01:44.940> night<00:01:45.350> a590<00:01:46.350> takes<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:47.040> five<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.580> then

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
sorry night a590 takes a five and then

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.780 
sorry night a590 takes a five and then
some<00:01:48.810> kind<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> tactic<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.550> don't<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
some kind of tactic on I don't get it

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.540 
some kind of tactic on I don't get it
now<00:01:53.790> let's<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.420> also<00:01:54.840> could<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.200> taken

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
now let's see I also could have taken

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:05.630 
now let's see I also could have taken
wouldn't<00:01:56.550> have<00:01:56.640> been<00:01:56.820> bad<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:04.649> goes<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.160> was

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
wouldn't have been bad it goes there was

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.510 
wouldn't have been bad it goes there was
thinking<00:02:05.970> Queen<00:02:06.270> 85<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.720> Knight<00:02:07.530> a5<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:08.280> least

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
compensation I mean this is really just

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.520 
compensation I mean this is really just

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.079 

why<00:04:40.519> just<00:04:40.579> em<00:04:41.089> I<00:04:42.309> just<00:04:43.309> push<00:04:43.489> it<00:04:43.519> through<00:04:43.909> here

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:44.089 
why just em I just push it through here

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:48.219 
why just em I just push it through here
in<00:04:44.209> the<00:04:44.239> center<00:04:46.179> opening<00:04:47.179> on<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.899> diagonal

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
in the center opening on the diagonal

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.439 
in the center opening on the diagonal
Tim<00:04:48.709> yeah<00:04:49.489> the<00:04:49.729> rook<00:04:50.059> is<00:04:50.209> also<00:04:50.599> hanging<00:04:51.189> um<00:04:52.449> can

probably easiest am just taking it black
resigns<00:05:03.219> yeah<00:05:04.219> it's<00:05:04.519> an<00:05:04.699> opening<00:05:05.179> disaster<00:05:05.809> I

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 
don't know that this looks a bit 95

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.699 
don't know that this looks a bit 95
looks<00:05:09.829> a<00:05:09.979> bit<00:05:10.099> strange<00:05:10.459> here<00:05:10.819> to<00:05:10.969> be<00:05:11.089> honest

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:11.709 
looks a bit strange here to be honest

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:16.169 
looks a bit strange here to be honest
giving<00:05:12.709> why<00:05:12.889> this<00:05:12.949> the<00:05:13.879> center<00:05:14.859> so<00:05:15.859> easily

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:16.179 
giving why this the center so easily

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:18.669 
giving why this the center so easily
it's<00:05:17.179> a<00:05:17.239> number<00:05:17.599> of<00:05:17.689> good<00:05:17.869> options<00:05:18.109> even<00:05:18.499> I

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:18.679 
it's a number of good options even I

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:20.409 
it's a number of good options even I
mean<00:05:18.829> it's<00:05:18.979> not<00:05:19.099> threatening<00:05:19.609> on<00:05:19.759> c3<00:05:19.999> as<00:05:20.389> I

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
mean it's not threatening on c3 as I

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.729 
mean it's not threatening on c3 as I
always<00:05:20.749> have<00:05:20.899> bishop<00:05:21.469> h7<00:05:22.039> Quincy<00:05:22.399> to<00:05:22.579> check<00:05:23.739> 9f

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:01.249 
are not not really coordinated the

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.729 
are not not really coordinated the
computer<00:06:01.729> suggests<00:06:02.269> the<00:06:02.449> really<00:06:03.169> wacky

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:03.739 
computer suggests the really wacky

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:07.479 
computer suggests the really wacky
looking<00:06:04.039> move<00:06:04.189> f5<00:06:05.529> yeah<00:06:06.529> maybe<00:06:06.889> maybe

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:07.489 
looking move f5 yeah maybe maybe

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:10.149 
looking move f5 yeah maybe maybe
something<00:06:08.089> like<00:06:08.239> that<00:06:08.289> putting<00:06:09.289> at<00:06:09.919> least

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:10.159 
something like that putting at least

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:11.919 
something like that putting at least
something<00:06:10.669> in<00:06:10.969> the<00:06:11.089> center<00:06:11.539> it<00:06:11.659> looks<00:06:11.869> very

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:11.929 
something in the center it looks very

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:15.039 
something in the center it looks very
weakening<00:06:12.589> though<00:06:12.799> by<00:06:13.219> five<00:06:13.749> okay<00:06:14.749> you<00:06:14.809> did

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:15.049 
weakening though by five okay you did

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:18.249 
weakening though by five okay you did
this<00:06:15.289> and<00:06:15.649> after<00:06:16.039> d5<00:06:16.549> hmm<00:06:17.179> I<00:06:17.329> thought<00:06:18.079> you

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
this and after d5 hmm I thought you

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.479 
this and after d5 hmm I thought you
would<00:06:18.349> go<00:06:18.589> here<00:06:18.889> and<00:06:20.589> after<00:06:21.589> this<00:06:21.769> I'm<00:06:22.129> some

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:22.489 
would go here and after this I'm some

00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:24.039 
would go here and after this I'm some

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
even stronger than that due to this

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:26.239
