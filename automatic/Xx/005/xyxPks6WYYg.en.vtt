00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
know finds a paleo diet to be incredibly

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
know finds a paleo diet to be incredibly
healthy<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.960> are<00:01:46.049> those<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.409> reasons

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
healthy and here are those two reasons

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.300 
healthy and here are those two reasons
first<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.810> makes<00:01:49.200> sense<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.890> decrease

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
first of all it makes sense to decrease

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.830 
first of all it makes sense to decrease
the<00:01:50.460> amount<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.700> toxins<00:01:51.150> in<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.299> food<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the amount of toxins in your food and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
the amount of toxins in your food and
that's<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> paleo<00:01:52.530> diet<00:01:52.619> does<00:01:53.040> first<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that's what a paleo diet does first and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.120 
that's what a paleo diet does first and
foremost<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> their<00:01:55.590> toxins<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.070> we

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
foremost that is their toxins that we

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.550 
foremost that is their toxins that we
add<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.670> chemicals<00:01:57.119> pesticides<00:01:57.360> GMOs<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
add like chemicals pesticides GMOs and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.080 
add like chemicals pesticides GMOs and
there<00:01:59.159> are<00:01:59.250> toxins<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.729> naturally<00:02:00.030> occurring

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
there are toxins and naturally occurring

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
there are toxins and naturally occurring
plants<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.960> excess<00:02:01.440> sugar<00:02:01.680> when<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:01.950> refine

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
plants like excess sugar when we refine

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
plants like excess sugar when we refine
it<00:02:02.369> excess<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.060> mega<00:02:03.240> six<00:02:03.570> fats<00:02:03.869> when<00:02:04.229> we

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
it excess of mega six fats when we

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.590 
it excess of mega six fats when we
refined<00:02:05.100> vegetable<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.790> cook<00:02:05.820> our<00:02:06.090> foods<00:02:06.360> in

food or those chemicals that we add to
our<00:02:17.970> food<00:02:18.269> are<00:02:18.690> toxins<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.440> our<00:02:19.620> body<00:02:19.950> can't

our<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.890> number<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.430> reason<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:23.880> we<00:02:24.030> need

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
our the number one reason that we need

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.870 
our the number one reason that we need
to<00:02:24.540> cut<00:02:24.840> out<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.380> lot<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.280> foods<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to cut out a lot of foods of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.580 
to cut out a lot of foods of
particularly<00:02:27.330> processed<00:02:27.900> foods<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.410> things

particularly processed foods and things

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.110 
particularly processed foods and things
that<00:02:28.680> come<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.040> packages<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.850> are<00:02:29.940> made

that come in packages and that are made
by<00:02:30.260> industrial<00:02:31.260> corporations<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.370> that's

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
by industrial corporations so that's

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.490 
by industrial corporations so that's
number<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.209> you'll<00:02:34.019> have<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.410> be

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
number one and you'll have to be

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.170 
number one and you'll have to be
hard-pressed<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:35.040> find<00:02:35.280> anybody<00:02:35.489> who<00:02:35.700> doesn't

hard-pressed to find anybody who doesn't
agree<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.049> should<00:02:37.200> eat<00:02:37.380> less<00:02:37.680> pesticides

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
agree that we should eat less pesticides

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.400 
agree that we should eat less pesticides
and<00:02:38.760> less<00:02:39.180> things<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.600> are<00:02:39.720> making<00:02:39.989> us<00:02:40.110> sick

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
and less things that are making us sick

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.580 
and less things that are making us sick
the<00:02:41.190> second<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.820> other<00:02:42.570> big<00:02:43.019> reason<00:02:43.049> that<00:02:43.470> we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the second and other big reason that we

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.830 
the second and other big reason that we
need<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.800> go<00:02:43.920> paleo<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:45.390> we<00:02:45.599> need<00:02:45.720> to

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
need to go paleo is that we need to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.690 
need to go paleo is that we need to
increase<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.260> nutrients<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> same<00:02:47.459> time

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
increase the nutrients so the same time

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.120 
increase the nutrients so the same time
that<00:02:47.819> we're<00:02:47.910> going

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
that we're going

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.860 
that we're going
the<00:02:48.220> toxins<00:02:48.580> out<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.760> our<00:02:48.940> food<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.660> need<00:02:49.780> to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
the toxins out of our food we need to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.990 
the toxins out of our food we need to
put<00:02:50.020> more<00:02:50.230> nutrients<00:02:50.770> back<00:02:50.890> into<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.700> you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
put more nutrients back into it and you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
put more nutrients back into it and you
know<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:52.300> natural<00:02:52.810> paleo<00:02:53.110> foods<00:02:53.440> are<00:02:53.830> very

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
know what natural paleo foods are very

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.860 
know what natural paleo foods are very
high<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.550> nutrients<00:02:54.970> they<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.270> have<00:02:55.510> more

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
high in nutrients they can have more

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.350 
high in nutrients they can have more
good<00:02:56.590> fats<00:02:56.890> like<00:02:57.220> omega-3<00:02:57.640> fat<00:02:58.000> saturated

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
good fats like omega-3 fat saturated

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.600 
good fats like omega-3 fat saturated
fats<00:02:58.870> which<00:02:59.020> are<00:02:59.110> very<00:02:59.350> stable<00:02:59.620> they<00:03:00.340> tend<00:03:00.580> to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
fats which are very stable they tend to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.940 
fats which are very stable they tend to
have<00:03:00.820> more<00:03:01.050> vitamins<00:03:02.050> more<00:03:02.290> minerals<00:03:02.590> because

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
have more vitamins more minerals because

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.820 
have more vitamins more minerals because
we're<00:03:03.250> eating<00:03:03.490> more<00:03:03.520> vegetables<00:03:03.670> more<00:03:04.830> more

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
we're eating more vegetables more more

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.590 
we're eating more vegetables more more

meats<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.960> organ<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.830> know<00:03:08.920> things<00:03:09.100> like

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
meats the organ the you know things like

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.490 
meats the organ the you know things like
the<00:03:09.430> liver<00:03:09.640> more<00:03:10.300> fruits<00:03:10.690> which<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.200> lot

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
the liver more fruits which have a lot

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.020 
the liver more fruits which have a lot
of<00:03:11.530> vitamins<00:03:12.040> minerals<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.430> them<00:03:12.550> also<00:03:12.700> and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
of vitamins minerals in them also and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.160 
of vitamins minerals in them also and
tuberous<00:03:13.390> which<00:03:13.540> are<00:03:13.660> actually<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.990> lot<00:03:14.110> more

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
tuberous which are actually a lot more

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.020 
tuberous which are actually a lot more
nutrient<00:03:14.740> dense<00:03:14.770> than<00:03:14.980> people<00:03:15.250> realize<00:03:15.640> so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
nutrient dense than people realize so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.870 
nutrient dense than people realize so
eating<00:03:16.930> more<00:03:17.290> nutrients<00:03:17.980> will<00:03:18.400> allow<00:03:18.640> our

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
eating more nutrients will allow our

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.760 
eating more nutrients will allow our
body<00:03:19.120> not<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> process<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.200> toxins<00:03:20.620> but

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
body not just to process the toxins but

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.770 
body not just to process the toxins but
to<00:03:20.860> perform<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.490> a<00:03:21.550> much<00:03:22.060> higher<00:03:22.240> level

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
to perform on a much higher level

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.900 
to perform on a much higher level
so<00:03:23.200> we're<00:03:23.320> simultaneously<00:03:24.010> decreasing<00:03:24.820> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
so we're simultaneously decreasing the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.240 
so we're simultaneously decreasing the
toxins<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.540> increasing<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.410> nutrients<00:03:26.920> and

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
toxins and increasing the nutrients and

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.430 
toxins and increasing the nutrients and
here's<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> thing<00:03:28.030> if<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.900> tell<00:03:29.170> that<00:03:29.200> to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
here's the thing if you tell that to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.070 
here's the thing if you tell that to
somebody<00:03:30.300> nobody<00:03:31.300> can<00:03:31.570> argue<00:03:31.660> with<00:03:31.930> that

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
somebody nobody can argue with that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.570 
somebody nobody can argue with that
there<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.350> nobody<00:03:32.560> out<00:03:32.950> there<00:03:33.220> who's<00:03:33.430> gonna

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
there is nobody out there who's gonna

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.850 
there is nobody out there who's gonna
say<00:03:33.850> yeah<00:03:34.120> you<00:03:34.510> know<00:03:34.660> what<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.170> think<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.710> need

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
say yeah you know what I think we need

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.860 
say yeah you know what I think we need
to<00:03:35.950> eat<00:03:36.070> more<00:03:36.310> toxins<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.120> get<00:03:37.540> fewer

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
to eat more toxins and get fewer

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.780 
to eat more toxins and get fewer
vitamins<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.470> minerals<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.040> fewer

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
vitamins and minerals and fewer

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.220 
vitamins and minerals and fewer
nutrients<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.450> just<00:03:40.600> doesn't<00:03:40.870> happen<00:03:40.990> because

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
nutrients it just doesn't happen because

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.600 
nutrients it just doesn't happen because
it<00:03:41.470> doesn't<00:03:41.770> make<00:03:41.860> any<00:03:41.980> sense<00:03:42.250> there's<00:03:42.550> no

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
it doesn't make any sense there's no

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.130 
it doesn't make any sense there's no
science<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.060> support<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.810> course<00:03:43.840> the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
science to support it and of course the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.560 
science to support it and of course the
science<00:03:44.470> says<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.830> exact<00:03:45.160> opposite<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.390> next

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
science says the exact opposite so next

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.780 
science says the exact opposite so next
time<00:03:46.810> you're<00:03:47.530> reading<00:03:47.770> or<00:03:48.160> even<00:03:48.400> talking<00:03:48.760> to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
time you're reading or even talking to

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.340 
time you're reading or even talking to
somebody<00:03:49.210> maybe<00:03:49.480> who's<00:03:49.720> not<00:03:49.870> even<00:03:49.900> bashing

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
somebody maybe who's not even bashing

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.070 
somebody maybe who's not even bashing
paleo<00:03:50.980> but<00:03:51.700> who<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.510> think<00:03:52.750> might<00:03:52.930> be

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
paleo but who just you think might be

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.200 
paleo but who just you think might be
converted<00:03:53.620> don't<00:03:54.340> start<00:03:54.670> by<00:03:54.850> saying<00:03:55.090> we

converted don't start by saying we
should<00:03:55.390> live<00:03:55.540> like<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.750> caveman<00:03:56.080> or<00:03:56.320> eat<00:03:56.500> like<00:03:56.650> a

should live like a caveman or eat like a
caveman<00:03:57.010> because<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.460> know<00:03:57.580> what<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:58.360> not

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
caveman because you know what it's not

lot<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.680> my<00:04:02.800> technology<00:04:03.270> but<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.390> know<00:04:04.480> what
