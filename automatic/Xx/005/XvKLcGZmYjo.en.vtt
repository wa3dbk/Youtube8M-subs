 screens this is droids and we are on 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.900
 Apple presentation and me alone 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.639
 from the first managed to hold in your hands 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.120
 new products were introduced today 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 two iphone it iphone 5s here it is in my 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.580
 hands it is budget so to speak versions 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.789
 iphone 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.039
 as the company itself says it does n't care 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.449
 premium product but just for more 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.730
 affordable price 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 that's how it looks like it is plastic but 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.140
 inside actually under this enclosure 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.260
 hidden metal so that he would be more 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.989
 robust and reliable in terms of filling 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 tons well you can say it's just 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.120
 iphone five a little 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.110
 with the simplified corps let's compare it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.050
 from the top five because all the same 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 this comparison suggests itself here at me 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:53.730
 little white iphone 5 iphone 5s 5c a bit 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.969
 thicker he height is basically the same 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.640
 about well a little bit well 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 in front in front you can sometimes them and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.449
 confused if for example it will be white 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.430
 color incidentally presented immediately 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.689
 five colors is white blue yellow 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.640
 some orange well in short 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.799
 many different colors well apart from that yet 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 showed very cool accessories then 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.439
 Here is such a case 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.540
 which when we put it on 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.670
 it turns out well, that's the similarity of the picture 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 Claudia are such caustic 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.890
 vigorous colors just such a youth 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.159
 piece well I think heptor and should it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.460
 appreciate because it really is 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.770
 Now it turns out funny style and style 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.540
 weight so let's say well and of course inside 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.579
 we have ios 7 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.570
 everything basically works enough 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.570

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.430
 high quality she shoots as 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.590
 19 megapixels in mind yes now she 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.570
 better suited for video chat and of course 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.579

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.500
 than in the pictures the first time 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.360

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.489

 fits well in the hand and does not slip out 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.930
 glossy plastic and these 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.019
 crazy colors they surely will make 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:37.800

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:41.180
