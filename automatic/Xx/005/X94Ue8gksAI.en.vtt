00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
aperture we would choose aperture

aperture we would choose aperture
priority<00:01:55.200> mode<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.369> set<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> aperture

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
priority mode we would set the aperture

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050 
priority mode we would set the aperture
to<00:01:57.329> F<00:01:57.600> 2.8<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.469> example<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> camera

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to F 2.8 for example and then the camera

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.969 
to F 2.8 for example and then the camera
would<00:02:00.180> choose<00:02:00.450> 2<00:02:00.659> shutter<00:02:00.899> speed<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.469> us<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
would choose 2 shutter speed for us and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
would choose 2 shutter speed for us and
then<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.820> would<00:02:02.969> take<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.180> picture<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.750> looks

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
then we would take a picture that looks

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.139 
then we would take a picture that looks
like<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.159> other<00:02:05.340> hand<00:02:05.700> let's<00:02:06.030> say

like this on the other hand let's say

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.249 
like this on the other hand let's say
you<00:02:06.240> want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> take<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> photo<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.110> some

you want to take a photo of some
fireworks<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> show<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
fireworks we know that to show the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
fireworks we know that to show the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
motion of the light in the fireworks we

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
need a shutter speed of about 1 to 2

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.100 
need a shutter speed of about 1 to 2
seconds<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.000> case<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.720> would<00:02:15.870> choose

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
seconds in this case we would choose

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
seconds in this case we would choose
shutter<00:02:16.380> priority<00:02:16.590> mode<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.430> set<00:02:18.000> our

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
shutter priority mode and set our

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.330 
shutter priority mode and set our
shutter<00:02:18.420> speed<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.200> or<00:02:19.440> two<00:02:19.650> seconds<00:02:20.160> and

shutter speed to one or two seconds and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.130 
shutter speed to one or two seconds and
the<00:02:20.700> camera<00:02:21.060> would<00:02:21.180> choose<00:02:21.390> an<00:02:21.570> aperture<00:02:21.840> for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the camera would choose an aperture for

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.440 
the camera would choose an aperture for
us<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:23.550> would<00:02:23.700> take<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.910> photo<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
us and then we would take a photo that

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.330 
us and then we would take a photo that
looks<00:02:24.510> something<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.260> what<00:02:26.160> this

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
looks something like this what this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.400 
looks something like this what this
means<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.240> choose<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.780> mode<00:02:28.020> that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
means is that you choose the mode that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.470 
means is that you choose the mode that
gives<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:29.070> control<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.700> variable<00:02:30.300> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
gives you control of the variable that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.620 
gives you control of the variable that
is<00:02:30.600> most<00:02:30.870> important<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.370> photo<00:02:32.640> so

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
is most important to you in the photo so

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.480 
is most important to you in the photo so
if<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.930> want<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.200> control<00:02:34.500> depth<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.010> field<00:02:35.280> or

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
if you want to control depth of field or

through the aperture you would choose

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.720 
through the aperture you would choose
aperture<00:02:39.930> priority<00:02:40.170> mode<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.370> want<00:02:41.670> to

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.820 
sounds intimidating but manual mode is
not<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.940> scary<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.630> back<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.350> day<00:03:13.530> there

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
not that scary and back in the day there

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.880 
not that scary and back in the day there
was<00:03:14.010> no<00:03:14.070> auto<00:03:14.610> all<00:03:14.970> cameras<00:03:15.870> were<00:03:16.080> manual<00:03:16.650> I

a<00:03:21.390> bit<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.170> fib<00:03:22.470> because<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.370> I'm<00:03:23.519> not<00:03:23.550> using

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
a bit of a fib because if I'm not using

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.850 
a bit of a fib because if I'm not using
flash<00:03:24.209> which<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.870> haven't<00:03:25.170> gotten<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.470> yet

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
primary concern however a manual mode is

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.690 
primary concern however a manual mode is
a<00:03:36.420> fantastic<00:03:37.200> mode<00:03:37.350> for<00:03:37.620> learning<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.280> in

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
a fantastic mode for learning in and in

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
about manual mode and how to use it for

controls for all of our shooting modes

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.250 
controls for all of our shooting modes
so<00:03:47.730> when<00:03:48.030> you're<00:03:48.120> going<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.269> take<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.510> photo<00:03:48.810> one

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
so when you're going to take a photo one

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.780 
so when you're going to take a photo one
of<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> first<00:03:49.680> decisions<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.610> make

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
of the first decisions you have to make

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.190 
of the first decisions you have to make
is<00:03:50.970> which<00:03:51.150> mode<00:03:51.420> you're<00:03:51.630> going<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.810> shoot<00:03:52.019> in

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
is which mode you're going to shoot in

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.040 
is which mode you're going to shoot in
and<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:53.040> confess<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.730> never<00:03:54.030> shoot<00:03:54.390> in<00:03:54.570> full<00:03:54.810> auto

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
and I confess I never shoot in full auto

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.080 
and I confess I never shoot in full auto
or<00:03:55.350> program<00:03:55.860> auto<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.580> leaves<00:03:56.760> me<00:03:56.910> with

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
or program auto so that leaves me with

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.150 
or program auto so that leaves me with
three<00:03:57.480> choices<00:03:58.019> either<00:03:58.260> aperture<00:03:58.920> priority

can take control of the aperture or the
shutter<00:04:46.290> but<00:04:46.860> we<00:04:46.980> still<00:04:47.220> have<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.550> be<00:04:47.640> aware<00:04:47.760> of

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
shutter but we still have to be aware of

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.940 
shutter but we still have to be aware of
the<00:04:48.120> limitations<00:04:48.720> of<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.930> camera<00:04:49.350> let's<00:04:49.710> say

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
the limitations of the camera let's say

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.500 
the limitations of the camera let's say
you're<00:04:50.100> trying<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.430> take<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.670> picture<00:04:50.790> in<00:04:51.330> low

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
you're trying to take a picture in low

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.630 
you're trying to take a picture in low
light<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.500> want<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.800> sharp<00:04:53.130> so<00:04:53.580> you

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
light and you want it sharp so you

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.730 
light and you want it sharp so you
switch<00:04:53.970> into<00:04:54.120> shutter<00:04:54.450> priority<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.200> you<00:04:55.500> set

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
switch into shutter priority and you set

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.440 
switch into shutter priority and you set
your<00:04:55.860> shutter<00:04:56.010> to<00:04:56.220> one<00:04:56.400> fiftieth<00:04:56.790> of<00:04:56.940> a<00:04:57.030> second

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
your shutter to one fiftieth of a second

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.840 
your shutter to one fiftieth of a second
the<00:04:58.290> problem<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.920> if<00:04:59.190> there<00:04:59.400> is<00:04:59.430> not<00:04:59.820> enough

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
the problem is if there is not enough

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.840 
the problem is if there is not enough
light<00:05:00.330> in<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.960> space<00:05:01.100> your<00:05:02.100> camera<00:05:02.490> will<00:05:02.670> not

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
light in the space your camera will not

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.610 
light in the space your camera will not
physically<00:05:03.480> be<00:05:03.600> able<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.840> open<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.290> aperture

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
physically be able to open the aperture

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.100 
physically be able to open the aperture
wide<00:05:05.040> enough<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.430> take<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.970> photo<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.960> could

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
wide enough to take the photo you could

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.530 
wide enough to take the photo you could
then<00:05:07.320> turn<00:05:07.680> your<00:05:07.800> ISO<00:05:08.310> setting<00:05:08.670> up<00:05:08.850> to

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
then turn your ISO setting up to

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.450 
then turn your ISO setting up to
increase<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.140> sensitivity<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.100> camera

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
increase the sensitivity of the camera

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.910 
increase the sensitivity of the camera
sensor<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:12.120> light<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.630> then<00:05:13.380> you<00:05:13.770> would<00:05:13.890> be

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
sensor to light and then you would be

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.980 
sensor to light and then you would be
able<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.280> take<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.520> photo<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:15.180> that<00:05:15.480> light<00:05:15.720> at

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
able to take a photo in that light at

150 of a second with an aperture that
