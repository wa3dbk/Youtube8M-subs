00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.839
 late 20th century, Soviet scientists again 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.300
 back to the idea of ​​creating a geophysical 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.080
 weapons near Nizhny Novgorod 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.250
 secret station was built sura 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.400
 irradiating with electromagnetic waves 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.020
 the atmosphere she created ionized 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.600
 clouds with their help 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.050
 my studied them but also learned to create 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.710
 lightning his lab in his 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.230
 research 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.440
 Avramenko achieved a colossal result 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.239
 you see unique footage of experiments 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.239
 with plasma formations 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 It turns out the most dangerous enemy of the pilots 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.770
 fireballs can be put on 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.540
 aviation service surrounding a plasma plane 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.120
 can dramatically reduce the resistance 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.100
 air and increase the flight speed in 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 dozens of times 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.150
 plasma aerodynamics opened in front 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.870
 Russian aviation fantastic 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.449
 opportunities 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.580
 it turns out you can fly around the globe for 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.090
 few minutes and that's not all 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.470
 learning opportunities 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.880
 atmospheric energy another plane 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 losing lift 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 I get a controlled corkscrew and 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270
 collapses under the influence of huge 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.060
 overload the same thing happens with 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.190
 missile warhead she stumbles 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.800
 starts to spin and breaks 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.509
 own kinetic energy to 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.410
 sorry the Americans abandoned 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.410
 participation in the project 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.150
 1992 at the artillery range 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.240
 Vladimir 30 in the strictest conditions 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.750
 secrets went through the first shooting you and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.970
 plasma gun tests 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.560
 special ground generator and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.990
 focused the last corridor in 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.090
 which flew carefully when shot 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.159
 artillery shell under action 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.220
 plasma ammunition changed trajectory 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.100
 flight and went away from the goal 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.740
 the results of these tests were long 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 closed creeps top secret
