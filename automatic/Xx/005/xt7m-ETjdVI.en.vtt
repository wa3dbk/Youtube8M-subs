00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.800
 hello I am christian solmecke 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.810
 lawyer and partner of the cologne 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 law firm wilde beuger &amp; 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.580
 Solmecke and this is my new mouse in 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.860
 the last videos have been a lot 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.250
 speculated discusses and comments yes 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.770
 This is a mouse that is vertical 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.770
 just for being there 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.630
 mouse serves and not so should the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.949
 shoulder already really finds quite 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.319
 nice to have after two three 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.089
 get used to it there so this is 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:37.800
 speculation and discussions like this 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:42.019
 here the enlightenment stops 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.839
 a new mouse a vertical mouse from 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.309
 evolution good but that should not be that 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.929
 be the topic of our videos but that 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.600
 theme from today's videos is 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.420
 microsoft and the new agb of windows 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.069
 8 that are ineffective says that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.170
 Higher Regional Court Hamburg 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.819
 why are the general ones 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.280
 terms of business of microsoft 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:05.040
 ineffective now because they go too far and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 the customer partly too much 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.940
 I want to read aloud what 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.920
 in the general terms and conditions 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.910
 can be found from windows 8 there is it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 besides they are entitled the 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.280
 software so windows 8 on one 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.700
 to transfer someone's computer 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.730
 other things, if she is the first 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.410
 licensee of the software are and b the 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.350
 new users to the terms of this 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.630
 contract agrees that means windows 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.390
 8 you can only continue once 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.920
 so be the first to sell the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.410
 may sell again afterwards 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.590
 You are not allowed to resell there 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.540
 The Higher Regional Court of Hamburg said that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 that does not hurt that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.770
 so-called exhaustion principle of 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.780
 in copyright terms means who once something 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.550
 he bought that too 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.610
 resell said simplistic 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.040
 and here microsoft says you can only 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.550
 reselling it is illegal 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.960
 and microsoft will probably follow suit 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.090
 the general terms and conditions 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.040
 change that is not so simple if 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.610
 which are somehow settled on it 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.180
 pressed on a cd then you have to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.440
 the volumes if you are on cd 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.450
 general business conditions 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.500
 exchange accordingly so not so 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.350
 simple but the farewell is a 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.290
 concrete need for action for microsoft 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.120
 So you see again we look 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.010
 We like the general ones 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.750
 terms and conditions of us 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.610
 American companies and the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.010
 are often not quite compatible 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.750
 with German right and so much the better 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.730
 one or the other fights against it 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.280
 and keep the thumb on it and then you 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.800
 just here you will find too much 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.470
 imprinted so much must not be 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.360
 Of course we will continue the 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.580
 market watch since facebook google 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.690
 microsoft amazon see what the Sun 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.790
 drive and will inform you 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.160
 if anything be interesting 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.750
 discover you are in any case always the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.000
 first who experience it looks you too 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.920
 still our other videos to the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.060
 similar topics have been filmed and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.250
 subscribe to our channel 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.680
 because we are happy about every new fan 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.030
 for the time being, thank you for watching 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.860
 maybe he still tells us in the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.959
 what he comments on such 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.880
 conditions of use 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.320
 and I would be happy if you too 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.320
 be back next time
