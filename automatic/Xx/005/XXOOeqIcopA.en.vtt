00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 Street 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.940
 looking for his second final in these 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.940
 world 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.890
 and I do not know if you have arms your fence is 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.000
 good or bad 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.710
 for melanie I think we have a 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.660
 swimmer who is world champion 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.930
 true is time 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.029
 medieval very very scary and that is going to 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.189
 run a lot but that also 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.189
 I should run much more a day 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.260
 In this challenge, the world returned 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.589
 with a very fast dye 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.489
 this is practically the last long 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.489
 is beyond the reach of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.540
 the village team record and so on 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.700
 since we had time to clear 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.570
 well it's fine from the head of the race 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.540
 controlling what you can do here 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.420
 host that is can be the great reference 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:05.830
 keep an eye on the other side of the palm tree 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.590
 kylie palmer the most important women 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.180
 I was trying to pass through 100 meilan 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.720
 and in second position 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.720
 at par 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.740
 look ni 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.289
 has left by all now there is no doubt and 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.240
 they have fighting the Spanish with the 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.030
 blue cap goes first 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.520
 position dance and heads to that flip 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.189
 in first position 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.090
 keep rhythms of 29 degrees you can 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.090
 be doing the equipment 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.909
 29 and said he wants to get off 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.909
 clearly that has more more and more 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.020
 now 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.020
 d 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.810
 very fast 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.539
 with the year 156 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.370
 British 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.370
 29 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.110
 but my god how is he in the mood what 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 barbarity 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 156 1956 up to 400 because it will not go down 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.470
 almost 200 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.540
 how he has managed the race 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.590
 rolando the two favorites do to the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.069
 Australian and August but kept at 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.069
 scared post 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:08.069
 father of 156 19 9 is an authentic 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.049
 barbarity is not is certainly not the 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.810
 bestial what melanie just did 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.560
 as he has left moment of moments the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.560
 record of spain 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.160
 because the roof is now because even 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.610
 when the head arrives if more comes 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.610
 flat 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.440
 I was saying that I was already seeing 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.440
 and the mother 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.910
 we'll see 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.239
 I was already looking for the look and the 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.579
 I was living in what atrocity there the 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.800
 we have airships heading towards 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.440
 that position and you are next to yours 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.580
 until the hug that makes us in solitude 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.300
 or I to her why 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.300
 what you have done 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.750
 I like it 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.620
 this day is insane 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.329
 156 and you asked 57 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.680
 and we are left with our mouths open 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.060
 every time you throw yourself in the pool I do not know 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.150
 if it is also surprising you 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.590
 same or not very much because with the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.040
 I hope I can reflect them 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.770
 in the water 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.400
 and also that at no time lose 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.080
 force and that's super important is 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.550
 say we see mostly a thousand and more 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.120
 not only physically strong but 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.100
 it also gets us heads if we also 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.550
 it helps that finding me too and the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.190
 400 I knew I had to go back to 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 do 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.410
 and now what or what is the roof that 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.500
 you propose for the final nothing I do not know 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.370
 nothing at the end and fight it 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.150
 if it were to win then nothing so you 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.600
 It goes very well 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.600
 thank you very much enjoy
