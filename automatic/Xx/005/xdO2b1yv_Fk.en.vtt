lately<00:00:18.810> because<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.800> got<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.430> one<00:00:20.490> instead<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
lately because I got this one instead of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.269 
lately because I got this one instead of
an<00:00:21.090> otterbox<00:00:21.570> cuz<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.619> stores<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.010> went<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
an otterbox cuz the stores I went to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.640 
an otterbox cuz the stores I went to
didn't<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.789> them<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.900> best<00:00:25.170> fly<00:00:25.380> they<00:00:25.590> were

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
didn't have them like best fly they were

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.830 
didn't have them like best fly they were
sold<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.580> my<00:00:26.699> verizon<00:00:27.300> stores<00:00:27.570> near

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
sold out one of my verizon stores near

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.380 
sold out one of my verizon stores near
me<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.109> didn't<00:00:28.320> even<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.500> him<00:00:28.830> yet<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
me they didn't even have him yet so I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.820 
me they didn't even have him yet so I
think<00:00:30.720> I'll<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:31.050> getting<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:31.619> soon

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
think I'll be getting one of them soon

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
think I'll be getting one of them soon
but<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.520> needed<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> case<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.420> protection

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
but I just needed a case for protection

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.049 
but I just needed a case for protection
cuz<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.290> would<00:00:34.380> suck<00:00:34.620> if<00:00:35.420> my<00:00:36.420> phone<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.690> broke

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
cuz I would suck if my phone just broke

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.440 
cuz I would suck if my phone just broke
that<00:00:39.059> would<00:00:39.180> suck<00:00:39.360> really<00:00:39.570> bad<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.850> yeah<00:00:41.850> this

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
that would suck really bad so yeah this

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.760 
that would suck really bad so yeah this
was<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.840> thirty<00:00:43.170> dollars<00:00:43.649> um<00:00:44.989> at<00:00:45.989> first<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
was like thirty dollars um at first I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.459 
was like thirty dollars um at first I
was<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.160> skeptical<00:00:47.660> cuz<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.989> mean<00:00:49.230> didn't

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
was kind of skeptical cuz I mean didn't

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.529 
was kind of skeptical cuz I mean didn't
really<00:00:49.649> look<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.860> nice<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> case<00:00:50.640> plus

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
really look that nice of a case plus

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
really look that nice of a case plus
it's<00:00:51.750> somewhat<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> hard<00:00:52.710> case<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> can

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it's somewhat of a hard case so I can

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.750 
it's somewhat of a hard case so I can
imagine<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.300> snapping<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> easily

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
imagine it just snapping kind of easily

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
imagine it just snapping kind of easily
but<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> tested<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.629> durability<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
but I tested kind of the durability I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.200 
but I tested kind of the durability I
mean<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:01.230> pretty<00:01:01.500> bendable<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
mean it's pretty bendable not like it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.910 
mean it's pretty bendable not like it's
never<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.899> iphones<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> bend

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
never gonna have iphones going to bend

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
never gonna have iphones going to bend
that<00:01:05.010> way<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:06.380> whatever<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.780> just<00:01:09.780> before

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that way but whatever so of just before

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600 
that way but whatever so of just before
i<00:01:10.140> start<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> phone<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.460> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
i start and put it on the phone I just

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.609 
i start and put it on the phone I just
like<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> say<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.659> case<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.350> kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> hard<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
like to say this case is kind of hard to

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
like to say this case is kind of hard to
get<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.310> off<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.549> phone<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
get on or off the phone that's a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.100 
get on or off the phone that's a
downside<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:20.340> doesn't<00:01:20.759> add<00:01:21.000> pretty<00:01:21.990> much

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
downside but it doesn't add pretty much

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.800 
downside but it doesn't add pretty much
any<00:01:22.350> bulk<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.159> phone<00:01:23.280> except<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.299> tiny<00:01:24.570> bit

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
any bulk to the phone except a tiny bit

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.289 
any bulk to the phone except a tiny bit
for<00:01:25.110> drop<00:01:25.500> protection<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> lands<00:01:26.369> like

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
for drop protection if it lands like

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
for drop protection if it lands like
that<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> ground<00:01:28.110> otherwise<00:01:28.950> there's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that on the ground otherwise there's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.630 
that on the ground otherwise there's
like<00:01:29.369> nothing<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> guess<00:01:31.560> I'll<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.740> put<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
like nothing so I guess I'll just put it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
like nothing so I guess I'll just put it
in<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.090> i'll<00:01:33.240> show<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.479> how<00:01:33.600> long<00:01:33.869> it

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
guess take it off which takes a little

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.449 
guess take it off which takes a little
while<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.799> like<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.250> take<00:03:56.430> that

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
while so it's like you have to take that

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:04.430 
while so it's like you have to take that
off<00:03:59.000> God<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:01.049> take<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:02.099> off<00:04:03.260> then<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.319> have

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
off God to take that off then you have

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.789 
off God to take that off then you have
to<00:04:04.530> take<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.859> out<00:04:04.980> now<00:04:05.730> normally<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:07.290> doesn't

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799

really<00:04:08.040> take<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.340> long<00:04:10.040> but<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.340> kind<00:04:11.700> of

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760
