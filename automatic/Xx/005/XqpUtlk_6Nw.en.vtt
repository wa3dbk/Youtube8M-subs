week we in Europe we don't we never club
race<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.690> biggest<00:01:30.930> thing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
race I think that's the biggest thing

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.540 
race I think that's the biggest thing
they<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.680> out<00:01:31.830> to<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> track<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.310> they

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
they go out to the track and they

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.020 
they go out to the track and they
actually<00:01:32.729> race<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.780> mean<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:35.130> America<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.790> seems

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
actually race I mean in America it seems

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
actually race I mean in America it seems
to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.300> quality<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.110> quantity<00:01:37.380> over<00:01:37.950> quality<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
to be quality or quantity over quality I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.029 
to be quality or quantity over quality I
think<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.240> America's<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.990> yeah<00:01:40.259> just

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
think that in America's at yeah just

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.749 
think that in America's at yeah just
years<00:01:41.880> added<00:01:42.300> of<00:01:42.450> us<00:01:42.630> especially<00:01:43.410> in<00:01:43.950> track

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
years added of us especially in track

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.570 
years added of us especially in track
condition<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.530> way<00:01:46.740> they<00:01:46.979> are<00:01:47.009> seeing

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
condition so and the way they are seeing

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.330 
condition so and the way they are seeing
the<00:01:48.300> industry<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.050> think<00:01:49.410> it's<00:01:49.590> mainly<00:01:49.830> because

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the industry I think it's mainly because

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.710 
the industry I think it's mainly because
of<00:01:51.560> experiences<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.149> first<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.479> think

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
of experiences and first I think

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
of experiences and first I think
American<00:01:55.170> driver<00:01:55.410> we<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.740> first<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.490> real

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
American driver we are first the real

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.270 
American driver we are first the real
fast<00:01:57.390> professional<00:01:57.780> Americans<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.890> better

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
fast professional Americans get better

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
fast professional Americans get better
practice<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.030> their<00:02:00.240> tracks<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.810> way

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
practice because their tracks are way

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.960 
practice because their tracks are way
more<00:02:01.259> difficult<00:02:01.680> their<00:02:02.490> tracks<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:02.940> more

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
more difficult their tracks are more

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.359 
more difficult their tracks are more
challenging<00:02:03.570> than<00:02:03.600> ours<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.140> Europe<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:05.340> I

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
challenging than ours in Europe so I

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.340 
challenging than ours in Europe so I
think<00:02:05.490> technically<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> drivers<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.929> America

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
think technically the drivers in America

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.560 
think technically the drivers in America
are<00:02:07.440> better<00:02:07.649> than<00:02:07.860> Europeans<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.239> think

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
are better than Europeans do you think

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.900 
are better than Europeans do you think
we<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:10.050> Europeans<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.709> finally<00:02:11.430> ready<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
we as Europeans are finally ready to

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.729 
we as Europeans are finally ready to
claim<00:02:12.360> back<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.720> world<00:02:12.870> championship<00:02:13.350> of

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
claim back the world championship of

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.520 
claim back the world championship of
course<00:02:14.070> why<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.930> european<00:02:16.350> guys

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
course why not I think the european guys

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.650 
course why not I think the european guys
are<00:02:16.769> really<00:02:16.920> fast<00:02:17.220> right<00:02:17.430> now<00:02:17.489> they<00:02:17.970> prepared

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
are really fast right now they prepared

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.420 
are really fast right now they prepared
a<00:02:18.840> lot<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.320> race<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.010> will<00:02:20.160> even

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
a lot for this race and they will even

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.400 
a lot for this race and they will even
get<00:02:20.700> more<00:02:20.910> prepared<00:02:21.239> for<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> world<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.380> i

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
get more prepared for the world so i

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.380 
get more prepared for the world so i
think<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.739> have<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.040> good<00:02:23.190> drivers<00:02:23.670> maybe

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
think we have really good drivers maybe

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.569 
think we have really good drivers maybe
now<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.140> 10<00:02:25.410> or<00:02:25.560> 15<00:02:25.890> drivers<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.400> can

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
now we have 10 or 15 drivers you can

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.729 
now we have 10 or 15 drivers you can
compete<00:02:27.329> with<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.660> American<00:02:28.140> fastest<00:02:28.560> guys

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
compete with the American fastest guys

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.740 
compete with the American fastest guys
in<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:29.010> world<00:02:29.130> nice<00:02:29.760> getting<00:02:30.269> closer<00:02:30.510> because

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
in the world nice getting closer because

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.350 
in the world nice getting closer because
now<00:02:31.079> we<00:02:31.140> understand<00:02:31.769> more<00:02:31.950> how<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.820> works<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
now we understand more how it works and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.840 
now we understand more how it works and
also<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.440> fact<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.709> now<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.190> example<00:02:35.280> just

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
also the fact that now for example just

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.630 
also the fact that now for example just
we<00:02:36.390> look<00:02:36.959> at<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> top<00:02:37.440> 18<00:02:37.980> at<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.160> moment<00:02:38.519> in

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
we look at the top 18 at the moment in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.910 
we look at the top 18 at the moment in
euros<00:02:39.030> thou<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.720> Pro<00:02:40.049> drivers<00:02:40.110> normally<00:02:40.890> a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
euros thou or Pro drivers normally a

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.970 
euros thou or Pro drivers normally a
spot<00:02:41.250> maybe<00:02:41.459> two<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:41.820> three<00:02:42.420> drivers<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.680> yes

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
spot maybe two or three drivers so yes

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.590 
spot maybe two or three drivers so yes
it's<00:02:44.220> getting<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.640> more<00:02:44.760> professional<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
it's getting to be more professional and
