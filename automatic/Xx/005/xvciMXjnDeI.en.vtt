success and you get basically a total
point<00:03:43.250> on<00:03:43.459> or<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> total<00:03:44.330> amount<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.780> points

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
point on or a total amount of points

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.750 
point on or a total amount of points
based<00:03:45.290> on<00:03:45.440> whether<00:03:45.740> you<00:03:45.950> had<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.130> success<00:03:46.580> or

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
based on whether you had a success or

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.900 
based on whether you had a success or
not<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.090> then<00:03:47.180> also<00:03:47.330> your<00:03:47.570> time<00:03:48.610> go<00:03:49.610> ahead<00:03:49.790> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
not and then also your time go ahead and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.630 
not and then also your time go ahead and
continue<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.660> could<00:03:50.840> see<00:03:51.050> now<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.640> the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
continue you could see now the the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.430 
continue you could see now the the
professor's<00:03:53.209> solution<00:03:53.780> or<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:53.990> can<00:03:54.230> just<00:03:54.260> go

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
professor's solution or I can just go

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.610 
professor's solution or I can just go
ahead<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.800> continue<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:56.660> if<00:03:56.810> it<00:03:56.959> gets<00:03:57.140> if<00:03:57.440> it's

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
ahead and continue so if it gets if it's

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.199 
ahead and continue so if it gets if it's
a<00:03:57.709> really<00:03:57.890> complicated<00:03:58.400> one<00:03:58.850> you<00:03:59.060> can

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
a really complicated one you can

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.850 
a really complicated one you can
actually<00:03:59.540> see<00:03:59.780> what<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.080> professor<00:04:00.650> wanted

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
actually see what the professor wanted

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.680 
actually see what the professor wanted
to<00:04:00.980> do<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:01.280> this<00:04:01.459> one<00:04:01.670> again<00:04:02.150> I'm<00:04:02.300> not<00:04:02.420> going<00:04:02.600> to

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
to do so this one again I'm not going to

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.760 
to do so this one again I'm not going to
go<00:04:02.870> through<00:04:03.110> every<00:04:03.470> single<00:04:04.150> every<00:04:05.150> single

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
go through every single every single

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.320 
go through every single every single
task<00:04:06.770> I<00:04:07.100> just<00:04:07.340> wanted<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:07.640> show<00:04:07.820> you<00:04:07.850> main<00:04:08.180> I

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
task I just wanted to show you main I

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
each one are like that so it looks like

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.750 
each one are like that so it looks like
so<00:04:13.970> again<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.239> have<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.570> few<00:04:14.930> an<00:04:15.860> even<00:04:16.250> reads<00:04:16.520> what

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
so again I have a few an even reads what

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.390 
so again I have a few an even reads what
this<00:04:16.910> one<00:04:17.299> was<00:04:17.630> about<00:04:17.890> let's<00:04:18.890> see<00:04:19.070> make<00:04:19.280> sure

any<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.830> other<00:04:48.979> levels<00:04:49.539> let's<00:04:50.539> see<00:04:52.570> okay

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
any of the other levels let's see okay

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.290 
any of the other levels let's see okay
yeah<00:04:53.780> cool<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:55.130> here's<00:04:55.460> basically<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:59.120> one

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
that I just went to was that I guess

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.180

easier or even I'm better yet I'll just
go<00:05:13.639> to<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.820> very<00:05:14.030> first<00:05:14.120> one<00:05:18.190> actually<00:05:19.190> a

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
go to the very first one actually a

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.480 
go to the very first one actually a
puzzle<00:05:21.940> you<00:05:22.940> can<00:05:23.840> start<00:05:24.110> so<00:05:24.770> this<00:05:24.949> is<00:05:25.099> the<00:05:25.220> very

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
puzzle you can start so this is the very

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.170 
puzzle you can start so this is the very
first<00:05:25.849> experiment<00:05:27.039> basically<00:05:28.039> says<00:05:28.370> start

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
first experiment basically says start

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.210 
first experiment basically says start
with<00:05:29.380> something<00:05:30.380> simple<00:05:30.710> get<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.979> football

with a soccer ball into the basketball

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.529 
with a soccer ball into the basketball
hoop<00:05:36.680> so<00:05:36.919> looks<00:05:37.520> like<00:05:37.610> I<00:05:37.760> just<00:05:37.940> need<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.419> add

hoop so looks like I just need to add

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.540 
hoop so looks like I just need to add
another<00:05:38.750> plank<00:05:39.260> here<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:39.800> again<00:05:40.099> this<00:05:40.220> is<00:05:40.430> the

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
another plank here and again this is the
