00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.829
 you are all very well then I say 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.810
 we find ourselves again for a 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.000
 new gainey news and today we're going 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.310
 continue to talk about assassin's creed 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.910
 rogge the game that will come out only on 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.829
 360 and ps3 is today a good and 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.030
 a bad new 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.769
 unfortunately for you the bad 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.079
 new is bad news but 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.400
 the good news is it is not 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.110
 not for everyone at least for 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.239
 those who do not like to be spoiled 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.879
 so I'll tell you that at the moment of the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.979
 video there will be a little spoil on the 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.809
 game so here we will start with the 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.659
 bad news is good is that 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.010
 assassin's creed Rogge will have no 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:02.570
 multiplayer nor cooperative mode 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.509
 I do not know why there is no 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.650
 cooperation nor the multiplayer 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.689
 personally me it does not make me 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.970
 great thing since I never played 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.460
 to multiplayer unfortunately there are some 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.340
 still some who does it 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.659
 was playing to kill assassins finally 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.030
 players around the world 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.420
 so here it was the bad news 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.440
 no multiplayer no cooperation 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.640
 pity but hey it is already I paint 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.800
 if you want my opinion I find it 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200
 already very very well who we need them 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.490
 make a murderer's creed for those 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 who are still on the old 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.820
 consoles 360 and ps3 because for those 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.560
 that would finally arise I I'm going out of 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.460
 my subject but I just know for you 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.200
 inform 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.600
 for those who would not be aware 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:53.330
 well the assassin's developers 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.909
 creed unity we say that there that assassin's 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.830
 creed unity could not go out on 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.710
 the old consoles because the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.890
 old consoles was not how 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.860
 to say was not fit to go to tolerate 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.750
 the game so I can say so here's no 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.670
 multiplayer no cooperation so we 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.860
 will then go to the good news 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.379
 be careful there will be a spoil on the game 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.870
 for those who want to know what 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.080
 happens in the game I will ask you 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.319
 to leave the video so watch out for 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 3.2 to his supporters good news we have 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.150
 a little info on the story mode 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.569
 so the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.290
 game will run precisely between 10 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.930
 752 and 10,761 our character will only be 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.579
 not a Templar during the whole game and 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.299
 we can discover a certain 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.079
 moment of the campaign the moment when everything 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.189
 Rocking 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:54.129
 and it would be around the year 10 754 so two 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.750
 years in history we will have a 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.359
 small period where we will be a 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.359
 assassin and we can discover this 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:04.150
 happened between our friend that we 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.489
 let's embody essays and his pals if 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.180
 I can tell his assassin pals who 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.019
 betrayed him 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.129
 for some reason so that's it 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.859
 it's a little bit of everything for this little girl 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.269
 video that was extremely fast it's 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.650

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.780

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.659

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.519

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.379
 wanted to communicate in a new 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.200
 gaming we hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.549
 that you are not too stressed that he 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.989
 there is no multiplayer mode or 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.180
 cooperation for those who love 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.030

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.620
