00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
next part the milk tank on the old

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.719 
next part the milk tank on the old
Nespresso<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> big<00:01:45.479> tank<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.049> bit

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
Nespresso the big tank is a little bit

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.569 
Nespresso the big tank is a little bit
bigger<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.320> definitely<00:01:49.770> harder

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
bigger and but it is definitely harder

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.510 
bigger and but it is definitely harder
to<00:01:50.759> clean<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.509> got<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.520> round

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to clean because it got this round

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.830 
to clean because it got this round
corners<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> got<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
corners here and if you got a a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.410 
corners here and if you got a a
dishwater<00:01:57.840> washer<00:01:58.500> no<00:01:58.829> problems<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.180> if

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
dishwater washer no problems here but if

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.999 
dishwater washer no problems here but if
you<00:02:00.540> could<00:02:00.689> want<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.170> clean<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> by<00:02:01.590> hand<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you could want to clean it by hand this

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.810 
you could want to clean it by hand this
is<00:02:02.189> definitely<00:02:02.520> harder<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.540> do<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:05.280> next

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
is definitely harder to do our here next

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.469 
is definitely harder to do our here next
the<00:02:06.450> long<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.899> redesigned<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:09.300> can

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the long it is redesigned it and you can

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.140 
the long it is redesigned it and you can
clean<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.530> easily

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.460 

because<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.569> machine<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.349> bit

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
because of the machine is a little bit

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
because of the machine is a little bit
smaller<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:17.459> also<00:02:18.560> went<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.860> smaller

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
smaller they also went with a smaller

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.650 
smaller they also went with a smaller
milk<00:02:21.090> tank<00:02:21.480> here<00:02:22.940> if<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.060> don't<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.300> some

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
milk tank attached you can just close it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.559 
milk tank attached you can just close it
there's<00:02:28.530> also<00:02:28.890> another<00:02:31.069> ya<00:02:32.069> thingy<00:02:33.060> here<00:02:33.390> to

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
there's also another ya thingy here to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
get hot water out of the machine if you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.920 
get hot water out of the machine if you
don't<00:02:35.459> attach<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.209> milk<00:02:36.390> tank
