fairly thin consistency you do not want

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.320 
fairly thin consistency you do not want
it<00:01:47.260> stiff<00:01:47.560> for<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.100> fact<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.550> once<00:01:49.180> this

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
it stiff for the fact that once this

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.970 
it stiff for the fact that once this
material<00:01:49.570> will<00:01:50.020> take<00:01:50.260> a<00:01:50.290> set<00:01:50.650> then<00:01:50.890> we're

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
material will take a set then we're

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.860 
material will take a set then we're
going<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.130> come<00:01:51.280> back<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.610> break<00:01:51.760> that<00:01:51.970> set<00:01:52.300> we

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
going to come back and break that set we

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.870 
going to come back and break that set we
do<00:01:53.170> not<00:01:53.320> want<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.710> add<00:01:53.830> water<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.550> second

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
do not want to add water to it a second

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.940 
do not want to add water to it a second
time<00:01:55.030> we<00:01:55.810> want<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.050> make<00:01:56.170> sure<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.470> we<00:01:56.560> mix<00:01:56.800> it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
time we want to make sure that we mix it

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.760 
time we want to make sure that we mix it
spin<00:01:57.370> enough<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.730> first<00:01:57.910> time<00:01:58.560> we'll<00:01:59.560> mix

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
spin enough the first time we'll mix

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.940 
spin enough the first time we'll mix
that<00:01:59.830> and<00:01:59.980> just<00:02:00.280> chill<00:02:00.430> that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.210 

you<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.069> see<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.429> consistency<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.920> fairly

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
you can see this consistency is fairly

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.240 
you can see this consistency is fairly
thin<00:02:12.580> still<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.989> when<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.319> takes<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:15.010> set

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
thin still and when that takes a set

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.830 
thin still and when that takes a set
initial<00:02:15.819> an<00:02:15.880> initial<00:02:16.239> set<00:02:16.420> will<00:02:16.569> come<00:02:16.690> back

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
initial an initial set will come back

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.600 
initial an initial set will come back
and<00:02:17.080> break<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.410> set<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.860> 2<00:02:21.040> mm

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
and break that set this is the 2 mm

and break that set this is the 2 mm
product<00:02:21.970> we've<00:02:22.090> mixed<00:02:22.390> before<00:02:22.540> we've<00:02:22.930> let

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
product we've mixed before we've let

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.390 
product we've mixed before we've let
this<00:02:23.200> sit<00:02:23.440> about<00:02:23.590> 10<00:02:23.860> minutes<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.280> it's

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
this sit about 10 minutes and it's

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.370 
this sit about 10 minutes and it's
taking<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.760> initial<00:02:25.090> set<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:25.959> see<00:02:26.170> that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
taking the initial set you can see that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.680 
taking the initial set you can see that
how<00:02:26.500> stiff<00:02:26.800> it's<00:02:26.980> got<00:02:27.220> at<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.120> point<00:02:28.239> all<00:02:28.660> we

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
how stiff it's got at this point all we

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.390 
how stiff it's got at this point all we
want<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.620> not<00:02:29.650> want<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.069> add<00:02:30.190> more

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
want to do we do not want to add more

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.309 
want to do we do not want to add more
water<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:31.239> we'll<00:02:31.360> do<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.540> we'll<00:02:31.660> just<00:02:31.870> remix

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
water so we'll do is we'll just remix

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:48.230 
water so we'll do is we'll just remix
this

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.730 

you<00:02:49.240> can<00:02:49.390> see<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.720> breaks<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.230> initial<00:02:50.560> set

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
you can see that breaks the initial set

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.320 
you can see that breaks the initial set
brings<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.160> back<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.550> consistency<00:02:52.240> that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
brings it back to the consistency that

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.520 
brings it back to the consistency that
we<00:02:52.450> want<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.690> have<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.020> be<00:02:53.110> able<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.320> spread

we want to have it to be able to spread

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.260 
we want to have it to be able to spread
the<00:02:53.650> product

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.360 

this<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.080> phone<00:03:02.290> base<00:03:02.530> coded<00:03:02.920> he's

this is the phone base coded he's
this<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:03.879> the<00:03:04.060> we'll<00:03:04.360> add<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.569> cement<00:03:05.409> product

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
this is the we'll add a cement product

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.559 
this is the we'll add a cement product
to<00:03:05.860> this<00:03:06.010> what<00:03:06.700> we<00:03:06.760> want<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:06.970> do<00:03:07.060> with<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.299> is

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
to this what we want to do with this is

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.570 
to this what we want to do with this is
sometimes<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.680> it'll<00:03:08.950> have<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.099> tendency<00:03:09.220> to

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
sometimes that it'll have a tendency to

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.039 
sometimes that it'll have a tendency to
separate<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.330> little<00:03:10.540> bit<00:03:10.690> with<00:03:10.870> an

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.470 

just<00:03:34.159> to<00:03:34.250> make<00:03:34.370> sure<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.700> acrylic<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.180> mixed

just to make sure the acrylic is mixed

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.229 
just to make sure the acrylic is mixed
back<00:03:35.689> into<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.079> material<00:03:36.969> what<00:03:37.969> we're<00:03:38.090> going

Portland cement
that's<00:04:24.650> just<00:04:24.979> approximately<00:04:25.550> 30<00:04:25.759> pounds<00:04:26.180> what

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
that's just approximately 30 pounds what

you're going to need to do at that point

00:04:27.889 --> 00:05:09.570 
you're going to need to do at that point
is<00:04:28.699> to<00:04:28.880> add<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.300> small<00:04:29.539> amount<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.870> water

at<00:05:10.580> this<00:05:10.730> point<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.120> can<00:05:11.240> add<00:05:11.360> another<00:05:11.600> small

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
at this point you can add another small

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.390 
at this point you can add another small
amount<00:05:12.170> of<00:05:12.230> water<00:05:12.380> just<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.830> adjust<00:05:13.280> the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
amount of water just to adjust the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.710 
amount of water just to adjust the

want<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.810> start<00:05:18.050> out<00:05:18.170> with<00:05:18.200> it<00:05:18.440> fairly<00:05:18.590> thin

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
want to start out with it fairly thin

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.290 
want to start out with it fairly thin
because<00:05:19.220> it's<00:05:19.370> going<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.670> take<00:05:19.850> an<00:05:19.970> initial

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
because it's going to take an initial

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:33.470 
because it's going to take an initial
set

strip to a fairly thin consistency and
once<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.360> takes<00:05:37.600> an<00:05:37.750> initial<00:05:38.080> set<00:05:38.290> will

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
once that takes an initial set will

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.440 
once that takes an initial set will
break<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:39.250> set<00:05:39.520> again<00:05:39.760> it<00:05:39.910> should<00:05:40.150> be<00:05:40.180> just

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
break that set again it should be just

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.940 
break that set again it should be just
about<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.840> viscosity<00:05:41.140> that<00:05:41.470> we<00:05:41.530> will<00:05:41.650> not<00:05:41.740> use

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
about the viscosity that we will not use

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:49.070 
about the viscosity that we will not use
to<00:05:42.100> spread
