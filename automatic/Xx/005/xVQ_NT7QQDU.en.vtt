celebrated Mother's Day because Mother's
Day<00:00:11.820> celebrated<00:00:12.300> earlier<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.870> think<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> UK

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
Day celebrated earlier I think in the UK

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.890 
Day celebrated earlier I think in the UK
so<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.519> video<00:00:14.940> probably<00:00:15.150> won't<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.570> any<00:00:15.839> good

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so this video probably won't do any good

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
so this video probably won't do any good
but<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.379> still<00:00:16.470> some<00:00:16.859> great<00:00:17.039> ideas<00:00:17.369> for

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
but it's still some great ideas for

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.700 
but it's still some great ideas for
maybe<00:00:17.820> next<00:00:18.090> Mother's<00:00:18.480> Day<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:19.140> maybe<00:00:19.350> even<00:00:19.439> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
maybe next Mother's Day or maybe even a

something<00:06:07.000> that<00:06:07.210> I<00:06:07.240> think<00:06:07.419> is<00:06:07.659> a<00:06:07.720> nice<00:06:07.990> splurge

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409

something that I think is a nice splurge
for<00:06:08.439> your<00:06:09.009> mom<00:06:09.189> it<00:06:09.490> is<00:06:09.639> the<00:06:09.759> Y<00:06:09.909> style<00:06:10.270> lip<00:06:10.419> gloss

for your mom it is the Y style lip gloss
and<00:06:10.780> number<00:06:11.139> 48<00:06:11.710> so<00:06:12.009> this<00:06:12.220> is<00:06:12.340> what<00:06:12.490> the

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
and number 48 so this is what the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.309 
and number 48 so this is what the
packaging<00:06:12.759> looks<00:06:13.000> like<00:06:13.360> I<00:06:13.539> think<00:06:13.900> one<00:06:14.110> lip

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
packaging looks like I think one lip

gloss<00:06:14.560> is<00:06:14.860> thirty<00:06:15.280> dollars<00:06:15.729> so<00:06:16.090> it's

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
gloss is thirty dollars so it's

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.899 
gloss is thirty dollars so it's
definitely<00:06:17.139> a<00:06:17.289> splurge<00:06:17.650> item<00:06:18.099> and<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.699> color

another thing that I picked up from
Sephora<00:06:40.150> it's<00:06:40.479> really<00:06:40.930> cool<00:06:41.139> it's<00:06:41.349> like<00:06:41.469> a

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
Sephora it's really cool it's like a

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.459 
Sephora it's really cool it's like a
cleansing<00:06:41.979> pad<00:06:42.250> and<00:06:42.550> it's<00:06:43.270> silicone<00:06:43.690> but<00:06:44.379> it

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:44.469 
cleansing pad and it's silicone but it

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.980 
cleansing pad and it's silicone but it
has<00:06:44.620> like<00:06:44.860> little<00:06:45.060> dots<00:06:46.060> on<00:06:46.270> it<00:06:46.300> to<00:06:46.870> help
