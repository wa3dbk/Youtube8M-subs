00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.860
 she greets everyone knows french 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.480
 paradise we find ourselves on the map 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.000
 defender for once again a 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.980
 French exclusivity find because 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.900
 says prestige and me it will be an out 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.850
 of maps and we type hoffman and small 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.490
 little tips to go all the way up 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.620
 from the bridge where we see my cursed friend 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.539
 as small as an ant that makes that 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.730
 skip that's how are the realization 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.310
 of the glitch you will come exactly to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 the place where I am exactly stacked 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.000
 really well take their bearings that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.680
 I take it will be really much more 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.480
 simple for you then he goes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.710
 have to do is jump back and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.210
 while you jumped back 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.640
 and you're in the air you redo 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 a jump to reach 1 the help that is 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.870
 in height we will have property I jump in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.570
 back I jump and I reach the ledge 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.130
 who is right there have you seen so I 'm there 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.660
 really happens the first time because 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.520
 I have a lot of habit 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.890
 once you have control of it, it's 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 really very very very simple so there 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 what we will have to do next is 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
 a double jam on the spot and redo a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.789
 double job on the spot you saw so 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.319
 as soon as I reached the platform that 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.359
 is below we redo a double job 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.109
 to reach the other platform that 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.729
 is a bit higher 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.439
 so already nothing but there you are at 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.779
 above this building you can go 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 on the barrier of this cane we went 

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.329
 everywhere do and explore on 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.159
 building 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.020
 but we are interested in the out 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.520
 of map so for the upper hand you 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.929
 go go on the double pillar 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 jam to go on a barrier 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.039
 invisible redo a double jump for 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 reach another barrier which is a 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.649
 slightly higher 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 you see that already we are really a 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.569
 good spot that is really very very 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.759
 height 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.340
 we have almost the whole map in sight 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.619
 you see 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.420
 that's it, he'll have you 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.770
 have to jump up to seven 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.749
 turns to go out of mind that's 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.829
 really the last step you for there 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.289
 to go it will have to activate your 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.869
 overclocking make a john booth jam 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.969
 boost planing and a last booth so 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.189
 watch it's really going really fast 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.669
 I activate overclocking I run jump 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.099
 boost boost boost and planing and a 

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:03.329
 last booster and we're there so I 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.039
 think I mixed up a bit 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.869
 brushes in while I do them 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.369
 because I comment live I think 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.229
 I mix a little while May 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.510
 listen well at first I will say it again 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.150
 you activate your overclocking you 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.670
 make a jump boost agent boost planing 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.500
 and a last booth we know pretty hard to 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.879
 memorize everything but if you listen 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.010
 many times you will remember 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.019
 it's really easy once you've 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.340
 has mastery so there all that remains 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.409
 to do is jump in october maps 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.970
 but not anywhere should jump well 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.799
 on the rock on which I jump because 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.180
 that if you jump into the water you go 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.190
 to die from kmd this barrier 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.200
 so here is so we'll have to go along 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.540
 long on the map to be able to you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.370
 head to the bridge so do the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.720
 way I am then from 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.790
 there he will have to jump make a john 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.049
 booth to reach this part because 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.090
 that if you go if you walk 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.950
 really follow you to the church is 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.060
 fell into the water and die what I 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.079
 does not stop doing everything from 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.700
 time is why I do not stop 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.769
 to start again because they are not 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.049
 I forget to jump me I'm lying here 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.440
 so I want that I have direction 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.879
 from the bridge 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.709
 again have to do very 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.109
 be careful not to jump here since that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.970
 it's invisible for well jumped on the 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.519
 platform that is here douala double job 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.430
 we arrive on the bridge next to the bridge 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.739
 forgiveness here so from there there is 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 really everything is hard apart from this 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.310
 part but we can go on on the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.540
 mountain that's here so here I'm going 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.370
 show you how to go where there is 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.299
 my cursed friend who is at the very top 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.730
 then jump or stadium boost for 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.599
 already reach the double bridge pillar 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.730
 agent and a boost one reaches 7 parties 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.440
 then double job and a little boost 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.629
 to help you we still arrive 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.760
 times here so we will go up little by little 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.459
 it's really like climbing small 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.489
 to small in the world so still a double 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.019
 jump and we reach this platform 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.879
 then that's going to be I think the most 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.959
 hard since this part we we 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.690
 block it really has happened in 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.160
 height so the same 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.750
 so watch out I'm good 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.230
 concentrate a bit because I'm starting 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.639
 live 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.989
 I do not want to miss double james 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.329
 so that's all I wanted 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.319
 do not stop the miss so I'll 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.000
 restart 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.639
 I'm really sorry the video is going 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.530
 last a little longer so here 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.290
 especially if I miss it really 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.140
 not be good I tried to do the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.060
 As fast as possible 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.769
 here we come I'll spend the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.600
 comments for to get on the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.799
 bridge so here I am really trying 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.520
 to go as fast as possible 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:31.300
 here's a double job again here is where 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:36.290
 where I definitely have no luck 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.030
 here is double jump we get here again a 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.070
 double job and we arrive at the top 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.540
 then we will have to redo a duplicate 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.160
 job to reach this part there not 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.780
 the one here since the invisible 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.200
 to really shift well on this 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:52.790
 part by property or there I missed 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.280
 so I 'm doing them here on this part 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.190
 and last jump last double job 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.750
 forgiveness and we arrive where again missed 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.730
 but decidedly I'm out of luck 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.110
 that's double jump and we get where he 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.180
 is my friend cursed so we're really 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.260
 at the very top of the bridge I'm sorry for 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.490
 all the tests that I put my games 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.290
 comment live to better you 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.940
 explain to explain the best 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.730
 possible forgiveness have you seen we are 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.620
 really very very high this part of 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.330
 bridge is blocking us so it's really 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.710
 pity we could have gone higher 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.820
 so we will try to find a way 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.950
 to go higher but for now 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.890
 it's the zander it's the only place 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.240
 pardon you the highest of the map of 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.000
 game show you a little there I'm going 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.729
 to walk around a bit in out of map 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.169
 so here I repeat it again this glitch 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.900
 was found by that of prestige and 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.220
 I will say it myself but must 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.740
 stop believing that the English is 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.260
 big bosses you do not want to believe us 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.820
 Well, all the other brands have 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.820
 been found on this game on ps3 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.680
 practically have been found by us 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.229
 laughs treats defenders instincts 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.210
 horizons and all the others have been 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.650
 found by us so that's it's just 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.380
 that I had my channel deleted 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.970
 and and that there is no evidence that even 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.560
 if I have emails like what my videos 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.970
 were they claude how good it is 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.039
 me who did upload first so 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.950
 Here are really exclusives 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.630
 of what prestige says and me even if 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.039
 you go on my channel if you go 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.840
 on my channel you will see that it's me 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.220
 who posts first and if you 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.229
 go again on my channel you 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.560
 will know that I am one of the only 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.690
 chains 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.090
 there really is the most glitch and the 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.770
 more excluded on this game so you have to 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.370
 to thank what prestige says because 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.110
 that they are 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.150
 he really finds glitches of 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.940
 sick it's really for me the 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.100
 best glitch 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.990

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.360
 short world this guy it's really

 what to do and where in some sweden 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.870
