read or write CD discs just in case I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.520 
read or write CD discs just in case I
need<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.149> block<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.619> never<00:02:01.740> know

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
need it I block that is you never know

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.880 
need it I block that is you never know
now<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.070> imac<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.240> standard<00:02:06.780> memory<00:02:07.409> is

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
now with the imac the standard memory is

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.370 
now with the imac the standard memory is
a

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.910 
a
eight<00:02:09.160> gigabytes<00:02:09.990> but<00:02:10.990> when<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.170> ordered<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.740> I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
eight gigabytes but when I ordered it I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.050 
eight gigabytes but when I ordered it I
actually<00:02:12.070> got<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.500> 16<00:02:15.210> 16<00:02:16.210> gigabyte<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.960> it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
actually got the 16 16 gigabyte for it

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.500 
actually got the 16 16 gigabyte for it
so<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.360> see<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.630> there<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.850> 16

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
so you can see that there is a 16

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.130 
so you can see that there is a 16
gigabyte<00:02:23.940> yeah<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.380> if<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.710> decide<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:28.140> like

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
gigabyte yeah so if you decide to like

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.360 
gigabyte yeah so if you decide to like
if<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.410> think<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.890> you're<00:02:30.010> going<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.190> add

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
if you think that you're going to add

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.990 
if you think that you're going to add
more<00:02:30.850> memory<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.300> your<00:02:31.990> imac<00:02:32.920> definitely<00:02:33.790> make

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
more memory to your imac definitely make

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.810 
more memory to your imac definitely make
sure<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.750> 16<00:02:35.500> gigabyte<00:02:36.070> when

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
sure that you get the 16 gigabyte when

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.270 
sure that you get the 16 gigabyte when
you<00:02:37.030> actually<00:02:37.210> place<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.840> order<00:02:38.380> just

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
you actually place the order just

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.190 
you actually place the order just
because<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:39.850> very<00:02:40.180> expensive<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.110> very

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
because it's very expensive and very

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.650 
because it's very expensive and very
hard<00:02:41.830> for<00:02:42.790> Apple<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.800> upgrade<00:02:45.030> your<00:02:46.030> memory<00:02:46.420> if

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
hard for Apple to upgrade your memory if

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.860 
hard for Apple to upgrade your memory if
you<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.800> know<00:02:47.830> decide<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.460> do<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.850> after<00:02:49.060> you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
you you know decide to do it after you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.410 
you you know decide to do it after you
know<00:02:50.550> when<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.640> actually<00:02:51.760> got<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.060> computer

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
know when you actually got a computer

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.240 
know when you actually got a computer
and<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.750> want<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.990> add<00:02:53.080> more<00:02:53.230> memory<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.920> so

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
and you want to add more memory to it so

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.540 
and you want to add more memory to it so
yeah<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.210> just<00:02:55.240> make<00:02:55.570> sure<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.810> guys<00:02:56.050> do<00:02:56.350> it

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
yeah so just make sure you guys do it

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.250 
yeah so just make sure you guys do it
when<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:57.820> place<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.330> order<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:58.930> way

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
when you place the order so that way

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.980 
when you place the order so that way
when<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.130> computer<00:03:00.390> comes<00:03:01.390> from<00:03:01.690> their

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
when the computer comes from their

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.890 
when the computer comes from their
factory<00:03:02.620> warehouse<00:03:02.860> they've<00:03:03.790> already<00:03:04.120> you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
factory warehouse they've already you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800 
factory warehouse they've already you
know<00:03:05.010> haven't<00:03:06.010> already<00:03:06.130> built<00:03:06.550> in<00:03:06.730> for<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.090> so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
know haven't already built in for you so

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.500 
know haven't already built in for you so
yeah<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.550> just<00:03:09.610> thought<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.000> make<00:03:10.210> a<00:03:10.240> note<00:03:10.480> of

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
yeah so just thought I make a note of

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.360 
yeah so just thought I make a note of
that<00:03:10.690> because<00:03:11.170> sometimes<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:12.220> know<00:03:12.340> people

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
that because sometimes you know people

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.670 
that because sometimes you know people
decide<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.390> buy<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.630> eight<00:03:13.990> gigs<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.560> they

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
decide to buy the eight gigs and they

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.140 
decide to buy the eight gigs and they
think<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.550> you<00:03:15.700> know<00:03:15.820> in<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:15.970> future

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
think that you know in the future

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.150 
think that you know in the future
they're<00:03:16.570> going<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.780> add<00:03:17.200> more<00:03:17.470> memory<00:03:17.620> but

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
they're going to add more memory but

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.760 
they're going to add more memory but
it's<00:03:18.310> really<00:03:18.610> expensive<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.540> hard<00:03:19.990> for<00:03:20.440> Mac

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
it's really expensive and hard for Mac

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.790 
it's really expensive and hard for Mac
to<00:03:20.950> do<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:22.000> better<00:03:22.450> just<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.440> know<00:03:23.470> have

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
to do it so better just to you know have

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.240 
to do it so better just to you know have
the<00:03:24.250> more<00:03:25.090> memory<00:03:25.480> when<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.980> order<00:03:26.980> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the more memory when you order the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.940 
the more memory when you order the
computer<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.970> first<00:03:28.180> place<00:03:28.590> yeah<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:29.920> I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
computer in the first place yeah so I

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.460 
computer in the first place yeah so I
definitely<00:03:30.430> love<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.540> screen<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:31.900> pretty

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
definitely love it the screen is pretty

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.030 
definitely love it the screen is pretty
baked<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:33.100> just<00:03:34.060> too<00:03:34.210> awesome<00:03:34.330> know<00:03:35.140> that

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
baked and just too awesome know that

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.260 
baked and just too awesome know that
when<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:37.090> use<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:39.310> might<00:03:39.640> find<00:03:40.000> that

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
when you do use it you might find that

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.190 
when you do use it you might find that
you<00:03:40.420> might<00:03:40.750> get<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> headache<00:03:41.800> sore<00:03:42.190> neck<00:03:42.670> pains

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
you might get a headache sore neck pains

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.840 
you might get a headache sore neck pains
because<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:44.410> kind<00:03:44.770> of<00:03:44.920> experience<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.520> when<00:03:45.820> I

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
because I kind of experience that when I

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.480 
because I kind of experience that when I
first<00:03:46.180> got<00:03:46.390> my<00:03:46.450> computer<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:48.010> apparently

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
first got my computer and apparently

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.940 
first got my computer and apparently
numb<00:03:49.150> wasn't<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.600> only<00:03:49.690> one<00:03:49.959> because<00:03:50.800> other

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
numb wasn't the only one because other

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.880 
numb wasn't the only one because other
people<00:03:51.310> felt<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.180> same<00:03:52.450> had<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.350> same<00:03:53.500> issues

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
people felt the same had the same issues

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.580 
people felt the same had the same issues
as<00:03:53.920> well<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.600> can<00:03:55.750> just<00:03:55.870> make<00:03:56.200> minor

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
as well so you can just make minor

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.949 
as well so you can just make minor
adjustments<00:03:56.800> by<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:58.060> know<00:03:58.180> adjusting<00:03:58.720> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
adjustments by you know adjusting the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.620 
adjustments by you know adjusting the
height<00:03:58.990> of<00:03:59.230> your<00:03:59.440> chair<00:04:00.040> or<00:04:00.490> you<00:04:01.360> can<00:04:01.480> also

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630

height of your chair or you can also
move<00:04:01.990> the<00:04:02.050> monitor<00:04:02.740> like<00:04:03.130> back<00:04:04.110> kind<00:04:05.110> of<00:04:05.140> up

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
move the monitor like back kind of up

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.580 
move the monitor like back kind of up
and<00:04:05.410> down<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.180> then<00:04:07.180> also<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.900> know<00:04:08.110> justing

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
smaller you look my browser but now you

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.439 
smaller you look my browser but now you
know<00:04:26.889> after<00:04:27.009> using<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.669> i<00:04:27.729> just<00:04:27.910> kind<00:04:28.360> of

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
know after using it i just kind of

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.550 
know after using it i just kind of
slowly<00:04:28.840> just<00:04:29.289> made<00:04:29.979> it<00:04:30.130> bigger<00:04:30.460> bigger<00:04:31.560> you
