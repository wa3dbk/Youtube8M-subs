 sega 32 bit sega console 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.570
 supposedly to compete with the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.820
 playstation or at the time but 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
 Unfortunately you could not be a 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 competitor at the height of the game of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.050
 cede that originally criticized it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.249
 It was supposed to be a cartridge club. 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.760
 so much that it has here you can see 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:49.769
 increased to cartridge behind and yes 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.229
 on the eve of the launch they put 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.600
 the processor is 3d 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.699
 In this kill so much that the 3d graphics of 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.089
 famous statue are not as good as 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.699
 playstation but 2d graphics 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.649
 of them are very good even from that console 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.689
 that I have a special affection for 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.219
 this console because it was one of those I 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.409

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.490

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.149
