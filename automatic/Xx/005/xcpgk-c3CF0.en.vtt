00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
they're adding in scorpion on the last

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.239 
they're adding in scorpion on the last
one<00:01:55.179> and<00:01:55.359> I<00:01:55.539> mean<00:01:55.569> you<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:55.959> actually<00:01:56.200> have<00:01:56.560> you

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
one and I mean you can actually have you

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.559 
one and I mean you can actually have you
can't<00:01:57.399> have<00:01:57.490> scorpion<00:01:57.999> just<00:01:58.209> fighting

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
can't have scorpion just fighting

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:59.789 
can't have scorpion just fighting
superheroes<00:01:59.109> it<00:01:59.229> makes<00:01:59.439> sense<00:01:59.529> for<00:01:59.619> him<00:01:59.740> to

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
superheroes it makes sense for him to

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.199 
superheroes it makes sense for him to
have<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> counterpart<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.549> know<00:02:00.639> like<00:02:00.759> sub<00:02:00.969> 0

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
have a counterpart you know like sub 0

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.839 
have a counterpart you know like sub 0
so<00:02:01.779> it<00:02:01.959> all<00:02:02.109> makes<00:02:02.139> sense<00:02:02.619> guys<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.459> like<00:02:03.759> I

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
so it all makes sense guys and like I

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.330 
so it all makes sense guys and like I
said<00:02:03.909> this<00:02:04.329> isn't<00:02:04.539> you<00:02:04.990> know<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.889> not<00:02:06.130> as

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
said this isn't you know it's not as

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.880 
said this isn't you know it's not as
official<00:02:06.999> it's<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.659> as<00:02:07.840> incredible<00:02:08.170> as<00:02:08.679> what

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
official it's not as incredible as what

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.740 
official it's not as incredible as what
we<00:02:08.979> got<00:02:09.130> first<00:02:09.520> but<00:02:09.759> apparently<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.360> could<00:02:10.569> be

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
we got first but apparently it could be

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.809 
we got first but apparently it could be
because<00:02:11.260> he<00:02:11.530> says<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.860> he<00:02:11.920> has<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.250> full<00:02:12.550> hex

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
because he says that he has the full hex

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.190 
because he says that he has the full hex
code<00:02:13.060> he<00:02:13.180> just<00:02:13.390> not<00:02:13.510> going<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.690> post<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.050> so

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
code he just not going to post it so

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.870 
code he just not going to post it so
this<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.410> probably<00:02:14.770> just<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.400> was<00:02:15.550> for

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
this is probably just like it was for

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.090 
this is probably just like it was for
the<00:02:16.390> first<00:02:16.540> pack<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.200> I'm<00:02:17.830> excited<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.670> think

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
the first pack so I'm excited I think

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.430 
the first pack so I'm excited I think
legit<00:02:19.520> time<00:02:19.910> will<00:02:20.090> tell<00:02:20.120> but<00:02:20.570> what<00:02:21.320> do<00:02:21.380> you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
legit time will tell but what do you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.900 
legit time will tell but what do you
guys<00:02:21.530> think<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.070> guys<00:02:22.220> think<00:02:22.490> that<00:02:22.670> this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
guys think do you guys think that this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.610 
guys think do you guys think that this
is<00:02:23.120> legit<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:23.870> anything<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.410> think

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
is legit and if anything do you think

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.840 
is legit and if anything do you think
that<00:02:24.740> Nathan<00:02:25.010> got<00:02:25.130> some<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.370> these<00:02:25.430> mixed<00:02:25.730> up

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
that Nathan got some of these mixed up

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.280 
that Nathan got some of these mixed up
i'm<00:02:26.060> pretty<00:02:26.360> sure<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.630> red<00:02:26.750> hood<00:02:26.900> martian

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
i'm pretty sure it's red hood martian

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.770 
i'm pretty sure it's red hood martian
manhunter<00:02:27.460> Palmer<00:02:28.460> girl<00:02:28.670> sub-zero<00:02:29.060> out<00:02:29.540> of

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780

manhunter Palmer girl sub-zero out of
oil<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.080> they'd<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.370> by<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.430> way<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> order<00:02:32.000> is

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
oil so they'd be by the way the order is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.750 
oil so they'd be by the way the order is
also<00:02:32.360> similar<00:02:32.650> how<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.770> goes<00:02:33.920> substrate<00:02:34.700> at

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
also similar how it goes substrate at

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.160 
also similar how it goes substrate at
the<00:02:34.820> end<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.180> scorpions<00:02:35.630> preparing<00:02:35.990> looking

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the end like scorpions preparing looking

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.110
