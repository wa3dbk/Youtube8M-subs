to<00:04:29.220> my<00:04:29.340> post<00:04:29.639> is<00:04:29.820> basically<00:04:30.660> by<00:04:30.960> getting<00:04:31.770> my

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
to my post is basically by getting my

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.920 
to my post is basically by getting my
hair<00:04:32.070> as<00:04:32.160> slow<00:04:32.430> as<00:04:32.490> possible<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.360> then

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
hair as slow as possible and then

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.589 
hair as slow as possible and then
compacting<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.099> matting<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.789> down<00:04:36.060> into<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
compacting it and matting it down into a

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:44.780 
compacting it and matting it down into a
rounded<00:04:37.169> shape

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.420 

now<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:45.850> actual<00:04:46.420> shaping<00:04:47.110> for<00:04:47.770> my<00:04:47.920> pump<00:04:48.220> it

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
now the actual shaping for my pump it

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.280 
now the actual shaping for my pump it
usually<00:04:48.790> takes<00:04:49.030> me<00:04:49.150> about<00:04:49.270> five<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:50.080> ten

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
usually takes me about five to ten

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.380 
usually takes me about five to ten
minutes<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:51.520> will<00:04:51.850> see<00:04:52.030> me<00:04:52.150> playing
