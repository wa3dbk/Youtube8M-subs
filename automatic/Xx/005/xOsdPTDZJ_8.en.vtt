actually<00:02:45.570> has<00:02:45.750> 60%<00:02:46.170> light<00:02:46.710> transition<00:02:47.370> that's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
actually has 60% light transition that's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.580 
actually has 60% light transition that's
three<00:02:48.240> times<00:02:48.420> brighter<00:02:48.780> than<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.200> competitive

rangefinder<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.790> find<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.240> there

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
rangefinder that you can find out there

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.600 
rangefinder that you can find out there
it<00:02:52.020> will<00:02:52.260> range<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:52.740> six<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.370> eight<00:02:53.490> hundred

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
it will range from six to eight hundred

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.330 
it will range from six to eight hundred
yards<00:02:54.470> all<00:02:55.470> right<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.920> things<00:02:56.100> about

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
yards all right one of the things about

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.040 
yards all right one of the things about
this<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.790> has<00:02:56.820> ranges<00:02:57.390> from<00:02:57.540> six<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.960> eight

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
this it has ranges from six to eight

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.570 
this it has ranges from six to eight
hundred<00:02:58.200> yards<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> can<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.340> only<00:02:59.460> use

everybody<00:03:44.370> asks<00:03:44.610> what's<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.910> DNA<00:03:45.450> stand<00:03:45.750> for

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
everybody asks what's the DNA stand for

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.910 
everybody asks what's the DNA stand for
you<00:03:46.170> know<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:47.010> RX<00:03:47.760> full<00:03:48.060> draw<00:03:48.300> DNA

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
you know this is the RX full draw DNA

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.040 
you know this is the RX full draw DNA
the<00:03:49.920> DNA<00:03:50.070> is<00:03:50.489> digitally<00:03:50.970> enhanced<00:03:51.630> accuracy

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
the DNA is digitally enhanced accuracy

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.080 
the DNA is digitally enhanced accuracy
so<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.950> next<00:03:53.220> generation<00:03:53.340> laser

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
so it's next generation laser

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.910 
so it's next generation laser
rangefinder<00:03:54.930> engine<00:03:55.290> that<00:03:55.410> they<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.739> in

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
rangefinder engine that they have in

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.720 
rangefinder engine that they have in
this<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.580> right<00:03:56.850> here<00:03:57.150> right<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:57.840> overall

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
this this right here right so overall

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.000 
this this right here right so overall
you<00:03:59.730> know<00:03:59.850> great<00:04:00.450> compact<00:04:00.870> design<00:04:01.110> they've

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
you know great compact design they've

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.920 
you know great compact design they've
really<00:04:02.340> come<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.550> long<00:04:02.640> way<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.630> form<00:04:03.840> of

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
really come a long way in the form of

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.870 
really come a long way in the form of
range<00:04:04.110> finders<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.980> RX<00:04:05.250> two<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.640> have

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
range finders the RX two that I have

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.600 
range finders the RX two that I have
exactly<00:04:06.570> about<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.989> same<00:04:07.230> size<00:04:07.470> maybe<00:04:07.890> maybe

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
exactly about the same size maybe maybe

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.710 
exactly about the same size maybe maybe
a<00:04:08.670> little<00:04:08.820> bigger<00:04:09.060> than<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.570> they're

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
a little bigger than this so they're

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.780 
a little bigger than this so they're
getting<00:04:09.810> smaller<00:04:10.230> which<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.680> really<00:04:10.950> nice<00:04:11.130> but

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
getting smaller which is really nice but

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.540 
getting smaller which is really nice but
you<00:04:11.820> also<00:04:12.030> have<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.570> great<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:13.500> know<00:04:13.620> compact

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
you also have the great you know compact

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.430 
you also have the great you know compact
designs<00:04:14.940> got<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.269> camel<00:04:15.690> case<00:04:15.930> it's<00:04:16.230> not<00:04:16.380> a

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
designs got a camel case it's not a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.680 
designs got a camel case it's not a
solid<00:04:16.709> color<00:04:17.070> case<00:04:17.370> which<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.209> really<00:04:18.510> nice

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
solid color case which is really nice

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.020 
solid color case which is really nice
and<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:20.250> know<00:04:20.340> something<00:04:20.700> that's<00:04:20.790> going<00:04:20.970> to

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
and you know something that's going to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.120 
and you know something that's going to
give<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.299> exact<00:04:21.930> accuracy<00:04:22.410> out<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.860> where<00:04:22.979> you

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
give you exact accuracy out to where you

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.800 
give you exact accuracy out to where you
need<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.580> that's<00:04:23.669> what<00:04:23.940> we<00:04:24.060> need<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.330> an

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
need it and that's what we need is an

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.330 
need it and that's what we need is an
archer<00:04:25.200> because<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.770> difference<00:04:26.070> between<00:04:26.280> a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
archer because the difference between a

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.480 
archer because the difference between a
25-yard<00:04:26.940> shot

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
25-yard shot

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.670 
25-yard shot
28-yard<00:04:28.060> shot<00:04:28.389> could<00:04:28.810> mean<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.020> hit<00:04:29.259> or<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> miss

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
28-yard shot could mean a hit or a miss

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.430 
28-yard shot could mean a hit or a miss
so<00:04:30.400> I'll<00:04:30.550> tell<00:04:30.729> you<00:04:30.819> what<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.210> like<00:04:31.539> my<00:04:31.840> Leopold
