00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.370 
think that it's a male voice somebody
with<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:07.860> sort<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.160> rich<00:02:08.399> sort<00:02:08.910> of

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.380 

I<00:03:11.130> think<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.190> challenge<00:03:12.550> for<00:03:12.790> creating<00:03:13.240> a

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
I think the challenge for creating a

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.750 
I think the challenge for creating a
unique<00:03:14.050> series<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.650> where<00:03:14.890> world<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.370> I

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
unique series like where world is I

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.310 
unique series like where world is I
wasn't<00:03:16.000> even<00:03:16.150> aware<00:03:16.270> I<00:03:16.330> was<00:03:16.420> doing<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.960> but<00:03:17.140> one

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
wasn't even aware I was doing it but one

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.960 
wasn't even aware I was doing it but one
of<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.470> things<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.830> was<00:03:17.920> mentioned<00:03:18.070> very

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
of the things that was mentioned very

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.430 
of the things that was mentioned very
early<00:03:19.030> doors<00:03:19.390> with<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.840> reviews<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.290> came

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
early doors with the reviews that came

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.350 
early doors with the reviews that came
through<00:03:20.620> was<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.250> world<00:03:21.460> building<00:03:21.970> side

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
through was the the world building side

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.210 
through was the the world building side
of<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.630> which<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:24.670> me<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:26.590> comes<00:03:26.770> naturally

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
of it which for me it comes naturally

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.500 
of it which for me it comes naturally
and<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.430> much<00:03:27.550> as<00:03:27.700> if<00:03:27.790> I'm<00:03:27.880> writing<00:03:28.240> if<00:03:28.360> you're

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
and so much as if I'm writing if you're

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.850 
and so much as if I'm writing if you're
writing<00:03:28.660> fantasy<00:03:29.020> I<00:03:29.290> guess<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.620> have<00:03:29.740> to

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
writing fantasy I guess you have to

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.860 
writing fantasy I guess you have to
build<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.100> world<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:31.060> lot<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.420> contemporary

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
build the world a lot of contemporary

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.050 
build the world a lot of contemporary
fiction<00:03:32.080> it<00:03:32.860> has<00:03:33.010> those<00:03:33.220> points<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.940> reference

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
fiction it has those points of reference

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.610 
fiction it has those points of reference
for<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.450> audience<00:03:34.840> if<00:03:34.990> it's<00:03:35.110> set<00:03:35.230> within<00:03:35.500> a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
for the audience if it's set within a

for the audience if it's set within a
real<00:03:35.770> world<00:03:36.010> setting<00:03:36.870> everybody<00:03:37.870> knows<00:03:37.990> where

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
real world setting everybody knows where

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.440 
real world setting everybody knows where
London<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.650> or<00:03:38.950> what<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.430> Alps<00:03:39.700> look<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.090> or

immediately understand and project
themselves<00:03:45.430> into<00:03:45.820> that<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.090> when<00:03:46.209> you're

love<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.400> horror<00:04:06.670> fantasy<00:04:07.150> comes<00:04:07.360> from<00:04:07.600> and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
love of horror fantasy comes from and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.800 
love of horror fantasy comes from and
that<00:04:09.010> was<00:04:09.190> really<00:04:09.580> where<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.000> learned<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.510> kind

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
that was really where I learned to kind

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.840 
that was really where I learned to kind
of<00:04:10.930> build<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.290> world<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.830> kind<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.520> tell<00:04:12.730> my

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
of build the world and kind of tell my

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.479 
of build the world and kind of tell my
own<00:04:12.940> story<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:14.080> that<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.950> guess<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.190> was<00:04:15.459> the

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
own story so that I guess that was the

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.599 
own story so that I guess that was the
challenge<00:04:15.730> but<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.090> other<00:04:16.209> thing<00:04:16.359> was<00:04:16.510> and

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
challenge but the other thing was and

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.979 
challenge but the other thing was and
the<00:04:18.609> first<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:19.209> know<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.359> first<00:04:19.479> book<00:04:19.870> when

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
the first you know the first book when

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.539 
the first you know the first book when
it<00:04:20.080> was<00:04:20.169> real<00:04:20.320> by<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.919> time<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.220> got<00:04:21.310> released

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
it was real by the time it got released

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.490 
it was real by the time it got released
it<00:04:21.760> was<00:04:21.880> that<00:04:22.479> time<00:04:22.630> he<00:04:22.690> got<00:04:22.780> picked<00:04:23.050> up<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.410> was

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
it was that time he got picked up it was

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.140 
it was that time he got picked up it was
a<00:04:23.560> fifth<00:04:23.770> draft<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.790> did<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:24.970> lot<00:04:25.090> of

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
a fifth draft so I did a lot of

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.240 
a fifth draft so I did a lot of
revisions<00:04:25.510> along<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.840> way<00:04:25.960> I'm<00:04:26.169> holding<00:04:26.890> it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
revisions along the way I'm holding it

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.640 
revisions along the way I'm holding it
and<00:04:27.400> tinkering<00:04:28.150> with<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.600> changing<00:04:29.440> huge

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
and tinkering with it and changing huge

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.380 
and tinkering with it and changing huge
lumps<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.669> think<00:04:30.729> new<00:04:30.970> ones<00:04:31.180> to

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
lumps of it and and I think new ones to

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.850 
lumps of it and and I think new ones to
it<00:04:31.479> as<00:04:31.600> well<00:04:31.780> just<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.140> make<00:04:32.169> sure<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.530> was<00:04:32.650> it

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
it as well just to make sure it was it

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.980 
it as well just to make sure it was it
was<00:04:33.010> absolutely<00:04:33.340> right<00:04:33.630> before<00:04:34.630> we<00:04:34.720> got<00:04:34.810> off

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
was absolutely right before we got off

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.200 
was absolutely right before we got off
the<00:04:35.080> ground
