00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
is going to be basically taken down to
its<00:01:09.330> deck<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.810> rebuilt<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.500> problem

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
its deck and then rebuilt the problem

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
its deck and then rebuilt the problem
though<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.970> existing<00:01:12.630> gas

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
though is that the existing gas

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.180 
though is that the existing gas

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that and in order to do the rebuild we

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.010 
that and in order to do the rebuild we
have<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.440> get<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> pipe<00:01:16.830> off<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
have to get the pipe off so how do you

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
have to get the pipe off so how do you
get<00:01:19.140> across<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> river<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> can't<00:01:20.340> use

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
