00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.300 
you are also going to see the true space
stereo<00:01:51.060> signal<00:01:51.600> processing<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.500> these<00:01:53.100> which

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
stereo signal processing on these which

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880 
stereo signal processing on these which
is<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> give<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.479> wide<00:01:55.020> stereo

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
is going to give you a very wide stereo

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.649 
is going to give you a very wide stereo
field<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.549> even<00:01:56.969> though<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> couple

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
field so even though you have a couple

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.109 
field so even though you have a couple
of<00:01:57.750> speakers<00:01:57.990> sitting<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.920> maybe<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.759> foot<00:02:00.030> or

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
of speakers sitting just maybe a foot or

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.030 
of speakers sitting just maybe a foot or
two<00:02:00.149> apart<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.810> front<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
two apart in front of you it's going to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
two apart in front of you it's going to
sound<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.670> those<00:02:02.880> speakers<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.390> much<00:02:04.170> wider

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
sound like those speakers are much wider

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.429 
sound like those speakers are much wider
and<00:02:04.770> filling<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> room<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:06.689> much<00:02:07.049> more

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and filling up the room much much more

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.559 
and filling up the room much much more
it<00:02:08.129> all<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> speakers<00:02:08.849> are<00:02:09.030> fully

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
it all the speakers are fully

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.540 
it all the speakers are fully
magnetically<00:02:10.560> shielded<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.190> don't<00:02:11.400> have

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
magnetically shielded so you don't have

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.240 
magnetically shielded so you don't have
to<00:02:11.700> worry<00:02:11.910> about<00:02:12.209> them<00:02:12.780> effect

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to worry about them effect

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.390 
to worry about them effect
your<00:02:13.670> monitor<00:02:14.150> or<00:02:14.360> your<00:02:14.660> PC<00:02:15.170> in<00:02:15.380> any<00:02:16.130> way

your monitor or your PC in any way

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.810 
your monitor or your PC in any way
active<00:02:17.180> equalization<00:02:17.960> is<00:02:18.140> built-in<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:19.490> the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
active equalization is built-in to the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.310 
active equalization is built-in to the
system<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.510> don't<00:02:20.690> have<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.050> choose

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
system so you don't have to choose

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.520 
system so you don't have to choose
different<00:02:22.150> equalization<00:02:23.150> presets<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.350> will

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
different equalization presets this will

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.100 
different equalization presets this will
actually<00:02:24.980> determine<00:02:25.340> what<00:02:26.210> is<00:02:26.420> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.990> be

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
actually determine what is going to be

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.440 
actually determine what is going to be
the<00:02:27.320> best<00:02:27.620> equalization<00:02:28.430> setting<00:02:28.820> for<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.240> on

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
the best equalization setting for you on

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.890 
the best equalization setting for you on
the<00:02:29.750> fly<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.500> make<00:02:31.040> sure<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.640> uses<00:02:32.360> that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
the fly and make sure it uses that

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.170 
the fly and make sure it uses that
setting<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.680> let<00:02:33.980> me<00:02:34.070> show<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.310> how<00:02:34.760> this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
setting so let me show you how this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360 
setting so let me show you how this
hooks<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.930> how<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.230> all<00:02:36.410> goes<00:02:36.620> together<00:02:36.860> it
