 in this tutorial we will see how to configure 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.720
 the game so that it is lighter 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.540
 possible and we will also explore 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.140
 the other options that the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.140

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.960
 O

 rpg from the quality of the textures 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.800
 to the details of the terrain of the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.100
 design of the monsters we can perceive 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.670
 the artistic and technical aspects of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.560
 game is awesome 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.420
 but for all this to work from 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.759
 appropriate manner it is necessary to have a 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.920
 reasonable machine equipped with a good 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.070
 video card and a modern processor 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.210
 but if you do not have a super 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.580
 machine to play 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.080
 You do not need to worry because the

 graphics that can make the game more 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.509
 lighter and more affordable to access 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.690
 Video Options menu shortly after being 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.729

 video options will be displayed and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.710
 many of them can be adjusted to 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.750
 decrease visual and graphic aspects 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.159
 so the game does not require as much of your 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.250
 computer 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.269
 groups of options in this menu are available. 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.000
 they resolve the options of this 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.200
 area serve to define the aspects and 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.480
 screen size 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.970
 the option to display the content of the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.920
 full screen or no window 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.829
 if you want to improve performance here 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.980
 is to combine what leaves the ideal option is 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.049
 off and leave a small resolution 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.660
 if the voter is too large 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.220
 keep a small revolution but activate 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.440
 the full screen option 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.390
 it is still possible to further reduce 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.209
 screen resolution when choosing another 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.480
 exclude reptile as the picture for three 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.200
 after resolution 1024 by 768 pixels 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.420
 of the display 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.360
 at this point you can set up two 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.000
 effects level and adjust 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.000
 violent game details 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.330
 the smaller the both options girl 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.850
 cpu and gpu will be required 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.740
 if you have a medium machine it is 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.730
 recommended to activate the auto box 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.430
 adjustment 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.470
 so the game regulates the quality of 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.790
 effects according to the quantity of 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.640

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.430
 preset and slide the bar according to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.500
 the need for your hardware to 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.530
 bar at 0 to leave the machine more 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.270
 you can drag up to 6 so that you can 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.060
 the graphics look the most beautiful 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.950
 possible if you are in doubt as to your 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.959

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.320
 game do the following 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.900
 leave the box 10 and between the game is 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.530
 realize that the game is not flooding and 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.520
 presenting good ets is improving to 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.220
 the graphics by placing preset 1 or 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.489

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.930
 basic english 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.209
 if the game continues without taking advantage of 22 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.760
 continue to increase the graphic quality 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.950

 great believer the game at all 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.419
 is limited to them since it is not enough to have a 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.970
