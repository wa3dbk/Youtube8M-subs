00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
I had enough space in between the two so

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.750 
I had enough space in between the two so
that<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:17.379> flowers<00:02:17.739> wouldn't<00:02:18.040> be<00:02:18.190> smushed<00:02:18.519> up

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that the flowers wouldn't be smushed up

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.550 
that the flowers wouldn't be smushed up
and<00:02:19.180> also<00:02:19.540> doesn't<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.200> there<00:02:20.409> wasn't

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
and also doesn't so that there wasn't

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.050 
and also doesn't so that there wasn't
too<00:02:20.799> much<00:02:20.950> space<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.549> don't<00:02:21.670> really<00:02:21.760> want

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
too much space but you don't really want

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.170 
too much space but you don't really want
the<00:02:22.209> wire<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.420> show<00:02:22.900> you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the wire to show you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.429 
the wire to show you
between<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:25.879> went<00:02:26.329> ahead<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.900> just<00:02:27.109> wrap

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
between so I went ahead and just wrap

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.479 
between so I went ahead and just wrap
the<00:02:27.680> wire<00:02:27.890> around<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.849> center<00:02:30.069> of<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.250> tissue

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
the wire around the center of the tissue

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.050 
the wire around the center of the tissue
paper<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:32.799> get<00:02:33.799> it<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.010> there<00:02:34.219> pretty<00:02:34.400> well<00:02:34.519> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
paper I get it on there pretty well and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.970 
paper I get it on there pretty well and
then<00:02:35.269> maybe<00:02:35.599> twist<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.079> around<00:02:36.170> one<00:02:36.560> time<00:02:36.799> just

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
then maybe twist it around one time just

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.759 
then maybe twist it around one time just
to<00:02:37.159> make<00:02:37.310> sure<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.609> stays<00:02:37.879> on<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:40.389> then<00:02:41.769> to

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
to make sure it stays on and then to

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.520 
to make sure it stays on and then to
make<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.189> little<00:02:43.810> more<00:02:44.810> more

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
make it a little more more

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.009 
make it a little more more

ends of the paper and for that you can
just<00:02:52.129> use<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> regular<00:02:52.370> pair<00:02:52.909> of<00:02:53.000> scissors<00:02:53.389> or

start carefully separating each of the
pieces<00:04:36.130> of<00:04:36.370> paper<00:04:36.640> this<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.840> part<00:04:38.080> that's

pieces of paper this is the part that's

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.620 
pieces of paper this is the part that's
a<00:04:38.380> little<00:04:38.850> difficult<00:04:39.850> but<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.330> have<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.540> be

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
a little difficult but you have to be

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.820 
a little difficult but you have to be
careful<00:04:40.960> because<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.170> don't<00:04:41.260> want<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.650> rip

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
careful because you don't want to rip

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.870

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
the paper so separate each piece each

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.600 
the paper so separate each piece each
sheet<00:04:46.290> carefully<00:04:47.290> from<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.010> one<00:04:48.220> that's<00:04:48.400> next

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
like another thing that I've done is

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.460 
like another thing that I've done is
even<00:05:29.530> now<00:05:29.650> I'm<00:05:29.860> using<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:31.090> same<00:05:31.360> colors<00:05:31.960> for

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
even now I'm using the same colors for

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.920 
even now I'm using the same colors for
each<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.800> these<00:05:32.890> flowers<00:05:33.370> where<00:05:34.360> I've<00:05:34.480> done<00:05:34.660> is

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
each of these flowers where I've done is

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.700 
each of these flowers where I've done is
as<00:05:35.650> I<00:05:36.190> am<00:05:36.570> stacking<00:05:37.570> them<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.290> know<00:05:38.350> once<00:05:38.560> I've

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
as I am stacking them you know once I've

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.770 
as I am stacking them you know once I've
cut<00:05:38.890> them<00:05:39.040> into<00:05:39.190> quarters<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:39.820> rearranged<00:05:40.570> the

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
cut them into quarters I rearranged the

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.530 
cut them into quarters I rearranged the
colors<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:41.470> this<00:05:42.130> will<00:05:42.340> change<00:05:42.370> which<00:05:43.060> colors

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
colors and this will change which colors

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.750 
colors and this will change which colors
are<00:05:43.780> on<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.020> outside<00:05:44.560> versus<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.130> inside<00:05:45.580> and

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
are on the outside versus the inside and

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.400 
are on the outside versus the inside and
okay<00:05:46.000> but<00:05:46.030> give<00:05:46.600> a<00:05:46.630> little<00:05:46.840> bit<00:05:47.020> of<00:05:47.110> variation

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
okay but give a little bit of variation

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.370 
okay but give a little bit of variation
so<00:05:48.040> even<00:05:48.400> though<00:05:48.580> you<00:05:49.150> know<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.420> purple<00:05:49.840> blue

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
so even though you know the purple blue

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.500 
so even though you know the purple blue
and<00:05:51.190> green<00:05:51.460> flowers<00:05:51.940> all<00:05:52.090> have<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.360> same

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
and green flowers all have the same

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.090 
and green flowers all have the same
colors<00:05:52.930> they're<00:05:53.470> in<00:05:53.620> slightly<00:05:53.920> different

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
colors they're in slightly different

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.890 
colors they're in slightly different
order<00:05:54.580> so<00:05:54.700> that<00:05:55.000> just<00:05:55.150> kind<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.390> makes<00:05:55.570> it<00:05:55.750> look

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
order so that just kind of makes it look

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.900 
order so that just kind of makes it look
a<00:05:55.930> little<00:05:56.170> more<00:05:56.320> interesting<00:05:56.640> it's<00:05:57.640> a<00:05:57.700> little

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
a little more interesting it's a little

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.910 
a little more interesting it's a little
more<00:05:58.030> variation<00:05:58.530> just<00:05:59.530> like<00:05:59.650> a<00:05:59.680> natural

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
more variation just like a natural

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
more variation just like a natural
flower<00:06:00.430> they're<00:06:00.700> not<00:06:00.850> all<00:06:01.090> identical<00:06:02.130> so

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
flower they're not all identical so

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.310 
flower they're not all identical so
go<00:06:05.040> almost<00:06:06.040> done<00:06:06.280> with<00:06:06.400> this<00:06:06.610> flower<00:06:06.910> you<00:06:07.320> know
