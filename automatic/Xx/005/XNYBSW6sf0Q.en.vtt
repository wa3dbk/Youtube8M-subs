00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
start off with the controls here you've

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.839 
start off with the controls here you've
got<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.670> level<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.689> fuzz<00:00:24.930> control<00:00:25.849> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
got a level and a fuzz control and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.939 
got a level and a fuzz control and
halfway<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> fuzz<00:00:27.869> control<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.710> becomes

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
halfway up the fuzz control it becomes

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.479 
halfway up the fuzz control it becomes
also<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.250> boost<00:00:29.580> you've<00:00:30.449> got<00:00:30.570> three<00:00:30.929> modes<00:00:31.489> one

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
also a boost you've got three modes one

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.970 
also a boost you've got three modes one
made<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> emulate<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> old<00:00:33.360> fuzz<00:00:33.660> face<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
made to emulate the old fuzz face on the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.280 
made to emulate the old fuzz face on the
next<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> old<00:00:35.640> maestro<00:00:36.120> fuzz<00:00:36.630> pedals<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
next for the old maestro fuzz pedals and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
next for the old maestro fuzz pedals and
one<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.219> mimic<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> sound<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> an<00:00:39.270> Octavia

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
one to mimic the sound of an Octavia

one to mimic the sound of an Octavia
this<00:00:40.500> pedal<00:00:40.800> does<00:00:41.070> incorporate<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.879> Kazem

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this pedal does incorporate the Kazem

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380 
this pedal does incorporate the Kazem
processing<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.820> I'll<00:00:44.820> start<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> fuzz

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
processing and I'll start with the fuzz

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:55.830 
processing and I'll start with the fuzz
face<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.140> let's<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.410> how<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.559> sounds

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:16.380 

Hey

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.580 

hmm<00:01:18.420> I'd<00:01:19.420> say<00:01:19.630> it's<00:01:19.750> pretty<00:01:19.870> pretty<00:01:20.200> accurate

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
hmm I'd say it's pretty pretty accurate

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.890 
hmm I'd say it's pretty pretty accurate
I<00:01:20.620> mean<00:01:20.770> it's<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:21.010> pretty<00:01:21.820> low<00:01:22.090> fidelity<00:01:22.390> fuzz

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
I mean it's a pretty low fidelity fuzz

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.630 
I mean it's a pretty low fidelity fuzz
and<00:01:23.440> back<00:01:23.650> off<00:01:23.860> here<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:24.070> bring<00:01:24.250> up<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.400> level

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
and back off here and bring up the level

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.430 
and back off here and bring up the level
a<00:01:24.670> little<00:01:24.729> bit<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.060> get<00:01:25.150> some<00:01:25.300> different

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
a little bit and get some different

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.219 
a little bit and get some different
different<00:01:26.440> flavors<00:01:26.740> with<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:32.020> she<00:01:32.110> can

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
different flavors with it where she can

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.530 
different flavors with it where she can
get<00:01:32.320> into<00:01:32.470> that<00:01:32.530> boost<00:01:32.890> range<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.490> get<00:01:34.300> pretty

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
get into that boost range and get pretty

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:57.859 
get into that boost range and get pretty
pretty<00:01:34.990> out<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.140> hand<00:01:35.229> really

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.940 

I'm<00:01:58.869> going<00:01:58.990> around<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.320> next<00:01:59.560> setting<00:01:59.860> the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
I'm going around to the next setting the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.399 
I'm going around to the next setting the
maestro<00:02:00.930> traditionally<00:02:01.930> a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.200> bit<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.350> a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
maestro traditionally a little bit of a

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.670 
maestro traditionally a little bit of a
brighter<00:02:02.619> fuzz<00:02:04.290> crude<00:02:05.290> of<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.409> different

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
brighter fuzz crude of a different

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:38.190 
brighter fuzz crude of a different
timbre<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.250> let's<00:02:06.850> hear<00:02:07.000> how<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.210> sounds

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.210 

kind<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.230> think<00:02:39.410> Keith<00:02:39.590> Richards<00:02:39.950> with<00:02:40.100> that

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
kind of think Keith Richards with that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.950 
kind of think Keith Richards with that
one<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.400> think<00:02:40.520> he<00:02:40.700> was<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.880> he<00:02:41.570> was<00:02:41.600> pretty<00:02:41.810> hip

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
one I think he was a he was pretty hip

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.110 
one I think he was a he was pretty hip
to<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> maestro<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.190> next<00:02:43.850> one<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
to the maestro and the next one is the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.060 
to the maestro and the next one is the
Octavia<00:02:44.810> which<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> fuzz<00:02:45.560> was<00:02:45.800> sort<00:02:46.040> of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
Octavia which is the fuzz was sort of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.610 
Octavia which is the fuzz was sort of
the<00:02:46.190> octave<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.150> effect<00:02:47.570> which<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.840> sort<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.500> an

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the octave up effect which is sort of an

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.160 
the octave up effect which is sort of an
artifact<00:02:49.190> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.490> fuzz<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.000> let's<00:02:50.900> hear<00:02:51.020> that

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
artifact of the fuzz and let's hear that

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:21.130 
artifact of the fuzz and let's hear that
sounds<00:03:18.940> sort<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:20.090> sort<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.690> kind<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.050> the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
sounds sort of sort of kind of the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.500 
sounds sort of sort of kind of the
purple<00:03:21.440> haze<00:03:21.620> effect<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.910> this<00:03:23.030> Octavia

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
purple haze effect on this Octavia

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.610 
purple haze effect on this Octavia
effect<00:03:23.780> oh<00:03:23.870> if<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.050> start<00:03:24.290> getting<00:03:24.440> into<00:03:24.560> that

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
effect oh if you start getting into that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.740 
effect oh if you start getting into that
boost<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.610> does<00:03:25.820> sort<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.090> drown<00:03:26.360> out<00:03:26.540> that

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
boost it does sort of drown out that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:52.900 
boost it does sort of drown out that
octave

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.790 

here<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.060> still<00:03:54.300> there<00:03:54.540> but<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:55.590> know<00:03:55.680> as

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
here it is still there but you know as

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.199 
here it is still there but you know as
the<00:03:55.830> fuzz<00:03:56.130> increases<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.819> can't<00:03:57.000> hear<00:03:57.180> it

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
the fuzz increases you can't hear it

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.860 
the fuzz increases you can't hear it
quite<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:57.660> well<00:03:59.000> pretty<00:04:00.000> good<00:04:00.209> I'd<00:04:00.660> say<00:04:00.720> a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
quite so well pretty good I'd say a

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.350 
quite so well pretty good I'd say a
pretty<00:04:00.930> good<00:04:01.140> replica<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.740> all<00:04:01.890> three

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
pretty good replica of all three

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.430 
pretty good replica of all three
especially<00:04:03.360> with<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.660> prices<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.260> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
especially with the prices of the you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.730 
especially with the prices of the you
know<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.620> originals<00:04:05.069> these<00:04:05.310> days<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:07.620> can

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
know the originals these days you can

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.030
