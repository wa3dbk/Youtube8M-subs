does work pretty well I would say the
highlight<00:01:28.020> though<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.350> definitely<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040

brown sugar is delicious gonna get one
more<00:01:34.170> big<00:01:34.439> bite<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> though<00:01:36.180> i

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
more big bite here I like it though i

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.460 
more big bite here I like it though i
like<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> i<00:01:36.659> don't<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.140> spectacular

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
like it i don't think it's spectacular

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.249 
like it i don't think it's spectacular
but<00:01:38.460> i<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.450> very<00:01:39.630> above

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
but i think that it is very very above

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.240 
but i think that it is very very above
average<00:01:40.409> solid<00:01:40.890> he<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:42.530> liked<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
average solid he really liked it a lot I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.819 
average solid he really liked it a lot I
would<00:01:44.610> give<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.909> high<00:01:45.180> form<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:46.380> really

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
would give that a high form it's really

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.789 
would give that a high form it's really
good<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.670> wee-wee<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.659> dry<00:01:48.930> but

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
good just a little wee-wee to dry but

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
good just a little wee-wee to dry but
flavor-wise<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.640> bacon<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:52.049> highlight

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
flavor-wise the bacon is the highlight

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.929 
flavor-wise the bacon is the highlight
of<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.560> thing<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.100> why<00:01:53.280> they<00:01:53.640> named

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
of this thing and that's why they named

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.030 
of this thing and that's why they named
it<00:01:54.090> after<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.509> stretches<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.439> baked<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.890> its

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
it after it stretches the baked on its
