00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.850 
said before and this is a really fun set
because<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.690> could<00:01:03.930> design<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.409> any<00:01:04.589> way<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
because you could design it any way you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.300 
because you could design it any way you
want<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.030> Steve<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.630> over<00:01:06.869> here

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
want to so Steve can be over here

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.679

farming<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.290> growing<00:01:10.290> crops<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.520> he<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.510> be

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
farming and growing crops or he can be

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.320 
farming and growing crops or he can be
at<00:01:12.900> his<00:01:13.140> crafting<00:01:13.680> table<00:01:14.250> creating<00:01:15.030> something

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
at his crafting table creating something

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.850 
at his crafting table creating something
or<00:01:15.890> he's<00:01:16.890> eating<00:01:17.640> his<00:01:17.909> local<00:01:18.479> bread<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.590> he

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
or he's eating his local bread and he

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.320 
or he's eating his local bread and he
can<00:01:20.009> actually<00:01:20.340> hold<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.770> if<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:24.150> do

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
can actually hold on to this if I can do

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.800 
can actually hold on to this if I can do
this<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.900> hand<00:01:26.119> anyway<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.180> he<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.630> hold

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this with one hand anyway so he can hold

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.270 
this with one hand anyway so he can hold
on<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.170> since<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.590> an<00:01:28.680> indent<00:01:29.070> there

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
on to it since it's an indent there

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.730 
on to it since it's an indent there
that's<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.880> cool<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> store<00:01:31.530> his

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that's really cool and he can store his

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.749 
that's really cool and he can store his
precious<00:01:32.159> items<00:01:32.520> inside<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.939> his<00:01:33.030> chest<00:01:34.759> the

precious items inside of his chest the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
precious items inside of his chest the
skeleton<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> he<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.619> move

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
skeleton is over here and he can move

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.850 
skeleton is over here and he can move
around<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> quite<00:01:38.790> fun<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.500> also<00:01:40.500> there

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860

was<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.040> really<00:01:41.400> large<00:01:41.549> tree<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.060> would

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
was this really large tree I would
