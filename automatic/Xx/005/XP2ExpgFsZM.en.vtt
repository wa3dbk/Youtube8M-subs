00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 almost two months after the g the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.549
 judgment rendered yesterday and perceived as a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.370
 new step in the damien family 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.170
 from today I think we 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.090
 can begin to mourn the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.219
 drama day outward a lot 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.510
 of hate a lot of people wanted 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.990
 a lot to this young man today I 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.170
 would say that the circumstances were have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.010
 been established this young I saw them at 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.580
 the audience seems to be very bad 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.660
 in his skin 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.059
 anyway today so that's 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 something that there is no longer this 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.370
 week we understand that this is a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 accident 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.920
 we understand that this is how to tell you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.379
 it's a drama of life that can 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.890
 arrive unfortunately every day 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.260
 April 20th 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 it is on the d7 this winding road and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 dangerous that the accident occurred 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.230
 in the commune of blanzay damien come back 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.670
 an interview hired during 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.809
 from which he had been recruited 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 this is where the young person has 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.890
 lost control of his vehicle and 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.729
 the exit of the bend hit my son 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.939
 that came back from his interview 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.939
 of hired 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.770
 a priori there was no excess of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.450
 speed it's only a loss of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.600
 vehicle control of a youngster who had 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.509
 his license for a while said 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.180
 always me I I I know how I 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.189
 drive unfortunately I do not know 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.869
 how are the others driving and I have 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:37.020
 always afraid of that and it's him 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.490
 unfortunately was fatal the young 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.680
 guilty of 19 years today 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.720
 traumatized was driving a big 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.079
 170 horsepower 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 a situation that challenges us all 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.710
 turned 18 we carefree fears nothing 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.659
 18 years old and the problem when in his 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.020
 hands we have powerful vehicles 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.610
 we are all the more dangerous the law 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.110
 managed to prevent it young people 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.940
 drivers driving d 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.770
 bikes that are too powerful with 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.510
 too powerful displacements is what the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.929
 law could not be the same for 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.510
 cars the family is planning to 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.250
 commit to changing the law for 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.670
 that damien's death is not been 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.670
 useless
