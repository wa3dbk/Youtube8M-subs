better<00:06:15.180> at<00:06:15.389> analyzing<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.289> being<00:06:16.529> in<00:06:16.680> fear

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
better at analyzing and being in fear

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.829 
better at analyzing and being in fear
the<00:06:17.099> whole<00:06:17.250> time<00:06:17.460> analyzing<00:06:18.149> is<00:06:18.270> as<00:06:18.389> defense

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:18.839 
the whole time analyzing is as defense

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.290 
the whole time analyzing is as defense
it's<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.889> self<00:06:20.129> defense<00:06:20.520> it's<00:06:20.729> a<00:06:20.819> safety

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
it's a self defense it's a safety

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.149 
it's a self defense it's a safety
mechanism<00:06:21.449> it's<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:21.990> survival<00:06:22.529> mechanism<00:06:22.620> is

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
mechanism it's a survival mechanism is

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:26.240 
mechanism it's a survival mechanism is
this<00:06:23.310> going<00:06:23.550> to<00:06:23.580> work<00:06:23.669> so<00:06:24.569> instead<00:06:25.199> your<00:06:25.919> job
