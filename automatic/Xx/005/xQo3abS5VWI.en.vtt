00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.040
 more will be done soon 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.170
 estimated 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.980
 zero, I would also say differently and yes 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.809
 about how much volume we have 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.080
 what falsifications and wines and brandies 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.069
 we are fundamentally such cases 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.509
 did not introduce at all and there 56 and 220 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 imagine that this phenomenon is present 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.409
 and today 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.739
 he he other state bodies 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.129
 control bodies that will be required 

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.569
 control this market and 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.309
 Do not let 3 of this phenomenon we 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.710
 practically without help 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.690
 actually 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.140
 not only they but also extraordinary 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.470
 mass consumer yourself 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.780
 protect yourself from singer threat 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.510
 falsifications that are today 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200
 in the alcohol market but the state of the framework 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.990
 acts get justice in the process 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.590
 prosecution of falsification 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.120
 but just before you 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 besides and gentleman 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.000
 simplified set 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 this is a classic booker 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.450
 forgers who say not to 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.500
 home conditions but we were less in 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.850
 industrial environment can 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.650
 to make 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.100
 no particular drink 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.970
 legal schemes because there are 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.390
 clear classic technology 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.360
 production 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.040
 and cognac here unfortunately with each 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.750
 in the afternoon, but sheâ€™s replaced by 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.440
 gave change comes here such here all 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.710
 so interesting trendy 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.200
 drugs here for example 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.100
 n say and shredded 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.280
 oak granulation 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.650
 let's say the foundation phase 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.920
 not for all kinds of 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.420
 all kinds of extracts 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.350
 of which the magnificent is made 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.950
 so called cognacs are different 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.780
 excerpts updating how it is done very 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.580
 simply 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.890
 remove 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.380
 spirit end 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.820
 yes alcohol alcohol but take the usual 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.850
 alcohol 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.740
 here we take houses 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.399
 a certain dose of 50 milliliters let's say 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.270
 Ivanov glass 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.409
 let's say this one for example concentrate 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.239
 just simply 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.299
 volume of 5 milliliters 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 not so much 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.369
 further you him 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:24.369
 yes but not only 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.909
 because so much so the police here 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.129
 it is seen 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.189
 and here we understand him 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.419
 but this glass and here we get 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.479
 cognac 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.759
 the so-called five years we excerpt 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.009
 in principle, I am ordinary 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:46.069
 consumer contrast 4 this alcohol drink 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.889
 sites containing from 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.619
 the percentage of this brandy is made 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.389
 on the classic calorie technique he 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.379
 just will not consist 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.459
 unfortunately such experience as ours 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.629
 enough 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.479
 Yes of course 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.169
 a similar scheme can be further here in 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.109
 each of these glasses 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.570
 prepare let's say so 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.080
 everyone who cognac different excerpts here 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.370
 there will be five years old there will be seven years old here 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.190
 there will be a ten year old there are no 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.440
 problems and that's the same technology 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.449
 similar 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.259
 my job today I work 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:20.109
 modern cube ukrainian bloggers 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.409
 who produce called for example 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.079
 who just call brandy 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.439
 it was he 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.599
 language does not turn 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.589
 now as for 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:33.379
 the company that I mentioned today 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.659
 in rf here it is safe 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.650
 Well, how to say it in the play 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.199
 containing liquid 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.669
 m s 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.509
 certain 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.029
 with a certain capacity 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.369
 such additives 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:51.499
 who certainly center say so 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.889
 unhealthy certainly 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.559
 that's the way this is a very big problem 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.429
 because today our 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:59.649
 well, and the regulatory authority and 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.169
 unfortunately enjoy 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.649
 outdated techniques and 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:05.709
 the technical base of the laboratory is not 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.139
 allows to do it properly 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.459
 objective complete 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.939
 p analysis of the study of these here 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.939
 fluids that they have therefore 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.280
 Here such products they are extremely dangerous 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.889
 Of course it is undesirable to use 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.240
 Well, on the voyages once again I say sorry 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.650
 we have no institutions today and reliable 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.990
 Institute of reliable protection 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.449
 as a consumer 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.219
 so legal manufacturer from 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.789
 this product
