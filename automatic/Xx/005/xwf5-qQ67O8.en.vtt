 hello everyone with you fil and this is 49 part 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.699
 Minecraft mechanism is a series of licked 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 quick because this is a video response to 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:24.570
 video crowns yes so say crowns 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.660
 showed one mechanism is something like 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.170
 from the discharge to build as I in general 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.690
 he grills hens for well in general 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.030
 look not in the stove but I will not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.350
 show it in the oven to fry every 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.250
 chicken for five minutes each exactly 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.160
 at least 50 chickens in five seconds 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.870
 General now let me show you in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.700
 overall he made a hefty car and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.629
 wrote a mole do something smaller 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.859
 and make a video answer it will be now 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.629
 video response means shows here it is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.530
 she did not build a car and helped train 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:10.250
 I think, too, will show his version so 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.560
 let's do it means this car 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.330
 let here well and bottom how much here 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.340
 there will be many courses just a lot of hens and 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.630
 so we cut down the creative q to be seen 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 so i'm doing here on the general do 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.100
 so we press the button 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.979
 they are all set on fire to gather and die 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 we end up with 24 hens and 27 feathers 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.119
 Here is such a car and I even have a night with you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.670
 and and build instantly and so for 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.000
 this we need any block 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.170
 redstone torch arnu rockstone 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.479
 ration torch arbiter sticky button 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:02.939
 piston dispenser unit not all you graze 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.160
 4 distributor or piston one by one 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.129
 and one thing this stone here and for yes and 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.280
 What else but still we need 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:17.480
 fireballs 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.920
 it means to build here next to start 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.120
 build this arch 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.530
 here we put the distributor here sticky 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.310
 piston and block like this 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.590
 then we make a mold 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:40.390
 we all put a torch here now 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:45.700
 redstone so let's fill up right away 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.800
 our distributor now put a block here 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.770
 redstone redstone not even so redstone 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:58.460
 aaa damn if Peter 4 and so here to 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:03.020
 piston block and now we still have 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:09.950
 need a fence as well as a decoration 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:12.860
 so here and here the fence 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.270
 so that they do not run away otherwise nothing 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.600
 it turns out and then take the spawner hens 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.600
 and 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:30.980
 well let's fill but i don't know how much 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.230
 in short everything is like this so we will remember 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:39.140
 we have nothing here to push 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:44.660
 button they burn they die and we 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.140
 we select 19 years from 19 hens I just 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.600
 killed 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.850
 does that mean and you ask why this 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.400
 the canopy this canopy is made to 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.900
 everything just the system always worked 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.570
 for example in the rain just will not 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.209
 work all the fire will stew 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.430
 so I put such a canopy can even 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.680
 I have not tested it like this 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.280
 rain will not penetrate just think 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.350
 so put and everything in general on this all 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.690
