00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
this and you sometimes see that very

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.889 
this and you sometimes see that very
clearly<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.240> photograph<00:00:05.569> something<00:00:06.569> is

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
clearly in a photograph something is

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.720 
clearly in a photograph something is
ironic<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> world<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.250> has<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.610> do

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
ironic in the world and it has to do

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.970 
ironic in the world and it has to do
with<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.000> fact<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.139> intend<00:00:10.590> never

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
with the fact that what you intend never

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.999 
with the fact that what you intend never
comes<00:00:11.250> out<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.759> intended<00:00:12.920> what<00:00:13.920> I'm

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
comes out like you intended what I'm

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.560 
comes out like you intended what I'm
trying<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> describe<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:14.969> it's

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
trying to describe is that it's

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.810 
trying to describe is that it's
impossible<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> get<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.859> your<00:00:17.039> skin<00:00:17.490> into

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
impossible to get out of your skin into

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.420 
impossible to get out of your skin into
somebody<00:00:18.300> else's<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.020> that's<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:20.010> all<00:00:20.189> this

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
somebody else's and that's what all this

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.790 
somebody else's and that's what all this
is<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.699> little<00:00:21.000> bit<00:00:21.119> about<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:22.410> somebody

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
is a little bit about that somebody

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.650 
is a little bit about that somebody
else's<00:00:23.130> tragedy<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.150> same<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.480> your

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
else's tragedy is not the same as your

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.589 
else's tragedy is not the same as your

another<00:00:27.599> thing<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.410> photograph<00:00:28.920> has<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.310> be

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
another thing is a photograph has to be

I<00:00:32.850> first<00:00:32.880> began<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> photograph<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.140> thought

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I first began to photograph I thought

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.500 
I first began to photograph I thought
there<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.219> an<00:00:35.370> awful<00:00:35.700> lot<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> people<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.390> the

to<00:00:38.100> photograph<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.820> them<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.989> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
to photograph all of them so if I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.350 
to photograph all of them so if I
photograph<00:00:40.770> some<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.610> generalized

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of exactitude a kind of scrutiny that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.980 
of exactitude a kind of scrutiny that
we're<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.220> normally<00:01:14.760> subject<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.540> mean

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
confirmed in a sense of unreality which

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:28.850
