my<00:00:06.299> name's<00:00:06.540> Adrian<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.290> good<00:00:07.560> I'm<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.740> member<00:00:08.130> of

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
my name's Adrian so good I'm a member of

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.000 
my name's Adrian so good I'm a member of
mafia<00:00:08.760> climate<00:00:09.269> action<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.139> pool<00:00:10.440> originally

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
mafia climate action the pool originally

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.430 
mafia climate action the pool originally
approached<00:00:11.429> us<00:00:11.730> because<00:00:12.719> they<00:00:12.870> were<00:00:12.929> having<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
approached us because they were having a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.289 
approached us because they were having a
major<00:00:13.679> rebuild<00:00:14.280> um<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.700> whilst<00:00:15.030> they<00:00:15.210> were

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
major rebuild um and whilst they were

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.000 
major rebuild um and whilst they were
doing<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.750> they<00:00:16.020> felt<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.770> would<00:00:16.830> be<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
doing that they felt that it would be a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.070 
doing that they felt that it would be a
good<00:00:17.130> idea<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.880> make<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.660> more<00:00:18.840> sustainable

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
good idea to make it more sustainable

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.490 
good idea to make it more sustainable
and<00:00:19.890> importantly<00:00:20.789> if<00:00:21.060> they<00:00:21.210> could<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.900> reduce

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and importantly if they could to reduce

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.240 
and importantly if they could to reduce
their<00:00:22.710> running<00:00:23.010> costs<00:00:27.740> initially<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.949> felt

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
their running costs initially we felt

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.849 
their running costs initially we felt
sort<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> quite<00:00:30.210> naively<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.349> we

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
sort of quite naively I think that we

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
sort of quite naively I think that we
could<00:00:32.130> provide<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.910> whole<00:00:33.059> heating<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
could provide the whole heating for the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.720 
could provide the whole heating for the
pool<00:00:33.930> using<00:00:34.290> solar<00:00:34.770> panels<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.430> seem<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.640> be

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
pool using solar panels there seem to be

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.780 
pool using solar panels there seem to be
plenty<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.870> roof<00:00:37.079> space<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.489> thought

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
plenty of roof space and so we thought

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.510 
plenty of roof space and so we thought
solar<00:00:39.000> thermal<00:00:39.329> would<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.680> easy<00:00:40.829> solution

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
solar thermal would be the easy solution

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.030 
solar thermal would be the easy solution
and<00:00:41.700> then<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.120> started<00:00:42.870> sort<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.620> looking<00:00:43.920> at

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and then we started sort of looking at

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790 
and then we started sort of looking at
the<00:00:44.100> figures<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.120> does<00:00:45.390> require<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> surprising

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the figures it does require a surprising

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.470 
the figures it does require a surprising
amount<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.039> energy<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> pool<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.000> kept<00:00:48.239> at

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
amount of energy the pool is kept at

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.139 
amount of energy the pool is kept at
quite<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> high<00:00:49.590> temperature<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.129> 30<00:00:50.370> degrees<00:00:50.820> C

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
quite a high temperature at 30 degrees C

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330 
quite a high temperature at 30 degrees C
and<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.960> did<00:00:52.110> quickly<00:00:52.469> realize<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and we did quickly realize that the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.229 
and we did quickly realize that the
solar<00:00:54.329> panels<00:00:54.890> really<00:00:55.890> would<00:00:56.489> not<00:00:56.820> provide

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
solar panels really would not provide

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
solar panels really would not provide
the<00:00:57.539> sort<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.809> energy<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.410> needed<00:00:58.800> well

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the sort of energy that was needed well

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.720 
the sort of energy that was needed well
we<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.210> felt<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> best<00:01:01.320> option<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
we then felt that the best option was to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.200 
we then felt that the best option was to
have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> proper<00:01:03.870> energy<00:01:04.260> audit<00:01:04.619> done<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.489> we

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
have a proper energy audit done so we

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.440 
have a proper energy audit done so we
got<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> grant<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.729> have<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:08.850> energy<00:01:09.180> audit

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
got a grant to have an energy audit

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570 
got a grant to have an energy audit
undertaken<00:01:10.080> by<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> Devon<00:01:10.830> Association<00:01:11.460> of

renewable energy they did a very

to heat that pool really wasn't an

to heat that pool really wasn't an
option<00:01:21.659> even<00:01:22.439> though<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.799> fairly

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
option even though it's fairly

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.539 
option even though it's fairly
substantial<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.869> available<00:01:25.320> roof<00:01:25.530> space<00:01:25.830> was

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
substantial the available roof space was

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.920 
substantial the available roof space was
such<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.270> only<00:01:27.390> provided

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
such that it would have only provided

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
such that it would have only provided
about<00:01:28.020> half<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.619> less<00:01:28.650> than<00:01:28.860> half<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> energy

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
about half or less than half the energy

about half or less than half the energy

required to eat the pool they gave a
series<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> recommendations<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> one

swimming pool Association was that was

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.370 
swimming pool Association was that was
to<00:01:49.159> reduce<00:01:49.460> costs<00:01:49.970> as<00:01:50.090> as<00:01:50.570> well<00:01:50.840> as<00:01:50.990> making<00:01:51.200> it

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
to reduce costs as as well as making it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.820 
to reduce costs as as well as making it
more<00:01:51.500> sustainable<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.960> biomass<00:01:54.380> system

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
more sustainable and the biomass system

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.370 
more sustainable and the biomass system
wouldn't<00:01:55.729> have<00:01:55.940> reduced<00:01:56.330> running<00:01:56.930> costs<00:01:57.290> in

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
wouldn't have reduced running costs in

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.600 
wouldn't have reduced running costs in
fact<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.680> might<00:01:57.770> even<00:01:57.830> even<00:01:58.250> increase<00:01:58.580> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
fact it might even even increase the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.980 
fact it might even even increase the
styling<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.260> they<00:02:01.220> weren't<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.390> interested<00:02:02.869> in

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
styling so they weren't so interested in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.710 
styling so they weren't so interested in
pursuing<00:02:03.650> that<00:02:03.830> route<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:05.090> decided<00:02:05.540> that

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
pursuing that route we then decided that

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.529 
pursuing that route we then decided that
we<00:02:06.200> would<00:02:06.440> just<00:02:06.860> concentrate<00:02:07.550> on<00:02:07.580> heating<00:02:08.390> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
we would just concentrate on heating the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.350 
we would just concentrate on heating the
shower<00:02:08.810> water<00:02:09.229> as<00:02:09.820> partly<00:02:10.820> as<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> sort<00:02:11.300> of

shower water as partly as a sort of
pilot<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.930> see<00:02:12.140> at<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.380> see<00:02:12.680> how<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.980> went<00:02:13.160> and

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
pilot to see at it see how it went and

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.690 
pilot to see at it see how it went and
if<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:14.030> went<00:02:14.240> well<00:02:14.600> then<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.980> could<00:02:16.340> look<00:02:16.610> at

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
if that went well then we could look at

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.870 
if that went well then we could look at
it<00:02:16.850> again<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.989> we<00:02:18.680> decided<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> easy

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
it again so we decided on that the easy

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.630 
it again so we decided on that the easy
option<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.720> was<00:02:21.080> was<00:02:21.590> solar<00:02:22.400> thermal

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
option for that was was solar thermal

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.720 
option for that was was solar thermal

we have a wicked we have a record of how

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.350 
we have a wicked we have a record of how

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
much heat is produced it was part of the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.980 
much heat is produced it was part of the

conditions of the of the grant that the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.600 
conditions of the of the grant that the
SDF<00:04:35.470> gave<00:04:35.830> us<00:04:37.200> that<00:04:38.200> we<00:04:38.410> should<00:04:38.620> use<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:39.010> data

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
SDF gave us that we should use that data

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.020 
SDF gave us that we should use that data
to<00:04:40.000> let<00:04:40.960> people<00:04:41.169> know<00:04:41.320> what<00:04:42.310> was<00:04:42.490> going<00:04:42.729> on<00:04:42.880> in

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
to let people know what was going on in

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.310 
to let people know what was going on in
the<00:04:43.120> pool<00:04:43.330> how<00:04:43.540> much<00:04:43.720> energy<00:04:44.110> was<00:04:44.260> being

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
the pool how much energy was being

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.950 
the pool how much energy was being
produced<00:04:44.710> so<00:04:45.300> there's<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.389> little<00:04:46.570> display

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
produced so there's a little display

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.490 
produced so there's a little display
board<00:04:48.270> with<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.450> figures<00:04:49.750> posted<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.229> every

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
board with the figures posted on every

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.200 
board with the figures posted on every
day<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:50.979> can<00:04:51.220> see<00:04:51.430> exactly<00:04:51.760> how<00:04:52.030> much

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
day so you can see exactly how much

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.260 
day so you can see exactly how much
energy<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:54.220> solar<00:04:54.820> panels<00:04:55.150> are

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
energy the the solar panels are

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.170 
energy the the solar panels are
producing<00:04:55.660> that's<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.410> total<00:04:56.680> number<00:04:56.830> of

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
producing that's the total number of

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.290 
producing that's the total number of
swimmer<00:04:58.180> entries<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:59.560> about<00:04:59.830> 19,000<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.910> year

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
swimmer entries is about 19,000 a year

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.940 
swimmer entries is about 19,000 a year
very<00:05:01.600> roughly<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.229> most<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.680> those<00:05:02.770> people

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
very roughly and most of those people

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.420 
very roughly and most of those people
will<00:05:03.310> have<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.550> shower<00:05:03.850> so<00:05:04.889> yeah<00:05:05.889> there's<00:05:06.340> quite

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
will have a shower so yeah there's quite

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.670 
will have a shower so yeah there's quite
a<00:05:06.639> substantial<00:05:06.850> usage<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.750> those<00:05:07.840> shows<00:05:08.139> the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
a substantial usage of those shows the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.969 
a substantial usage of those shows the
pool<00:05:08.919> is<00:05:09.160> trying<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.490> reduce<00:05:09.639> its<00:05:10.300> energy

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
pool is trying to reduce its energy

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.290 
pool is trying to reduce its energy
consumption<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:12.460> was<00:05:12.550> asking<00:05:12.940> people<00:05:13.150> to

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
consumption so I was asking people to

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.629 
consumption so I was asking people to
not<00:05:14.290> spend<00:05:14.590> 10<00:05:14.919> minutes<00:05:15.190> in<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.430> showers

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
not spend 10 minutes in the showers

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.659 
not spend 10 minutes in the showers
keeping<00:05:16.600> warm<00:05:16.810> but<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.590> try<00:05:17.770> and<00:05:17.800> reduce<00:05:18.130> their

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
keeping warm but to try and reduce their

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.610 
keeping warm but to try and reduce their
usage<00:05:19.120> we<00:05:19.780> haven't<00:05:20.050> really<00:05:20.169> done<00:05:20.350> a<00:05:20.410> full

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
usage we haven't really done a full

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.450 
usage we haven't really done a full
analysis<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.250> it<00:05:21.400> yet<00:05:22.410> we<00:05:23.410> need<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.800> do<00:05:23.950> that<00:05:24.190> we

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
analysis of it yet we need to do that we

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.040 
analysis of it yet we need to do that we
will<00:05:24.610> do<00:05:24.789> that<00:05:24.970> at<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.210> end<00:05:25.240> of<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.570> season<00:05:25.930> to

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
will do that at the end of the season to

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.260 
will do that at the end of the season to
see<00:05:26.229> exactly<00:05:26.530> you<00:05:27.220> know<00:05:27.310> how<00:05:27.520> much<00:05:27.789> has<00:05:28.060> been

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
see exactly you know how much has been

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.629 
see exactly you know how much has been
produced<00:05:28.660> and<00:05:28.900> you<00:05:29.800> know<00:05:29.889> what<00:05:30.100> percentage

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
produced and you know what percentage

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.840 
produced and you know what percentage
you<00:05:30.789> in<00:05:30.940> fact<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.510> energy<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:33.250> shower<00:05:33.490> use

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
you in fact of the energy the shower use

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.260 
you in fact of the energy the shower use
are<00:05:34.090> being<00:05:34.240> produced

place<00:05:40.910> would<00:05:41.180> make<00:05:41.210> an<00:05:41.569> enormous<00:05:41.750> difference

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
place would make an enormous difference

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.930 
place would make an enormous difference
it<00:05:42.620> would<00:05:42.740> change<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.160> whole<00:05:43.250> economics<00:05:43.819> of

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
it would change the whole economics of

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.460 
it would change the whole economics of
it<00:05:44.090> and<00:05:44.300> it<00:05:44.360> would<00:05:44.509> be<00:05:44.630> sensible<00:05:45.169> of<00:05:45.319> that

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
it and it would be sensible of that

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.920 
it and it would be sensible of that
stage<00:05:45.800> to<00:05:46.100> consider<00:05:46.810> district<00:05:47.810> heating

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
stage to consider district heating

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.529 
stage to consider district heating
system<00:05:48.500> because<00:05:48.979> we<00:05:49.099> are<00:05:49.280> actually<00:05:49.729> placed<00:05:50.419> in

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
system because we are actually placed in

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.870 
system because we are actually placed in
a<00:05:50.630> very<00:05:50.810> good<00:05:50.990> position<00:05:51.139> with<00:05:51.650> with<00:05:52.460> several

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
a very good position with with several

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.969 
a very good position with with several
community<00:05:53.330> buildings<00:05:53.780> in<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.440> immediate

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
community buildings in the immediate

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.589 
community buildings in the immediate
vicinity<00:05:55.099> so<00:05:55.669> we<00:05:55.789> got<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.060> cricket<00:05:56.389> club

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
vicinity so we got the cricket club

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.050 
vicinity so we got the cricket club
we've<00:05:56.810> got<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.500> football<00:05:57.889> club<00:05:58.160> and<00:05:58.729> we've

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
we've got the football club and we've

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.960 
we've got the football club and we've
got<00:05:59.180> a<00:05:59.210> church<00:05:59.509> very<00:05:59.900> local<00:06:00.380> so<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.979> district

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
got a church very local so a district

got a church very local so a district
heating<00:06:02.120> system<00:06:02.569> would<00:06:02.780> make<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.080> great<00:06:03.410> deal

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
heating system would make a great deal

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.010 
heating system would make a great deal
of<00:06:03.860> sense<00:06:04.039> so<00:06:04.970> I<00:06:05.000> think<00:06:05.120> we<00:06:05.389> you<00:06:05.690> know<00:06:05.810> that

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
of sense so I think we you know that

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.080 
of sense so I think we you know that
would<00:06:06.229> be<00:06:06.380> sensible<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.800> look<00:06:07.009> at<00:06:07.130> it<00:06:07.250> at<00:06:07.880> that

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
would be sensible to look at it at that

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.629 
would be sensible to look at it at that
stage<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:12.770> biggest<00:06:13.070> challenges<00:06:13.490> I<00:06:13.610> think

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
stage the biggest challenges I think

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.400 
stage the biggest challenges I think
were<00:06:14.060> really<00:06:14.479> getting<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:14.870> money<00:06:15.020> to<00:06:15.229> do<00:06:15.380> it

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
were really getting the money to do it

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.310 
were really getting the money to do it
and<00:06:15.590> even<00:06:15.860> that<00:06:16.070> wasn't<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.520> hard<00:06:16.639> it's<00:06:17.060> just

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
and even that wasn't that hard it's just

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.240 
and even that wasn't that hard it's just
