00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.480 

okay<00:00:02.159> it's<00:00:02.310> morning<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:03.110> the<00:00:04.110> coals<00:00:04.950> pretty

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
okay it's morning and the coals pretty

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.210 
okay it's morning and the coals pretty
much<00:00:05.640> died<00:00:05.910> down<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:07.049> pulled<00:00:07.470> out<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.919> two

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
much died down and pulled out the two

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.599 
much died down and pulled out the two
containers<00:00:12.230> and<00:00:13.230> they're<00:00:14.009> cooling<00:00:14.370> their

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
containers and they're cooling their

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.170 
containers and they're cooling their
some<00:00:17.609> coals<00:00:17.940> left<00:00:18.930> but<00:00:19.260> big<00:00:19.800> coals<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.520> stop<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
some coals left but big coals I stop the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.130 
some coals left but big coals I stop the
airflow<00:00:21.869> down<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> could<00:00:22.880> get<00:00:23.880> as<00:00:24.029> much<00:00:24.180> char

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
airflow down so I could get as much char

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.910 
airflow down so I could get as much char
out<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> wood<00:00:27.689> itself<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.349> possible

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
out of the the wood itself as possible

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.139 
out of the the wood itself as possible
and<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.939> should<00:00:30.500> cool<00:00:31.500> off<00:00:31.769> stop<00:00:32.759> burnin

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and that should cool off stop burnin

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.200 
and that should cool off stop burnin
pretty<00:00:33.390> soon<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:34.620> these<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
pretty soon and these are at this is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
pretty soon and these are at this is
cooled<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.719> enough<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.170> open<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.739> one's<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
cooled down enough to open this one's a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.380 
cooled down enough to open this one's a
little<00:00:38.250> bit<00:00:38.579> hot<00:00:38.850> yet<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:40.550> let's<00:00:41.550> take<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.120> look

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
little bit hot yet so let's take a look

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:55.010 
little bit hot yet so let's take a look
at<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:53.600> haven't<00:00:54.600> seen<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.960> yet

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
at this one I haven't seen this yet

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.729 
at this one I haven't seen this yet
either<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.770> we'll<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:59.329> all<00:01:00.739> lovely

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
either so we'll see what all lovely

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:19.270 
either so we'll see what all lovely
charm<00:01:03.559> will<00:01:04.559> stick<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.040> char

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.510 

just<00:01:20.280> embarked<00:01:22.100> doesn't<00:01:23.100> matter<00:01:23.220> what<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
just embarked doesn't matter what you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.180 
just embarked doesn't matter what you
put<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:25.730> nut<00:01:26.730> shells<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.830> weeds<00:01:28.830> from

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
put into it the nut shells or weeds from

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.470 
put into it the nut shells or weeds from
the<00:01:29.280> garden<00:01:30.590> pine<00:01:31.590> needles<00:01:32.160> whatever<00:01:34.280> just

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
the garden pine needles whatever just

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.390 
the garden pine needles whatever just
had<00:01:36.480> twigs<00:01:36.870> it's<00:01:37.650> organic<00:01:38.160> pattern<00:01:38.520> put<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
had twigs it's organic pattern put it in

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.780 
had twigs it's organic pattern put it in
this<00:01:41.570> char<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.740> looks<00:01:46.920> pretty<00:01:47.250> good<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this char this one looks pretty good I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.480 
this char this one looks pretty good I
think<00:01:49.160> like<00:01:50.160> a<00:01:50.490> pencil<00:01:51.120> ads<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:55.400> here's<00:01:56.400> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
think like a pencil ads here here's a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.240 
think like a pencil ads here here's a
bigger<00:01:56.700> piece<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.970> about<00:02:03.390> half<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:05.010> wood

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
bigger piece so about half the the wood

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.460 
bigger piece so about half the the wood
energy<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.760> contained<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.510> gases<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
energy is contained in the gases and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.790 
energy is contained in the gases and
about<00:02:08.240> that<00:02:09.240> burn<00:02:09.510> off<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.080> then<00:02:10.290> half<00:02:10.560> is

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
about that burn off and then half is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.050 
about that burn off and then half is
left<00:02:11.040> as<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:12.330> carbon<00:02:12.930> char<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.580> grind

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
left as this carbon char and you grind

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.670 
left as this carbon char and you grind
that<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.360> with<00:02:15.990> my<00:02:16.170> garden<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:18.380> increases<00:02:19.380> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
that up with my garden it increases the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.260 
that up with my garden it increases the
soil<00:02:20.160> fertility<00:02:20.720> ability<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.900> hold<00:02:23.270> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
soil fertility ability to hold the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.500 
soil fertility ability to hold the
nutrients<00:02:24.830> from<00:02:25.830> bleaching<00:02:26.160> out<00:02:26.520> whatever

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
nutrients from bleaching out whatever

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.500 
nutrients from bleaching out whatever
you<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.410> see<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.860> paint<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> cans<00:02:30.030> now

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
you can see the paint on the cans now

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.830 
you can see the paint on the cans now
god<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:33.150> was<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.330> one-time<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.890> will

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
god that was a one-time of that you will

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.060 
god that was a one-time of that you will
got<00:02:36.840> out<00:02:37.489> box<00:02:38.489> now<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> do<00:02:39.600> future<00:02:40.080> char<00:02:40.770> burns

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
got out box now to do future char burns

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:50.510 
got out box now to do future char burns
in<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:44.150> pull<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.420> down<00:02:46.400> put<00:02:47.400> aside<00:02:48.830> okay<00:02:49.830> kind

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
in it pull this down put aside okay kind

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.970 
in it pull this down put aside okay kind
of<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.060> thought<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:53.660> still<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:54.810> brave<00:02:55.550> here

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
of like I thought I still be brave here

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.250 
of like I thought I still be brave here
about<00:02:58.980> half<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.580> char's<00:02:59.910> God<00:03:02.480> did<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.930> some

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
about half the char's God did get some

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:15.240 
about half the char's God did get some
but<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.920> let<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.340> too<00:03:05.550> much<00:03:05.700> air<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.590> guess

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.860 

you<00:03:16.250> can<00:03:16.459> burn<00:03:16.700> completely<00:03:16.969> though<00:03:17.359> I<00:03:17.390> mean<00:03:17.659> I

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
you can burn completely though I mean I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.809 
you can burn completely though I mean I
just<00:03:17.989> pulled<00:03:18.349> that<00:03:18.469> out<00:03:18.819> so<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.340> fire<00:03:22.609> are

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
just pulled that out so the fire are

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.220 
just pulled that out so the fire are
still<00:03:23.209> burning<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.870> guess<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:26.450> warm<00:03:26.840> but<00:03:26.989> I

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
still burning I guess it's warm but I

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.360 
still burning I guess it's warm but I
think<00:03:27.439> it's<00:03:27.560> all<00:03:27.709> char<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:28.700> not<00:03:28.939> not

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
think it's all char and it's not not

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.679 
think it's all char and it's not not
burn<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.989> so<00:03:34.659> this<00:03:35.659> is<00:03:35.689> fidgett<00:03:36.530> chunks<00:03:36.950> of

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
burn it so this is fidgett chunks of

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.580 
burn it so this is fidgett chunks of
bark<00:03:38.689> and<00:03:38.989> wood<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.340> headed<00:03:41.120> but<00:03:41.900> I'd<00:03:42.319> like<00:03:42.469> to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
bark and wood I headed but I'd like to

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.899 
bark and wood I headed but I'd like to
say<00:03:42.799> I<00:03:43.069> think<00:03:43.250> about<00:03:45.010> about<00:03:46.010> half<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.549> did<00:03:46.790> it

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
say I think about about half of a did it

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.970 
say I think about about half of a did it
end<00:03:47.120> up<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:47.870> away<00:03:48.079> it's<00:03:48.260> at<00:03:48.470> some<00:03:48.709> point

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
end up and away it's at some point

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.119 
end up and away it's at some point
because<00:03:49.609> it's<00:03:49.849> got<00:03:49.970> too<00:03:50.180> much<00:03:50.299> here<00:03:51.069> ok<00:03:52.069> so

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
because it's got too much here ok so

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.550 
because it's got too much here ok so
then<00:03:52.519> I've<00:03:53.329> got<00:03:54.669> saved<00:03:55.669> in<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:56.000> side<00:03:56.409> this<00:03:57.409> is

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
then I've got saved in the side this is
