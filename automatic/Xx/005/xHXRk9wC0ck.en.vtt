00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello everyone how are my name is 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.370
 hair gomez welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.160
 of jg art but in this case we're going to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.040
 talk about windows 10 in your wheel 9926 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 in which many have told me that this 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.660
 search bar that has cortana already 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.580
 they know that what is incorporated here is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.609
 is cortana in windows 10 the assistant 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.010
 virtual or personal from microsoft and I do not 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.769
 they say that this search bar occupies 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.599
 a lot of space in the taskbar of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.949
 our windows 10 and that suddenly to the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.130
 we have several applications 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.469
 open then let's notice that lack of 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.719
 space that we have there when having that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.820
 cut bar or that search bar 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.190
 that we have there in our bar 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.620
 tasks this taskbar or this bar 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.390
 This search bar or bar 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.270
 cortana we can change it for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.910
 an icon or we can remove it completely 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.699
 from our taskbar this we're going 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.039
 to be able to perform through the bar 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.260
 tasks giving you right click and let's go 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.930
 here to the option to search here we go to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.789
 can we have three options of 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.050
 show the search box that is the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.080
 bar that we see at this moment 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.600
 the search icon that is an icon one 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.030
 lupita that is shown to us there and we have 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.040
 the disabled that this is going to 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.470
 show no part no option 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.870
 for us to carry out searches already 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.760
 they know that searches on windows 10 the 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.460
 let's perform only for that bar 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.350
 of searches or the search button 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.510
 then there we are going to have these three 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.670
 options that we will be able to change 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.580
 directly show search icon 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 we see that it automatically changes to this 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.520
 icon and it shows or would come out what 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.270
 would this button or this new bar 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.830
 searches that would not be inserted in 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.840
 our taskbar but it would come out 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.720
 at the moment at the time of us 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.270
 press what would be this button 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.840
 search that is a bit more stylish 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.090
 a little more visually better and we do not 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.560
 will occupy as much space as it is 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.690
 search bar and we will be able to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.930
 we search directly too 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.210
 we have the option to disable what 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.399
 it would not show that search button 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.260
 nor the search bar there in our 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.980
 taskbar but you know that the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.769
 searches 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.769
 we will have directly here when 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.239
 we click on the start menu 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.370
 then we see that here if I give it 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.890
 click will show me the bar 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.230
 search for cortana automatically at 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.330
 we click on the menu but we do not 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.040
 will show what in what would be the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.459
 taskbar or in the bar 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.260
 search or the search button then 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.450
 these are the options that we 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.849
 we have to be able to remove that bar from 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.890
 searches if they take up a lot of space in 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.319
