gone with the Hong Kong hobby city 1
I've<00:00:32.220> heard<00:00:32.399> mixed<00:00:33.060> reviews<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.510> these<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I've heard mixed reviews with these and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.319 
I've heard mixed reviews with these and
it<00:00:35.070> did<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.220> bit<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> research<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.850> RC<00:00:36.120> groups

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
it did a bit of research on RC groups

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.590 
it did a bit of research on RC groups
and<00:00:36.540> found<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.550> in<00:00:38.550> its<00:00:38.670> stock<00:00:38.880> form<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.450> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and found that in its stock form this is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
and found that in its stock form this is
not<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.020> safe<00:00:40.350> helicopter<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.980> fly<00:00:41.010> few<00:00:41.850> things

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
not a safe helicopter to fly few things

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.099 
not a safe helicopter to fly few things
if<00:00:42.239> you're<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.750> helicopter

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
if you're going to get this helicopter

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.189 
if you're going to get this helicopter
to<00:00:43.769> change<00:00:44.039> are<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.730> feathering<00:00:45.329> shaft<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
to change are the feathering shaft and

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.590 
to change are the feathering shaft and
that's<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> part<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> holds<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.600> blades

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that's the part that holds the blades

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.079 
that's the part that holds the blades
together<00:00:48.809> essentially<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.699> lots<00:00:50.699> of<00:00:50.760> reports

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
together essentially and lots of reports

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.360 
together essentially and lots of reports
of<00:00:51.210> guys<00:00:51.329> flying<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:52.140> 3d<00:00:52.739> head<00:00:52.920> speed<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of guys flying that at 3d head speed and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
of guys flying that at 3d head speed and
the<00:00:53.879> blade<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.089> coming<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.839> that's

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the blade is coming out so that's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.819 
the blade is coming out so that's
obviously<00:00:55.769> a<00:00:56.100> catastrophic<00:00:56.969> failure<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
obviously a catastrophic failure the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.119 
obviously a catastrophic failure the
tail<00:00:59.039> belt<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> belt<00:01:00.570> system<00:01:00.929> and<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
tail belt it's a belt system and the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.610 
tail belt it's a belt system and the
tail<00:01:02.309> stock<00:01:02.820> still<00:01:03.210> tail<00:01:03.809> belt<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.199> break<00:01:04.440> on

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
tail stock still tail belt will break on

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.649 
tail stock still tail belt will break on
you<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.430> those<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> 2<00:01:06.180> things<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.480> want

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you so those are the 2 things you want

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.490 
you so those are the 2 things you want
to<00:01:06.720> change<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.080> sure

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to change for sure

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.780 
to change for sure
I<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> changed<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.190> main<00:01:08.340> shaft<00:01:08.550> on

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
I think it changed the main shaft on

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.200 
I think it changed the main shaft on
this<00:01:09.080> stock<00:01:10.080> comes<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.470> plastic<00:01:10.950> blades<00:01:11.210> I'm

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
this stock comes with plastic blades I'm

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.790 
this stock comes with plastic blades I'm
a<00:01:12.270> snob<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> fly<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.620> makes<00:01:13.710> me

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
a snob I think I fly good or it makes me

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.230 
a snob I think I fly good or it makes me
feel<00:01:13.980> like<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.280> fly<00:01:14.460> better<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.030> carbon

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
feel like I fly better if I get carbon

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
feel like I fly better if I get carbon
blades<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:16.079> some<00:01:16.290> cheap<00:01:16.710> ease<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.070> those

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
blades so I got some cheap ease of those

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.539 
blades so I got some cheap ease of those
and<00:01:18.290> some<00:01:19.290> people<00:01:19.500> had<00:01:19.590> issues<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> tail

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and some people had issues with the tail

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.120 
and some people had issues with the tail
and<00:01:20.850> I've<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:21.899> on<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.500> used<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> stock

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and I've actually on this used the stock

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.840 
and I've actually on this used the stock
tail<00:01:23.399> broke<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.229> Judah<00:01:25.829> my<00:01:25.950> fault<00:01:26.219> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
tail broke it in a Judah my fault and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.149 
tail broke it in a Judah my fault and
replaced<00:01:27.149> it<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.140> align<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
replaced it with the the align one and I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.469 
replaced it with the the align one and I
didn't<00:01:29.490> find<00:01:29.579> any<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> difference

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
didn't find any kind of difference

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.700 
didn't find any kind of difference
they're<00:01:30.600> both<00:01:30.719> pretty<00:01:30.899> sloppy<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.439> they

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
they're both pretty sloppy but they

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
they're both pretty sloppy but they
tighten<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.070> under<00:01:32.399> under<00:01:32.939> load<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.570> I've<00:01:33.659> got

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
tighten up under under load and I've got

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.580 
tighten up under under load and I've got
some<00:01:33.960> kbd<00:01:34.560> tail<00:01:35.009> rotors<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:37.350> one

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
some kbd tail rotors on this the one

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
some kbd tail rotors on this the one
final<00:01:37.860> thing<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.060> canopy<00:01:39.539> looks

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
final thing is the the canopy looks

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.350 
final thing is the the canopy looks
great<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.979> doesn't<00:01:41.280> fit<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.270> you're

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
great but it doesn't fit so what you're

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.779 
great but it doesn't fit so what you're
going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> need<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.460> fill<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.670> hot

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
going to need to do is fill it with hot

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.459 
going to need to do is fill it with hot
water<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.390> squeeze<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.780> from<00:01:46.229> top<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
water and then squeeze it from top to

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.410 
water and then squeeze it from top to
bottom<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.890> makes<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.250> fatter<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.969> shorter

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
bottom that makes it fatter and shorter

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.550 
bottom that makes it fatter and shorter
and<00:01:48.810> it'll<00:01:49.229> clear<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.039> servos<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.850> case

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
and it'll clear the servos in that case

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.690 
and it'll clear the servos in that case
for<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> few<00:01:52.710> flights<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.250> seems<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> fly
