book yeah as you can tell we're slowly
cracking<00:01:44.000> its<00:01:44.150> armor<00:01:45.080> or<00:01:45.290> it's<00:01:45.440> like<00:01:45.560> outer

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
cracking its armor or it's like outer

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.740 
cracking its armor or it's like outer
shell<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.520> don't<00:01:46.910> really<00:01:47.030> know<00:01:47.180> if<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:47.420> armor

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
shell I don't really know if it's armor

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.150 
shell I don't really know if it's armor
I<00:01:47.810> don't<00:01:47.960> really<00:01:48.140> know<00:01:48.290> what<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.680> is<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:49.040> be

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
I don't really know what it is to be

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160 
I don't really know what it is to be
exact<00:01:49.490> because<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:50.240> looks<00:01:50.600> like<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:50.990> already

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
exact because it looks like it's already

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.630 
exact because it looks like it's already
bones<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.979> I'm<00:01:52.040> saying<00:01:52.220> we're<00:01:52.369> cracking

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
bones and I'm saying we're cracking

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.249 
bones and I'm saying we're cracking
bones<00:01:53.330> but<00:01:54.369> inside<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.760> more<00:01:56.030> bones<00:01:56.270> you

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
bones but inside of it is more bones you

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.780 
bones but inside of it is more bones you
know<00:01:57.290> I'm<00:01:57.590> not<00:01:57.950> really<00:01:58.100> going<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.400> look<00:01:58.460> into

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
know I'm not really going to look into

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.400 
know I'm not really going to look into
that<00:01:58.910> but<00:01:59.119> we<00:01:59.450> just<00:01:59.630> basically<00:01:59.750> want<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.200> crack

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
that but we just basically want to crack

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.190 
that but we just basically want to crack
its<00:02:00.590> outer<00:02:00.800> shell<00:02:01.479> with<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.690> technique<00:02:03.170> so

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
its outer shell with this technique so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.499 
its outer shell with this technique so
you<00:02:03.410> want<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.800> rinse<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.490> repeat<00:02:04.850> three<00:02:05.210> times

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
you want to rinse and repeat three times

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.380 
you want to rinse and repeat three times
and<00:02:05.960> yeah<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.619> know<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.070> old<00:02:07.280> three<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.300> know

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
and yeah you know the old three you know

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.229 
and yeah you know the old three you know
because<00:02:08.660> three<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:10.310> best<00:02:10.520> number<00:02:10.759> ever

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
because three is the best number ever

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.510 
because three is the best number ever
egg<00:02:11.570> Canaan<00:02:11.870> 70<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.320> better<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:12.739> three<00:02:13.370> go

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
egg Canaan 70 is better but three go
