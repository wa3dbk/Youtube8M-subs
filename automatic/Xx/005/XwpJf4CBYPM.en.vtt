 from the words of those who were Donetsk and Lugansk 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.299
 everything is much more clearly strictly more 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.270

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.420

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.490
 imagine 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.259
 formalized armed formation 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.860

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.450
 Republic of Ly with its own structure for 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.369

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.210
 there were the right amount of weapons squads 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.980
 were small poorly prepared for it 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.420
