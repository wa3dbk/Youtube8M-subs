if you predicted my switch or what but
he<00:00:45.300> doesn't<00:00:45.600> even<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> fake<00:00:46.230> i<00:00:46.260> just

a<00:00:48.930> switch<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.800> know<00:00:49.890> i'm<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
a switch here because you know i'm a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.709 
a switch here because you know i'm a
physically<00:00:50.399> defensive<00:00:50.850> wall<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.510> know

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

what<00:00:51.930> he<00:00:51.989> wants<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.820> he<00:00:54.000> stays<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
what he wants to do but he stays in and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
what he wants to do but he stays in and
thoughts<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> tried<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> sub<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:55.860> he

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
thoughts as I tried it sub and then he

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.410 
thoughts as I tried it sub and then he
stays<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> double<00:00:56.699> hits<00:00:57.059> which<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.360> don't

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
stays in and double hits which I don't

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
stays in and double hits which I don't
understand<00:00:58.109> i<00:00:58.230> predict<00:00:58.559> him<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.739> switch<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
understand i predict him to switch to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
heat wave but he stays in I get a crit

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.800 
heat wave but he stays in I get a crit
here<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.380> mattered<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:09.390> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
here which is you know it mattered but I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.880 
here which is you know it mattered but I
don't<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> would<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.770> been<00:01:10.830> like

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
don't know it would have been like

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
don't know it would have been like
completely<00:01:11.460> different<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.510> didn't<00:01:12.840> get

that crib because I wouldn't probably
just<00:01:14.460> switch<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.060> couldn't

I should be able to take any hit he has

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.240 
I should be able to take any hit he has
to<00:04:03.420> throw<00:04:03.660> at<00:04:03.780> me<00:04:03.930> except<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:04.590> explosion

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
to throw at me except for explosion

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.380 
to throw at me except for explosion
which<00:04:05.400> would<00:04:05.549> be<00:04:05.670> fine<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.060> know<00:04:06.120> because

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
which would be fine you know because

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.000 
which would be fine you know because
then<00:04:06.510> he<00:04:06.570> would<00:04:06.660> kill<00:04:06.840> himself<00:04:06.930> off<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.590> I

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
then he would kill himself off and I

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.410 
then he would kill himself off and I
don't<00:04:08.250> think<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.489> would<00:04:08.640> try<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.060> anyway

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
don't think you would try that anyway

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.960 
don't think you would try that anyway
because<00:04:09.450> i<00:04:09.780> do<00:04:09.930> have<00:04:10.049> protect<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.580> just<00:04:11.850> in

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
because i do have protect and just in

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.280 
because i do have protect and just in
case<00:04:12.120> i<00:04:12.150> would<00:04:12.330> go<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.690> he's<00:04:12.989> not<00:04:13.170> going

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
case i would go for that he's not going

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.430 
case i would go for that he's not going
to<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.530> explode<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.580> uh<00:04:14.900> take<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> nice<00:04:16.140> bunch

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
to just explode so uh take a nice bunch

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.710 
to just explode so uh take a nice bunch
fairly<00:04:16.769> convincingly<00:04:17.220> i<00:04:17.489> have<00:04:18.239> taken<00:04:18.450> ice

fairly convincingly i have taken ice
budget<00:04:19.140> from<00:04:19.290> weevils<00:04:19.769> before<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.220> i<00:04:20.310> was

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
budget from weevils before so i was

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.930 
budget from weevils before so i was
really<00:04:20.580> not<00:04:20.849> afraid<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.330> this<00:04:21.570> at<00:04:21.780> all

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
really not afraid of this at all

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.850 
really not afraid of this at all
the<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.750> know<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:23.870> take<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.260> finish<00:04:24.650> him<00:04:24.710> off
