00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.790
 The Pokémon are Japan's last attempt to destroy the millenary culture

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.000
 the monster choir

 the same and have eyes whose size is inversely proportional to the size 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.750

 the most well-known pokémon pikachu 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.050
 the intrinsic characteristics of Pokémon are ethically sized eyes

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.399
 acquisition of the faculty of speech 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.130
 limited a series of syllables that curiously sound the same as a part 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.570
 of its name 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170
 certain combat skills

 lobotomy progressive partner and predisposition to submission 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.419
 lack of genital organs and any means of evacuation of 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.389
 waste is reproduced pokémon and sand other animals by radiation or spores 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.509
 even though in their baby stages they are amorphous and stupid animals in the 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.459
 adult stages are completely anthropomorphic in addition to incorporate 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.599
 an armor by the temple 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.360
 are able to live more than half of their lives locked in spheres 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.469
 metallic and at the time of leaving is nothing more than to receive a beating in a 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.290
 battle 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.029
 even so 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.209
 they love their coaches 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.150
 despite its dangerous that the pokémon are creatures with 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.639
 very interesting peculiarities 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.529
 they do not have sex or practice it, which explains why they are there all day 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:51.859
 pissed off 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.959
 they reproduce by means of some eggs 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.909
 that you do not know where they come from 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.529
 the scholarly scientists of the subject whoever it may be a 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.180
 abortion resulting from a crossing of a peacock with a giraffe and another of the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.650
 theories of our expert scientists is that these things come from 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.079
 the eggs kinder surprise or the stupid planet inc 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.580
 another thing to emphasize about the pokémon I know what 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.010
 apart from having shape of rubber stuffed animals 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.509
 they are immortal 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.659
 they never die 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.419
 they give him sticks to leave him without his ability to reproduce his name 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.890
 Acquisition of the faculty of limited speech a series of syllables 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.560
 and if they had the bad temper of the world to hit one so hard to 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.909
 kill him would become another pokémon 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.010
 but ghost that in theory at the beginning of time there was only 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.489
 three but evolved with the giraffe and peacock egg technique 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.919
 by popular vote the Pokemon series has been chosen as the 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.919
 worst series in the whole world for me I do not know how many geeks 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.089
 well that's all the shit about who 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.489
 there more 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.209
 Japanese ancestry pokémon the clue that basically proves that pokémon 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.519
 it's a Japanese invention without a doubt that both the police force and the 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.979
 global nursing staff are clones of each other 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.939
 Technological advance only seen in Star Wars and is achievable 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.019
 in our time just for them 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.239
 if you find two different policemen or two nurses who do not look like clones 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.199
 you are facing a bad copy of the idea of ​​why not 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.650
 the Pokémon owe their origin possibly the last voyage of 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.229
 chuburna liza japan 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.009
 released a couple of spinning kicks and the poor animals were left like this 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:28.340
 Well that's it 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.590
 now I'm going to 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.320
 I'm here 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.919
 now I'm going to play the emerald pokémon 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.150
 wait 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.040
 I will continue talking about why not good they have asked what is 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.159
 feed the sports humans 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.369
 in my opinion they feed on their own because they will mount in the 

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:48.689
 pokémon world you have your pokémon and the next day you are hungry you arrive and you 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.090
 you eat it and everyone is happy 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.270
 not exact the pokémon xd 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.669
 I've always wondered what the original is 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.240
 pokémon or digimon 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.449
 that says it speaks 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.069
 the original digimon 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.659
 that everyone knows 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:05.009
 like digimon is the original 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.160
 everyone knew that koke with came out first we said in pokémon 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.260
 we said in pokémon we said in pokémon we said in pokémon good ya enough 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.210
 so that they do not say more let's make a competition to see which is the best and 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.580
 the original that the youths would have decided us 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.300
 good you all youtube plains 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.879
 Which serie is better 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.449
 pokémon or digimon 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.779
 leave comments about it 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.610
