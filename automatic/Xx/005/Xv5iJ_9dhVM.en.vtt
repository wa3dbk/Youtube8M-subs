we<00:02:12.370> have<00:02:13.260> Luke<00:02:14.260> Skywalker<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:20.409> can<00:02:20.799> turn

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
we have Luke Skywalker and you can turn

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.949 
we have Luke Skywalker and you can turn
his<00:02:21.849> head<00:02:22.030> maybe<00:02:24.329> you're<00:02:25.329> supposed<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.840> be

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
his head maybe you're supposed to be

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.929 
his head maybe you're supposed to be
able<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.200> turn<00:02:26.379> his<00:02:26.500> head<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:27.069> it's<00:02:27.730> really

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
able to turn his head but it's really

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.610 
able to turn his head but it's really
stiff<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.689> I<00:02:28.930> think<00:02:29.200> that's<00:02:29.379> just<00:02:29.500> because

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
stiff and I think that's just because

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.369 
stiff and I think that's just because
it's<00:02:29.980> new<00:02:30.220> but<00:02:30.970> I'm<00:02:31.720> pretty<00:02:31.989> sure<00:02:32.200> you're

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
it's new but I'm pretty sure you're

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.420 
it's new but I'm pretty sure you're
supposed<00:02:32.409> to<00:02:32.769> be<00:02:32.829> able<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.010> turn<00:02:33.159> his<00:02:33.310> head

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
supposed to be able to turn his head

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.059 
supposed to be able to turn his head
it's<00:02:33.640> just<00:02:33.670> not<00:02:33.939> working<00:02:34.120> very<00:02:34.480> well<00:02:34.859> but<00:02:35.859> you

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
it's just not working very well but you

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.740 
it's just not working very well but you
can<00:02:36.280> move<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.670> arms<00:02:37.030> he<00:02:37.150> does<00:02:37.269> come<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.599> his

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
can move the arms he does come with his

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.289 
can move the arms he does come with his
lightsaber<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.639> this<00:02:39.639> is<00:02:39.819> something<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.150> I

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
lightsaber and this is something that I

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.660 
lightsaber and this is something that I
thought<00:02:40.569> was<00:02:40.750> really<00:02:40.780> really<00:02:41.230> cool<00:02:41.639> not<00:02:42.639> only

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
thought was really really cool not only

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.929 
thought was really really cool not only
does<00:02:43.030> he<00:02:43.060> also<00:02:43.269> come<00:02:43.689> with<00:02:43.719> a<00:02:44.230> blaster<00:02:44.889> he<00:02:45.670> also

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
does he also come with a blaster he also

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.800 
does he also come with a blaster he also
has<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.019> holster<00:02:47.470> on<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.829> side<00:02:48.069> there<00:02:48.400> that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
has the holster on the side there that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.390 
has the holster on the side there that
actually<00:02:49.810> works<00:02:50.139> you<00:02:50.470> can<00:02:50.590> actually<00:02:50.829> put<00:02:51.250> the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
actually works you can actually put the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.520 
actually works you can actually put the
blaster<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.120> which<00:02:52.450> i<00:02:52.689> think<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.989> really

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
blaster in it which i think is really

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.149 
blaster in it which i think is really
really<00:02:53.709> good

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
really good

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.690 
really good
glad<00:02:54.639> they<00:02:54.819> included<00:02:55.299> that<00:02:55.419> this<00:02:55.659> time<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
glad they included that this time and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.059 
glad they included that this time and
other<00:02:57.700> than<00:02:57.849> that<00:02:57.970> some<00:02:58.269> pretty<00:02:58.840> ok<00:02:59.379> detailing

other than that some pretty ok detailing

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.750 
other than that some pretty ok detailing
nothing<00:03:00.819> too<00:03:01.030> spectacular<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:03.010> think<00:03:03.549> he's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
nothing too spectacular but I think he's

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.099 
nothing too spectacular but I think he's
cool<00:03:04.030> anyway<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.579> next<00:03:06.579> up<00:03:06.760> we<00:03:07.209> have<00:03:07.239> Darth

cool anyway and next up we have Darth

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.770 
cool anyway and next up we have Darth
Vader<00:03:08.530> which<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.639> think<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.329> really<00:03:10.659> really

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
Vader which I think is really really

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.140 
Vader which I think is really really
cool<00:03:11.049> I<00:03:11.470> was<00:03:11.829> really<00:03:12.129> surprised<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.939> see<00:03:13.120> that

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
cool I was really surprised to see that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.330 
cool I was really surprised to see that
they<00:03:13.389> actually<00:03:13.840> included<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.379> cloth<00:03:14.709> cape<00:03:15.129> I

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
they actually included a cloth cape I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.640 
they actually included a cloth cape I
thought<00:03:15.609> it<00:03:15.730> would<00:03:15.849> be<00:03:15.970> plastic<00:03:16.900> like<00:03:17.199> the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
thought it would be plastic like the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.819 
thought it would be plastic like the
rest<00:03:17.889> of<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.159> but<00:03:18.909> it<00:03:19.239> is<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.419> very<00:03:19.599> nice<00:03:19.840> cloth
