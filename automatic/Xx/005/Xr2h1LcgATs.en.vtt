hang on we're going to be fighting
ultimate<00:00:02.490> electro<00:00:03.179> requires<00:00:03.600> level<00:00:03.899> 45<00:00:15.619> so

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
ultimate electro requires level 45 so

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:28.929 
ultimate electro requires level 45 so
this<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.070> ultimate<00:00:17.789> electro

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.279 

alright<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.060> assuming<00:00:30.570> they've<00:00:30.750> made<00:00:31.050> this

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
alright I'm assuming they've made this

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.979 
alright I'm assuming they've made this
stage<00:00:31.590> much<00:00:31.920> harder<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.680> that's<00:00:34.680> because

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.770 

usually<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.140> make<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> harder<00:00:41.100> when<00:00:41.780> they

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
usually they make it harder when they

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
usually they make it harder when they
just<00:00:43.050> release<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> new<00:00:43.680> stage<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.399> people<00:00:44.850> can't

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
just release a new stage so people can't

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.190 
just release a new stage so people can't
beat<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> early<00:00:47.570> all<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.719> nothing<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
beat it that early all right nothing is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.779 
beat it that early all right nothing is
happening<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.770> far<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.309> can't

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
happening so far but I can't

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.720 
happening so far but I can't
those<00:00:51.390> green<00:00:51.660> thing<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.199> bothers<00:00:52.800> me<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.160 

mean<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> red<00:00:57.059> ones<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.480> bother<00:00:57.719> me<00:00:58.020> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

mean the red ones don't bother me that
much<00:00:58.440> by<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> last<00:00:59.010> minute

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
much by the last minute

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
much by the last minute
appearing<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.329> kind<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> laser<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
appearing it's kind of like the laser I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
appearing it's kind of like the laser I
don't<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> laser<00:01:02.250> stages<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.120> tried<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
don't like the laser stages I tried to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.219 
don't like the laser stages I tried to
ignore<00:01:04.110> those<00:01:04.530> stages<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.309> possible<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.229> mean

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
ignore those stages if possible I mean

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.410 
ignore those stages if possible I mean
the<00:01:07.890> laser<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.369> comes<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.850> whatever<00:01:09.119> they

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
