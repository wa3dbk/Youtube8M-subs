00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
think the soldiers on the ground can

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.460 
think the soldiers on the ground can
accomplish<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.240> what<00:02:34.450> those<00:02:34.690> soldiers<00:02:35.020> know

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
accomplish and what those soldiers know

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.090 
accomplish and what those soldiers know
they<00:02:36.250> actually<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.970> do<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.720> kind<00:02:37.930> of

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
they actually can do and the kind of

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.050 
they actually can do and the kind of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
decisions that are made that are so

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.380 
decisions that are made that are so
governed<00:02:40.510> by<00:02:41.280> who<00:02:42.280> stands<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.880> get<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.030> medal
