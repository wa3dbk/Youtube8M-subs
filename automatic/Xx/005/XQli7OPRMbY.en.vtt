00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
would fade they would get dry and you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.729 
would fade they would get dry and you
would<00:01:03.300> need<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> sand<00:01:03.750> them<00:01:03.870> down<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.260> real<00:01:04.439> oil

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
would need to sand them down or real oil

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.310 
would need to sand them down or real oil
them<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.400> nets<00:01:05.729> from<00:01:05.939> nomad<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.869> nets<00:01:07.140> from

Nomad fish spawn in this case you'll see
are<00:01:09.840> made<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.530> composites<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
are made of composites that are I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.350 
are made of composites that are I
believe<00:01:12.240> graphite<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.760> fiberglass<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
more important part about these nests is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.149 
more important part about these nests is
the<00:01:19.680> function

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the function

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
the function
they're<00:01:20.520> extremely<00:01:20.970> durable<00:01:21.360> they're

right you may indeed have to replace the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.490 
right you may indeed have to replace the
net<00:01:26.939> after<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.299> couple<00:01:27.479> years<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> should

going bad and and really about the net
being<00:01:34.710> extremely<00:01:35.130> damaged<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:35.939> they're

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
being extremely damaged because they're

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330
