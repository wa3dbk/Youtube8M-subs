00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.689
 we have then to the lungs gaza 17 of the mammals we can not forget that 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.920
 these animals are with my technicians what does this mean are the animals that 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.129
 present the body temperature as they are told and because of this 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.000
 we need to say with a lot of energy 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.820
 we need it collor these animals have very high metabolism to 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.949
 respiration of birds and mammals 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.740
 they need a well-developed album like the lungs 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.160
 that you are preserving 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.170
 breathing is very important and it has many games like us 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.630
 we have just observed 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.449
 now 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.479
 is that we are going to comment a little bit on our breath breathing 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.500
 human 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 so you need to observe without our respiratory system in the system 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.140
 respiratory 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410
 is the human respiratory system 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.200
 it has presence of nasal cavities 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.240
 there we will find the short pms and the mucus that will help 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.570
 It's a gift from God. 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.710
 Excretion of microorganisms 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 but we also have the heating duarte acra when it penetrates through the cesspools 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.830
 the blood qualifications that we will find in this region. 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.960
 so nanny and ana 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.409
 the nasal cavities 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.729
 we have a lot of next vessels 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.550
 the air passing through the nostrils he dropped a tube you see there 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.570
 who to err 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.910
 pharyngitis 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.910
 the larynx and will stop here to send 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.299
 I never dealt here 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.590
 We'll wait for the notification. 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.939
 there for them 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.299
 lungs then we have details of a lung on the right lung 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.690
 donetsk him and we have a bronchus which is a branch and trachea 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.020
 penetrating 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.910
 internally we moniz 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.299
 I realize that the lungs 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.299
 they will be the whites rules does not mean in the inner region of the 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.100
 lungs 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.609
 hospitalization was at the end of the bronchial years we will find 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649
 these facts that we are trying to 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.769
 that you are seeing them in the lungs and it is these facts that we 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.900
 hematologist the parts exchange gas 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.659
 entry into the sorting and exit 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.439
 and carbonic 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.939
 the organs that also remain totally the surface of the 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.340
 lung if you are fan and direction profiles if internal of a lung 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.239
 a human lung 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.829
 we will have about 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.099
 150 square meters of internal lung surface 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.609
 then reunited what years he smokes 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.610
 The importance of this has 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.980
 in animal mount siam 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.349
 seek greater amounts of oxygen to produce more heat 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.639
 since mammals are animals 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.099
 or better technicians 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.280
 is how does the control of our breath occur 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.779
 how do these gas exchanges occur 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.579
 so they prefer security now 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.799
 then we have there respiratory movements observe 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.119
 the entry of art 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.429
 15 expiration movements 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:15.049
 participation of the diaphragm the exit of the air movement explanation 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.449
 all we still have inspiration 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.859
 the lung between the retraction 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.700
 has greatly reduced the goal 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.049
 increasing the pressure 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.110
 eternal 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.630
 in relation to the atmosphere 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.150
 so it has moved more in periods like this through the roads 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.139
 respiratory 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.180
 for stelionate 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.619
 so we have art there 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.040
 breath 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.399
 the exit of the rice 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.819
 to roll in we have to have 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.289
 the pressure of the day-out greater than the internal pressure, how does this go 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:50.579
 happen then area it will move from the outside 'disrupts the ways 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.179
 respiratory 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:57.119
 the lungs into the lungs and through this difference of 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:01.669
 volume and that we will find in the lungs then the lungs expand 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.419
 increasing its volume ii the sea mail 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.000
 because it was from internal pressure 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.890
 regarding 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.710
 atmospheric pressure 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.800
 allowing air to enter obviously that these pressure differences 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.320
 internal and external are controlled afragola pelts by the movement of the day 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.439
 weak 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.879
 by inter-muscle movement with the afternoons 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:29.729
 but after these movements they are also controlled foot 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.789
 it is in the nervous system 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.439
 a region of the major nervous system that is the respiratory center 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.889
 is a fool 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.219
 detail 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:39.240
 of the world 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.410
 observe the location of the world at the base of the brain 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:48.309
 and to finish improving that 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:50.349
 Good, we just got it right. 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.400
 our entire respiratory system 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 now 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.130
 after an afternoon the gas exchanges 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.520
 How did I introduce what hit the mountain range? 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.670
 so if it's too late, this year 6 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.309
 nanda encourages the difficult moment 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:15.379
 then we have there gasques tractors suac cgi thousand and hateful of 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.150
 carbon co2 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.009
 ducks have transported 3% by the blood term dissolved in the plasma 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.240
 blood 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.270
 that the net part in the saints 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.590
 and 7% of co2 is through the portal of the blood term 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.960
 97% doha that serginho that is transported 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.759
 like obina are with hemoglobin 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.809
 in the first leg 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.439
 is what I have is that we find ourselves inside small 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:49.389
 cells most of the ac was released the transported foot 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.870
 she has a flag 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.710
 while keiko dial carbon wells the bulk of the carbon dioxide 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.520
 is carried in the form of bicarbonates which are salts present therein 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.699
 no saints 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.539
 as we have just observed 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.440
 breathing is important prayer for living things and how important 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.030
 because through the breath we have the entrance of the serginho actor and I 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.090
 I believe ap 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.529
 goes to the cell where what we call combustion will occur 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.159
 burning of the carmo and grateful 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.819
 and this carbohydrate is record will release the energy is that we go 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:26.660
 use 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.960
 during our vital activities 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.830
 very well 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.250
 and I wait for you 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.900
 for our next lesson from him - day until
