how to assemble your brand new lucky

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.629 
how to assemble your brand new lucky
scooter<00:00:12.150> first<00:00:13.110> we'll<00:00:13.679> install<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.070> star<00:00:14.429> nut

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
scooter first we'll install the star nut

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
scooter first we'll install the star nut
the<00:00:14.880> star<00:00:15.120> nut<00:00:15.269> goes<00:00:15.480> inside<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.350> sear<00:00:16.590> tube

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the star nut goes inside the sear tube

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.650 
the star nut goes inside the sear tube
of<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> fork<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.699> holds<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> headset

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
of the fork and holds the headset

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.230 
of the fork and holds the headset
together<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.680> spin<00:00:20.090> after<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
together so that it can spin after that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
together so that it can spin after that
we'll<00:00:21.539> be<00:00:21.570> doing<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.020> crown<00:00:22.260> race<00:00:22.500> which

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
we'll be doing the crown race which

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
we'll be doing the crown race which
holds<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> bearing<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.210> bottom<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> so

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
holds the bearing on the bottom of it so

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:37.840 
holds the bearing on the bottom of it so
that<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.590> spin<00:00:25.859> freely<00:00:26.250> as<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.730> should

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.010 

this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.910> something<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.690> should<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.960> done

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
job after we install the star nut we can

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
job after we install the star nut we can

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the bearing in there which should be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.749 
the bearing in there which should be
pretty<00:01:48.810> easy<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.320> do<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.890> slide<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.490> fork

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
pretty easy to do you can slide the fork

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.830 
pretty easy to do you can slide the fork
up<00:01:50.970> inside<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> deck<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:53.180> set<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
up inside the deck and set it like so to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.789 
up inside the deck and set it like so to
hold<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.290> still

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
hold it still

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.609 
hold it still
after<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.479> install<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.049> second

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
after that you can install the second

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.709 
after that you can install the second
bearing<00:01:58.950> onto<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.579> top<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.299> head<00:02:00.479> tube

bearing onto the top of the head tube

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.450 
bearing onto the top of the head tube
and<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.899> should<00:02:04.170> sit<00:02:04.439> nicely<00:02:04.680> inside<00:02:05.219> there

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and that should sit nicely inside there

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.089 
and that should sit nicely inside there
as<00:02:05.549> well<00:02:06.170> then<00:02:07.170> you'll<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> little

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
as well then you'll put a little

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.609 
as well then you'll put a little
compression<00:02:08.759> ring<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.959> will<00:02:10.110> hold<00:02:10.319> all

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
compression ring in that will hold all

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190 
compression ring in that will hold all
the<00:02:10.800> bearings<00:02:11.129> steady<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.540> center<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the bearings steady in the center of the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.430 
the bearings steady in the center of the
head

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
head

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.420 
head
two<00:02:14.300> after<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.750> top<00:02:16.290> cap<00:02:16.560> will<00:02:16.950> go<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.220> top

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
two after that a top cap will go on top

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430 
two after that a top cap will go on top
to<00:02:17.670> keep<00:02:17.790> everything<00:02:18.150> nice<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.540> clean<00:02:18.780> inside

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
to keep everything nice and clean inside

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.140 
to keep everything nice and clean inside
there<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:21.470> as<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.710> move<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.100> after<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> place

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
there and as we move on after you place

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.150 
there and as we move on after you place
that<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.570> top<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.440> will<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.010> install

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
that on top you will have to install

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.340 
that on top you will have to install
this<00:02:26.490> adapter<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.240> that<00:02:27.270> your<00:02:27.510> handlebars<00:02:28.020> fit

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
this adapter so that your handlebars fit

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.800 
this adapter so that your handlebars fit
on<00:02:28.470> top<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.860> your<00:02:29.010> fork<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:30.360> will<00:02:30.570> slide

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
on top of your fork that will slide
