on how to make these smallest block

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.249 
on how to make these smallest block
swapper<00:00:15.910> it<00:00:16.570> is<00:00:16.840> 3<00:00:17.200> x<00:00:17.500> 7<00:00:17.980> x<00:00:18.009> 1<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:19.090> as<00:00:19.960> you<00:00:20.110> can

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
swapper it is 3 x 7 x 1 and as you can

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.260 
swapper it is 3 x 7 x 1 and as you can
see<00:00:20.289> through<00:00:20.680> it's<00:00:20.980> three<00:00:21.400> blocks<00:00:21.520> tall<00:00:21.939> three

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
see through it's three blocks tall three

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.200 
see through it's three blocks tall three
blocks<00:00:22.539> wide<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.170> 30<00:00:23.980> one<00:00:24.250> blocking<00:00:24.519> link<00:00:24.939> and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
blocks wide and 30 one blocking link and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.960 
blocks wide and 30 one blocking link and
they<00:00:26.019> can<00:00:26.289> be<00:00:26.500> literally<00:00:26.949> connected<00:00:27.400> one

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
they can be literally connected one

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.679 
they can be literally connected one
block<00:00:28.210> apart<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:30.039> to<00:00:30.550> start<00:00:30.609> you<00:00:31.179> can<00:00:31.390> place

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
block apart so to start you can place

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.280 
block apart so to start you can place
two<00:00:32.169> blocks<00:00:33.089> with<00:00:34.089> a<00:00:34.120> five-block<00:00:34.750> space<00:00:35.050> in

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
two blocks with a five-block space in

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.539 
two blocks with a five-block space in
between<00:00:35.550> 1<00:00:36.550> 2<00:00:36.940> 3<00:00:37.150> 4<00:00:37.600> 5<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.799> go<00:00:39.070> ahead<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:39.400> dig

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:39.549 
between 1 2 3 4 5 and go ahead and dig

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.329 
between 1 2 3 4 5 and go ahead and dig
out<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.790> middle<00:00:40.059> like<00:00:40.780> so<00:00:40.949> then<00:00:41.949> you<00:00:42.100> place

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
out the middle like so then you place

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.719 
out the middle like so then you place
regular<00:00:42.820> pissants<00:00:43.269> on<00:00:43.510> each<00:00:43.780> side<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.290> the

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
regular pissants on each side of the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.960 
regular pissants on each side of the
power<00:00:45.729> block<00:00:46.330> and<00:00:47.260> you<00:00:47.290> put<00:00:47.710> redstone<00:00:48.190> on<00:00:48.640> one

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
power block and you put redstone on one

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.930 
power block and you put redstone on one
side<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.600> then<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.260> fill<00:00:50.619> in<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.890> blocks<00:00:51.339> in

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
side and then you fill in the blocks in

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.000 
side and then you fill in the blocks in
this<00:00:52.119> case<00:00:52.330> I'm<00:00:52.479> going<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.839> set<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.979> a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
this case I'm going to set it to a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.030 
this case I'm going to set it to a
glowstone<00:00:54.549> then<00:00:55.059> stone<00:00:55.869> and<00:00:56.110> then<00:00:56.739> I'm<00:00:56.860> going

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
glowstone then stone and then I'm going

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.119 
glowstone then stone and then I'm going
to<00:00:57.100> place<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:57.580> second<00:00:58.030> torch<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:59.680> simple

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
to place the second torch very simple

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.179 
to place the second torch very simple
next<00:01:00.909> thing<00:01:01.089> is<00:01:01.119> you<00:01:01.659> do<00:01:01.869> is<00:01:02.110> put<00:01:02.470> two<00:01:02.890> blocks

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:03.189 
next thing is you do is put two blocks

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.120 
next thing is you do is put two blocks
on<00:01:03.430> each<00:01:03.610> side<00:01:03.909> next<00:01:04.720> to<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.110> redstone<00:01:05.860> torch

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
on each side next to the redstone torch

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.499 
on each side next to the redstone torch
only<00:01:07.030> two<00:01:07.210> blocks<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:08.290> want<00:01:08.439> to<00:01:08.530> place<00:01:08.740> a

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
only two blocks and you want to place a

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.419 
only two blocks and you want to place a
upside<00:01:10.509> down<00:01:10.829> piston<00:01:11.829> like<00:01:12.759> so<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:15.189> almost

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
upside down piston like so you're almost

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.340 
upside down piston like so you're almost
there<00:01:15.909> all<00:01:16.179> you<00:01:16.390> have<00:01:16.509> to<00:01:16.630> do<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:17.109> place<00:01:17.320> a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
there all you have to do is to place a

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.950 
there all you have to do is to place a
block<00:01:17.679> on<00:01:17.920> top<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.609> redstone<00:01:19.359> torch<00:01:19.630> on

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
block on top of the redstone torch on

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.520 
block on top of the redstone torch on
both<00:01:20.259> sides<00:01:20.590> like<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:21.729> put<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.689> redstone<00:01:23.020> here

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
both sides like so put a redstone here

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.660 
both sides like so put a redstone here
and<00:01:24.159> here<00:01:24.579> and<00:01:24.729> then<00:01:25.509> you<00:01:25.630> place<00:01:25.929> a<00:01:26.229> repeater

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and here and then you place a repeater

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.169 
and here and then you place a repeater
now<00:01:27.670> next<00:01:28.179> to<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.390> piston<00:01:28.749> and<00:01:28.780> you're<00:01:29.530> done

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
now next to the piston and you're done

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.700 
now next to the piston and you're done
now<00:01:31.179> I'll<00:01:31.299> show<00:01:31.329> you<00:01:31.509> how<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.899> works<00:01:31.929> when<00:01:32.320> you
