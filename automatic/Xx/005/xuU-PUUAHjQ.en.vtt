run Wi-Fi doesn't work so that's that's

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.910 
run Wi-Fi doesn't work so that's that's
a<00:02:49.519> killer<00:02:49.760> right<00:02:50.000> there<00:02:50.060> cuz<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.650> like

a killer right there cuz I really like
this<00:02:52.040> wrong<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.880> Wi-Fi<00:02:53.359> couldn't<00:02:53.750> make

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
this wrong but the Wi-Fi couldn't make

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.309 
this wrong but the Wi-Fi couldn't make
the<00:02:54.019> Wi-Fi<00:02:54.350> work<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:54.890> try<00:02:55.280> try<00:02:55.640> try<00:02:56.060> see<00:02:56.900> when<00:02:57.290> I

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
the Wi-Fi work I try try try see when I

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.599 
the Wi-Fi work I try try try see when I
try<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.650> pop<00:02:58.069> boom<00:02:58.400> but<00:02:59.209> if<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.420> does<00:02:59.600> not<00:02:59.630> work

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
try to pop boom but if it does not work

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.199 
try to pop boom but if it does not work
so<00:03:01.609> that's<00:03:01.970> one<00:03:02.329> bad<00:03:03.260> thing<00:03:03.290> about<00:03:03.620> on<00:03:04.209> ice

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
so that's one bad thing about on ice

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.590 
so that's one bad thing about on ice
wrong<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:06.410> could<00:03:06.709> install<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.670> corner<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
wrong you could install the corner the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.440 
wrong you could install the corner the
corner<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.530> he<00:03:09.680> could<00:03:09.889> do<00:03:10.250> overclock<00:03:10.910> I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
corner and then he could do overclock I

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.440 
corner and then he could do overclock I
did<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.319> but<00:03:12.590> he<00:03:12.709> could<00:03:12.980> do<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.489> believe<00:03:14.389> he

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
did it but he could do it I believe he

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
did it but he could do it I believe he
could<00:03:14.630> go<00:03:14.780> up<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.190> 1/9<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:17.470> basically

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
could go up to like 1/9 and basically

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.319 
could go up to like 1/9 and basically
everything<00:03:18.859> else<00:03:18.980> is<00:03:19.310> same<00:03:19.609> as<00:03:19.850> your<00:03:20.030> stock

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
run this is basically stop ROM and see

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.500

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
feel like there's a better battery life

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.580 
feel like there's a better battery life
so<00:03:37.579> that's<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.510> know<00:03:38.660> that's<00:03:38.900> another<00:03:39.230> plus
