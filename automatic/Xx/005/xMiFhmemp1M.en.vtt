00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
what they should be like so we've got

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
what they should be like so we've got
samples<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> them<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.310> first<00:01:08.580> we'll

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
samples of all of them so first we'll

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000 
samples of all of them so first we'll
start<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> peanut<00:01:09.479> butter<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.830> take

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
one of those now I like this one this is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.039 
one of those now I like this one this is
the<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.240> definitely<00:01:15.450> should<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.840> won
