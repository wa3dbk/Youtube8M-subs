00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.620 
reenergized us the whole villain idea
and<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.700> think<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.910> number<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.209> us<00:03:32.329> were<00:03:32.510> like

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
and I think a number of us were like

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.569 
and I think a number of us were like
well<00:03:33.079> how<00:03:33.200> can<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.440> replace<00:03:33.739> crew<00:03:34.160> what's<00:03:34.459> the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
well how can you replace crew what's the

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.190 
well how can you replace crew what's the
storyline<00:03:35.120> going<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.510> be<00:03:35.660> why<00:03:35.840> would<00:03:36.079> you

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
storyline going to be why would you

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.050 
storyline going to be why would you
replace<00:03:36.530> grill/griddle<00:03:37.190> always<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.790> kind<00:03:38.000> of

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
replace grill/griddle always is kind of

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.280 
replace grill/griddle always is kind of
underestimated<00:03:38.720> in<00:03:38.870> terms<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.230> this

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
underestimated in terms of this

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.680 
underestimated in terms of this
popularity<00:03:39.980> but<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.190> think<00:03:40.370> if<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.519> actually

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
popularity but I think if you actually

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.630 
popularity but I think if you actually
you<00:03:41.690> know<00:03:41.780> pay<00:03:42.019> attention<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.890> Despicable<00:03:43.610> Me

but I also really like Groot but I think
that<00:03:53.989> this<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:55.040> way<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.280> introduce<00:03:55.630> scarlet

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
that this this way to introduce scarlet

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.150 
that this this way to introduce scarlet
overkill<00:03:57.049> and<00:03:57.109> also<00:03:57.500> perhaps<00:03:57.680> it

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
overkill and also perhaps it

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.980 
overkill and also perhaps it
she's<00:03:58.400> not<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:58.940> nice<00:03:59.180> we're<00:03:59.480> his<00:03:59.570> crew<00:03:59.780> deep

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.650 
she's not so nice we're his crew deep
down<00:04:00.200> is<00:04:00.440> very<00:04:00.830> nice<00:04:01.480> differentiates<00:04:02.480> her

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
down is very nice differentiates her

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.870 
down is very nice differentiates her
enough<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.290> warrant<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:04.070> movie<00:04:04.370> revolving

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
enough to warrant this movie revolving

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.630 
enough to warrant this movie revolving
around<00:04:05.030> her<00:04:05.510> also<00:04:06.050> on<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.350> side<00:04:06.650> note<00:04:06.710> how<00:04:07.190> cute

continue to believe you know in morning

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.810 
continue to believe you know in morning
movie<00:04:45.350> news<00:04:45.500> I<00:04:45.620> talked<00:04:45.860> about<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:46.310> thought<00:04:46.640> that

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
movie news I talked about I thought that

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.850 
movie news I talked about I thought that
the<00:04:46.910> design<00:04:47.660> for<00:04:47.870> scarlet<00:04:48.200> overkill<00:04:48.650> is

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
the design for scarlet overkill is

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.440 
the design for scarlet overkill is
really<00:04:49.190> smart<00:04:49.550> because<00:04:49.700> it's<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.210> an

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
really smart because it's a an

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.240 
really smart because it's a an
international<00:04:51.170> design<00:04:51.320> that<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:51.680> think<00:04:51.920> would

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
international design that I think would

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.250 
international design that I think would
be<00:04:52.430> at<00:04:52.520> home<00:04:52.670> in<00:04:52.820> many<00:04:53.000> countries<00:04:53.540> but<00:04:54.140> the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
be at home in many countries but the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.440 
be at home in many countries but the
idea<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.560> villain-con<00:04:54.950> etc<00:04:55.670> this<00:04:56.000> is<00:04:56.060> just<00:04:56.360> a

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
idea of villain-con etc this is just a

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.530 
idea of villain-con etc this is just a
really<00:04:56.660> business<00:04:57.410> savvy<00:04:58.150> company<00:04:59.150> over<00:04:59.480> at
