00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.150
 the full moon was witness enough 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 with having my friends 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.599
 have goal reject me your kisses and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.300
 I lost my heartbeat so much strength that I lost 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.640
 so many new challenges to live today seeing 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.949
 a little backward tribute to feel in 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.560
 the past that I remember so much that I put 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.259
 in the opposite side finish right 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.150
 so many failed me without remorse 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.129
 So many words were taken by the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.290
 wind in me I feel cold in this 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.199
 deep scale while the notes of his 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.780
 piano for remembering I keep throwing 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.940
 notes like bullets dodging their acts and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.070
 after before nobody is to not look towards 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.080
 back but the moon chases me in every 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 song dictated and I write what you do not 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.280
 you say where there is love always remain 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.619
 scars well healthy wounds without 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.930
 laps and now you what do you say of all 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.939
 those who failed you look good by your side 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.699
 who is there after so many years 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:05.939
 so many mistakes that happened my head gives 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.950
 turned by a great desolate heart to 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.799
 how much have you been deceived saying no 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.600
 you loved me and then being there for everything 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.760
 with this I'm satisfied I learned to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.300
 settle for the minimum that for me 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.670
 now 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.020
 It's no small thing if you pay and pointed to the sky 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.720
 I know you 're six boys pointed two 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.060
 although I feel though I feel and I tell you 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.909
 I will fight this great dream 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.470
 one filled every time he sang he shouted 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.130
 it's worth full moon hugs 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 and the kisses are those that condemn me 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.480
 full moon my family first thing the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.420
 others stay outside 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.140
 for a hyena you gave us trains in the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.330
 life what happens 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.100
 If you talk before time, you waste your 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.440
 words tell me how many are those that we 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 You give us before we speak we know that to you 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.640
 You also got it dubbed 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.460
 scratch you so much and take advantage of your go more 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.740
 take advantage of your actions in movement 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.110
 Only the moon spits out the rage that I have 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.060
 inside you keep pulling the rope that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.220
 I drown the time I do not change is you 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.440
 who looks at me differently in each 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.300
 verse that I wrote I was empty since 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.610
 once I got used to the war 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.260
 you winter approaches and 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.080
 approach cold I can not find a place 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.360
 where does this make sense after what 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.910
 we spend everything we live everything 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.820
 that we feel was lost in that Paul in 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.069
 a great void in a great void 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.310
 importing me alone you alone 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.969
 one full every time he sang he shouted that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.950
 it's worth it 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:45.599
 your hugs and their prisoners are what I 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.459
 they condemn my family first what 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:53.700
 others it stays outside a trains in the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.250
 life passing life changes 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.159
 moments I am barakaldo, never give him the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.280
 back to your front of home singing 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.750
 from an added my neighborhood felt the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.840
 friendship 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.880
 I come back stronger than ever with edr 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.470
 macÃ­as in the production by jealousy 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.400
 until 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.400
 its elevation 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.690
