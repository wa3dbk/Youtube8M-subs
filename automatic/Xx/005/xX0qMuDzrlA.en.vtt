00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
is a wood core vertical sidewall ski

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
is a wood core vertical sidewall ski
that<00:00:28.439> really<00:00:28.680> lends<00:00:28.949> itself<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.519> great

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
that really lends itself a great

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.979 
that really lends itself a great
durability<00:00:30.800> needed<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.969> park<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.719> well

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
durability needed for the park as well

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.200 
durability needed for the park as well
as<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.890> great<00:00:35.280> edge<00:00:35.550> hold<00:00:35.579> for

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
as just get that great edge hold for

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
as just get that great edge hold for
jumps<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.500> pipe<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
jumps and for the pipe this is kind of a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.470 
jumps and for the pipe this is kind of a
newer<00:00:41.730> design<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.660> Park<00:00:43.500> Ski<00:00:43.890> technology<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
newer design in Park Ski technology a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.529 
newer design in Park Ski technology a
little<00:00:45.989> bit<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> wider<00:00:46.980> platform<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
little bit more of a wider platform and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.350 
little bit more of a wider platform and
90<00:00:48.989> millimeters<00:00:49.559> underfoot<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:51.120> little

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
90 millimeters underfoot and a little

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.439 
90 millimeters underfoot and a little
bit<00:00:51.449> more<00:00:51.920> shape<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.309> side<00:00:53.579> cut<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.149> you'd

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
bit more shape or side cut then you'd

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.410 
bit more shape or side cut then you'd
probably<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.899> used<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.190> park<00:00:56.789> ski<00:00:57.149> but

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
probably be used to in a park ski but

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
probably be used to in a park ski but
what<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> does<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.530> lends<00:00:58.829> itself<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
what it does it really lends itself to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.389 
what it does it really lends itself to
great<00:00:59.730> all-mountain<00:01:00.469> performance<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.710> well

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
great all-mountain performance as well

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.119 
great all-mountain performance as well
as<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:03.420> give<00:01:03.629> me<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> wider<00:01:04.229> platform<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
as just give me that wider platform that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.570 
as just give me that wider platform that
a<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> people<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> park
