00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.930
 most feared on the planet its way of 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.600
 feed on the blood of the living 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.380
 has run like his stories of 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.750
 generation in generation since centuries 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.630
 ancestral fame that today however 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.849
 returns to be news after this 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.499
 discovery 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.720
 bulgaria amazed the world by showing its 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.579
 most recent archaeological find is 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.349
 it's about the skeleton of a vampire that 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.149
 It was found in a medieval tomb 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.269
 shores of the Black Sea with a piece of 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.920
 Iron of a plow stuck in the heart 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.290
 according to some historians of the age 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.630
 half a person became the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.050
 vampire after having suffered a 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.810
 violent death a satanic ritual one 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.020
 curse for sacrilegious act or as in 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.320
 most cases from the bite of 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.320
 a vampire 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.949
 however another study done by the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.440
 matteo borrini scientist of the 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.600
 University of Florence in Italy 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.560
 it just ensures that the vampires were not 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.810
 supernatural characters but rather 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.530
 mentally ill people obsessed with 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.530
 human blood 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.460
 these remains found in italy guarantee 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.530
 the study of vorín and according to him it treats 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.270
 of a vampire woman buried in the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.920
 16th century and has a brick in its mouth 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.610
 and is that according to the authorities of the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.430
 time many vampires bow their death 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.920
 and they were buried in common graves together 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.830
 with people who died because of the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.820
 black plague according to the writings of the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.920
 time 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.260
 once the vampires are buried 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.590
 they woke up and they fed on the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.680
 blood and other organs of the dead in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.440
 full mass grave is why the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.220
 vampires broke their jaws with 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.830
 crickets like this one would prevent that 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.650
 these are fed with blood and organs 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.979
 infected and that spread the disease 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.770
 when they came out of those graves 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.310
 community 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.310
 now 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.430
 ancient about real vampires is that of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.640
 Elizabeth Bathory also called the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.530
 bloody countess picked up the blood and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.840
 I poured it into a spacious bathtub 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.640
 dimensions that Elizabeth used in 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.150
 all the occasions according to their 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.550
 historians back in the year 1600 the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.730
 Countess Báthory was accused and condemned 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.290
 for having killed and because of the blood 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 of 630 people in hungary its goal 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.340
 was to stay young drinking blood 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.000
 human the bloody countess passed away to 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.170
 the 54 years in a dungeon far from the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.640
 sunlight and blood 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.640
 love and I want to be the best 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.190
 closest to our days we find 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.319
 to richard code in 1980 the world 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.459
 he finally saw the face of cottingham 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.930
 known as the vampire of the torso 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.560
 accused of killing more than 100 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.760
 people cut them into pieces and drink 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.829
 the blood of his cottingham victims was 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.829
 sentenced to life in prison 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.000
 other real-life vampires are peter 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.510
 court john who murdered nine 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.290
 people, mostly girls, to whom 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.410
 he slashed he drank his blood and burned his 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.110
 bodies but I am the same satan 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.959
 but it's something that I do not care that the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.130
 last on the list is roderick casting 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:57.010

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.920
 clan of the vampires of kentucky a 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.920
 character that drank the blood of 19 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.060
 people including your parents' 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.350
 girlfriend 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.050
 jeter wenders 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.890
 hit him on the head and follow him 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.650
 hitting until he died today the 32's 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.320
 years is being held for life in a 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.940
 jail account here 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.400
 obviously I have some kind of 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.400
 disease normal people do not do what 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.620
 that I held title these are just 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.130
 some marked the stories of the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.350
 real life stories that contrast with 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.500
 the fiction to which they have been brought 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.110
 the vampires in the cinema embodied such 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.350
 once in twilight as its maximum 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:46.550
 contemporary exponent for those days 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.730
 is on billboard dawn 2 with robert 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.460
 pattinson and kristen stewart 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.460
 accompanied by the lid or a ribbon 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.640
 based on the successful twilight saga of 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.310
 the writer stephanie meyer and that in 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.240
 this opportunity presents the beautiful and 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.630
 misadventures of Pela Edward and the little 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.630
 daughter 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.200
 yes 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.680
 and it 's in the vampire story to 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.080
 through time a stained narration 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.409
 of blood and that apparently stops 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.780
 side that old legend referred to 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.569
 his immortality and whose main 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.550
 promoter would have been nothing less than bram 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.879
 stoker and is that recent studies 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.400
 they assure that these nocturnal characters 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:43.009
 that is, the vampires were people 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.310
 ordinary but with 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.919
 unfortunate mental disorders one of 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.979
 them their obsession with prolonging their 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.490
 youth at the expense of the blood of 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.490
 neighbor
