00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 hi guys are rare and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.970
 this new review 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.100
 yes yes today we have a 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.140
 there is a son of one of my superheroes 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.210
 marvel favorite or amazing 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.610
 spider man 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.650
 produced by the diamond select is part 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.820
 obviously from the marvel collection 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.650
 select 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.170
 ok on the background of this 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.910
 character there is not much to say why 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.960
 I think everyone knows him 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.540
 it's peter parker a young man 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.180
 student being bitten by a spider 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.649
 radioactive is in fact acquires i 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:52.340
 powers of the spider that is super strength super 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.530
 agility and the ability to climb 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.050
 on the walls and does not even acquire the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.050
 power to throw webs this is 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.719
 an invention of the film of raimi ma 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.420
 invents mechanical devices that 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.180
 precisely they launch this fluid not 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.550
 organic that behaves practically 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.320
 with a spider web the fluid in the true 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.020
 history invents him because he is 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.430
 a clever venture 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.619
 oh well but let's not waste any more time 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.070
 let's see our in detail 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.540
 movie action started from the head like 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.509
 you see it has a rather elongated shape 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.909
 we also look in profile to the eyes 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.250
 I like this extremely large 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.100
 because I have always appreciated the eyes 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.330
 big on spider man 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.060
 look it's not a lens error but 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.030
 here it is really a little higher and here it goes 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.640
 instead to go down the shape of the head 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.130
 in short, this deformity if it could 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.320
 perhaps a little save sees the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.549
 detail of the cobwebs is done 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.270
 quite well it's not just printed but is 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.500
 just carved I find it hard to say 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.090
 to which spider man is inspired by the various 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.729
 marvel designers 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.769
 if you have any ideas write sail 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.750
 here in the comments 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.870
 let's see the rest then 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.230
 let's see the bust a little, we see that the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.730
 spider man symbol in release 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.130
 we see that there is this dirt in the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.410
 painting which is not an error but is done 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.900
 deliberately and I must say that it is not bad 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.310
 I think the musculature of the is resolved 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.620
 character 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.810
 we also see very bright colors 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.720
 which I like 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.900
 back there is the most classic symbol 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.020
 very nice red spider perhaps a 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.020
 a little too big, but it's still there 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.670
 we go down on the legs 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.130
 nothing to say painting well 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.739
 realized the colors are as bright as 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.370
 I said the details are enough 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.440
 good we also see the arms here 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.950
 let's see the joints in the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.319
 head there is a ball joint 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.950
 only that the head practically succeeds 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.080
 perhaps only to the right and left does it succeed 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.450
 just stay low while up is 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.600
 practically blocked then we see the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.080
 classic articulation arms 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.700
 at the opening the detail at the elbow 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.440
 there is also rotation at the elbow 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.799
 we see the forearm in detail here 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.870
 where is the hand that is throwing the 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.850
 spider web you see there is this part 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.850
 raised that should be precisely the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.500
 throws webs and then the hand with the 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.730
 classic shape 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:48.049
 the thing that does not suit me is that the hand 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.670
 they can practically rotate 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.370
 wanted it to move too 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.019
 down because this position is not me 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.010
 it seems very likely we notice that here 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.220
 there is no 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.750
 there is no raised part so yes 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.989
 they forgot to make the magnet launcher 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.660
 no oh well they are small details 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:12.290
 this is not a small detail 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:18.459
 look under the arm if it is 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:21.680
 leaving the paint and also here 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.440
 this is a point that goes against it 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.150
 and it's something I don't like 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.840
 we resume with the joints we have 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.400
 the articulation to life we ​​go to 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.270
 legs move 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:39.080
 on a sphere they go further than that 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.630
 back and forth they succeed in April 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.960
 but not so much we have the 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.949
 knee rotation is the joint 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.330
 classic is the foot goes up down but not 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.090
 turn nothing 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.430
 the position in the figure is enough 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.280
 so it's dynamic but it's always there 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.090
 the fact that it is not very positionable 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.830
 given the few articulations and this 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.770
 an action figures from spider man e 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.470
 suffers because in my opinion spiderman must 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.660
 to be positionable in most ways 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.570
 disparate and here we are enough 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.430
 limited at the beginning of the review 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.470
 before the sila 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.860
 maybe you noticed that there was a base 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:25.639
 yes it was not a mirage but it was one 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.120
 car practically crushed by a 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:33.470
 something here I must say that it is well 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:39.470
 made the painting and excellent the glass 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:43.639
 broken the dirt there is nothing to say 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.680
 crushed wheels is a machine 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.130
 practically crumpled by the non yes 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.800
 know what from below and empty is not a base 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:55.820
 my problem is what the hell does it do 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.430
 this base with an action figures pipe e 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.340
 I would like to know what the link between spiders is 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.690
 man is a crumpled machine 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.750
 according to them it is he should stay that way 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.610
 above this machine it is not known why it is 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.909
 was he the author delights in 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.490
 smashing cars apart from that 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:18.979
 is the base is huge goes well this is one 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.979
 matter of available space does not 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.740
 It worries a lot of space but there is 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.159
 which is a beautiful base but I can't find it 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.180
 the only thing with spiderman 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:35.870
 what comes to mind is to take 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.030
 spider man is practically lying down 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.599
 over as if it had been slammed over 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.970
 by some the billing so it works 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.070
 I would say for today 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:48.949
 does not seem a nice way to expose a 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:52.220
 spiderman one action figures 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:53.750
 spiderman pounded lying on one 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.229
 machine 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.210
 let me know what you think about it and with 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.460
 what action figures you would have seen 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.960
 better this base 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.470
 they solved here with the accessories 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.000
 there was nothing left of the action children 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.520
 since in fact there was not one 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.460
 spider web I had to work around creating it 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.940
 one with the iron sons they held 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.190
 the action figures from the box to the 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.169
 end the effect is not even bad at least 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.120
 an extra accessory 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:24.470
 well guys our review is 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.490
 come to an end 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:31.639
 if you want leave a comment below 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:33.979
 hello give it is from spiderman who wishes you 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.050
 much love or is warning you of 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:39.229
 something else 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.539
 there is this dirt that is not a mistake of 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:45.349
 painting never done on purpose that is not 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:48.009
 bad for me is made for christ for 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:48.009
 Christ
