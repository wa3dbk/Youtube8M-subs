00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.589
 the head 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.039
 this is the example 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.390
 m portrait 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.460
 by their fault 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.659
 so assassin's creed revelations and anecdotes 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.089
 this is the next big blockbusters of ubi soft for this winter as at 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.719
 every year we will be entitled to new scenes saida attention is 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:33.769
 not believe it is what in the extension of the two hour drive we 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:36.150
 So go find the waters in a new adventure 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.890
 so side by side I did what I could see today it was 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.740
 relatively common rock it was a ten-minute sequence of gameplay 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.230
 mainly about the solo to predict the idiots mode deÃ»le 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.090
 georgetown and I want to say he took a few years 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.980
 we have been super active it is super nice kid scrum then not even more 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.839
 strong for them not the weight of ages 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.780
 new combat capabilities 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.060
 haha I could see new moves 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.380
 he can also now treat for me to make himself his own 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.280
 bombs 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.930
 and aaa and with age but also sharpened its 105 for example I was able to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.810
 see fight and throw a bomb 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.420
 e smoke 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.740
 and then use his sixth sense of his equal to aix can for 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.520
 call his friends in the smoke and murder them 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.380
 so it is of course the gameplay we know the best to 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 some little news and there and of course especially especially even I want 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.300
 to say that this pleasure of discovery 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.750
 because while strolling in a city of constantinople 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.100
 absolutely stunning 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.140
 with a reenactment work yeah great and that's same today 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.650
 even though the engine is unknown assane seck had reached a very very 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.280
 beautiful and very visually impressive 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.030
 so now for this sequel we still have the impression in 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.010
 of the classic 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.460
 and there is something that made me a little bit scared 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.650
 these questions is very very very loud lurking why 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.060
 of course it's the hero but links it's done every year 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.940
 she remembers 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.310
 sometimes we are surrounded by a cluster of enemies 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.720
 and that we could easily get rid of the action with new 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.650
 capacity 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.570
 at laval I hope the fights are interesting that the developers are going 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.120
 to be able to gauge 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.640
 a little bit of that so that it stays 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.589
 to adjamed johnny oduya pleases me 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.469
 but now for all fans of God it's still normal to see 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.790
 more and more likely to discover new capabilities 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.989
 and that's also why it's necessary 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.929
 we shoot we get this suite 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.929
 to 1 to discover what the character shortly 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.379
 not the rule
