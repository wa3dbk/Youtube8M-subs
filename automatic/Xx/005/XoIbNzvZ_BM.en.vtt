00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.670 

now<00:00:00.240> I<00:00:00.269> think<00:00:00.390> most<00:00:00.659> of<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.900> time<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.560> don't

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
now I think most of the time you don't

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.860 
now I think most of the time you don't
look<00:00:01.860> at<00:00:02.010> this<00:00:02.129> as<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> job<00:00:02.820> it's<00:00:03.480> your<00:00:03.659> passion

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
look at this as a job it's your passion

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.470 
look at this as a job it's your passion
not<00:00:04.589> many<00:00:04.740> people<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:05.160> say<00:00:05.220> that<00:00:05.430> they<00:00:06.420> were

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
not many people can say that they were

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.059 
not many people can say that they were
sort<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.020> doing<00:00:07.080> their<00:00:07.470> job<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.859> now<00:00:07.919> it's

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
sort of doing their job and now it's

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.340 
sort of doing their job and now it's
true<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> guess

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.530 

from<00:00:15.620> this<00:00:15.769> environment<00:00:16.280> I<00:00:16.369> wake<00:00:16.670> up<00:00:16.850> if<00:00:17.180> I

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
from this environment I wake up if I

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.000 
from this environment I wake up if I
know<00:00:17.600> I've<00:00:17.810> got<00:00:18.050> a<00:00:18.080> really<00:00:18.380> important<00:00:18.860> show

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
know I've got a really important show

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.620 
know I've got a really important show
that<00:00:19.220> night<00:00:19.400> it's<00:00:19.700> one<00:00:20.119> of<00:00:20.210> the<00:00:20.270> first<00:00:20.450> things

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
that night it's one of the first things

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.359 
that night it's one of the first things
I<00:00:20.750> think<00:00:20.810> about<00:00:21.140> I<00:00:21.350> want<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.830> put<00:00:21.950> myself<00:00:22.070> in

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
I think about I want to put myself in

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.600 
I think about I want to put myself in
the<00:00:22.460> right<00:00:22.610> mental<00:00:23.000> state<00:00:24.009> when<00:00:25.009> we're<00:00:25.340> inside

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
the right mental state when we're inside

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.700 
the right mental state when we're inside
the<00:00:25.730> Opera<00:00:25.939> House<00:00:26.090> it<00:00:26.840> sort<00:00:27.110> of<00:00:27.140> turns<00:00:27.380> into<00:00:27.590> a

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
the Opera House it sort of turns into a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.479 
the Opera House it sort of turns into a
second<00:00:28.430> home<00:00:28.640> I<00:00:29.500> moved<00:00:30.500> away<00:00:30.680> from<00:00:30.830> my<00:00:31.279> parents

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
second home I moved away from my parents

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.690 
second home I moved away from my parents
when<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:32.060> was<00:00:32.090> 14<00:00:33.079> it<00:00:33.680> was<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.310> hardest<00:00:34.579> thing

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
when I was 14 it was the hardest thing

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.850 
when I was 14 it was the hardest thing
I've<00:00:35.180> ever<00:00:35.239> had<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.660> do<00:00:35.780> I<00:00:35.989> was<00:00:36.380> very<00:00:36.680> lucky

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
I've ever had to do I was very lucky

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.819 
I've ever had to do I was very lucky
that<00:00:37.040> they<00:00:37.250> let<00:00:37.399> me<00:00:37.520> go<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.880> I<00:00:38.360> all<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.200> this<00:00:39.380> to

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
that they let me go and I all of this to

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.240 
that they let me go and I all of this to
them<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:43.480> think<00:00:44.480> class<00:00:44.780> will<00:00:45.530> probably<00:00:46.010> be<00:00:46.100> my

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
them I think class will probably be my

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.070 
them I think class will probably be my
favorite<00:00:46.550> part<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.880> day<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.570> outcome<00:00:47.960> of

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
favorite part of the day the outcome of

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.200 
favorite part of the day the outcome of
class<00:00:48.350> can<00:00:49.040> sort<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.370> determine<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.030> day

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
class can sort of determine the day

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.750 
class can sort of determine the day
sometimes<00:00:50.720> sort<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.530> reassembles<00:00:52.370> everything

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
sometimes sort of reassembles everything

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:10.130 
sometimes sort of reassembles everything
and<00:00:52.880> you<00:00:52.940> just<00:00:52.970> feel<00:00:53.480> more<00:00:54.200> like<00:00:54.380> yourself

your Center in any day you can go from
two<00:01:36.130> extremes<00:01:36.640> one<00:01:37.030> being<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.930> pure

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
two extremes one being the pure

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.950 
two extremes one being the pure
classical<00:01:38.740> sweet<00:01:39.550> on<00:01:39.700> blonde<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.150> then<00:01:40.450> go

classical sweet on blonde and then go

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.430 
classical sweet on blonde and then go
into<00:01:41.200> something<00:01:41.560> like<00:01:41.650> sexton's<00:01:42.160> very<00:01:42.670> sharp

really drive on I find sewing is quite
therapeutic<00:02:18.879> I'd<00:02:19.450> probably<00:02:19.690> just<00:02:19.930> like<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.230> go

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
therapeutic I'd probably just like to go

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.680 
therapeutic I'd probably just like to go
find<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.769> quiet<00:02:21.400> corner<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.180> sew<00:02:22.660> a

find like a quiet corner and just sew a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.800 
find like a quiet corner and just sew a
few<00:02:22.870> pairs<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.260> pointers<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:25.000> hard<00:02:25.360> it's

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
few pairs of pointers it's hard it's

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.220 
few pairs of pointers it's hard it's
hard<00:02:25.900> not<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.410> get<00:02:26.530> too<00:02:26.709> nervous<00:02:28.049> it's<00:02:29.049> almost

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
hard not to get too nervous it's almost

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.750 
hard not to get too nervous it's almost
like<00:02:29.379> a<00:02:29.410> new<00:02:29.650> day<00:02:29.860> when<00:02:30.129> you<00:02:30.250> come<00:02:30.400> back<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:30.700> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
like a new day when you come back in a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.850 
like a new day when you come back in a
do<00:02:31.299> bar<00:02:31.510> again<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.319> not<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:32.709> much<00:02:32.799> about

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
do bar again it's not so much about

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.380 
do bar again it's not so much about
improving<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.519> technique<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:34.120> it's<00:02:34.239> more

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
improving a technique but it's more
