 margarita sent that me ana lourdes lÃ³pez 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.320
 we have the agency of children in action and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.860
 we decided to get together with our 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.070
 work 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.110
 we both work with children for 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.439
 many years and we decided to do this 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.020
 training school and agency too 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.899
 of children actors and young children in 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.930
 action is a school is a company of 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:33.110
 theater is an agency where we do 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.200
 castings we coach we give workshops 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.030
 for movies we advise and take care 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.720
 especially working conditions 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.720
 for children 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.680
 good 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.110
 the difference of children in action with 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.000
 other schools is to input there is a 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.700
 acting methodology that we are 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.610
 adapting the children and the results 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.840
 that you are seeing are very different to 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.190
 other schools because there really is not 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.560
 methods of action focused on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.900
 We have been researching for many years 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.260
 different methods of action that 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.020
 can be applied to children's education 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.420
 and youth and we had the opportunity to 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.680
 Accept us in stella adler's technique 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.640
 because it really is the technique and the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.660
 ideal method for children's education 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.830
 and well we have been applying it for three years 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:36.460
 with some truly results 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.710
 impressive this raises that the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.280
 growth as a human being goes from the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.799
 hand with growth as actors 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 all these philosophies that grow 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.950
 as an actor is synonymous with growing as 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.290
 human being is very important to me 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.900
 because that topic is usually not treated 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.990
 in schools more like nothing else they give you 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.909
 technical otan classes and that part does not lead 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.780
 It's very nice to me 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.500
 hand in hand the technique of this leader 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.929
 What it seeks is to provide the child 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.660
 a work tool with which 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.480
 the child becomes a collaborator and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.080
 becomes totally independent and so 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.570
 can come forward and build their 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.209
 characters build their scene without 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.700
 need for nobody to tell you how 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.069
 you have to show your emotion is that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.110
 when they are in other schools already as 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.810
 who was advancing and then when I 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.940
 they got into this as I was able to overcome 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.510
 It was transformed a lot when I'm there 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.689
 on stage I liked it 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.200
 and get over emiliano is an actor from the 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.200
 4 years 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.490
 however it really developed 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.490
 until until he came to this school 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.800
 we try to bring students to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.640
 texts so that they can apply in 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.120
 a text what they are learning and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.890
 we ended up mounting a work 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.330
 interpreted by themselves and we search 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.930
 that the children receive from their own 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.870
 children's voice their stories because they do not 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.750
 there are children's plays with characters 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.630
 when the season of the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.280
 play the gaze of the child 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.780
 connected much more with the character 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.960
 that if an adult had interpreted it 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.590
 he is very father because he had not had 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.830
 with enough experience in the theater and 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.260
 because the teachers follow us very well 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.770
 because there were things that I did not understand before 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.400
 why every detail then I 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.720
 They were absurd and now I understand why 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.240
 is the theater the truth is that I'm 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.380
 enchanted gives them discipline gives them them 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.819
 strengthens memory this link that is 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.569
 basic that is wonderful 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.599
 and gives them security gives them a lot 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.189
 body language I do not know what I can 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.049
 say I know frankly in the theater 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.150
 I think the theater is wonderful 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.320
 and this workshop has been amazing the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.320
 truly incredible 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.880
 children in action is an agency 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.270
 dedicate to do castings on children and 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.820
 young people is very important to have in 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.590
 account the physical characteristics of 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.470
 character and also the characteristics 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.050
 emotional character as we are 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.070
 teachers is much simpler much more 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.470
 quick to find the directors or 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.980
 film and television theater producers 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.200
 also an actor that works them just 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.900
 for your emotional needs 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.780
 as physical children studying with 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.490
 we leave prepared for the world 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.640
 professional and they end up doing 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.820
 commercial theater movies 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.310
 TV shows for this 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.960
 technique I have learned how I stay in 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.450
 a movie and I've learned better 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.890
 feel and see every emotion and know by 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.260
 what do you say each text from the beginning 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.240
 is to think think because from a 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.780
 beginning until later because you say that 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.210
 text now it's easier if they ask me for 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.720
 a paper is easier to act I have it 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.780
 better be 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.780
 better as stability of a paper 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.820
 within the agency of children in action 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.030
 we also do a count and also 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.720
 we make baby baby kita service and 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.090
 this service what helps is for 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.290
 take care of the children inside the set inside 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.850
 of the filming we are looking for an area of 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:57.360
 stay where they can have their 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.520
 games and while they are learning the 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.420
 dialogues are learning the texts but 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.810
 at his pace without forcing anything and is 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.630
 much more natural much more careful and 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.020
 they are happy there is vigilance in the 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.940
 entrance not children do not leave them 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.980
 approach the door unless 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.290
 come the dads for them I think 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.890
 which is a very safe place is 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.520
 very safe a place is one of the most 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.520
 safe city 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:33.509
 the most important of the proposal of 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.370
 this project is that we see how the 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.620
 children with this training in addition to 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.870
 open up and they are children who enjoy it 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.120
 very much we have very full children very 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.880
 happy we have the great commitment of 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.210
 give them a professional education with 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.949
 very serious tools 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.470
 First of all, I have many, many 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:58.650
 contacts for theater and cinema 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.310
 and to meet other actors and know 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.530
 as personalities 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.770
 and because it helps you as to bring confidence 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:10.070
 to you or they help you as it is how it is that 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.930
 it's like a family if then as a 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.870
 family and one that had the problem of 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.470
 him and I'm afraid to ask him if 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:22.630
 I did well or that they judge me later as 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:26.100
 yes friends then more wanted 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:30.120
 being able to act for me is 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:33.500
 it's something beautiful and for me every time 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.500
 act the happiness 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.680
 and embrace that happiness and I do not want 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.680
 let it go
