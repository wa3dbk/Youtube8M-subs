for<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> front<00:00:55.170> face<00:00:55.670> in<00:00:57.020> relation<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
for the front face in relation to the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.220 
for the front face in relation to the
profile<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.910> example<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.539> go<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:00.960> in

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
profile for example if we go right in

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.980 
profile for example if we go right in
the<00:01:01.379> middle<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.750> oval<00:01:04.170> again<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> then

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the middle of this oval again and then

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.160 
the middle of this oval again and then
we<00:01:07.110> split<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.530> again<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.600> where<00:01:10.140> we

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
we split that again this is where we

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
we split that again this is where we
will<00:01:10.409> place<00:01:10.650> our<00:01:10.860> ear<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> side<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
will place our ear on the side of the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
will place our ear on the side of the
head<00:01:14.090> okay<00:01:15.350> well<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.979> forehead<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.030> can

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
head okay well now the forehead we can

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.399 
head okay well now the forehead we can
soften<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.869> once<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.500> our<00:01:19.680> ovals<00:01:20.040> drawn

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
soften this once we get our ovals drawn

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.130 
soften this once we get our ovals drawn
okay<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> nose<00:01:23.009> we'll<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> bridge

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
okay in the nose we'll have the bridge

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.410 
okay in the nose we'll have the bridge
and<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.890> nose<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.580> extends<00:01:27.240> out

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and the nose actually extends out

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.880 
and the nose actually extends out
because<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.140> piece<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.470> cartilage

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
because you have that piece of cartilage

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.179 
because you have that piece of cartilage
there<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.689> nashville's<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.770> okay

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.010 
it actually is kind of sunken back a
little<00:01:40.920> bit<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> put<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> lips

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
little bit and then you put the lips

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.200 
little bit and then you put the lips

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.940 

and<00:01:49.210> then<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.750> bottom<00:01:50.110> lip<00:01:50.320> even<00:01:50.680> though<00:01:50.800> it's

larger<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.700> sinks<00:01:52.210> back<00:01:52.420> as<00:01:52.660> well<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.710> then<00:01:54.100> we

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
larger it sinks back as well and then we

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.840 
larger it sinks back as well and then we
come<00:01:54.400> down<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.880> chin<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:56.340> then<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.580> stick

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
come down to the chin and then the stick

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.300 
come down to the chin and then the stick
stands<00:01:58.270> out<00:01:59.160> and<00:02:00.160> once<00:02:00.430> we<00:02:00.580> soften<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
stands out and once we soften this this

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.940 
stands out and once we soften this this
we<00:02:03.880> can<00:02:04.060> soften<00:02:04.300> this<00:02:04.630> oval<00:02:05.110> as<00:02:05.290> well<00:02:05.530> we<00:02:05.800> don't

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
we can soften this oval as well we don't

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.770 
we can soften this oval as well we don't
have<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.250> make<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:06.790> exaggerate<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.880> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
have to make it so exaggerate it and the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.220 
have to make it so exaggerate it and the
eye<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:10.990> actually<00:02:11.620> set<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.070> here<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.230> once

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
eye is actually set in here so once

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.050 
eye is actually set in here so once
again<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.530> high<00:02:14.650> brow<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.310> there<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:18.060> yeah

again the high brow is there and yeah

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.850 
again the high brow is there and yeah
you<00:02:19.510> have<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.750> imagine<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.230> eyeball<00:02:20.590> being

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
you have to imagine the eyeball being

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.180 
you have to imagine the eyeball being
set<00:02:21.160> in<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:23.380> have<00:02:23.560> eyelids<00:02:23.950> that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
set in here but we have eyelids that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.520 
set in here but we have eyelids that
cover<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:25.060> make<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.240> not<00:02:25.510> look<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:25.900> scary
