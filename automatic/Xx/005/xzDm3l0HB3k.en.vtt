00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello dear friends we are today 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.980
 let's talk in the next knives to a friend 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.410
 provided for review Novosibirsk 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.120
 the shop for the inhabitants of the feet will be the knife from 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.230
 companies kirsha called he 1082 and are 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.150
 on field knife immediately want to talk on 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 for some reason on the company website kirsch 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.859
 I couldn't find this knife right now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.439
 so its performance characteristics I present in the frame 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.730
 there will be absolutely none likely 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.340
 look then leave a link 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 clamping action leather sheath 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.809
 Traditionally for the company, caches are pretty 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 qualitatively quite simply made 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.550
 you can see the whole thing very much 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.410
 simple loop but actually for this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.969
 knife more likely and not required 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.370
 You can only wear it like this 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.920
 the belt is very small therefore interfere 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.340
 on the belt will not be respect let's weight 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 with sheath the knife weighs only 113 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:05.339
 gram that's the knife itself about eighty 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.409
 one gram at least for me 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.090
 scales show let's a little bit 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.650
 more look at it very much 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.270
 curious little skinner 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.270
 rarely do I have such knives on the channel 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.290
 orange g10 all so it is for 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.030
 the fields are made that in their case of which the knife is not 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.619
 Lost here so very shirsh it so 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.020
 something done before probably 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.159
 a small knife is perhaps a plus 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.170
 see that the steel of the knife sticks out noticeably behind 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.729
 lining is now so fashionable 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.220
 trend at least cash company 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.110
 regular enjoy their futon fixes 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.700
 The design pressed such a dark 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.920
 the hole is quite normal for me 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.710
 there will be a paracord such a blade 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.229
 I think about three half- four 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.119
 millimeters thickness basically 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.770
 strong enough tip it is clear that 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.270
 maybe hard work not conceived but 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.220
 nevertheless it would be wrong to break it 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.119
 just downhill 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.710
 slightly under the concave from about but here 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.570
 I do not know how to say here it turns out not 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.080
 in general from the butt go started us knife 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.510
 here probably from the first third of about 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.430
 so here they are made kirsha knife made 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 your states of america model 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.550
 corporation which is generally very 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.670
 made an interesting impression on me 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.200
 this knife 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.660
 skinny rock is so small for cutting 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.640
 small game seem even alleged 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.120
 she probably will be a little bit after all 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.860
 small wedge because here but i 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 I think that the order of centimeters seeds 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.390
 vernik or maxim the length of the blade that is 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.610
 small created from stock shock about 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.840
 very convenient here is such a grip is very 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.220
 comfortable kitchen grip is very cool 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.080
 sharpened cuts in that with him on 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.030
 mixing such a last is enough 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.470
 thin really liked it like that 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.019
 works for some so small 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.760
 kitchen tasks even honestly potatoes 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.190
 tried to clean very interesting 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.900
 nice knife in fact he could have 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.150
 principle used as a kitchen knife 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.130
 for some small job but if 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.239
 whatever it is for it 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.350
 specialized some kind of knife under 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.810
 hand that's understandable that he is so 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.680
 easy it is much lighter even to many 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.250
 folding knives 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.109
 that's what if you feel comfortable about 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.900
 relation pressed in such a case there somewhere 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.060
 on the belt, in principle, I think that even 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.970
 for urban use that knife 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.819
 may well be someone in demand 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.100
 because in principle he is so very 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.140
 nice interesting bodies to if you 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.400
 adjust its carrier enough 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.040
 convenient to extract when you need it 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.530
 it is necessary in principle but for me personally 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.819
 it seems that in the city it can also be 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.220
 use the only thing here is how 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.769
 at least at the beginning here is the knife 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.400
 new yes and not from this case it is so 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.900
 It's pretty tight here, but I think that 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.250
 over time , somehow the issue is solved 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.890
 because it stretches or my husband 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.300
 case everything falls into place but by 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.650
 pervokatu sensation can be here 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.420
 liked maybe pretty though for 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.070
 me personally mostly useless 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.890
 with the original knives I mainly use but 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.230
 nevertheless it seems to me that he is well 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.940
 pretty pleasantly interesting as it were in 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.640
 different classes let such a rustic 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.230
 but still good just such a second 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.190
 extra knife in the box when here 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.910
 necessary not some small 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.410
 a knife for some small works 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.060
 I hope that you were interesting big 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.060
 thanks for watching bye
