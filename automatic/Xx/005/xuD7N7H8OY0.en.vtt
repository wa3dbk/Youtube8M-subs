00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 you scare me what you took me 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.200
 in a slightly dark place just 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.910
 after asking me if I had any 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.319
 relationships and who woke up without 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.630
 it was a little bit trying 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.759
 of me sin you believe yeah I find a 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.299
 weird, I'm often told that 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.299
 first time 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.810
 yes I see it's beautiful and it's 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.789
 bucolic who do not know at home 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.070
 no no no it's not my home that I 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.020
 my home is true how much is it 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.110
 of square meters at home in this moment 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.640
 yes 45 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.960
 I'm going to move there I'm going into more 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.260
 big now ah yeah bah yes that 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.489
 works better and so what 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.019
 would have had 100 to eat what I 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.519
 always looking for a home the year on 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.540
 paris had so I have bigger but 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:53.390
 but I have to share 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.430
 I saw a stamp on fairness put this 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.820
 man goes too far and so my question 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.260
 is where are you gonna not know what are we going 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.309
 understand to start there because 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.600
 that you 're going to cut what happened 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.659
 before putting it back 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.630
 I cut I saw in the press release 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:16.479
 press gives a kind of stamp in 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.479
 which is emitted but where are you 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.850
 this man I recommend to his views and 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.830
 why do not hang around waiting for 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.800
 score but where are you going but why I 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.000
 do not know but where is he going or is he 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.130
 I'm going too far it's marked 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.960
 on the card is what you have to be 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.760
 dunce at school to become a good 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.950
 comedian like that it's primordial a 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.979
 stage or air turin beautiful it's like in 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.659
 2007 7.3 in 2007 but actually I had 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.250
 already did the one before I did 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.170
 already wan in paris since 2000 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.640
 2 it will be since then that I have the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.720
 long hair to play the rimbaud 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.390
 that's good before the general public and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.360
 the just know you via laurent 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.300
 ruquier but it was still a 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 obligatory passage or it could have 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 still work without it 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.259
 that you think 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.080
 I think this show was 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.250
 perfect for me because I am refused 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.580
 many media access because 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.600
 I needed 100% freedom of expression 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.240
 it's very hard to find programs 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.610
 it was left untouched found and the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.739
 scoring side and the school side of 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.000
 this issue give the opportunity to 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.840
 let a guy tell everything they 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.520
 wanted because there was the jury 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.890
 who was there to defuse I read that 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.840
 you do not use a pet de laurent 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.970
 ruquier you can give details on 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.920
 on fighting is that one is who is a 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.230
 black mount fan and that when I'm 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.390
 in the show he defended me a little 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.970
 against all odds, it is unfortunately he has 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 been there when when sometimes we wanted 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.239
 after when it became a bit more 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.980
 seriously when we sometimes wanted censored 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.360
 my texts or not censored in any case 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.130
 we wanted to review cut texts 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.090
 parties etc has always fought for 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.060
 that this is not the case 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.320
 he hires me on the radio so and then we 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.420
 has become so friends in life so 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.790
 that's why we say that I think 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.980
 we get along well 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.930
 oh yes there is no ya did not have any 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.930
