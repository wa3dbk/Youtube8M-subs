back to a very laid back angle so good

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.930 
back to a very laid back angle so good
good<00:03:19.660> angle<00:03:20.019> can<00:03:20.440> sit<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.799> more<00:03:21.010> up<00:03:21.220> right<00:03:21.640> as

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
good angle can sit it more up right as

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.559

can<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.160> course<00:03:33.400> as<00:03:33.639> I<00:03:33.730> mentioned<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:34.299> can<00:03:34.480> of

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
can of course as I mentioned we can of

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.949 
can of course as I mentioned we can of
course<00:03:34.680> rotate<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:35.859> round<00:03:36.299> into<00:03:37.299> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
course rotate this round into the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.250 
course rotate this round into the
landscape<00:03:38.470> orientation<00:03:38.889> and<00:03:39.639> again<00:03:40.450> even<00:03:41.139> in

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
landscape orientation and again even in

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.080 
landscape orientation and again even in
this<00:03:41.410> orientation<00:03:41.590> we<00:03:42.459> can<00:03:42.609> adjust<00:03:42.970> that

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
this orientation we can adjust that

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.690 
this orientation we can adjust that
angle<00:03:43.630> if<00:03:44.200> we<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:44.739> wish<00:03:45.010> let's<00:03:45.310> keep<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.639> at

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
angle if we so wish let's keep it at

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.160 
angle if we so wish let's keep it at
this<00:03:45.790> all<00:03:46.060> angles<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.569> you<00:03:46.630> don't<00:03:46.900> get<00:03:46.989> those

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
this all angles so you don't get those

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.550 
this all angles so you don't get those
nasty<00:03:47.799> reflections<00:03:48.370> from<00:03:48.549> my<00:03:48.760> lights<00:03:49.060> and

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
nasty reflections from my lights and

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.229 
nasty reflections from my lights and
lets<00:03:50.560> its<00:03:50.769> own<00:03:50.950> planes<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.579> is<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:51.880> as<00:03:52.150> I

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
lets its own planes so this is just as I

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.580 
lets its own planes so this is just as I
say<00:03:52.389> using<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.959> standard<00:03:54.329> iPad<00:03:55.590> controls

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
say using the standard iPad controls

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.030 
say using the standard iPad controls
it's<00:03:57.160> perhaps<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.030> ting<00:03:58.269> tings<00:03:58.299> and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
it's perhaps going to the ting tings and

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.150 
it's perhaps going to the ting tings and
it's<00:04:00.040> due<00:04:00.389> that's<00:04:01.389> not<00:04:01.569> my<00:04:01.720> name<00:04:01.859> so<00:04:02.859> here<00:04:03.069> we

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
it's due that's not my name so here we

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:20.580 
it's due that's not my name so here we
go

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.260 

and<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:22.100> gives<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.370> an<00:04:22.460> idea<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.000> sort

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
and that gives you an idea of the sort

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.060 
and that gives you an idea of the sort
quality<00:04:23.870> it's<00:04:24.020> not<00:04:24.170> a<00:04:24.200> very<00:04:24.470> good<00:04:24.560> sound

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
quality it's not a very good sound

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.910 
quality it's not a very good sound
actually<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.700> sir<00:04:25.970> it's<00:04:26.570> okay<00:04:27.170> but<00:04:27.650> i<00:04:27.680> think

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
actually it sir it's okay but i think

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.580 
actually it sir it's okay but i think
the<00:04:28.010> plastic<00:04:28.520> enclosure<00:04:29.030> on<00:04:29.450> this<00:04:30.170> speaker

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
the plastic enclosure on this speaker

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.590 
the plastic enclosure on this speaker
doesn't<00:04:31.250> really<00:04:31.460> do<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.670> music<00:04:31.910> justice

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
doesn't really do the music justice

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.260 
doesn't really do the music justice
let's<00:04:33.470> turn<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.830> volume<00:04:34.130> up<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.520> we've<00:04:35.150> got

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
let's turn the volume up so we've got

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.590 
let's turn the volume up so we've got
volume<00:04:35.600> controls<00:04:36.020> here<00:04:36.850> let's<00:04:37.850> play<00:04:38.330> this<00:04:38.540> a

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
volume controls here let's play this a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:48.730 
volume controls here let's play this a
bit<00:04:38.900> more<00:04:45.970> well<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.900> get<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.110> idea<00:04:48.200> again

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
bit more well you get the idea again

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.340 
bit more well you get the idea again
it's<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.160> very<00:04:49.430> sort<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.850> muddy<00:04:50.120> sound<00:04:50.540> doesn't

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
sounding from the speaker's here let me

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.850 
sounding from the speaker's here let me
just<00:05:45.310> show<00:05:45.430> you<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.669> I<00:05:45.729> station<00:05:46.419> app<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.830> I

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
just show you that I station app that I

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.529 
just show you that I station app that I
did<00:05:48.130> download<00:05:48.370> here<00:05:48.910> we<00:05:49.030> go<00:05:49.150> with<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.360> Ice

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
did download here we go with the Ice

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.890 
did download here we go with the Ice
Station<00:05:49.810> here<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:50.610> unfortunately<00:05:51.720> it's<00:05:52.720> only

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
Station here and unfortunately it's only

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.400 
Station here and unfortunately it's only
for<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.970> ipod<00:05:54.970> so<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.539> do<00:05:55.750> have<00:05:55.840> to<00:05:56.020> zoom<00:05:56.229> it

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
for the ipod so you do have to zoom it

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.860 
for the ipod so you do have to zoom it
up<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:57.280> two<00:05:57.490> times<00:05:57.520> for<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.270> iPad<00:05:58.630> so<00:05:58.780> you're

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
up to two times for the iPad so you're

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.140 
up to two times for the iPad so you're
not<00:05:59.020> getting<00:05:59.289> any<00:05:59.410> high-res<00:05:59.860> graphics<00:06:00.000> but<00:06:01.000> it

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
not getting any high-res graphics but it

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.650 
not getting any high-res graphics but it
gives<00:06:01.300> you<00:06:01.600> a<00:06:02.080> display<00:06:02.860> for<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.580> clock<00:06:04.060> which<00:06:04.509> is

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
gives you a display for a clock which is

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.360 
gives you a display for a clock which is
quite<00:06:04.900> cool<00:06:05.280> if<00:06:06.280> we<00:06:06.490> tap<00:06:06.759> on<00:06:06.940> it<00:06:08.190> it's<00:06:09.190> not

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
quite cool if we tap on it it's not

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.060 
quite cool if we tap on it it's not
actually<00:06:09.990> doing<00:06:10.990> anything<00:06:11.229> for<00:06:11.770> me<00:06:13.199> so<00:06:14.199> not

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
actually doing anything for me so not

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.939 
actually doing anything for me so not
great<00:06:15.280> functionality<00:06:15.910> there<00:06:16.570> which<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.530> tap<00:06:17.830> in

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
great functionality there which I tap in

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.430 
great functionality there which I tap in
on<00:06:18.010> it<00:06:18.160> from<00:06:18.370> here<00:06:18.930> nothing<00:06:19.930> there<00:06:20.110> at<00:06:20.260> all

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
on it from here nothing there at all

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.560 
on it from here nothing there at all
let's<00:06:20.979> turn<00:06:21.190> this<00:06:21.370> round<00:06:21.669> into<00:06:21.970> this<00:06:22.120> format

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
let's turn this round into this format

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.629 
let's turn this round into this format
and<00:06:23.080> we<00:06:23.169> get<00:06:23.320> some<00:06:23.470> extra<00:06:23.680> buttons<00:06:24.039> appear<00:06:24.190> so

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
and we get some extra buttons appear so

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.730 
and we get some extra buttons appear so
as<00:06:24.729> you<00:06:24.820> can<00:06:24.940> see<00:06:25.180> it's<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.539> in<00:06:25.780> this<00:06:26.289> format

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
as you can see it's a in this format
