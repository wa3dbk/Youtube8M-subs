00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.330
 the drivers of the network transport network 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.340
 What have they been talking about among 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.260
 people who use this service for 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.360
 the way of driving they complain that 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.060
 they drive like crazy so they comment some 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.240
 Users from Queretaro good most 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 when you are standing size 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.779
 good 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.079
 is that then centuries that handle the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.870
 buses go too hard 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.870
 they respect some rules most 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.670
 of summer so that they had their 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.549
 time is to arrive as until 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.549
 arrives said hours to get to the 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.479
 forever 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.040
 nevertheless and added to this detail there is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.900
 operators who are talking on the phone 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.280
 or sending messages while driving 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.790
 as is the case of the driver of the unit 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.890
 60 0 107 of route 76 that I was sending 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 messages while driving a user 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.610
 asked to leave a cell phone to avoid 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.700
 some accident and he ignored it 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700
 full 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.590
 good 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.890
 in these situations we ask the 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.960
 people what they thought about it and this was 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.740
 what they answered in case they happen 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.440
 many and for zaragoza has happened in 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.240
 many of the great ones that we saw 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.190
 they are precisely people who do not 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.140
 they matter 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.510
 more than anything the security of our 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.370
 steels I think it 's very bad because I do not 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.950
 it only puts your life at risk 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.470
 everything that everyone who goes outside 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.170
 Any complaint can be reported to 211 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.030
