00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:09.219
 Now that I had the last two nights, 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:13.840
 Now we have to get the code to play and play. 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:16.059
 Why by looking moat Pele code learned from seeing how one spread so 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.210
 It's a picture drawn by three generations on the surface . 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.650
 I do not think I will see a fan today 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:28.000
 This party has got one true negative 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:31.000
 So what are these demands now? 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.590
 This is what the terrain is like 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.560
 Breeze bumps into what's behind him. 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.489
 I'm here to give their caps 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.390
 Is not it like the product hasyeotne here I'll give you a weapon 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.570
 If this is the typical metallurgy times 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:55.449
 It's thick. This is six. 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.269
 Reduce the breeding characters then again here too. What BONNET 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:05.140
 In fact geuraetjiman hands 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:09.600
 e3 one party who is born to see this kind of left hand fingers 1 2 3 4 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:14.659
 Now it's so then let 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.659
 Yogeo will remember being hit by a presentation and a presentation Soo Ae Yes 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.509
 So Now What Now cards, but the first edition second compartment until the third 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.180
 It can be better. 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.180
 Then the drawing shows the code 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:36.039
 Let's do two more examples. 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:36.039
 Next is the d code d code. 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:46.290
 Oh, and remove two to three pods table I could stand here, here, here, a key code 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.800
 I have 1 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:56.100
 This is alive. 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.600
 This is followed by air is the meaning said first party is the first left 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.050
 With a finger 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.050
 Other 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.310
 Second, press the second row of thick lines 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:13.590
 Here, too, the achievement of the middle of this Christmas, the middle finger of the thickest line 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.300
 Alive two years down the second column nude little finger four times in the little finger 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:22.100
 On the thinnest line 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.100
 Well the third canoe stage is talked about then c code c code 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:33.050
 Code again coming Oh, 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.050
 Aaak c code cooking here Click here 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.620
 Then here 's the 2 3 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.879
 Likewise, the second finger in the second 10-minute line with the common finger, 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.819
 Press 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:51.030
 This rainfall regime and 1 tone 3 Hearts 34th in the second compartment 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:57.269
 And with three fingers and one finger, 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.799
 Haha that sand 4th line 5th line Arata 2 3th kan This is to notify the world 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.049
 Tucker 3 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.780
 The weight yigotdo short stroke press in the state gave the world at this day through 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:12.739
 When folded, this chord comes out. 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:20.280
 Now take the law code, so when the real problem japeusil when I was in middle school 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:24.720
 I went to the country when he was young and then I got the first 3002 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.849
 Look, I have an acoustic guitar first gotta have this relationship now from then until now 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.540
 I was playing guitar, and the code I was using for the first time was Zico. 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.519
 So you now do it so or g code is easy sound 1 g 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.079
 I did a lot of code announcements 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.829
 I am telling people from the god code that the 4g code is Japanese 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.169
 To sugar 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:48.000
 Its lack of load-party body in the first part of the glass capillary workers drink the next line 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.000
 The problem is, 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.739
 Not in the middle, not in the back, 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.579
 At 2 years old, you have to press the new outward side towards this side g sound 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.079
 That 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:06.419
 Then the middle finger always made this finger early. 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:11.459
 Come one side of a third country to the next, like this also in the third knife jet going 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:14.909
 Some sort of a strange sound is frustrating, but the skirt on this side has a clear sound 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.560
 It's functional. 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:24.180
 And a few lines below this angle, there is a catch to the sound of the little finger 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.060
 Holding a little break turned into diagonal shapes are going to do this, then you 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.780
 Being so professional fur accident or Galago 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:36.630
 When it comes to this, I'm asking you to be slightly sideways 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.070
 Now, this man must be presented hankeot yisejong there is going to weaken the little finger 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.020
 have 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:47.219
 Now the c code is good, but the tough guy can stop it because of the little finger. 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.139
 You can push it with your fingers . I do not care. 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:52.650
 Where possible 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:57.509
 Her daughter is three times weaker than three fingers, so if possible, 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.039
 I really get that often in writing, so your fingers can be one and the other gohui 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:04.289
 I gotta equalize the balance 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:08.270
 Jatiko etc. So the little finger is the thinnest third car 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.270
 So holding on to dementia 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:19.150
 I just feel so bright. 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:24.460
 If the code has any concept of what we code the way the code is configured value 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:31.870
 Well, Mr. and did so when I saw that was so small as to shoot the workers 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:37.210
 And then so, alas for our second home, drink this I mean that is the end 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:41.620
 Meaning to disappear is that Posey only comes out at level 6 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:45.850
 My heart is on my mind, 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:50.020
 Here's our code. Here's your finger number one . 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:52.120
 Where is the second column in the first row in the thin line, 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:58.960
 I need you to press Freddie closer. 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:03.970
 The requirement is that the middle finger here is the product to buy and sell. 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:08.139
 Next, here is the 5-yuan Public Health Center 1 2 3 4 5 yuse 1 2 3 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:14.349
 One can not enter the compartment where exactly're not cheap plane control programs look 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:16.150
 If you go this way, it will make you sound strange. 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:20.830
 However, 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:24.750
 This said, this code c code so when the reproduction under the sole and sea bream 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.870
 After 9 people have said and wrote a check Quad 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:33.970
 What the hell is flying the West do 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:37.639
 Now that the terrain is grateful, the g code that you just learned and the c code 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:41.720
 I mix it up with the autonomous code 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:44.680
 The day before yesterday, Ji Young cow standing in the US is now chat garage on the way tha 3 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.050
 After building up a shop and four won straight 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:54.090
 Sounds a bit tricky. 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:58.380
 Very good, very good sound from 6 weeks . Then let's catch the c code. 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:03.360
 I'll take a step, I'll do it again. 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.350
 When the sound coming from the sound cleanly in six weeks time so completely caught up in the whole 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.949
 200 point image 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.949
 OK pass
