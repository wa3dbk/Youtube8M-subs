to because you can see just straight

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.539 
to because you can see just straight
through<00:03:06.150> like<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.519> I

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
through like that it's like you know I

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.810 
through like that it's like you know I
still<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:09.450> links<00:03:09.959> but<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:11.400> create<00:03:11.610> how

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
still have some links but to create how

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.410 
still have some links but to create how
it<00:03:12.000> used<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.900> much<00:03:16.440> more<00:03:17.420> thinner

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
it used to be it's much more thinner

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.590 
it used to be it's much more thinner
than<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.959> was<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.910> I'm<00:03:20.970> trying<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.239> get<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.480> to

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
than it was so I'm trying to get it to

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.770 
than it was so I'm trying to get it to
thicken<00:03:21.870> up<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:23.239> stop<00:03:24.239> wasting<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.720> much

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
thicken up and stop wasting so much

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.160 
thicken up and stop wasting so much
protein<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> clergy<00:03:26.190> has<00:03:26.660> protein<00:03:27.660> and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
protein is that a clergy has protein and

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.320 
protein is that a clergy has protein and
