00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.970
 good carnal we continue with this that is 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.580
 minecraft 17.2 as you can see this is 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.920
 glass like powers like and also like 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.660
 you can see it is colorful and all 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.160
 are those of big size and also 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.720
 these that are the ones like more 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.340
 delgadito I do not remember the name well 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.590
 Well, as you can see, it's in yellow 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.490
 is in blue is in chicken is in 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.890
 purple is in a bunch of better and 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.750
 I also think that this is 1.6 points 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.150
 but no macro I think if that's 17.2 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.629
 when you come across something like they look 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.390
 the particles as well as here type 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.610
 Well the question of how kaka is something 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.920
 there they could see that there are new flowers 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.780
 also that there is not much importance 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.079
 but good when creating this 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.520
 colors yes and here the new command that 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.980
 is from saman 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.740
 can you as you invoke could you 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.630
 say I do not know any way here that by 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.339
 example can you invoke this then this 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.700
 mushroom vaquita can invoke a 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.350
 creepers a pig one I do not know what 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.770
 you can think you can invoke 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.210
 with that command that is are taken and what 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.490
 what do you want to invoke in English 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.740
 obviously and capitalized at the beginning 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.450
 as you can see then also that already 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.710
 they had seen or fuck mother knows 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.190
 helicopters that always pass here 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.260
 outside but they leave this the portals of 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.390
 the black one can do this 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.190
 any size and the only important thing 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.920
 is that it has to be in a form 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.290
 correct and they do it in type then 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.750
 well rather it has to be a way 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.759
 of rectangle because if it does not work 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.520
 correctly here as you can see then 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.320
 this portal is all crooked but 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.660
 they can also stop it and it stays the same and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.700
 I put on we have a batch holder 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.940
 and you see guys come those mountains from 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.220
 1.7 point 2 the generated ones here are 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.509
 they see simply and simply epics 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 fucking mom and after a while with the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.860
 shaders is going to look cool and also 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.460
 is the new command that is set 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.170
 block 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.229
 here as you can see above it says 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.869
 warning this used in america and this will 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.630
 not be supporting the future so 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.910
 says good before you have to put the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.550
 set block command have to put 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.200
 the coordinates as you can see here and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.459
 well there he said that you could not put 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.620
 the light of the block that could be or 420 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.440
 or 1 this now they have to put 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 minecraft two points this either the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.120
 gold gold block 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.840
 block or time on black as you can see and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.310
 you will say in those numbers that 17 63 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.780
 179 as you can see it is also 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.019
 specific that they want to put their 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.180
 xyz coordinates so you can see 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.790
 there that nothing else pressing f3 and you 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.470
 can see where and obviously we 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.470
 is going to put our block without any 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.970
 carnal problem this one right now we're going 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.620

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.170
