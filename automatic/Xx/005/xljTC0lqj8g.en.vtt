00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.310 

now<00:02:47.260> yep<00:02:48.260> that's<00:02:48.650> all<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:50.320> power

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
now yep that's all for the power

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.710 
now yep that's all for the power
smithing<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.190> can<00:02:52.460> alter<00:02:52.910> which<00:02:53.210> items<00:02:53.630> you

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
way you can get access to the edge vil

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.199 
way you can get access to the edge vil
furnace<00:04:02.410> which<00:04:03.410> is<00:04:03.560> located<00:04:03.740> right<00:04:04.100> here<00:04:04.280> now

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
furnace which is located right here now

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.600 
furnace which is located right here now
as<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.480> can<00:04:05.840> see<00:04:05.900> this<00:04:06.560> is<00:04:06.740> a<00:04:06.770> very<00:04:07.130> short<00:04:07.190> run

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
as you can see this is a very short run

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.740 
as you can see this is a very short run
from<00:04:07.790> bank<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.510> furnace<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.800> bank<00:04:10.750> run

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
from bank to the furnace so bank run

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.060 
from bank to the furnace so bank run
back

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.759 

alright<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.389> 30<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.690> 50<00:04:19.139> you'll<00:04:19.410> be<00:04:19.560> making

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
alright so 30 to 50 you'll be making

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.409 
alright so 30 to 50 you'll be making
steel<00:04:20.310> bars<00:04:21.740> you<00:04:22.740> can<00:04:22.919> either<00:04:23.240> make<00:04:24.240> your

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
steel bars you can either make your

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.540 
steel bars you can either make your
steel<00:04:24.630> bars<00:04:24.870> using<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.950> furnace<00:04:26.340> or

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
steel bars using a furnace or

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.780 
steel bars using a furnace or
superheating<00:04:27.210> i<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.660> believe<00:04:28.050> both<00:04:28.590> are<00:04:28.889> well

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
superheating i do believe both are well

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.730 
superheating i do believe both are well
so<00:04:30.510> creating<00:04:30.870> from<00:04:31.380> what<00:04:31.500> i<00:04:31.530> know<00:04:31.590> is

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
so creating from what i know is

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.580 
so creating from what i know is
profitable<00:04:32.460> or<00:04:32.669> last<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.150> checked<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.720> can

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
profitable or last I checked you can

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.629 
profitable or last I checked you can
check<00:04:34.860> by<00:04:36.260> adding<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.290> cost<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.130> material

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
check by adding the cost of the material

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.320 
check by adding the cost of the material
and<00:04:38.760> then<00:04:39.360> comparing<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:40.590> against<00:04:41.040> the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
and then comparing it against the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.409 
and then comparing it against the
completed<00:04:42.330> bars<00:04:42.570> price<00:04:43.110> 50<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.370> 70<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:45.090> can

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
completed bars price 50 to 70 you can

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.900 
completed bars price 50 to 70 you can
you<00:04:46.110> have<00:04:46.260> two<00:04:46.440> options<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:47.550> can<00:04:47.700> make

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
you have two options you can make

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.659 
you have two options you can make
mithril<00:04:48.750> bars<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.290> entire<00:04:49.620> way<00:04:49.889> or<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.460> can

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
mithril bars the entire way or you can

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:57.460 
mithril bars the entire way or you can
make<00:04:51.320> mithril<00:04:52.320> bars<00:04:52.350> from<00:04:52.860> 52<00:04:53.370> 53<00:04:55.220> now<00:04:56.220> at<00:04:56.460> 53

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
make mithril bars from 52 53 now at 53

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.350 
make mithril bars from 52 53 now at 53
you<00:04:58.470> can<00:04:58.710> do<00:04:58.860> blast<00:04:59.220> furnace<00:04:59.729> if<00:04:59.970> you're<00:05:00.120> able

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
you can do blast furnace if you're able

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.520 
you can do blast furnace if you're able
to<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:01.639> what<00:05:02.639> blast<00:05:02.940> furnace<00:05:03.330> does<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.900> it

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
to and what blast furnace does is it

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.790 
to and what blast furnace does is it
allows<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.310> use<00:05:05.550> half<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:07.169> usual

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
allows you to use half of the usual

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.680 
allows you to use half of the usual
amount<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.490> coal<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:08.910> you're<00:05:10.280> needed<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.430> use

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
amount of coal that you're needed to use

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.400
