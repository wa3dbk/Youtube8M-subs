and<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.450> Italian<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.170> technique<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.920> adding

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and in Italian this technique of adding

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.740 
and in Italian this technique of adding
the<00:01:39.360> milk<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.840> called<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.290> phyllo<00:01:41.750> meaning

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the milk it's called a phyllo meaning

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.819 
the milk it's called a phyllo meaning
like<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> thread<00:01:44.240> it's<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.689> easy<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.170> spoil

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
like a thread it's really easy to spoil

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:54.300 
like a thread it's really easy to spoil
the<00:01:47.220> custard<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.750> careful

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.310 

now<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.370> can<00:01:55.670> turn<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.060> fire<00:01:56.300> up<00:01:56.659> just<00:01:57.200> a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
now you can turn the fire up just a

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.359 
now you can turn the fire up just a
little<00:01:57.620> so<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.520> cream<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.930> pot<00:02:00.369> can

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
little so that the cream and the pot can

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.719 
little so that the cream and the pot can
start<00:02:01.729> getting<00:02:02.060> hot<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.710> my<00:02:03.710> advice<00:02:04.130> is<00:02:04.460> to

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
start getting hot and my advice is to

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.480 
start getting hot and my advice is to
keep<00:02:04.760> stirring<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:06.070> always<00:02:07.070> in<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.400> same

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
keep stirring it always in the same

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.360 
keep stirring it always in the same
direction<00:02:08.740> gently<00:02:11.290> turn<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.470> fire<00:02:12.709> down<00:02:12.740> just

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
direction gently turn the fire down just

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.100 
direction gently turn the fire down just
a<00:02:13.490> little<00:02:13.520> bit<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.940> don't<00:02:14.180> want<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.480> burn<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.870> I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
a little bit I don't want to burn it I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.070 
a little bit I don't want to burn it I
don't<00:02:16.070> want<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.580> don't<00:02:17.300> want<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.870> turn

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
don't want to I don't want it to turn

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:27.010 
don't want to I don't want it to turn
into<00:02:19.030> strange<00:02:20.030> looking<00:02:20.450> lumps<00:02:20.959> just<00:02:26.020> a

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
into strange looking lumps just a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.390

it's so delicious

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.870 
it's so delicious
I<00:02:35.540> might<00:02:35.750> even<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.260> better<00:02:36.620> with<00:02:36.890> cane

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
I might even like it better with cane

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.500 
I might even like it better with cane
sugar<00:02:39.040> instead<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.160> regular<00:02:40.550> regular<00:02:41.209> white

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
sugar instead of regular regular white

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:49.120 
sugar instead of regular regular white
sugar<00:02:46.300> all<00:02:47.300> right<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:47.810> at<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:48.290> point<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.830> would

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
sugar all right so at this point I would

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.490 
sugar all right so at this point I would
say<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.910> flour<00:02:50.180> has<00:02:50.630> had<00:02:50.900> enough<00:02:51.200> time

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
say that the flour has had enough time

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.860 
say that the flour has had enough time
to<00:02:51.560> cook<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.970> custard<00:02:53.390> has<00:02:54.019> reached<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.319 

consistency<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> wanted<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.090> kind

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
consistency that I wanted so it's kind

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.340 
consistency that I wanted so it's kind
of<00:03:02.420> like<00:03:02.600> working<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:03.519> bechamel<00:03:04.959> in<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.110> sense

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
of like working a bechamel in the sense

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.720 
of like working a bechamel in the sense
that<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.590> have<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.769> cook<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.160> flour<00:03:07.370> with<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
that you have to cook the flour with the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.069 
that you have to cook the flour with the
milk<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.329> it's<00:03:09.200> gonna<00:03:09.410> change<00:03:11.079> its

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
milk and it's gonna change its

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.830 
milk and it's gonna change its
consistency<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.190> then<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.760> work<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.209> until

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
consistency and then you work it until
