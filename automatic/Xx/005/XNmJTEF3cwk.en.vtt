in the diagram here insert this very

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.760 
in the diagram here insert this very
slowly<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.780> make<00:00:33.930> sure<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.469> ridges

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
slowly and make sure that all the ridges

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.889 
slowly and make sure that all the ridges
line<00:00:34.950> up<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.790> feel<00:00:36.030> resistance

damage the pins inside the camera and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
damage the pins inside the camera and
then<00:00:40.950> we're<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> camera<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> semester

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
then we're down a camera for a semester

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
then we're down a camera for a semester
so<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:42.989> don't<00:00:43.140> want<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.190> very

little twist and you can either put it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.760 
little twist and you can either put it
back<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.869> leave<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> off<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.409> today

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
back on or just leave it off for today

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
back on or just leave it off for today
we're<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:43.979> gonna<00:01:44.130> leave<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:44.780> leave<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
we're just gonna leave it off leave a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
we're just gonna leave it off leave a
lens<00:01:46.049> cap<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.040> fine<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
lens cap on for now that's fine so the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.340 
lens cap on for now that's fine so the
shoulder<00:01:49.020> rig<00:01:49.610> has<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.000> follow<00:01:51.240> focus

make sure it's nice and loose we're

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.880 
make sure it's nice and loose we're
gonna<00:01:59.460> loosen<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.770> can

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
gonna loosen this up so that we can

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.499 
gonna loosen this up so that we can
easily<00:02:02.070> slide<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.759> over<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> lens<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.640 

you<00:02:32.750> want<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.960> make<00:02:33.080> sure<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.500> can

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
you want to make sure that you can

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.290 
you want to make sure that you can
rotate<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> teeth<00:02:34.760> are<00:02:34.940> all<00:02:35.060> lined

rotate this that the teeth are all lined

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.090 
rotate this that the teeth are all lined
up<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.690> then<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.260> not<00:02:36.380> rubbing<00:02:36.770> on<00:02:36.890> anything

up and then it's not rubbing on anything

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.160 
up and then it's not rubbing on anything
I<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.580> see<00:02:37.730> right<00:02:37.940> now<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.390> side<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.870> coming

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
I can see right now this side is coming

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.680 
I can see right now this side is coming
out<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.320> little<00:02:39.530> too<00:02:39.830> much<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.330> we<00:02:41.390> can<00:02:41.540> just

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
out a little too much and we can just

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.540 
out a little too much and we can just
make<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.900> uniform<00:02:42.410> all<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.710> way<00:02:42.800> around<00:02:43.130> it's

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
make it uniform all the way around it's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.490 
make it uniform all the way around it's
okay<00:02:43.940> if<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.270> continues<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.870> focus<00:02:45.260> even

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
okay if this continues to focus even

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.840 
okay if this continues to focus even
when<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> focus<00:02:46.070> controlling<00:02:46.730> mechanism

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
when the focus controlling mechanism

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.150 
when the focus controlling mechanism
stops<00:02:47.540> itself<00:02:47.960> that's<00:02:48.290> fine<00:02:50.800> if<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.860> haven't

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
stops itself that's fine if you haven't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.530 
stops itself that's fine if you haven't
made<00:02:52.220> any<00:02:52.280> changes<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.060> shoulder<00:02:53.390> rig

made any changes to the shoulder rig
this<00:02:53.690> should<00:02:53.870> line<00:02:54.080> up<00:02:54.110> perfectly<00:02:55.010> with<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
this should line up perfectly with the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
it to the follow focus rig you'll simply

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.970 
it to the follow focus rig you'll simply
line<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.330> screw<00:03:02.480> hole<00:03:02.810> on<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.410> bottom<00:03:03.650> of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
plate one other thing to look out for is

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.250 
plate one other thing to look out for is
the<00:03:09.500> set<00:03:09.890> screw<00:03:10.160> here<00:03:10.460> this<00:03:11.270> just<00:03:11.570> falls<00:03:11.900> into

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the set screw here this just falls into

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.170 
the set screw here this just falls into
a<00:03:12.530> small<00:03:13.040> hole<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.580> other<00:03:13.730> side<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
a small hole on the other side of the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.150 
a small hole on the other side of the
camera<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.660> doesn't<00:03:14.840> screw<00:03:15.170> into<00:03:15.320> place<00:03:15.380> but

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
camera it doesn't screw into place but

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.890 
camera it doesn't screw into place but
be<00:03:16.280> very<00:03:16.460> careful<00:03:16.580> not<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.090> break<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.450> off<00:03:17.690> or

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
be very careful not to break it off or

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.450 
be very careful not to break it off or
shear<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.230> off<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.620> adds<00:03:18.860> extra<00:03:19.220> stability

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
shear it off this adds extra stability

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.690 
shear it off this adds extra stability
when<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.030> camera<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.630> on<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.050> rig<00:03:21.350> as<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.550> put

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
when the camera is on the rig as you put

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.180 
when the camera is on the rig as you put
it<00:03:22.790> on<00:03:22.970> make<00:03:23.300> sure<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.320> screw<00:03:24.800> for<00:03:25.070> the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
it on make sure that the screw for the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.610 
it on make sure that the screw for the
follow<00:03:25.400> focus<00:03:25.640> is<00:03:25.970> out<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.390> way<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.470> we'll

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
follow focus is out of the way so we'll

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.110 
follow focus is out of the way so we'll
put<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:27.920> kind<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.190> straight<00:03:28.460> up<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.760> down<00:03:28.880> so

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
put it kind of straight up and down so

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.220 
put it kind of straight up and down so
that<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.360> doesn't<00:03:29.660> get<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.930> way<00:03:30.050> of<00:03:30.080> our

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
that it doesn't get in the way of our

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.050 
that it doesn't get in the way of our
follow<00:03:30.470> focus<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.340> we<00:03:31.460> just<00:03:31.640> kind<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.820> want<00:03:32.000> to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
follow focus and we just kind of want to

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.210 
follow focus and we just kind of want to
lay<00:03:32.270> it<00:03:32.420> into<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.870> ridges<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.470> make<00:03:33.950> sure<00:03:34.100> it

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
lay it into the ridges and make sure it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.000 
lay it into the ridges and make sure it
lines<00:03:34.400> up<00:03:35.110> this<00:03:36.110> tape<00:03:36.410> might<00:03:36.620> take<00:03:36.800> some

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
lines up this tape might take some

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:50.140 
lines up this tape might take some
finessing

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150

let go you'll want to put the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.050 
let go you'll want to put the
counterbalance<00:04:52.860> on<00:04:53.190> this<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> very<00:04:53.789> heavy

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
counterbalance on this is a very heavy

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.050 
counterbalance on this is a very heavy
object<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.900> be<00:04:55.169> careful<00:04:55.620> you<00:04:56.610> can<00:04:56.760> put<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.000> on

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
object so be careful you can put it on

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.000 
object so be careful you can put it on
either<00:04:57.330> way<00:04:57.599> it<00:04:58.139> depends<00:04:58.500> on<00:04:58.560> how<00:04:58.740> large<00:04:58.889> your

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
either way it depends on how large your

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.560 
either way it depends on how large your
shoulder<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.639> and<00:04:59.970> what's<00:05:00.120> going<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.330> get<00:05:00.449> in

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
shoulder is and what's going to get in

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.800 
shoulder is and what's going to get in
the<00:05:00.660> way<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.500> if<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:01.770> put<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.099> on<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:02.400> way<00:05:02.810> you

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
the way so if you put it on this way you

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.110 
the way so if you put it on this way you
don't<00:05:04.050> have<00:05:04.289> too<00:05:04.770> much<00:05:04.919> clearance<00:05:05.400> here<00:05:05.669> if

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
don't have too much clearance here if

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.990 
don't have too much clearance here if
you<00:05:06.300> put<00:05:06.510> it<00:05:06.630> on<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:07.199> other<00:05:07.349> way<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:08.729> have<00:05:08.970> a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
you put it on the other way you have a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.480 
you put it on the other way you have a
lot<00:05:09.360> less<00:05:09.389> clearance<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.710> so<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.070> might<00:05:11.340> have

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
lot less clearance and so you might have

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.070 
lot less clearance and so you might have
the<00:05:11.550> issue<00:05:11.789> that<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.210> rails<00:05:12.419> don't<00:05:12.750> go<00:05:12.870> all

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
the issue that the rails don't go all

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.870 
the issue that the rails don't go all
the<00:05:13.199> way<00:05:13.229> through<00:05:13.530> based<00:05:14.190> on<00:05:14.340> how<00:05:14.520> everything

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
the way through based on how everything

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.330 
the way through based on how everything
else<00:05:15.180> is<00:05:15.419> set<00:05:15.810> up<00:05:15.990> so<00:05:16.440> be<00:05:16.650> careful<00:05:17.039> with<00:05:17.130> this

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
else is set up so be careful with this

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.740 
else is set up so be careful with this
you<00:05:17.520> definitely<00:05:17.669> want<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.240> at<00:05:18.419> least<00:05:18.449> a

the monitor you can definitely just look
at<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.030> viewfinder<00:06:00.510> on<00:06:00.539> the<00:06:00.750> camera<00:06:01.280> but<00:06:02.280> many

at the viewfinder on the camera but many

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.860 
at the viewfinder on the camera but many
people<00:06:03.180> like<00:06:03.510> to

people like to

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.420 
people like to
with<00:06:04.080> a<00:06:04.290> monitor<00:06:04.770> right<00:06:04.949> in<00:06:05.070> front<00:06:05.220> of<00:06:05.340> their

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
that when you're holding it on your

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.490 
that when you're holding it on your
shoulder<00:06:27.330> you<00:06:27.360> can<00:06:27.630> see<00:06:27.870> that<00:06:28.110> right<00:06:28.320> now

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
shoulder you can see that right now

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.560 
shoulder you can see that right now
where<00:06:29.100> the<00:06:29.250> pistol<00:06:29.610> grip<00:06:29.639> here<00:06:30.000> is<00:06:30.180> on<00:06:30.419> the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
where the pistol grip here is on the

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.969 
where the pistol grip here is on the
shoulder<00:06:30.870> support<00:06:30.990> I'd<00:06:31.410> have<00:06:31.560> to<00:06:31.680> take<00:06:31.800> my

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
shoulder support I'd have to take my

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.310 
shoulder support I'd have to take my
hand<00:06:32.190> off<00:06:32.490> to<00:06:32.820> adjust<00:06:33.389> the<00:06:33.479> follow<00:06:33.690> focus<00:06:33.810> and

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
hand off to adjust the follow focus and

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.110 
hand off to adjust the follow focus and
then<00:06:34.410> come<00:06:34.620> back<00:06:34.650> and<00:06:35.100> as<00:06:35.639> you<00:06:35.790> know<00:06:35.910> from

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
then come back and as you know from

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.460 
then come back and as you know from
running<00:06:36.419> gun<00:06:36.570> shooting<00:06:36.960> you<00:06:37.050> really<00:06:37.290> don't

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
running gun shooting you really don't

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.659 
running gun shooting you really don't
want<00:06:37.590> to<00:06:37.650> have<00:06:37.740> to<00:06:37.860> take<00:06:38.010> your<00:06:38.160> hand<00:06:38.400> off<00:06:38.639> the

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
want to have to take your hand off the

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.940 
want to have to take your hand off the
focus<00:06:39.180> control<00:06:39.510> so<00:06:40.139> what<00:06:40.229> I<00:06:40.260> found<00:06:40.590> is<00:06:40.889> a

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
focus control so what I found is a

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.620 
focus control so what I found is a
little<00:06:41.220> unconventional<00:06:41.580> but<00:06:42.180> it<00:06:42.270> works<00:06:42.450> well

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
little unconventional but it works well

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.070 
little unconventional but it works well
for<00:06:42.690> me

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
for me

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.469 
for me
I<00:06:43.260> picked<00:06:44.010> this<00:06:44.340> grip<00:06:44.610> up<00:06:44.790> and<00:06:45.120> put<00:06:45.389> it

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
I picked this grip up and put it

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:46.969 
I picked this grip up and put it
sideways<00:06:45.720> and<00:06:46.169> get<00:06:46.260> it<00:06:46.350> a<00:06:46.410> little<00:06:46.470> bit<00:06:46.620> closer

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
sideways and get it a little bit closer

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.490 
sideways and get it a little bit closer
to<00:06:47.220> the<00:06:47.280> focus<00:06:47.639> control<00:06:48.000> so<00:06:48.810> that<00:06:48.840> rather<00:06:49.260> than

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
to the focus control so that rather than

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.230 
to the focus control so that rather than
holding<00:06:49.950> this<00:06:50.100> up<00:06:50.280> I'm<00:06:50.520> just<00:06:50.550> kind<00:06:50.850> of<00:06:50.910> resting

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
holding this up I'm just kind of resting

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.210 
holding this up I'm just kind of resting
it<00:06:51.360> there<00:06:51.570> and<00:06:51.930> I<00:06:52.080> can<00:06:52.200> very<00:06:52.470> easily<00:06:52.740> reach

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
it there and I can very easily reach

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.610 
it there and I can very easily reach
over<00:06:53.610> and<00:06:53.729> adjust<00:06:54.510> my<00:06:54.570> follow<00:06:54.870> focus<00:06:55.139> and<00:06:55.560> I

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
over and adjust my follow focus and I

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.750 
over and adjust my follow focus and I
don't<00:06:55.770> have<00:06:55.889> to<00:06:55.979> take<00:06:56.130> my<00:06:56.280> hand<00:06:56.460> off<00:06:56.580> the

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
don't have to take my hand off the

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.010 
don't have to take my hand off the
control<00:06:57.180> I'm<00:06:57.360> actually<00:06:57.510> gonna<00:06:57.720> bring<00:06:57.840> it<00:06:57.960> a

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
control I'm actually gonna bring it a

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.480 
control I'm actually gonna bring it a
little<00:06:58.050> bit<00:06:58.289> closer<00:06:59.780> and<00:07:00.780> there<00:07:01.410> I<00:07:01.440> am<00:07:01.560> so<00:07:02.430> you

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
little bit closer and there I am so you

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.930 
little bit closer and there I am so you
can<00:07:02.699> see<00:07:02.940> how<00:07:03.479> close<00:07:03.780> it<00:07:03.960> really<00:07:04.080> is<00:07:04.639> okay<00:07:05.639> so<00:07:05.699> I

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 
can see how close it really is okay so I

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.590 
can see how close it really is okay so I
can<00:07:06.090> just<00:07:06.270> hold<00:07:06.510> on<00:07:06.660> to<00:07:06.810> it<00:07:06.900> perfectly<00:07:07.430> and<00:07:08.600> the

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
can just hold on to it perfectly and the

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.180 
can just hold on to it perfectly and the
monitor<00:07:09.990> is<00:07:10.110> far<00:07:10.350> enough<00:07:10.530> in<00:07:10.710> front<00:07:10.860> that<00:07:11.130> I

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
monitor is far enough in front that I

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.100 
monitor is far enough in front that I
really<00:07:11.460> don't<00:07:11.639> even<00:07:11.880> see<00:07:12.120> this<00:07:12.570> pistol<00:07:12.930> grip

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
really don't even see this pistol grip

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.560 
really don't even see this pistol grip
in<00:07:13.320> my<00:07:13.620> way<00:07:13.800> just<00:07:14.700> be<00:07:14.910> careful<00:07:15.300> when<00:07:15.419> you're

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
in my way just be careful when you're

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.940 
in my way just be careful when you're
walking<00:07:15.720> around<00:07:16.169> that<00:07:16.410> you<00:07:16.530> don't<00:07:16.740> suddenly

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:16.950 
walking around that you don't suddenly

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.640 
walking around that you don't suddenly
get<00:07:17.310> this<00:07:17.520> jammed<00:07:17.880> back<00:07:18.150> into<00:07:18.450> your<00:07:18.539> face<00:07:18.840> that

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650 
get this jammed back into your face that

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.710 
get this jammed back into your face that
would<00:07:19.919> be<00:07:20.099> bad<00:07:20.370> but<00:07:21.060> for<00:07:21.240> right<00:07:21.330> now<00:07:21.479> if<00:07:21.599> you've

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
would be bad but for right now if you've

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.469 
would be bad but for right now if you've
got<00:07:21.750> a<00:07:21.870> hand<00:07:22.169> on<00:07:22.349> it<00:07:22.380> you<00:07:23.039> also<00:07:23.250> have<00:07:23.700> the<00:07:24.060> back

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
got a hand on it you also have the back

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.350 
got a hand on it you also have the back
of<00:07:24.720> the<00:07:25.200> support<00:07:25.620> resting<00:07:26.400> squarely<00:07:26.580> against

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
of the support resting squarely against

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.000 
of the support resting squarely against
your<00:07:27.510> shoulder<00:07:27.840> so<00:07:27.990> that<00:07:28.020> really<00:07:28.500> isn't<00:07:28.650> room

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
your shoulder so that really isn't room

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.650 
your shoulder so that really isn't room
for<00:07:29.039> it<00:07:29.370> to<00:07:29.400> travel<00:07:29.700> anywhere<00:07:30.060> and<00:07:30.330> that's<00:07:30.419> the

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
for it to travel anywhere and that's the

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.290 
for it to travel anywhere and that's the
ideal<00:07:31.080> method<00:07:31.500> for<00:07:31.680> using<00:07:31.830> so<00:07:32.760> in<00:07:32.880> this<00:07:33.000> case

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 
ideal method for using so in this case

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.060 
ideal method for using so in this case
I'm<00:07:33.630> ready<00:07:33.840> to<00:07:33.990> go

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.070 
I'm ready to go

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.100 
I'm ready to go
you<00:07:35.280> can<00:07:35.430> also<00:07:35.610> swing<00:07:36.090> this<00:07:36.270> grip<00:07:36.510> around<00:07:36.840> if

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
you can also swing this grip around if

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.320 
you can also swing this grip around if
you'd<00:07:37.380> like<00:07:37.650> to<00:07:38.160> bring<00:07:38.310> it<00:07:38.430> up<00:07:38.610> closer<00:07:38.910> to<00:07:39.090> the

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
you'd like to bring it up closer to the

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.420 
you'd like to bring it up closer to the
zoom<00:07:39.630> so<00:07:39.930> if<00:07:40.020> you<00:07:40.110> need<00:07:40.260> to<00:07:40.289> zoom<00:07:40.620> on<00:07:41.010> the<00:07:41.190> fly

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430 
zoom so if you need to zoom on the fly

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.820 
zoom so if you need to zoom on the fly
you<00:07:42.330> can<00:07:42.479> do<00:07:42.599> something<00:07:42.990> very<00:07:43.020> similar<00:07:43.470> flip

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:43.830 
you can do something very similar flip

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.200 
you can do something very similar flip
it<00:07:43.950> upside<00:07:44.250> down<00:07:44.280> so<00:07:44.430> that<00:07:44.639> you<00:07:44.820> can<00:07:44.970> rock<00:07:45.180> it

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.210 
it upside down so that you can rock it

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.450 
it upside down so that you can rock it
back<00:07:45.510> and<00:07:45.570> forth<00:07:45.810> and<00:07:46.229> have<00:07:46.680> a<00:07:46.710> grip<00:07:46.979> up<00:07:47.130> here

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 
back and forth and have a grip up here

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.190 
back and forth and have a grip up here
but<00:07:47.789> ordinarily<00:07:48.270> you<00:07:48.479> probably<00:07:48.870> are<00:07:49.020> going<00:07:49.139> to

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.200 
but ordinarily you probably are going to

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.990 
but ordinarily you probably are going to
set<00:07:49.440> your<00:07:49.560> zoom<00:07:49.830> at<00:07:50.070> a<00:07:50.099> certain<00:07:50.490> interval<00:07:50.760> and

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 
set your zoom at a certain interval and

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.850 
set your zoom at a certain interval and
not<00:07:51.419> really<00:07:51.720> change<00:07:51.990> it<00:07:52.139> the<00:07:52.260> focus<00:07:52.650> might

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 
not really change it the focus might

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.740 
not really change it the focus might
need<00:07:53.010> to<00:07:53.130> change<00:07:53.370> on<00:07:53.550> the<00:07:53.639> fly<00:07:53.669> so<00:07:54.090> this<00:07:54.599> is<00:07:54.720> a

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:54.750 
need to change on the fly so this is a

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.600 
need to change on the fly so this is a
really<00:07:55.080> good<00:07:55.169> way<00:07:55.349> to<00:07:55.650> run<00:07:55.800> and<00:07:55.979> gun<00:07:56.099> with<00:07:56.460> this

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610 
really good way to run and gun with this

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.849 
really good way to run and gun with this
camera
