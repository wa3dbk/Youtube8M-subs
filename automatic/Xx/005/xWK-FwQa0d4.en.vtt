00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.830
 perforation scuffs can be done 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.440
 scale or modest cross-cutting or 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.679
 with a number not so you decide today 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.150
 learning to make ripped jeans by the rules 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.610
 to create fashionable jeans to us 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.310
 you will need scissors office knife 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.820
 emery paper ruler coarse nail file 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.739
 or penza jeans can be broken chaotically 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.770
 or arisen holes in random order 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.870
 but it is better if you start to inspect them 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.550
 it is necessary to determine 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.550
 which places are the best for 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.679
 scuffs and now reveal the secret if 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.559
 jeans from the inside are light torn edges and 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.429
 contrasting scuffs 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.469
 dark blue fabric color from the inside 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.320
 assumes only perforation without 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.059
 protruding threads tear and wipe 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.309
 jeans need on the ground where they can 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.879
 tear naturally for example on 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.249
 knees 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.079
 However, do not get carried away too voluminous 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:01.309
 cuts can turn pants into shorts and 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.899
 scuffs can be done on pockets 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.300
 this is most easily achieved by 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.909
 rough file or sandpaper 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.229
 pull the fabric over your finger and wipe until 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.210
 partial or full perforation to 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.329
 make a cut for example on your knees inward 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.619
 Trousers place a solid base. 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.130
 mark the number of cuts and their 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.130
 magnitude 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.030
 cut the fabric with a stationery knife 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.670
 Now we will pull out the warp threads 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.159
 so that weft threads are weak and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.289
 light at this stage all threads can 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.200
 generally cut to remain open 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.490
 perforation 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.619
 now you need to make the edges more 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.810
 natural for this process them 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.689
 nail file or float on this principle 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.079
 you can make scuffs and holes different 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.090
 magnitudes 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:52.250
 at all times daring style mix wali with 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.850
 the most varied including classic 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 things 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.619
 boats or loose jackets so 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.060
 sure rest ass torn jeans not 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.060
 stop being fashionable
