00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
and then here is the bronzer now as you

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.979 
and then here is the bronzer now as you
can<00:03:48.730> see<00:03:48.790> there<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.209> bit<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.540> shimmer<00:03:49.720> but

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
can see there is a bit of shimmer but

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.590 
can see there is a bit of shimmer but
nothing<00:03:50.380> overpowering<00:03:51.130> on<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:52.030> first<00:03:52.269> swatch

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
nothing overpowering on the first swatch

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.259 
nothing overpowering on the first swatch
there<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:52.989> very<00:03:53.350> heavily<00:03:53.799> swatched<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:55.180> you

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
there is very heavily swatched so you

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.020 
there is very heavily swatched so you
can<00:03:55.420> get<00:03:55.540> an<00:03:55.660> idea<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:56.489> there's<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.580> bit<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.760> red

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
can get an idea of there's a bit of red

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.330 
can get an idea of there's a bit of red
to<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:59.530> again<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.920> reacts<00:04:00.190> to

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
to that but again it reacts to

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.600 
to that but again it reacts to
everyone's<00:04:00.730> pH<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:02.160> it'll<00:04:03.160> look<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.459> bit

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
everyone's pH so it'll look a bit

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.039 
everyone's pH so it'll look a bit
different<00:04:03.640> on<00:04:04.030> everyone<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.690> then<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
different on everyone and then the

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.289 
different on everyone and then the
second<00:04:05.470> swatch<00:04:05.680> there<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:06.400> more<00:04:06.640> of<00:04:07.150> a

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
second swatch there is just more of a

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.090 
second swatch there is just more of a
light<00:04:07.480> swatch<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.170> can<00:04:08.380> see<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:09.070> can

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
light swatch so you can see you can

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.150 
light swatch so you can see you can
definitely<00:04:09.400> share<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:09.940> out<00:04:10.920> but<00:04:11.920> I<00:04:11.950> would
