00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:25.620 
controller so batteries they are the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
age but which which double-a battery

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.040 
age but which which double-a battery
rechargeable<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> best<00:00:39.180> well

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
rechargeable is really the best well

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.040 
rechargeable is really the best well
let's<00:00:40.440> begin<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.400> analyze<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.540> question

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
let's begin and analyze this question

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.670 
let's begin and analyze this question
first<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.220> you're<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> very<00:00:44.910> very<00:00:45.680> very

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
first off if you're a very very very

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610 
first off if you're a very very very
passive<00:00:47.310> gamer<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.329> use<00:00:48.660> an<00:00:48.930> Xbox<00:00:49.200> one

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
passive gamer and you use an Xbox one

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
passive gamer and you use an Xbox one
controller<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.309> would<00:00:50.640> strongly<00:00:50.910> suggest<00:00:51.270> just

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
controller I would strongly suggest just

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.069 
controller I would strongly suggest just
using<00:00:52.700> consumable<00:00:53.700> batteries<00:00:54.149> these<00:00:54.630> are<00:00:54.809> not

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
using consumable batteries these are not

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.160 
using consumable batteries these are not
rechargeable<00:00:55.829> okay<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.149> means<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
rechargeable okay so that means you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.350 
rechargeable okay so that means you
can't<00:00:58.530> charge<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.430> obviously<00:00:59.670> I'm

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
can't charge them obviously I'm

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.200 
can't charge them obviously I'm
emphasizing<00:01:00.920> because<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.370> stick<00:01:02.700> them<00:01:02.879> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
emphasizing because you do stick them in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.410 
emphasizing because you do stick them in
a<00:01:03.450> charger<00:01:03.870> whoo<00:01:04.820> stick<00:01:05.820> them<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> charger

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
a charger whoo stick them in a charger

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.080 
a charger whoo stick them in a charger
like<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.920> they<00:01:07.920> might<00:01:08.130> explode<00:01:08.549> catch<00:01:08.909> on

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
like this they might explode catch on

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.999 
like this they might explode catch on
fire<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.899> kinds<00:01:10.259> of<00:01:10.319> bad<00:01:10.439> things<00:01:10.649> there's

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
fire and all kinds of bad things there's

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.090 
fire and all kinds of bad things there's
acids<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.299> things<00:01:12.509> like<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.749> in

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
acids in here and things like that in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.260 
acids in here and things like that in
alkaline<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.429> don't<00:01:14.609> want<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.939> stuff

batteries you're risking possible

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.050 
batteries you're risking possible
explosion<00:01:36.499> possible<00:01:37.499> fire<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.189> lower

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
your batteries so having said that this

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
your batteries so having said that this
is<00:01:43.799> best<00:01:44.009> for<00:01:44.249> devices<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> you're<00:01:45.029> just<00:01:45.359> not

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
is best for devices that you're just not

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.129 
is best for devices that you're just not
going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:47.159> almost<00:01:48.090> ever<00:01:48.419> if<00:01:48.959> you

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
going to use like almost ever if you

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.109 
going to use like almost ever if you
have<00:01:49.169> a<00:01:49.289> secondary<00:01:49.829> controller<00:01:50.340> these<00:01:50.939> would

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
have a secondary controller these would

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.580 
have a secondary controller these would
be<00:01:51.240> pretty<00:01:51.450> good<00:01:51.599> for<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.380> can't

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
be pretty good for it but you can't

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.919 
be pretty good for it but you can't
leave<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.889> batteries<00:01:53.279> in<00:01:53.459> for<00:01:54.090> too<00:01:54.270> long<00:01:54.539> so

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
leave the batteries in for too long so

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.169 
leave the batteries in for too long so
if<00:01:55.289> you<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:55.919> use<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.999> couple

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
if you don't use it for like a couple

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.419 
if you don't use it for like a couple
months<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.810> least<00:01:58.200> turn<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.740> mess<00:01:59.249> around

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
months at least turn it on mess around

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.339 
months at least turn it on mess around
with<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.149> turn<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
with it and then turn it off because you

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.499 
with it and then turn it off because you
don't<00:02:01.529> want<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.770> batteries<00:02:02.249> leaking<00:02:02.819> now

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
don't want the batteries leaking now

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.869 
as it claims to be it starts to die off
pretty<00:02:45.359> quickly<00:02:45.900> all<00:02:46.650> things<00:02:47.129> considered

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
pretty quickly all things considered

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.449 
pretty quickly all things considered
now<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.599> have<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> non<00:02:49.319> name-brand<00:02:49.920> battery

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
now I have a non name-brand battery

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.270 
now I have a non name-brand battery
right<00:02:50.730> here<00:02:50.790> not<00:02:51.569> really<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.500> it's<00:02:52.889> name-brand

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
right here not really if it's name-brand

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.990 
right here not really if it's name-brand
then<00:02:53.700> maybe<00:02:54.329> I'm<00:02:54.569> an<00:02:54.720> idiot<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.639> can<00:02:56.819> see

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
then maybe I'm an idiot but you can see

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.869 
then maybe I'm an idiot but you can see
that<00:02:57.299> this<00:02:57.510> one<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.260> much<00:02:58.739> higher<00:02:59.189> one<00:02:59.639> and

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
that this one is a much higher one and

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.479 
that this one is a much higher one and
it<00:03:00.299> says<00:03:01.280> 2900<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:03.120> rating<00:03:03.590> where<00:03:04.590> again<00:03:05.159> I

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
it says 2900 on the rating where again I

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.599 
it says 2900 on the rating where again I
have<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:06.090> say<00:03:06.299> that's<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.689> bit<00:03:06.930> disingenuous

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
have to say that's a bit disingenuous

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.629 
have to say that's a bit disingenuous
because<00:03:08.609> it's<00:03:08.790> not<00:03:09.139> 2,900<00:03:10.139> on<00:03:10.319> it's<00:03:11.189> really

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
because it's not 2,900 on it's really

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.409 
because it's not 2,900 on it's really
not<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:12.919> I'll<00:03:13.919> get<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.790> later<00:03:14.939> and

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
not it I'll get to that later and

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.219 
not it I'll get to that later and
finally<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:16.470> have<00:03:16.680> n<00:03:16.980> loop<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:18.389> bad<00:03:18.989> boy

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
finally we have n loop this bad boy

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.670 
finally we have n loop this bad boy
right<00:03:19.260> here<00:03:19.949> is<00:03:20.069> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.239> Sanyo<00:03:21.599> variety<00:03:22.500> and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
rating the minimum is 1900 but it's just

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.349 
rating the minimum is 1900 but it's just
dependent<00:03:36.449> on<00:03:37.370> how<00:03:38.370> many<00:03:38.430> times<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.000> charge

dependent on how many times you charge
it<00:03:39.629> versus<00:03:40.790> killing<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.120> lifespan<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:42.989> so
