going to want to cut a little larger

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.129 
going to want to cut a little larger
than<00:01:55.709> the<00:01:56.100> circle<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.179> and<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.129 --> 00:01:58.139 
than the circle actually is and one of

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:01.730 
than the circle actually is and one of
them<00:01:58.319> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.560> smaller<00:01:59.149> like<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.929> now

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
them a little smaller like this so now

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.910 
them a little smaller like this so now
one<00:02:02.369> should<00:02:02.880> fit<00:02:03.270> inside<00:02:03.450> there<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.649> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
one should fit inside there like this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.129 
one should fit inside there like this
and<00:02:05.310> they're<00:02:06.179> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> want<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.779> hot<00:02:07.109> glue

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.139 
and they're going to want to hot glue

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.010 
and they're going to want to hot glue
them<00:02:07.560> together<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.429> now<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:09.450> should<00:02:09.690> look

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
them together so now it should look

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.320 
them together so now it should look
something<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.300> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
something like this for you have a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.010 
something like this for you have a
smaller<00:02:12.780> circle

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
smaller circle

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.900 
smaller circle
so<00:02:15.170> now<00:02:15.350> you're<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.980> want<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.250> glue<00:02:16.610> your

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
so now you're going to want to glue your

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.230 
so now you're going to want to glue your
other<00:02:17.300> bead<00:02:17.690> on<00:02:17.930> top<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.070> center<00:02:19.490> so<00:02:20.030> now

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
other bead on top in the center so now

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.480 
other bead on top in the center so now
it<00:02:20.600> should<00:02:20.870> fit<00:02:21.170> on<00:02:21.350> top<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.800> there<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
it should fit on top of there and the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.790 
it should fit on top of there and the
smaller<00:02:22.790> circle<00:02:23.330> should<00:02:23.660> help<00:02:23.930> hold<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.530> in

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
smaller circle should help hold it in
