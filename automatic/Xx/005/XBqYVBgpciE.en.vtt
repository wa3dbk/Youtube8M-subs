in<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:03.959> video<00:00:04.230> I'm<00:00:04.319> demonstrating<00:00:04.529> some<00:00:05.069> of

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
in this video I'm demonstrating some of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.530 
in this video I'm demonstrating some of
the<00:00:05.220> new<00:00:05.339> motion<00:00:05.640> capture<00:00:06.029> tools<00:00:06.210> we've<00:00:06.420> been

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
the new motion capture tools we've been

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.100 
the new motion capture tools we've been
developing<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.200> enable<00:00:08.210> management<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.450> live

developing the enable management of live

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.620 
developing the enable management of live
motion<00:00:10.469> capture<00:00:10.769> streams<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
motion capture streams so in this on the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.690 
motion capture streams so in this on the
right<00:00:12.750> hand<00:00:12.929> side<00:00:13.019> here<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:13.700> natural

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
right hand side here I have natural

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.180 
right hand side here I have natural
points<00:00:15.120> arena<00:00:15.960> software<00:00:16.470> which<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.890> be<00:00:17.010> used

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
points arena software which can be used

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.730 
points arena software which can be used
to<00:00:17.310> simulate<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:18.359> motion<00:00:19.109> capture<00:00:19.199> session

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
to simulate a motion capture session

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.550 
to simulate a motion capture session
this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.970> playing<00:00:21.720> back<00:00:21.960> recorded<00:00:21.990> data

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
this is just playing back recorded data

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.590 
this is just playing back recorded data
from<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.859> previous<00:00:23.070> motion<00:00:23.970> capture<00:00:24.269> session

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
from a previous motion capture session

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.310 
from a previous motion capture session
and<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.840> streaming<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.019> over<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
and it's it's a streaming it over a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.669 
and it's it's a streaming it over a
network<00:00:29.130> port<00:00:29.570> on<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.810> left<00:00:30.960> hand<00:00:31.140> side<00:00:31.470> here

network port on the left hand side here

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.120 
network port on the left hand side here
I've<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.520> fabric<00:00:33.030> application<00:00:33.630> which<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
I've got a fabric application which is

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.680 
I've got a fabric application which is
connected<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.399> live<00:00:35.730> arena<00:00:36.149> stream<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
connected to that live arena stream and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.660 
connected to that live arena stream and
it's<00:00:37.140> showing<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.469> character<00:00:37.890> retyping<00:00:38.399> that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it's showing a character retyping that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.450 
it's showing a character retyping that
motion<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> fly<00:00:41.180> onto<00:00:42.180> its<00:00:42.570> own<00:00:42.719> skeleton<00:00:43.460> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
motion on a fly onto its own skeleton so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
motion on a fly onto its own skeleton so
I<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.180> wanted<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> show<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> bit<00:00:45.960> more

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
I just wanted to show you the bit more

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.840 
I just wanted to show you the bit more
about<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.500> motion<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.520> scrub<00:00:47.700> through

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
about this motion I can scrub through

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.299 
about this motion I can scrub through
town<00:00:48.120> time<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> any<00:00:49.620> point<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.129> of

assisting<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.409> system<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> fabric<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
assisting a system and fabric is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.570 
assisting a system and fabric is
actually<00:01:05.729> doing<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.930> dynamic<00:01:07.260> pose<00:01:08.040> adjustment

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
actually doing a dynamic pose adjustment

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.679 
actually doing a dynamic pose adjustment
to<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.820> sure<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> character<00:01:09.479> actually

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to make sure that the character actually

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.380 
to make sure that the character actually
fits<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> pose<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> come

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
fits the pose so I just want to come

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.850 
fits the pose so I just want to come
over<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.140> pull<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.650> bit

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
over here and pull it out a little bit

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
over here and pull it out a little bit
and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.340> want<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.549> show<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:17.939> show<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and I want to show you some show the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.210 
and I want to show you some show the
skeleton<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> skeleton<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.040> my

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
skeleton so this is the skeleton of my

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
skeleton so this is the skeleton of my
character<00:01:20.670> ignore<00:01:21.210> these<00:01:21.360> floating<00:01:22.080> points

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
character ignore these floating points

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.280 
character ignore these floating points
here<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.520> face<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.570> toe<00:01:24.810> bones<00:01:25.049> that

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
here there are face and toe bones that

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.670 
here there are face and toe bones that
weren't<00:01:25.470> using<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.860> enveloping<00:01:27.409> if<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.530> turn

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
weren't using the enveloping if I turn

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.640 
weren't using the enveloping if I turn
off<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.979> skeleton<00:01:29.430> show<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> debugging

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
off the skeleton show bit of debugging

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
off the skeleton show bit of debugging
what<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> want<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> show<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.369> some<00:01:33.060> aspects

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
what I want to show now is some aspects

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.969 
what I want to show now is some aspects
of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> retargeting<00:01:34.020> which<00:01:34.380> basically

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
of the retargeting which basically

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.640 
of the retargeting which basically
enabled<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.460> system<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.990> work<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.470> enable

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
enabled this system to to work to enable

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
enabled this system to to work to enable
that<00:01:38.040> runtime<00:01:38.820> fitting<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.750> motion<00:01:40.079> capture

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that runtime fitting of motion capture

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.510 
that runtime fitting of motion capture
data<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.600> works<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
data so how it works is this is kind of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.480 
data so how it works is this is kind of
a<00:01:44.610> traditional<00:01:45.079> rig<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.290> has<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.860> cake

angle<00:01:57.180> values<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.829> system<00:01:59.040> does<00:01:59.250> is

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
angle values so what this system does is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
angle values so what this system does is
dynamically<00:02:00.659> blends<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.469> arms<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.890> legs

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
dynamically blends the arms and legs

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.359 
dynamically blends the arms and legs

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.150 
this incoming data so in this first pose
the<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.060> legs<00:02:09.300> are<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.539> AI<00:02:09.660> K<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.470> fetus

now as we come through the motion

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.590 
now as we come through the motion
there's<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.370> point<00:02:26.610> here<00:02:26.670> where<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.180> right

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
hand drops down and touches the ground

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820

and during that action our character

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
and during that action our character
blends<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:32.430> hand<00:02:32.670> from<00:02:32.850> okay<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.300> FK

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
blends the right hand from okay to FK

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.560 
blends the right hand from okay to FK
and<00:02:33.990> at<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> same<00:02:34.710> time<00:02:34.920> we<00:02:35.040> also<00:02:35.190> introduce<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
sort of our retargeting operator also

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.850 
sort of our retargeting operator also

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
modifies the Pope posture of his torso

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.500 
modifies the Pope posture of his torso
so<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.280> his<00:02:41.520> right<00:02:41.700> hand<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.030> actually<00:02:42.360> meet

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so that his right hand can actually meet

so that his right hand can actually meet
match<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.350> pose<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:44.700> he<00:02:44.850> stands<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.300> again

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.560

okay the point where he stands out as he

he lets it as he moves it up it sort of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.100 
he lets it as he moves it up it sort of
releases<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.430> constraint<00:02:59.910> as<00:03:00.210> how<00:03:00.570> I'm<00:03:00.900> goes

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
releases that constraint as how I'm goes

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.110 
releases that constraint as how I'm goes
back<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.470> natural<00:03:01.770> pose<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.640> idea<00:03:03.000> is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
back to a natural pose so the idea is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.090 
back to a natural pose so the idea is
that<00:03:03.270> as<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.690> hands<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.050> feet<00:03:04.290> or<00:03:04.530> any<00:03:04.920> other

and<00:03:15.720> off<00:03:15.780> at<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.350> moment<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.800> only

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
and off at the moment we can only

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.710 
and off at the moment we can only

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
constrain the pelvis chest hands and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.630 
constrain the pelvis chest hands and
feet<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.680> eventually<00:03:19.860> we<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.280> really

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
feet but eventually we can really

feet but eventually we can really
constrain<00:03:21.300> anything<00:03:21.630> we<00:03:21.720> could<00:03:22.200> do<00:03:22.740> dynamic

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
constrain anything we could do dynamic

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.300 
constrain anything we could do dynamic
head<00:03:23.520> constraints<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.180> any<00:03:24.540> constraints<00:03:25.310> so

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
head constraints and any constraints so

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.070 
head constraints and any constraints so
I'm<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.120> playing<00:03:27.600> back<00:03:27.810> through<00:03:27.990> this

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
I'm just playing back through this

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.290 
I'm just playing back through this
motion<00:03:28.440> again<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.880> doing<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.150> bit<00:03:30.270> of

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
motion again it is doing a bit of

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.940 
motion again it is doing a bit of
setting<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:30.990> actually<00:03:31.230> go<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.680> point

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
setting and I can actually go to a point

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.800 
setting and I can actually go to a point
in<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.160> motion<00:03:32.459> turn<00:03:32.730> off<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.209> fitting<00:03:33.420> just

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
in the motion turn off the fitting just

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.240 
in the motion turn off the fitting just
to<00:03:33.900> show<00:03:34.110> what<00:03:34.320> happens<00:03:34.770> without<00:03:35.070> this

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
to show what happens without this

to show what happens without this
retargeting<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.600> I'm<00:03:36.660> going<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> scroll<00:03:37.050> down

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
all the solvers applied so we can see

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.690 
all the solvers applied so we can see
there's<00:03:45.620> humanoid<00:03:46.620> legs<00:03:46.860> over<00:03:47.220> right<00:03:47.370> here

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
there's humanoid legs over right here

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.770 
there's humanoid legs over right here
humanoid<00:03:48.180> amasova

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
humanoid amasova

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.420 
humanoid amasova
and<00:03:48.930> then<00:03:49.530> what<00:03:49.680> follows<00:03:49.830> them<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
and then what follows them is the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.040 
and then what follows them is the
full-body<00:03:50.820> retargeting<00:03:51.239> solver<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.810> it's<00:03:51.959> an

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
full-body retargeting solver and it's an

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.170 
full-body retargeting solver and it's an
iterative<00:03:52.320> solver<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.520> can<00:03:53.670> come<00:03:53.820> back<00:03:53.970> down

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
iterative solver so I can come back down

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.050 
iterative solver so I can come back down
you<00:03:54.360> set<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.080> iteration<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.890> zero<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.940> what

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
you set the iteration to zero and what

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.640 
you set the iteration to zero and what
that<00:03:57.180> means<00:03:57.330> is<00:03:57.480> we're<00:03:57.660> still<00:03:57.870> doing<00:03:58.410> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
that means is we're still doing the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.530 
that means is we're still doing the
dynamic<00:03:59.160> blending<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.150> KN<00:04:00.420> FK<00:04:01.130> but<00:04:02.390> it's<00:04:03.390> not

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
dynamic blending of I KN FK but it's not

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.979 
dynamic blending of I KN FK but it's not
doing<00:04:03.780> actually<00:04:04.020> any<00:04:04.140> system<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.860> data<00:04:05.040> so

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
doing actually any system of the data so

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.580 
doing actually any system of the data so
his<00:04:06.989> legs<00:04:07.260> are<00:04:07.530> too<00:04:07.830> long<00:04:08.520> here<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.380> data

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
his legs are too long here for the data

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.680 
his legs are too long here for the data
so<00:04:10.890> his<00:04:11.130> he's<00:04:11.520> kind<00:04:11.820> of<00:04:11.850> squatting<00:04:12.300> down<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.480> bit

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
so his he's kind of squatting down a bit

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.140 
so his he's kind of squatting down a bit
which<00:04:12.810> doesn't<00:04:13.110> look<00:04:13.170> very<00:04:13.230> good<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.670> if<00:04:15.000> we

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
which doesn't look very good and if we

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.940 
which doesn't look very good and if we
scroll<00:04:15.420> through<00:04:15.480> time<00:04:15.900> whenever<00:04:16.530> he<00:04:16.590> does<00:04:16.770> in

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
scroll through time whenever he does in

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.610 
scroll through time whenever he does in
more<00:04:17.250> complex<00:04:17.549> actions<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.959> arms<00:04:19.200> may<00:04:19.350> not

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
more complex actions the arms may not

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.180 
more complex actions the arms may not
reach<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.070> target<00:04:20.430> or<00:04:20.549> they<00:04:20.700> may

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
reach the target or they may

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.890 
reach the target or they may
might<00:04:21.280> be<00:04:21.400> too<00:04:21.549> close<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.120> if<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.630> go<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.810> that

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
might be too close so if I go to that

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.130 
might be too close so if I go to that
point<00:04:23.260> where<00:04:23.380> he<00:04:23.440> goes<00:04:24.010> onto<00:04:24.520> us<00:04:25.020> onto<00:04:26.020> his

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
point where he goes onto us onto his

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.010 
point where he goes onto us onto his
arms<00:04:26.470> in<00:04:26.830> this<00:04:27.550> case<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.660> legs<00:04:28.840> look<00:04:28.990> fine

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
arms in this case the legs look fine

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.430 
arms in this case the legs look fine
because<00:04:29.320> they<00:04:29.470> blended<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.890> FK<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:32.020> arms

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
because they blended to FK but the arms

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.200 
because they blended to FK but the arms
Timms<00:04:32.710> look<00:04:32.890> bad<00:04:33.100> because<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:34.000> head<00:04:34.180> is

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
Timms look bad because the head is

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.520 
Timms look bad because the head is
pushing<00:04:34.570> into<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.750> ground<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.260> then<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
pushing into the ground and then the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.710 
pushing into the ground and then the
elbows<00:04:35.800> are<00:04:35.830> pushing<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:36.250> so<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.730> can<00:04:37.360> this<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.690> a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
elbows are pushing it so I can this is a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.210 
elbows are pushing it so I can this is a
good<00:04:37.870> point<00:04:38.080> to<00:04:38.200> highlight<00:04:38.440> what<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.160> eye

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
good point to highlight what the eye

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.150 
good point to highlight what the eye
retargeting<00:04:40.180> solver<00:04:40.510> does<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:41.140> sit<00:04:41.800> up<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:42.040> one

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
retargeting solver does I sit up to one

retargeting solver does I sit up to one
Inspirations<00:04:42.730> has<00:04:42.850> kind<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.090> done<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.300> little

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
Inspirations has kind of done a little

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.940 
Inspirations has kind of done a little
bit<00:04:43.630> of<00:04:43.690> effects<00:04:44.050> up<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:46.290> three<00:04:47.290> so<00:04:47.680> now<00:04:47.830> I've

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
bit of effects up to three so now I've

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.260 
bit of effects up to three so now I've
got<00:04:48.100> three<00:04:48.310> iterations<00:04:48.520> in<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:48.910> silver<00:04:49.240> and

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
got three iterations in the silver and

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.760 
got three iterations in the silver and
it's<00:04:49.450> starting<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.930> look<00:04:50.050> pretty<00:04:50.200> good<00:04:50.320> I<00:04:50.650> can

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
it's starting to look pretty good I can

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.800 
it's starting to look pretty good I can
get<00:04:50.890> straight<00:04:51.070> up<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:51.280> five<00:04:51.490> five<00:04:52.360> is<00:04:52.510> already

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
get straight up to five five is already

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.140 
get straight up to five five is already
looking<00:04:52.930> pretty<00:04:53.200> good<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:54.040> I<00:04:54.640> headed<00:04:54.790> up<00:04:54.910> ten

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
looking pretty good so I headed up ten

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.780 
looking pretty good so I headed up ten
earlier<00:04:55.510> which<00:04:56.320> does<00:04:56.590> is<00:04:56.710> sort<00:04:56.830> of<00:04:56.920> pretty

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
earlier which does is sort of pretty

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.820 
earlier which does is sort of pretty
accurate<00:04:58.300> constraint<00:04:58.720> which<00:04:58.930> now<00:04:59.350> we<00:04:59.410> can<00:04:59.650> see

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
accurate constraint which now we can see

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.560 
accurate constraint which now we can see
that<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.340> arm<00:05:00.460> is<00:05:00.640> resting<00:05:01.150> on<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.450> ground

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
that the arm is resting on the ground

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.960 
that the arm is resting on the ground
accurately<00:05:02.110> it's<00:05:02.590> pushed<00:05:02.890> the<00:05:03.490> chest<00:05:03.760> up

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
accurately it's pushed the chest up

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.510 
accurately it's pushed the chest up
enough<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.080> shoulders<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.830> elbows<00:05:06.130> now

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
enough that the shoulders the elbows now

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.100 
enough that the shoulders the elbows now
not<00:05:07.090> pushing<00:05:07.540> of<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.690> ground<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:09.990> what<00:05:10.990> it's

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
not pushing of the ground and what it's

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.420 
not pushing of the ground and what it's
so<00:05:11.410> we<00:05:11.530> can<00:05:11.560> look<00:05:11.770> at<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:11.920> characters<00:05:12.250> pose<00:05:12.400> a

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
so we can look at the characters pose a

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.150 
so we can look at the characters pose a
little<00:05:12.790> bit<00:05:13.170> it<00:05:14.170> would<00:05:14.260> have<00:05:14.380> posted<00:05:14.680> push<00:05:15.010> the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
little bit it would have posted push the

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.100 
little bit it would have posted push the
chest<00:05:15.400> to<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.610> side<00:05:15.790> a<00:05:15.820> little<00:05:15.910> bit<00:05:16.120> go<00:05:16.930> back

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
chest to the side a little bit go back

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.110 
chest to the side a little bit go back
to<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.620> first<00:05:18.040> one<00:05:18.190> and<00:05:18.250> then<00:05:18.460> go<00:05:18.610> back<00:05:18.760> to<00:05:18.790> ten

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
to the first one and then go back to ten

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.970 
to the first one and then go back to ten
so<00:05:19.990> it<00:05:20.020> has<00:05:20.230> changed<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.620> pose<00:05:20.800> of<00:05:20.830> the

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
so it has changed the pose of the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.770 
so it has changed the pose of the
character<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.340> little<00:05:21.400> bit<00:05:21.580> but<00:05:22.270> due<00:05:22.600> to<00:05:22.630> the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
character a little bit but due to the

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.940 
character a little bit but due to the
fact<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:23.080> these<00:05:23.200> constraints<00:05:23.710> blend

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
fact that these constraints blend

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.640 
fact that these constraints blend
themselves<00:05:24.130> on<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.640> off<00:05:24.730> fairly<00:05:25.720> smoothly<00:05:26.110> we

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
themselves on and off fairly smoothly we

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.840 
themselves on and off fairly smoothly we
actually<00:05:26.919> don't<00:05:27.040> really<00:05:27.190> we<00:05:27.550> don't<00:05:27.669> notice

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
actually don't really we don't notice

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:37.610 
actually don't really we don't notice
that<00:05:28.090> change<00:05:28.870> in<00:05:28.990> motion<00:05:29.169> too<00:05:29.440> much

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.620 

so<00:05:38.160> this<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.700> full<00:05:38.910> body<00:05:39.030> retargeting

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
so this this full body retargeting

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.360 
so this this full body retargeting
server<00:05:39.810> enables<00:05:40.230> us<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.380> use<00:05:40.680> animation<00:05:41.250> data

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
server enables us to use animation data

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.500 
server enables us to use animation data
from<00:05:41.640> one<00:05:41.760> character<00:05:42.180> on<00:05:42.210> another

from one character on another

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.060 
from one character on another
effectively<00:05:43.200> that's<00:05:43.440> what<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:43.680> is<00:05:43.740> is<00:05:43.950> the

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
effectively that's what it is is the

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.860 
effectively that's what it is is the

system of transferring skeletal data

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.780 
system of transferring skeletal data

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
from a source skeleton to a target

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.070 
from a source skeleton to a target
skeleton<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.390> doing<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:48.690> fitting<00:05:48.870> in<00:05:49.050> that

skeleton and doing a fitting in that

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.960 
skeleton and doing a fitting in that
process<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.800> can<00:05:50.250> just<00:05:50.400> quickly<00:05:50.550> show<00:05:50.850> you<00:05:50.880> the

docking<00:05:54.690> isn't<00:05:54.930> all<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.110> useful<00:05:55.560> in<00:05:55.680> them

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
docking isn't all that useful in them

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.890 
docking isn't all that useful in them
zoom<00:05:58.650> in<00:05:58.800> here<00:05:59.100> and<00:05:59.400> this<00:06:00.360> is<00:06:00.510> these<00:06:00.720> are<00:06:00.780> the

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
zoom in here and this is these are the

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.010 
zoom in here and this is these are the
solvers<00:06:01.290> applied<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.890> my<00:06:02.310> character<00:06:03.030> and

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
solvers applied to my character and

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.660 
solvers applied to my character and
these<00:06:04.230> these<00:06:04.830> are<00:06:04.890> what's<00:06:05.190> called<00:06:05.310> inversion

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
these these are what's called inversion

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.530 
these these are what's called inversion
solvers

solvers

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.690

so inverters are used to transfer the

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.280 
so inverters are used to transfer the
motion<00:06:09.000> from<00:06:09.120> one<00:06:09.210> character<00:06:09.690> to<00:06:09.810> another<00:06:09.930> and

motion from one character to another and

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.230 
motion from one character to another and
the<00:06:10.740> solver<00:06:11.070> here<00:06:11.280> is<00:06:11.370> used<00:06:11.610> in<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.910> fitting

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
the solver here is used in the fitting

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.640 
the solver here is used in the fitting
of<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.420> motion<00:06:12.720> directly<00:06:13.050> on<00:06:13.140> the<00:06:13.290> character

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
of a motion directly on the character

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.860 
of a motion directly on the character
and<00:06:14.640> a<00:06:14.730> look<00:06:14.880> at<00:06:14.970> the<00:06:15.030> dependency<00:06:15.450> graph<00:06:15.480> which

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
and a look at the dependency graph which

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.800 
and a look at the dependency graph which

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
is the underlying operator graph that's
