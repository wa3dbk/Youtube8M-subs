00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.220
 hello girls i hope you 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.600
 I'll find you today 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.010
 in a new video I you 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.420
 will show the tutorial in the lah ironing 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.320
 summer since I will go back 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.670
 slices of watermelon 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.020
 in this video I showed you two 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.250
 techniques to achieve it like that 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.510
 you can choose the method with 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.950
 which you are most comfortable with 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.910
 I hope this little tutorial goes my father 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.600
 and I find you as usual 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.600
 at the end of the video 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.140
 so hardware side I used a 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.359
 base and a top coat a nail polish 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.129
 reverse fuchsia and a white of the 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.409
 black acrylic paint a fine brush 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.079
 a nail art nail stencil has 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.399
 french and a palette 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.600
 I start as always by applying 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.739
 my base and that he is often very 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.000
 many to ask me if it takes 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.469
 absolutely from the base also we can 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.699
 put top coat instead but not 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.229
 you really need the base that goes 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.789
 protect your nail from the pigment of 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.460
 polish after you have polishes that 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.960
 base and hop count two in one 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.129
 will then put a final fuchsia 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.330
 two layers especially the nails to 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.119
 the exception of the thumbs that I'm going 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.350
 to varnish with glass I then clean the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.549
 outlines in there by on a flat 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.140
 nineteen ticket and I'm going 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.409
 let my varnish dry ten or so 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.409
 minutes 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 have passionate lured I show you the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.220
 first method with stencils has 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.840
 french and for this technique you have to 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.040
 that the base is dry and I want 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.630
 come and stick it on my fingernail 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.250
 I will put the video on the french 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 annotations manicure if that you 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.619
 interested 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 I then apply the green polish you 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.830
 can overtake on paper without 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 problem and without waiting i'm going 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.200
 gently remove the sticker using 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.430
 a forceps 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680
 I find it more convenient but 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 you can also do without I take 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.500
 then a fine brush and varnish 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.450
 white and I will come traced the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 delimitation between fuchsia and green 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.300
 working with the tip of the brush 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.800
 and without crushing I then take a 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.630
 green polish a little lighter and I'm going 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.100
 tap vertical lines on the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.729
 french to reproduce a little bit the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.729
 watermelon skin 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.270
 for glitches I preferred to use 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.770
 black acrylic paint but as 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.630
 always to study vernet if you 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.190
 prefer and I realized drops 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.049
 so for that I'm going to ask the tip of 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.489
 my brush and crush with the body of the 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.049
 brush and if the shape is not 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.000
 perfect you can redefine it with 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.160
 the tip of the brush for this reason I 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.250
 realized 6 bepan following the shape of the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.989
 french we move on to the second method is 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.459
 here no need for stencils since I have 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.140
 made two french freehand 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.549
 nested one and the other I start 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.410
 by doing the white french 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.730
 once it's dry about 5 to 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.500
 10 minutes I'll do the second 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.000
 towards a finer beginning than the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.920
 first so as to leave an end 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.060
 white edging once everything is dry 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.739
 I will come as just now 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.360
 tap lines with pastel green 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.799
 is actually the ideal is to do everything 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.390
 the french of all your nails like that 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.739
 you will not have the drying time and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.520
 you can go to the next step 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.590
 directly 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.120
 for glitches it's exactly like 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.170
 just now except here and chose to 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.060
 to do them a little bit everywhere and finally 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.620
 for the dust decided to replicate the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.330
 pattern of watermelon skin i 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.830
 so realized the same motive as on the 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.960
 french to know five or six lines 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.460
 parallel tapping with the brush 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.250
 to give this aspect a little bit 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.450
 blurred 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.920
 and now I have nothing left but 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.450
 apply a good coat of top coat 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.920
 especially since here I used the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.450
 acrylic paint that may leave 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.010
 to the water otherwise and if you want a 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.480
 little trick to keep your polish 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.190
 or other nail art little longer there 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.420
 just reapply a layer of top 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.650
 coat every day or both 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.650
 days to lengthen his outfit 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.150
