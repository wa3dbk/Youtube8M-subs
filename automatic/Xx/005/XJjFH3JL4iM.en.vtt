segment we're going to talk about how to
repel<00:00:05.190> negative<00:00:05.549> energy<00:00:06.649> now<00:00:07.649> there's<00:00:07.859> lots

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
repel negative energy now there's lots

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.370 
repel negative energy now there's lots
of<00:00:08.280> different<00:00:08.340> forms<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.540> negative<00:00:09.960> energy

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
of different forms of negative energy

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.200 
of different forms of negative energy
than<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> lot<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.830> different<00:00:11.130> definitions<00:00:11.309> but

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
than a lot of different definitions but

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.839 
than a lot of different definitions but
in<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.139> life<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.889> found<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.490> negative

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
in my life I have found that negative

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.570 
in my life I have found that negative
energy<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.650> anything<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.710> brings<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.310> down

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
energy is anything that brings you down

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.179 
energy is anything that brings you down
so<00:00:18.449> if<00:00:18.779> you're<00:00:18.810> having<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.380> good<00:00:19.560> day<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.100> you

so if you're having a good day and you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.070 
so if you're having a good day and you
get<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> phone<00:00:20.640> call<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.300> someone<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.900> not

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
being that nice to you that's negative

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.750 
being that nice to you that's negative
energy<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> tries<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.310> turn<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.670> around

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
energy and it tries to turn you around

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.150 
energy and it tries to turn you around

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
garden gargoyles are wonderful for

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.010 
garden gargoyles are wonderful for
warding<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.129> negative<00:00:50.670> energy<00:00:50.870> because<00:00:51.870> they

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
warding off negative energy because they

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.479 
warding off negative energy because they
have<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> history<00:00:52.590> there<00:00:52.739> around<00:00:52.949> churches

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
have a history there around churches

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.100 
have a history there around churches
because<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:53.820> ward<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.360> evil<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
because they ward off evil because the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
because they ward off evil because the
whole<00:00:55.260> thought<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> gargoyle<00:00:57.059> looks

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
whole thought is if a gargoyle looks

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.840 
whole thought is if a gargoyle looks
scary<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.800> negative<00:00:59.070> energy<00:00:59.430> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
scary then the negative energy will

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
scary then the negative energy will
leave<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.260> don't<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> works<00:01:01.920> or

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
leave and I don't know if it works or

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
leave and I don't know if it works or
not<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.030> kind<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> entertaining<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
not but it's kind of entertaining and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.219 
not but it's kind of entertaining and
fun<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.710> different<00:01:05.519> types<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.229> positive

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
fun to have different types of positive

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320 
fun to have different types of positive
energy<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:07.770> garden<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> wonderful

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
energy in your garden I have a wonderful

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
energy in your garden I have a wonderful
Hindu<00:01:09.869> goddess<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.650> garden<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.100> well<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
Hindu goddess in my garden as well and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
Hindu goddess in my garden as well and
she<00:01:12.119> has<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.479> parrot<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.229> her<00:01:13.439> shoulder

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
she has a little parrot on her shoulder

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
she has a little parrot on her shoulder
and<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:15.240> always<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.320> you've<00:01:16.500> got

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and I always think if you've got

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
and I always think if you've got
different<00:01:17.189> types<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.820> statues<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.479> your

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
different types of statues in your

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780 
different types of statues in your
garden<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.070> repel<00:01:20.610> negative

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
garden that you can also repel negative

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.120 
garden that you can also repel negative
energy<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:22.020> they're<00:01:22.470> very

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
energy just because they're very

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
energy just because they're very
positive<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.509> protect<00:01:24.869> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
positive and they can protect you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
positive and they can protect you
so<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.710> seems<00:01:25.979> silly<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.400> even<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.000> my

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
so it seems silly but even at my

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.840 
so it seems silly but even at my
entryway<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.590> either<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.009> Buddha<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
entryway I have either a Buddha or a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
entryway I have either a Buddha or a
Hindu<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.689> gargoyle<00:01:31.290> watching<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.159> every

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
Hindu or a gargoyle watching from every

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.359 
Hindu or a gargoyle watching from every
corner<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.000> repel<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> negative<00:01:34.079> energy<00:01:34.470> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
corner to repel the negative energy so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.010 
corner to repel the negative energy so
it's<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> whether<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.720> let<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it's up to you whether you let the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.140 
it's up to you whether you let the
negative<00:01:37.320> energy<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
negative energy get to you and it's just

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
negative energy get to you and it's just
like<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> psycho<00:01:39.810> ex-boyfriend<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> psycho

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
like a psycho ex-boyfriend or a psycho

like a psycho ex-boyfriend or a psycho
ex-girlfriend<00:01:41.540> if<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:42.960> seeing<00:01:43.259> them

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
ex-girlfriend if you keep seeing them
