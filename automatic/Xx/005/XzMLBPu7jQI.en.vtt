00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
different ways to go out and find those

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.880 
different ways to go out and find those
the<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.570> big<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.620> drive

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the one big way is to go out and drive

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.590 
the one big way is to go out and drive
neighborhoods<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.640> write<00:00:44.850> down<00:00:45.000> addresses

neighborhoods and write down addresses

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.750 
neighborhoods and write down addresses
so<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:45.930> step<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.469> step<00:00:47.070> number<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so that's step one step number two is

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.170 
so that's step one step number two is
you<00:00:47.969> look<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> owners<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.969> you
