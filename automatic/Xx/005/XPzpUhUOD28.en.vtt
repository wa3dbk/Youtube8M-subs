00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.580
 hello i am johan a sports coach 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.560
 we will see together the exercise of 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.930
 squat a great classic allowing for 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.419
 work the thighs and glutes 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.360
 in an intense way then this guy 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.920
 same place exercise and I'm going to spend 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.660
 my feet or little wider than the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.449
 pelvis oriented slightly towards 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.239
 the outside the goal being to get down to 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.660
 90 degrees I return the glutes far 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.580
 behind and going back I think of them 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.930
 contract by squeezing very hard in 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.460
 swinging the shoulders backwards 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.150
 in profile the position of my feet 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.379
 I send the glutes far behind and 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.940
 I still think about contracting them 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.699
 arrived up by blowing on my 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.650
 effort on this type of exercise you 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.110
 can start on three sets of 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.610
 to the petition for beginners in 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.740
 retaining at least one oil of 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.000
 recovery between series 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.299
 the goal is time to evolve over six 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.260
 series of 30 repetition 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.299
 small variant to increase the 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.470
 difficulty I'm going to add a beat 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.360
 low medium 2 and I always go by 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.920
 to be blown arriving at the time 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.920
 rocking one more shoulder 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.080
 backward think about that so I 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.950
 go down I do my beat for 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.240
 increase the stretch of my glutes and 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.580
 to contract them five are still 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.120
 more intense at the top I think to blow 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.760
 and his abs always instructions to 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.810
 security think especially to keep the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.510
 talents tackled on the ground 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.850
 when I go down for it 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.080
 sent the pelvis backwards 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.750
 secondly I think of my back always 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.570
 fixed I look at a point in front of the head 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.590
 well right I go back by tilting them 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.790
 shoulders back always in 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.060
 blowing back the buttocks away 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.240
 behind plated talent to the ground 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.240
 you
