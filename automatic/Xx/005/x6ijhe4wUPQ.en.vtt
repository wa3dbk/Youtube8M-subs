blender tutorial today I'm going to show
you<00:00:05.670> how<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.150> animate<00:00:06.750> these<00:00:07.350> rings<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:08.280> you

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
you how to animate these rings that you

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.890 
you how to animate these rings that you
see<00:00:08.670> right<00:00:08.910> here<00:00:09.440> using<00:00:10.440> only<00:00:10.759> one<00:00:11.759> MD<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.599> two

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
see right here using only one MD and two

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200 
see right here using only one MD and two
constraints<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.040> very<00:00:14.219> very<00:00:14.639> simple

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
constraints it's a very very simple

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.510 
constraints it's a very very simple
process<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.980> let's<00:00:16.980> get<00:00:17.250> into<00:00:17.580> it

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
process and let's get into it

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.670 
process and let's get into it
okay<00:00:20.520> first<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.720> I'm<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.350> create

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
okay first of all I'm going to create

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.460 
okay first of all I'm going to create
two<00:00:23.070> rings<00:00:23.689> to<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.820> add<00:00:26.820> one

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
two rings to do that I just add one

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.800 
two rings to do that I just add one
cylinder<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> make<00:00:29.640> sure<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.480> not

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
cylinder and make sure that it's not

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.889 
cylinder and make sure that it's not
filled<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.260> anything<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> set<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> cap<00:00:33.660> fill

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
filled with anything so I set a cap fill

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.670 
filled with anything so I set a cap fill
type<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.410> nothing<00:00:36.500> then<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> front<00:00:39.180> view

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
type to nothing then I go to front view

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.950 
type to nothing then I go to front view
autographic<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.070> scale<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> down<00:00:41.969> along<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
autographic and scale it down along the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.389 
autographic and scale it down along the
z-axis<00:00:44.660> until<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:48.590> it<00:00:49.590> tapped<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
z-axis until it's about so it tapped to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.020 
z-axis until it's about so it tapped to
enter<00:00:50.760> edit<00:00:51.149> mode<00:00:51.180> let's<00:00:52.110> go<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> front<00:00:52.770> view

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
enter edit mode let's go to front view

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.389 
enter edit mode let's go to front view
hit<00:00:54.030> e<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.660> extrude<00:00:54.770> but<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> don't<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
hit e to extrude but I don't want to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.720 
hit e to extrude but I don't want to
move<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.000> extrude<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.410> extruded<00:00:58.949> vertices

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
move the extrude the extruded vertices

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.380 
move the extrude the extruded vertices
right<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> hit<00:01:00.840> escape<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.329> instead<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
right now so I hit escape and instead I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
right now so I hit escape and instead I
want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> scare<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.589> s<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.860> hit<00:01:07.860> ctrl

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
want to scare them so s and hit ctrl

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.320 
want to scare them so s and hit ctrl
shift<00:01:08.610> Z<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.950> only<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.729> scale

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
shift Z so we are only going to scale

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.910 
shift Z so we are only going to scale
along<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> X<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.439> y<00:01:13.650> axis<00:01:15.409> let's<00:01:16.409> say<00:01:16.650> about

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
along the X and y axis let's say about

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.780 
along the X and y axis let's say about
so<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.509> tap<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.900> edit<00:01:19.110> mode<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
so and tap out of edit mode this is the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240 
so and tap out of edit mode this is the
ring<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.360> created<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
ring we have created right now and it

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.140 
ring we have created right now and it
could<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.970> bit<00:01:25.220> less<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.549> diameter

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
could be a little bit less in diameter

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.420 
could be a little bit less in diameter
so<00:01:27.600> scale<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.159> bit<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> z<00:01:30.329> axis<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
so scale again a bit on the z axis and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.760 
so scale again a bit on the z axis and
that<00:01:32.430> looks<00:01:32.670> okay<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> second<00:01:34.380> ring<00:01:34.560> I'm

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that looks okay for the second ring I'm

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
that looks okay for the second ring I'm
simply<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.790> hit<00:01:36.030> shift<00:01:37.670> D<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.210> duplicate

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
simply going to hit shift D to duplicate

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.889 
simply going to hit shift D to duplicate
it<00:01:40.310> leave<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> same<00:01:41.850> space<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.479> just

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it leave it in the same space and just

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.450 
it leave it in the same space and just
scale<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:50.040> have<00:01:50.430> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
scale it up about so just to have it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.910 
scale it up about so just to have it
organized<00:01:51.149> better<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.500> call<00:01:52.740> this

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
organized better I'm going to call this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:04.230 
organized better I'm going to call this
one<00:01:53.840> outer<00:01:55.219> ring<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:58.380> one<00:01:59.840> inner<00:02:01.219> ring

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.050 

now<00:02:05.240> we're<00:02:05.960> going<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:06.320> need<00:02:06.710> our<00:02:06.920> empty<00:02:07.640> so

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
now we're going to need our empty so

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.100 
now we're going to need our empty so
it's<00:02:08.330> shift<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.640> at<00:02:10.640> an<00:02:10.970> empty<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:13.840> let's<00:02:14.840> just

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
it's shift a at an empty and let's just

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.350 
it's shift a at an empty and let's just
move<00:02:15.379> it<00:02:15.620> up<00:02:16.580> there<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.060> doesn't<00:02:17.239> really

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
move it up there it doesn't really

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.030 
move it up there it doesn't really
matter<00:02:17.690> where<00:02:17.989> this<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.940> select<00:02:21.040> first

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
matter where this then we select first

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.729 
matter where this then we select first
ring<00:02:22.810> go<00:02:23.810> over<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.890> object<00:02:25.519> constraints

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
ring go over to the object constraints

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:34.920 
ring go over to the object constraints
select<00:02:27.739> copy<00:02:28.370> rotation<00:02:29.530> copy<00:02:30.530> from<00:02:31.040> empty<00:02:32.769> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
select copy rotation copy from empty and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.309 
select copy rotation copy from empty and
we<00:02:35.930> do<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.200> same<00:02:36.230> thing<00:02:36.799> for<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.489> second<00:02:37.880> ring

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
we do the same thing for the second ring

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.300 
we do the same thing for the second ring
copy<00:02:39.319> rotation<00:02:40.030> empty<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:41.480> we<00:02:41.660> want<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.310> let

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
copy rotation empty but we want to let

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.000 
copy rotation empty but we want to let
it<00:02:43.430> move<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.910> bit<00:02:44.150> differently<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:44.750> we<00:02:45.380> invert

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
it move a bit differently so we invert

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.289 
it move a bit differently so we invert
the<00:02:46.340> rotation<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.269> x-axis<00:02:48.400> now<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:50.090> we

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
the rotation on the x-axis now if we

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.430 
the rotation on the x-axis now if we
select<00:02:50.690> our<00:02:50.840> empty<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.500> rotate<00:02:53.200> we're<00:02:54.200> going

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
select our empty and rotate we're going

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.759 
select our empty and rotate we're going
to<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.860> those<00:02:55.310> rings<00:02:57.700> move<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.470> as<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.530> can

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
to see those rings move and as you can

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.759 
to see those rings move and as you can
see<00:03:01.150> they<00:03:02.150> move<00:03:02.360> against<00:03:02.840> each<00:03:03.019> other<00:03:03.319> on<00:03:03.620> the

see they move against each other on the

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.050 
see they move against each other on the
x-axis<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.239> they<00:03:05.900> will<00:03:06.140> move<00:03:06.670> exactly<00:03:07.670> with

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
x-axis and they will move exactly with

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.699 
x-axis and they will move exactly with
each<00:03:08.180> other<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.049> y<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:10.600> z<00:03:11.600> axis<00:03:14.709> that's

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
each other on the y and z axis that's

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.759 
each other on the y and z axis that's
basically<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.569> hope<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.079> was<00:03:18.319> helpful
