00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 hello everyone I bring you a hysteria that 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.670
 in caloto 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.940
 we are in extinction mode on the map 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 exodus the new dlc nemesis that comes out 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.630
 a few days ago for xbox one and good 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.220
 this hysteria that pretty simple we 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.590
 they give all the advantages also when 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.990
 we kill the cryptics an eye comes out that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
 represents that it is the neversoft logo and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 well, there are nine locations 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.929
 of these eyes there is a tiny eye that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.250
 we have to find and on xbox in 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.270
 this case we would do the X and in 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250
 three in three we will have to press 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.640
 square when it comes out is worth this map 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.620
 we have to look for three eyes worth pressing 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.140
 three eyes to activate stage tÃ©rek 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.180
 here at the beginning we have the first 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.280
 further away just start what is the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.200
 map as they fixed more or less this would be 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.700
 the first location say there's 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.320
 nine locations is worth but only 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.239
 we will have to find three in each 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.560
 map that are each departure forgiveness since 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.510
 It is random 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.510
 is the second location would be 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.980
 right here on this table as 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 You see a sound every time 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.660
 we press it is worth saying that all these are 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.000
 various items so I have been 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.320
 record all in the third location 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.050
 it would be on this table all this 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.450
 would be in zone 1 not just start 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.100
 ok this would be the third location 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 the fourth would be in this room here 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.510
 It's worth it that in this room, there are other 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.220
 three ok here would be the first good the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.130
 that would be the fourth location with the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 of the staircase is worth the fifth would be 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.080
 just in this same room is worth the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.630
 top part 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.270
 it's right here next to the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.520
 column is on top of the species is not 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.420
 a table but good here we have 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 The next 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.770
 then the other number 6 is the sixth 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.540
 it would be right here on top of this 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.900
 table with this would be the sixth 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.420
 location is worth the seventh since we 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.890
 we go to the gas station part of it 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.020
 which is right here on the side 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.630
 of the white barrel number not next to 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.100
 some garbage bags the eighth 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.229
 location is just in the same 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.970
 site but the back on top of 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.500
 some barrels this one could not record 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.440
 because it has not come to me but I know 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
 that comes out here also goes and then by 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.350
 last the ninth is just that at 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.850
 next to where the bags were 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.180
 of garbage and on the floor in that square 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.980
 when we already press good as you can see , 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.110
 has activated what is hysterical and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.940
 Well, as you can see we have all 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.920
 the advantages some little stars and such 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.500
 there's next door and when we kill the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.100
 cryptids then the logo of neversoft 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 in good there is like a big one above all 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.080
 that there are nine locations worth but 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.239
 we just have to press three in each 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.970
 split game is random at each 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.320
 departure will come out in different places 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 but come on, we just have to press 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.020
 three is pretty simple simply 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.960
 is that 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.660
 and nothing is basically this what we are 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.640
 give the advantages for three minutes 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.890
 which is similar to what happened on the map 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.090
 previous that it was water that no, it is more 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.680
 or less the same do not give us all the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.350
 advantages apart from saleh post 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.150
 in this case the universe logo every 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.710
 time we kill the prescriptive and little 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.560
 more once the three minutes pass then 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.600
 it is not taken away from us anymore, so nothing 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.940
 this is the exodus map steak in mode 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.840
 extinction in the dlc nemesis so nothing 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.670
 I hope you liked it if it has 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.350
 liked to vote busti favorites and we 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.350
 we see in the next video only use all 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.130
 protects 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.810
 ah 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.430
 or not
