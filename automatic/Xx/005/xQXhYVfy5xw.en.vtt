vegetables you like and I'll go through

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.080 
vegetables you like and I'll go through
the<00:02:18.450> same<00:02:18.630> fermentation<00:02:19.500> process<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.970> now

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the same fermentation process and now

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.870 
the same fermentation process and now
become<00:02:21.480> sour<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.350> sauerkraut<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.310> just

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
become sour like the sauerkraut you just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.940 
become sour like the sauerkraut you just
make<00:02:24.060> sure<00:02:24.090> everything<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.200> same<00:02:25.670> sort<00:02:26.670> of

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
make sure everything is the same sort of

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.980 
make sure everything is the same sort of
thickness<00:02:28.950> otherwise<00:02:29.880> they<00:02:30.150> don't<00:02:30.450> form<00:02:30.870> at

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
thickness otherwise they don't form at

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.910 
thickness otherwise they don't form at
different<00:02:31.440> rates

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
different rates

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.860 
different rates
that's<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.910> reasons<00:02:33.240> why<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.420> took<00:02:33.660> so

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
that's one of the reasons why it took so

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.140 
that's one of the reasons why it took so
long<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.290> make<00:02:34.410> pickles<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.820> matter

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
long to make pickles in this matter

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:48.410 
long to make pickles in this matter
because<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:37.470> pickles<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.310> thick<00:02:47.420> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
because the pickles are really thick and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.680 
because the pickles are really thick and
I<00:02:48.600> thought<00:02:48.840> about<00:02:49.140> another

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:07.870 

two<00:02:53.610> three<00:02:54.610> teaspoons<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:55.390> salt

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.600 

and<00:03:08.180> it'll<00:03:08.900> start<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.260> draw<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.980> liquid<00:03:10.370> out

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
and it'll start to draw the liquid out

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.400 
and it'll start to draw the liquid out
of<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:11.230> cabbage<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.730> I'm<00:03:13.940> also<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.840> add

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
of the cabbage and I'm also going to add

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.089 
of the cabbage and I'm also going to add
water<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.920> this

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.720 

and<00:03:23.099> then<00:03:23.370> I'm<00:03:23.459> going<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.700> wait<00:03:23.939> it<00:03:24.120> out

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
and then I'm going to wait it out

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:36.979 
and then I'm going to wait it out
filtered<00:03:26.730> water<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:36.269> should<00:03:36.480> be<00:03:36.599> about<00:03:36.780> an

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
filtered water that should be about an

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.800 
filtered water that should be about an
unfiltered<00:03:37.469> water<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:39.420> then<00:03:39.510> I'm<00:03:39.599> going<00:03:39.780> to

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
unfiltered water and then I'm going to

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.699 
unfiltered water and then I'm going to
put<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:39.989> weight<00:03:40.700> over<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.849> lid<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.230> make<00:03:43.500> sure

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
put a weight over the lid so make sure

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.789 
put a weight over the lid so make sure
that<00:03:43.920> all<00:03:44.129> that<00:03:44.310> cabbage<00:03:44.909> that<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.239> want<00:03:45.420> to

have the in your sauerkraut is

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.199 
have the in your sauerkraut is
underneath<00:03:51.450> where<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:51.959> lid<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:54.090> then

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
underneath where the lid is and then

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.190 
underneath where the lid is and then
I'll<00:03:54.329> wait<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.780> down<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:56.719> just<00:03:57.719> use<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.989> glass

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
I'll wait this down I just use a glass

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.809 
I'll wait this down I just use a glass
jar<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.620> water<00:04:02.299> make<00:04:03.299> sure<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.659> is<00:04:03.870> clean

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
jar with water make sure this is clean

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.679 
jar with water make sure this is clean
and<00:04:05.819> set<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.239> on<00:04:06.419> top<00:04:06.659> of<00:04:06.810> there<00:04:07.939> and<00:04:08.939> it<00:04:09.209> will

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
and set that on top of there and it will

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.179 
and set that on top of there and it will
start<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:10.049> come<00:04:10.290> out<00:04:10.469> and<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.829> should<00:04:11.069> be

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
start to come out and it should be

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.030 
start to come out and it should be
completely<00:04:11.849> covered<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.419> liquid<00:04:12.949> probably<00:04:13.949> in

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
completely covered in liquid probably in

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.520 
completely covered in liquid probably in
about<00:04:14.129> an<00:04:14.400> hour<00:04:14.609> have<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.419> waited<00:04:15.900> they<00:04:16.259> have<00:04:16.500> a

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
know that it's above the level of the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.100 
know that it's above the level of the
cabbage<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.460> if<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.389> can<00:04:24.539> see<00:04:24.750> this<00:04:24.900> it's

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
cabbage but if you can see this it's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.200 
cabbage but if you can see this it's
about<00:04:25.320> two-thirds<00:04:25.949> filled<00:04:26.280> right<00:04:26.729> now<00:04:26.909> with

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
about two-thirds filled right now with

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.080 
about two-thirds filled right now with
water<00:04:27.479> at<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.199> beginning<00:04:28.349> stage<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.520> it'll

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
water at the beginning stage and it'll

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.820 
water at the beginning stage and it'll
start<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.449> fill<00:04:30.630> up<00:04:30.750> more<00:04:30.960> with<00:04:31.110> water<00:04:31.380> as<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
start to fill up more with water as the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.310 
start to fill up more with water as the
water<00:04:31.979> draws<00:04:32.370> out<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:32.820> cabbage<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.720> then

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
water draws out of the cabbage and then

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.960 
water draws out of the cabbage and then
you<00:04:35.099> need<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.370> cover<00:04:35.699> it<00:04:35.909> with<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.419> clean<00:04:36.870> cloth

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
you need to cover it with a clean cloth

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.020
