00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.379
 Nicholas in this video will teach how 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.400
 download a video game and put them to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.950
 to play 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.810
 in the simplest way that I know 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.150
 to all the releases and towers we 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.090
 we can download here in softonic that 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.600
 is supposedly free of viruses and is 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.460
 all right 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.760
 we do not download it is worth once 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.690
 Discharged 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.910
 we put a game 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.510
 welcome this here is usually 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.410

 [Music] 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.050
 for example 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.520
 it will not be there 3 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.600

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.430
 [Music] 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.589
 best 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.589
 we had torrent here download 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.200
 This is crap because it came out 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.729
 bardem and not 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.729
 click that suffers state 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.950
 this opens up 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.580
 and if we give it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.629
 opening for the rent credit 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.629
 [Music] 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.469
 [Music] 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.659
 like milk 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.400
 now it has been added 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.110
 in torrent is the list of torrents 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.740
 It's worth it that I downloaded it from there 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.800
 then it would be this one here I'm put 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.800
 far cry vale would get us there 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.050
 from there we start to download 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 we have to give it here to start 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.380
 to download the broadcast is 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.100

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.319

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.470

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.950

 what do we do now iso file that many 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.520

 cojones archives and his friend the file 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.170

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.120
 iso file for many many times that 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.250

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.500
 Well, we do not have to download another 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.340
 Program 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.630

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.340
 free 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.850
 the juventus download can also be 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:45.760
 load softonic and download it and 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.760
 we installed once installed 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.889
 damon tools and is the open 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.560
 your question 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.969
 we open and it is opening calmly 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.969
 patience is worth 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.580
 I will without these two things worth 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.840
 nothing will come out practically what 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.330
 we have to do 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.740
 we come here and you put create image of 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.680
 disk 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.220
 you have to pass everything and once you 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.420
 has finished, we can play this 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.729
 game 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.710
 [Music] 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.930
 attentive we do 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.500
 iso file where our file was 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.640
 iso here is the iso file 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.640
 we would have to 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.110
 ok or open or we will open with the 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.370
 moon tools or if not 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.610
 we can 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.320
 take it here and move it is worth but good 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.780
 if you see it open with diamond tools it's what 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.660
 same 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:00.180
 and as soon as you do that, the 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.180
 install screen exit 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.380
 the uninstall and when you get to the 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.710
 half of the installation 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.990
 I will leave error I do not know what you have to 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.990
 put I do not know what things are worth then what 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.690
 you have to do is come here and put 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.640
 dvd 2 and open it again or again 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.380
 do not open the second one that does not 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.410
 we had opened so far 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.940
 and when you open it it will finish installing 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:31.400
 and I think it will still make you one last mistake 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.510
 so again mistake I think it has 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.450
 what to put again the tv of 1 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.220
 and when you 've put the land 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.890
 lands all 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.820
 and suddenly this icon has appeared 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.350
 because there are three and I tell you that I'm going to 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.740
 put it so you can see that yes 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.740
 works 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:56.870
 because 36 is now 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.550
 to start 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.280
 the truth is that it takes me a little bit in 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.870
 load that yes but the age of played and 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.870
 it's pretty good and not no 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.509
 if you have a shit graph 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.350
 you probably can not play here 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:16.820
 it's loading good up here I'm going to 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:20.019
 leave the video 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.019

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.300
 voucher voucher 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.760
 and beyond all this seriously 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.200
 Well, it gives me that I'm going to 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.360
 close here 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.249
 to see if they leave me in serious let me 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.349

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:48.269
 well up to here the video has arrived os 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:49.709

 test and that's how you download everything and 

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:56.149
