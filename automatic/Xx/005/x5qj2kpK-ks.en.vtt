it's<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.650> gone<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.650> guess<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.799> really

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
it's just gone it I guess it really

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
it's just gone it I guess it really
shows<00:01:14.220> what's<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> really

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
shows what's going on right now I really

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
shows what's going on right now I really
I<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:17.009> not<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.580> really

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
I would think it's not it's not really

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
I would think it's not it's not really
just<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.299> sign<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> troubled<00:01:19.140> economy<00:01:19.619> as

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
just a sign of the troubled economy as

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
just a sign of the troubled economy as
much<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.820> also<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.360> sign<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
much as it is I think also a sign of the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
much as it is I think also a sign of the
diminishment<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.409> popularity<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
diminishment in popularity of the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.789 
diminishment in popularity of the
daytime<00:01:23.520> soap<00:01:23.850> opera<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:25.259> certainly<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
daytime soap opera there certainly was a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.289 
daytime soap opera there certainly was a
time<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.549> again<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.210> be

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
time this again I think can be

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.580 
time this again I think can be
attributed<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.080> things<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
attributed to a lot of things the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
attributed to a lot of things the
internet<00:01:28.740> cable<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.570> when
