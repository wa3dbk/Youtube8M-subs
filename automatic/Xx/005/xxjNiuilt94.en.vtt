deliver them no problem so we'll take a
look<00:02:59.750> at<00:02:59.870> Excel<00:03:00.200> Excel<00:03:00.739> does<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.010> mean<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.910> very

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
look at Excel Excel does I mean a very

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240 
look at Excel Excel does I mean a very
good<00:03:02.360> job<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.900> course<00:03:03.500> with<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.739> spreadsheet

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
good job of course with a spreadsheet

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.610 
good job of course with a spreadsheet
you<00:03:04.610> really<00:03:04.880> don't<00:03:05.090> need<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.910> that

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you really don't need to have it that

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.170 
you really don't need to have it that
presentable<00:03:09.620> as<00:03:09.890> far<00:03:10.130> as<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.430> images<00:03:10.880> and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
presentable as far as the images and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.039 
presentable as far as the images and
alignment<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:11.989> font<00:03:13.030> but<00:03:14.030> as<00:03:14.299> far<00:03:14.540> as<00:03:14.600> you

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
alignment and font but as far as you

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.449 
alignment and font but as far as you
know<00:03:15.170> holding<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.650> colors<00:03:16.069> and<00:03:18.459> calculations

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
know holding the colors and calculations

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.670 
know holding the colors and calculations
and<00:03:19.700> everything<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.359> can<00:03:20.510> see<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.900> click<00:03:21.560> on

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
and everything so you can see I click on

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.530 
and everything so you can see I click on
here<00:03:21.920> my<00:03:22.100> total<00:03:22.519> is<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.700> combination<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.420> the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
here my total is a combination of the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.470 
here my total is a combination of the
quantity<00:03:23.930> times<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.380> unit<00:03:24.560> cost<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:26.060> kept<00:03:26.299> in

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
quantity times the unit cost it kept in

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.860 
quantity times the unit cost it kept in
the<00:03:26.660> HTML<00:03:27.500> links<00:03:27.799> that<00:03:27.920> were<00:03:28.010> HTML<00:03:28.549> links<00:03:28.970> and

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
the HTML links that were HTML links and

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.190 
the HTML links that were HTML links and
they'd<00:03:30.019> have<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> summation<00:03:30.709> here<00:03:32.049> excuse<00:03:33.049> me

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
they'd have a summation here excuse me

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.250 
they'd have a summation here excuse me
so<00:03:33.350> everything<00:03:33.680> like<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:34.180> holds<00:03:35.180> true<00:03:35.450> and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
so everything like that holds true and

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.110 
so everything like that holds true and
so<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.859> Excel<00:03:37.160> does<00:03:37.340> actually<00:03:37.639> a<00:03:37.880> fairly

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
so the Excel does actually a fairly

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.259 
so the Excel does actually a fairly
fairly<00:03:38.989> good<00:03:39.260> job<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.799> it's<00:03:39.920> very<00:03:40.700> very<00:03:40.850> nice

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
fairly good job and it's very very nice

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.819 
fairly good job and it's very very nice
to<00:03:41.540> view<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:43.010> pretty<00:03:43.400> decent<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.940> work<00:03:44.090> in

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
to view and and pretty decent to work in

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.670 
to view and and pretty decent to work in
and<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:47.540> can<00:03:47.660> also<00:03:47.840> see<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.500> has<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
and you can also see that it has the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.069 
and you can also see that it has the
abilities<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.310> mimic<00:03:50.120> through<00:03:50.329> sheets<00:03:50.690> and

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
abilities to mimic through sheets and

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.789 
abilities to mimic through sheets and
add<00:03:51.950> sheets<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.959> remove<00:03:53.959> sheets<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:54.650> so

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
add sheets and remove sheets and so

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.199 
add sheets and remove sheets and so
forth<00:03:55.099> so<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:55.880> it's<00:03:56.239> a<00:03:56.359> very<00:03:56.599> very<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:58.670> mean<00:03:58.940> it

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
forth so it's it's a very very I mean it

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.520 
forth so it's it's a very very I mean it
it's<00:03:59.810> a<00:04:00.170> fairly<00:04:00.829> nice<00:04:01.989> portion<00:04:02.989> of<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.319> Quick

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
it's a fairly nice portion of the Quick

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.970 
it's a fairly nice portion of the Quick
Office<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.669> can<00:04:04.819> see<00:04:05.000> I<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.630> know<00:04:05.750> I

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
Office and you can see I you know I

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.870 
Office and you can see I you know I
changed<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.069> couple<00:04:07.099> things<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.790> can

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
changed a couple things so you can

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.210 
changed a couple things so you can
actually<00:04:08.120> save<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.470> say<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.799> back<00:04:10.010> to

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
actually save and then say that back to

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.449 
actually save and then say that back to
the<00:04:10.340> cloud<00:04:10.609> or<00:04:10.970> save<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.690> locally<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.250> that's

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
the cloud or save it locally so that's

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.039 
the cloud or save it locally so that's
it's<00:04:14.030> pretty<00:04:14.299> neat<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:16.690> we<00:04:17.690> can<00:04:17.840> look<00:04:17.930> at

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
it's pretty neat and we can look at

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.479 
it's pretty neat and we can look at
another<00:04:18.260> PowerPoint<00:04:18.829> this<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.099> actually<00:04:19.400> an

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
another PowerPoint this is actually an

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.429 
another PowerPoint this is actually an
older<00:04:19.729> PowerPoint

00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:20.439 
older PowerPoint

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:24.839 
older PowerPoint
that<00:04:21.439> doesn't<00:04:21.739> use<00:04:21.889> some<00:04:22.159> of<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.370> newer<00:04:22.990> as<00:04:23.990> of

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
that doesn't use some of the newer as of

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:30.490 
that doesn't use some of the newer as of
2007<00:04:25.849> and<00:04:25.969> 2008<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:28.659> pptx<00:04:29.659> it<00:04:30.199> doesn't

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
2007 and 2008 the the pptx it doesn't

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.249 
2007 and 2008 the the pptx it doesn't
use<00:04:30.650> all<00:04:30.889> of<00:04:31.039> that<00:04:31.189> XML<00:04:31.960> formatting<00:04:32.960> so<00:04:33.169> you

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
use all of that XML formatting so you

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.189 
use all of that XML formatting so you
can<00:04:33.500> see<00:04:33.740> that<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.979> formatting<00:04:34.550> here<00:04:35.139> for<00:04:36.139> the

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
can see that the formatting here for the

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.309 
can see that the formatting here for the
most<00:04:36.349> part<00:04:36.620> stays<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.639> same<00:04:37.879> so<00:04:38.169> if<00:04:39.169> you're

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
most part stays the same so if you're

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.040 
most part stays the same so if you're
going<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.889> using<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.430> older<00:04:40.699> offices<00:04:41.270> you'll

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
going in using the older offices you'll

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.459 
going in using the older offices you'll
find<00:04:42.409> that<00:04:43.360> this<00:04:44.360> type<00:04:44.629> of<00:04:44.659> transition<00:04:45.199> or

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
find that this type of transition or

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.580 
find that this type of transition or
even<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.800> open<00:04:46.360> open<00:04:47.360> offices<00:04:47.840> you'll<00:04:48.319> find

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
even the open open offices you'll find

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.379 
even the open open offices you'll find
that<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:49.250> formatting<00:04:49.819> is<00:04:49.939> a<00:04:49.969> little<00:04:50.270> bit

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
that the formatting is a little bit

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:57.730 
that the formatting is a little bit
better<00:04:50.569> than<00:04:51.319> using<00:04:51.620> word<00:04:52.449> 2007<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:53.840> on<00:04:56.740> and

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
better than using word 2007 and on and

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.719 
better than using word 2007 and on and
then<00:04:57.860> we<00:04:57.949> can<00:04:58.099> look<00:04:58.189> at<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> PDF<00:05:00.279> PDFs<00:05:01.279> open

won't<00:06:09.229> probably<00:06:09.589> see<00:06:10.159> something<00:06:10.819> better<00:06:11.120> for

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
won't probably see something better for

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.459 
won't probably see something better for
furyl<00:06:11.870> for<00:06:12.409> a<00:06:12.439> while<00:06:12.620> until<00:06:12.979> maybe<00:06:13.339> hopefully

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
furyl for a while until maybe hopefully

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.990 
furyl for a while until maybe hopefully
I'm<00:06:15.469> a<00:06:15.529> better<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:16.009> better<00:06:16.069> package<00:06:16.550> as<00:06:16.969> a

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
I'm a better a better package as a

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.309 
I'm a better a better package as a
release<00:06:19.419> but<00:06:20.419> I<00:06:20.449> think<00:06:20.719> even<00:06:20.870> this<00:06:21.110> is

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
release but I think even this is

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.809 
release but I think even this is
something<00:06:21.680> that<00:06:21.830> you<00:06:22.159> know<00:06:22.279> if<00:06:22.430> you<00:06:22.550> were<00:06:22.669> to

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
something that you know if you were to

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:27.159 
something that you know if you were to
transition<00:06:23.539> from<00:06:23.979> PowerPoint<00:06:24.979> or<00:06:26.169> office
