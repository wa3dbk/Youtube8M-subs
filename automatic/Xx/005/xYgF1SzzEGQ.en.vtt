 what re marseille and santos 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.520

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.140
 Nurmagomedov today is one 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.849
 of the strongest 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.650
 Russia in the category up to 76 kilograms 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:38.019
 beginning 118 species to 77 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 the world started habib on amateur 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.670
 tournaments I still remember when 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.280
 volume almost nobody knew then 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.079
 the time was three or four years ago when 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.760
 Habib killed a court in Moscow 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.189
 amateur pankration tournaments 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.790
 cup atrium then performed it already 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.790
 to professionals 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.150
 where just won the eight in which 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.440
 participated satisfied no her fighters in 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.440
 including Alexander Butenko 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.520
 natalya 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.420
 but alexander buds met not 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.700
 he met then was kerimova shamil 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.930
 lost in the final already the hobbit won 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.090
 Abdulkerimov was so 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.229
 [music] 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.229
 [applause] 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.060
 [music] 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.730
 this eight also said Sergey 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.640
 grief Karen Grigorian but none 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.930
 the other at that tournament did not perform 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.310
 [music] 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.590
 I think sergeydolya participate 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.409
 eights absolutely there was no way to 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.099
 that moment he was a famous fighter and 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:58.079
 check yourself in an incomprehensible tournament 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.329
 it probably didn't make sense but for 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.569
 he is not clear of course there and by the way 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.430
 saying the fee was very good 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.139
 so could well try myself 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.480
 Sergey grieving but another thing porridge 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.209
 eight for such a famous one 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.989
 the moment of the athlete seems to me 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.930
 participate in such a tournament was 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.729
 wrong now but stealing 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.720
 is the Brazilian seems to kill off 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.669
 probably only able to di bows 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.000
 here's a ruber right for him only 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.120
 of protection 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.120
 [music] 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.449
 [applause] 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.720
 [music] 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:46.529
 [applause] 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:46.529
 [music] 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.300
 how do we say you people understandable habib 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.850
 support she started startled set 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.440
 beginning gum tomorrow will be dumb 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.690
 from this fire on what kind of freestyle 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.210
 a struggle like that in brazil 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:15.480
 Brazilians are throwing throughout 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.460
 combat such very dangerous strikes on the jump 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.940
 still super men punch and current rival 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.050
 Habib at the bottom was at this moment well 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.050
 I think that 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.660
 ground and pound good demonstrates 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.190
 [music] 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.750
 Nurmagomedov and 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.580
 [applause] 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.370
 or under the influence of Brazilians it seems to me 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.710
 stunned i think that question 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.310
 stop was it a matter of time and 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.370
 nearest 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.370
 [music] 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.060
 because i like habib in principle 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.580
 giving up fight to fight grows that's true 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.010
 the level of habib rivals does not become 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.730
 stronger though i remind u and everything is even 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.770
 announced 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.440

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.810
 rival primastar and me present to me 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.120
 accountant brazilians loser knockout 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.760
 its previous was kamal shalorus yes yes 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.700
 but still level kamala agree 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.380
 significantly lowers the level 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.970
 difficult to revive settled create fables 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.660
 Congratulations to Habib Nurmagomedov with 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:27.100

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:30.420
 correct problem rivals is 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.420

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.980

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.900
