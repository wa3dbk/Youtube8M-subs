come from either touch or all Stag
backgrounds<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.699> haven't<00:00:53.969> got<00:00:54.239> their

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
backgrounds so they haven't got their

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.299 
backgrounds so they haven't got their
haven't<00:00:54.899> got<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> contact<00:00:55.530> skills<00:00:55.829> as<00:00:56.070> such

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
haven't got the contact skills as such

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
haven't got the contact skills as such
but<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.360> good<00:00:57.680> catch<00:00:58.680> pass

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
but they do have very good catch pass

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.599 
but they do have very good catch pass
skills<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> very<00:00:59.850> good<00:01:00.059> spatial<00:01:00.359> awareness

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
skills and very good spatial awareness

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.030 
skills and very good spatial awareness
so<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:02.969> young<00:01:03.210> squad<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:04.290> us<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.860> be

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
so it's a very young squad for us to be

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
so it's a very young squad for us to be
taking<00:01:05.189> away<00:01:05.840> I'm<00:01:06.840> lucky<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.260> bit<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
taking away I'm lucky with a bit of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.580 
taking away I'm lucky with a bit of
injury<00:01:08.420> but<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.869> great<00:01:10.080> opportunity<00:01:10.560> for

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
injury but it's a great opportunity for

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.770 
injury but it's a great opportunity for
these<00:01:10.770> young<00:01:10.830> girls<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.400> step<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.240> think

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
these young girls to step up now I think

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.149 
these young girls to step up now I think
our<00:01:13.110> team<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.710> very<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.090> young<00:01:16.159> we

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
our team is very good but very young we

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.520 
our team is very good but very young we
can<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.580> opportunity<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.659> our

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
can take this opportunity they and our

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
can take this opportunity they and our
back<00:01:19.770> line<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.520> slick<00:01:20.939> we've<00:01:21.479> got

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
back line is pretty slick we've got

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
back line is pretty slick we've got
touches<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.259> there

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
touches in there

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.580 
touches in there
they<00:01:23.939> were<00:01:24.000> also<00:01:24.210> our<00:01:24.600> forwards<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.229> fairly

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
they were also our forwards of fairly

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
they were also our forwards of fairly
experienced<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.790> think<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.720> showed<00:01:27.960> from

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
experienced so I think it showed from

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
experienced so I think it showed from
our<00:01:28.470> training<00:01:28.799> session<00:01:29.100> today<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.790> all

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
our training session today that we all

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.700 
our training session today that we all
kind<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.329> gelled<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> felt<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.290> good

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
kind of gelled and it felt really good

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.670 
kind of gelled and it felt really good
so<00:01:31.950> we're<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.189> their<00:01:32.570> great<00:01:33.570> path<00:01:33.810> towards

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so we're on their great path towards

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
so we're on their great path towards
