00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.360
 we are more than twice two with three 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.340
 and in the previous chapter how can you 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.710
 observe we won the first map by 6 a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.180
 2 and if you do not remember that map then the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 I leave in the description for you to see 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.690
 and well that's the second episode of the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.490
 series 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.250
 we are going to try to win because I do not know anything 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.960
 as well as a 50 in guaje is a 10-0 that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.260
 it's quite complicated at the moment 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.730
 Well you know, we're going 10 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.710
 let's see if we can talk 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.510
 be the eyes on is difficult to 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.040
 decide how good they have tried to prey 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.930
 It's no use trying to put a game 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.030
 pretty bad that you hide that 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.920
 accept but luckily I did not let them not 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.270
 let me join me so they have not 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.800
 could we do the reportedly we do not know 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.900
 how and the yews but we know that it is the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 better of the two games because they 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.760
 they always try to get bad so nothing 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.760
 go for it 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.899
 there is one in its base jumping on you 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 and at noon look at the same time 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.780
 medium I think they sneak by means and 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 through medium they will go by 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.990
 behind 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.990
 so that he 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.430
 good and good good round good round 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.900
 It was worth champion a little nothing because 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.970
 that name site they were going to catch besides not 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.080
 they had seen me get in there yes it is 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.080
 interesting if they want to win 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.600
 w 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.600
 good now 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.640
 let's come the wave 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.990
 I tell you now the girl I'm going to the pineapple 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 to the pineapple of not doing more doubles and the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.909
 strip 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 look at the middle 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.170
 come one comes a few fasts let's go 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.119
 we will go them will be modeled the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.499
 placed the placed 20 20 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.770
 kill the others if it was me that 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:08.580
 come on it's not, but said it's gone 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.899
 he has gone planted, there is no need to go, I tell him 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.620
 he had gone you know you can not tell me that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.040
 not when I've already gone bastard 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.650
 and I say it already but he has not said when I 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.480
 I already read when I was not in your 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.799
 situation I was in the middle if I 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.930
 They put him in, I could not go 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:29.409
 backwards 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.409
 really concentrated 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.720
 people play very weird 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.030
 I will also throw through 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.920
 Good Morning 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.120
 Let's go, I'll have flip shot kids 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.970
 because he got an easy easy shot of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.410
 fuck let's take charge of good load 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.690
 good rotation 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 our people play very weird by means 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.740
 they heal by means and see what point to 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.410
 point in knowing are looking level and 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.410
 nothing very strange 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 at the same time that I go through the tunnel 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.260
 but good 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.570
 in the above 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.670
 through 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.550
 where can you do this male I do not 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.030
 can you do this to me you can not do it 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.710
 when we have already gone to the round when 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.230
 I was already going to the left stopped 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.580
 my mother takes the pump when I never 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.380
 I'm lame 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.380
 in mom is ok so the middle one I already 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.930
 it was discounted 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.880
 so it's pretty good 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.880
 I've seen 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.859
 there is an insuperable kills by means 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.859
 they do it all the time 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.229
 or is connected one placing placing 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.229
 placing 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.160
 he is a wizard 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.319
 They have lost the map if they do not get 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:56.000
 If you do not get in, you have lost the one that does not 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.710
 he gets there they have not lost no 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.710
 can be as a spectator today 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.030
 we'll see 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.030
 avn 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.229
 for tares bores 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.550
 now 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.660
 good good round good clothes is good and 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.160
 I the one that this union is not 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.840
 awakened or not what has come 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.639
 come out of the equipment 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.639
 lost on the map for that 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.010
 I'm recording it 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.810
 hey 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.629
 but no more 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.550
 reported overflowing we have to go over 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.230
 tests for obviously you already know that 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.240
 going to 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.950
 exploit or we continue to play in 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.580
 true 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.580
 now 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.750
 yesterday reported by fools 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.980
 we report 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.479
 jumps 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.610
 a guys it 's crap to play like that but 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.349
 the truth is that you have to be here the 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.930
 basically with the rules 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.879
 because then the guiris do the same and 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.099
 then loses effects so then 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.469
 Well, the truth is not very nice 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.000
 I hate losing and that is to win as well 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.259
 losing the truth is that it is something very 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.210
 unfair but good they have been wrong the 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:49.389
 norms and I tell you that to me what I most 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.669
 like is to play and win but in this case 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.379
 it's not going to be that way basically because of the great 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.240
 mass that we also carry that 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.409
 many times this has happened to us and we 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.569
 have taken for lost challenges that we have 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.039
 won but good is what there is 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.810
 I hope you liked it if this is the case 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.259
 x favorites for more greetings and even 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.259
 the next
