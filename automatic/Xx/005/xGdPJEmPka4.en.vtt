00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that I'm connected with these two once

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.330 
that I'm connected with these two once
you<00:02:32.840> understand<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.440> then<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:34.010> music

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
you understand that then the music

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.070 
you understand that then the music
becomes<00:02:34.670> more<00:02:34.760> into<00:02:35.150> focus<00:02:35.330> because<00:02:35.840> then<00:02:35.990> you

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
becomes more into focus because then you

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.170 
becomes more into focus because then you
balance<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.100> now<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.370> start<00:02:37.730> playing<00:02:37.970> with

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
balance so now you start playing with

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.240 
balance so now you start playing with
all<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.450> sort<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.750> space<00:02:39.100> when<00:02:40.100> they

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
all the sort of space when they

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.070 
all the sort of space when they
understand<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.240> red<00:02:41.510> music<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.050> very
