their product here it seems like it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
works really well from the videos that

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.100 
works really well from the videos that
have<00:03:22.040> seen<00:03:22.280> online<00:03:22.490> from<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.630> durability<00:03:24.080> of

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
have seen online from the durability of

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.490 
have seen online from the durability of
it<00:03:24.709> how<00:03:25.069> strong<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.300> what<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.260> meant

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
it how strong it is and what it is meant

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.260 
it how strong it is and what it is meant
to<00:03:27.650> do<00:03:27.920> which<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.190> kind<00:03:28.520> of<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.730> act<00:03:28.910> like<00:03:29.090> a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
to do which is kind of to act like a

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.290 
to do which is kind of to act like a
protective<00:03:29.660> barrier<00:03:30.380> against<00:03:31.130> scratches<00:03:32.030> and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
protective barrier against scratches and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.510 
protective barrier against scratches and
stuff<00:03:32.540> like<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:33.319> was<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> little

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
stuff like that I was a little

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.880 
stuff like that I was a little
apprehensive<00:03:34.760> first<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.930> actually<00:03:36.380> put<00:03:36.770> this

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
apprehensive first to actually put this

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.979 
apprehensive first to actually put this
on<00:03:37.069> my<00:03:37.250> phone<00:03:37.550> because<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.540> don't<00:03:38.780> know<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.930> just

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
on my phone because I don't know it just

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.620 
on my phone because I don't know it just
seems<00:03:39.350> like<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:40.310> stickiness<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:41.450> would

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
seems like the stickiness of it would

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.140 
seems like the stickiness of it would
damage<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.260> phone<00:03:42.470> somehow<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:43.280> decided<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.000> go

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
damage the phone somehow I decided to go

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.259 
damage the phone somehow I decided to go
ahead<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.930> in<00:03:45.190> doing<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.580> application

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
ahead and do it in doing the application

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.170 
ahead and do it in doing the application
which<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.600> just<00:03:47.630> saw<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.650> was<00:03:48.860> fairly<00:03:49.550> simple

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
which you just saw it was fairly simple

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.759 
which you just saw it was fairly simple
not<00:03:50.540> gonna<00:03:50.720> say<00:03:50.870> was<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.140> simplest<00:03:51.530> thing

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
not gonna say was the simplest thing

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.350 
not gonna say was the simplest thing
I've<00:03:51.950> ever<00:03:52.010> had<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.640> do<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.269> know

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
I've ever had to do like you know

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.150 
I've ever had to do like you know
putting<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> speck<00:03:54.080> case<00:03:54.320> is<00:03:54.530> super<00:03:54.950> simple

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
putting on a speck case is super simple

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.920 
putting on a speck case is super simple
it<00:03:55.519> takes<00:03:55.730> a<00:03:55.819> little<00:03:55.940> bit<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.150> precision<00:03:56.840> you

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
it takes a little bit of precision you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.780 
it takes a little bit of precision you
want<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.200> get<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:57.410> exactly<00:03:57.530> lined<00:03:58.250> up<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.670> that

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
want to get it exactly lined up so that

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.970 
want to get it exactly lined up so that
it<00:03:58.910> looks<00:03:59.120> good<00:03:59.480> but<00:04:00.140> once<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.470> have<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.800> on<00:04:00.950> I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
it looks good but once you have it on I

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.330 
it looks good but once you have it on I
mean<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.610> almost<00:04:02.769> invisible<00:04:03.769> there's<00:04:04.280> a

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
mean it's almost invisible there's a

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.610 
mean it's almost invisible there's a
couple<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.970> spots<00:04:05.450> where<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:06.080> can<00:04:06.230> definitely

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
couple of spots where you can definitely

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.170 
couple of spots where you can definitely
tell<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.830> there's<00:04:07.130> something<00:04:07.640> on<00:04:07.819> there

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
tell that there's something on there

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.750 
tell that there's something on there
like<00:04:08.720> on<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.989> corners<00:04:09.440> here<00:04:09.800> they<00:04:10.310> had<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.580> cut

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
like on the corners here they had to cut

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.729 
like on the corners here they had to cut
them<00:04:10.940> into<00:04:11.060> three<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.780> they<00:04:11.959> fit<00:04:12.290> round

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
them into three so that they fit round

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.250 
them into three so that they fit round
it<00:04:12.920> over<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.280> corners<00:04:13.700> well<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.030> back<00:04:14.870> piece

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
it over the corners well the back piece

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.440 
it over the corners well the back piece
was<00:04:15.560> probably<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.100> hardest<00:04:16.160> piece<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.090> put<00:04:17.299> on

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
was probably the hardest piece to put on

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.530 
was probably the hardest piece to put on
just<00:04:18.049> because<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.680> bevels<00:04:19.010> on<00:04:19.370> all<00:04:19.609> sides<00:04:20.000> so

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
just because it bevels on all sides so

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.300 
just because it bevels on all sides so
you<00:04:20.600> have<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.989> kind<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.290> hold<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.680> there<00:04:21.890> let<00:04:22.280> it

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
you have to kind of hold it there let it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.150 
you have to kind of hold it there let it
stick<00:04:22.880> because<00:04:23.570> this<00:04:23.990> application<00:04:24.830> stuff

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
stick because this application stuff

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.080 
stick because this application stuff
kind<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.970> prevents<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.950> adherence<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.130> it<00:04:28.460> so

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
kind of prevents the adherence to it so

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.570 
kind of prevents the adherence to it so
that<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.479> can<00:04:29.660> place<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.169> correctly<00:04:30.650> but<00:04:31.220> once

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
that you can place it correctly but once

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.980 
that you can place it correctly but once
you've<00:04:31.760> got<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.180> ready<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.570> go<00:04:32.600> you're<00:04:32.900> like

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
you've got it ready to go you're like

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
guess around those the side here was

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.550 
guess around those the side here was
necessary<00:04:46.580> or<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.330> would<00:04:47.510> have<00:04:47.630> been<00:04:47.780> nice<00:04:48.140> if

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
necessary or it would have been nice if

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.580 
necessary or it would have been nice if
it<00:04:48.950> could<00:04:49.039> have<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:49.640> all<00:04:49.910> been<00:04:50.270> one<00:04:50.690> piece<00:04:51.229> i

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
it could have just all been one piece i

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.250 
it could have just all been one piece i
just<00:04:51.950> don't<00:04:52.070> see<00:04:52.190> why<00:04:52.640> they<00:04:53.330> had<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.600> cut<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:53.990> up

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
little bit more grippy I guess you can

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.750 
little bit more grippy I guess you can
