going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.180> more<00:01:06.330> performance

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
going to be a little more performance

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.640 
going to be a little more performance

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.170 
stiffer actually quite a bit stiffer
than<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> Ireland<00:01:26.549> bushing<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.030> see

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
than the Ireland bushing you can see

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
than the Ireland bushing you can see
there's<00:01:27.360> virtually<00:01:27.689> no<00:01:27.869> deflection<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.860> is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there's virtually no deflection this is

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
there's virtually no deflection this is
much<00:01:29.310> better<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> race<00:01:30.240> car<00:01:30.540> or<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
much better for a race car or a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.140 
much better for a race car or a
high-performance<00:01:32.900> street<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.110> track<00:01:34.439> car<00:01:35.150> the

high-performance street or track car the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.940 
high-performance street or track car the
downside<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.049> increased<00:01:37.500> noise

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
downside of this is increased noise

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
downside of this is increased noise
vibration<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.729> harshness<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.450> will<00:01:39.659> get

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
vibration and harshness that will get

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
vibration and harshness that will get
into<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> passenger<00:01:40.920> compartment<00:01:41.450> might

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
into the passenger compartment might

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.850 
into the passenger compartment might
drive<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.110> nuts<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.439> long<00:01:43.619> road

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
drive you a little bit nuts on long road

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.749 
drive you a little bit nuts on long road
trips<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.850> finally<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.750> our
