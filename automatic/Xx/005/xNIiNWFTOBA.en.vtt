00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.270 
bit one and it is so we're going to do
the<00:00:31.769> install<00:00:33.110> stagger<00:00:34.110> pads<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the install stagger pads you have to

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
the install stagger pads you have to
make<00:00:35.430> sure<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> right<00:00:36.510> side<00:00:36.809> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
make sure that you got the right side so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.330 
make sure that you got the right side so
the<00:00:37.770> lettering<00:00:38.730> should<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.860> right<00:00:40.860> side<00:00:41.129> up

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the lettering should be right side up

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.920 
the lettering should be right side up
and<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> you're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and what you're going to do is you're

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.779 
and what you're going to do is you're
going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> try<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> put<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
going to try to put this on here and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.819 
going to try to put this on here and
this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> clear<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> difficult

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
this is the clear one which is difficult

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.770 
this is the clear one which is difficult
to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> without<00:00:47.760> bubbles<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:50.539> kind<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.600> did

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
to do it without bubbles I kind of did

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.700 
to do it without bubbles I kind of did
some<00:00:51.899> research<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.620> found<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.520> or<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
some research and I found a way or I

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.250 
some research and I found a way or I
think<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.920> found<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.520> good<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
think I found a good way to do it and it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
think I found a good way to do it and it
involves<00:00:58.739> using<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.129> tennis<00:00:59.489> ball<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.090> rotate

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
involves using a tennis ball to rotate

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.020 
involves using a tennis ball to rotate
on<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.649> stock<00:01:01.890> grip<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.640> move<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> along

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
on the stock grip as you move it along

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
on the stock grip as you move it along
and<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.840> kind<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.140> keeps<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.589> bubbles<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and it kind of keeps out the bubbles I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
and it kind of keeps out the bubbles I
tried<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> before<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> worked<00:01:07.170> pretty

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
tried it before and it worked pretty

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:17.440 
tried it before and it worked pretty
okay<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.390> let's<00:01:09.390> try<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.689> now

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.539 

all<00:01:17.990> right<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:18.350> just<00:01:18.530> peel<00:01:18.710> back<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:19.009> little<00:01:19.310> bit

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
all right so just peel back a little bit

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.850 
all right so just peel back a little bit
off<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.509> backing<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:22.700> start<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.060> off<00:01:23.860> just

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
off the backing just start it off just

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.249 
off the backing just start it off just
make<00:01:25.130> sure<00:01:25.369> you've<00:01:25.820> got<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:26.119> right<00:01:26.270> when

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
make sure you've got it right when

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.270 
make sure you've got it right when
you're<00:01:27.380> putting<00:01:27.649> it<00:01:27.830> on<00:01:30.100> you're<00:01:31.100> going<00:01:31.220> to

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
you're putting it on you're going to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.090 
you're putting it on you're going to
start<00:01:31.820> there

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.790 

do<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> softly

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:49.210 

how<00:01:39.310> to<00:01:39.370> get<00:01:39.580> out<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> air<00:01:39.970> bubbles

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.900 

and<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:49.760> go<00:01:49.940> along<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.780> tennis<00:01:51.230> ball

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:04.480 

little<00:01:55.910> by<00:01:56.060> little

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.559 

put<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:05.729> pressure<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:09.649> try<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.569> hold

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
put a little pressure on it try to hold

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:28.760 
put a little pressure on it try to hold
up<00:02:16.250> easier<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.400> do

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.900 

yeah

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910

yeah
we're<00:02:31.480> still<00:02:31.870> getting<00:02:32.020> bubbles<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:32.710> it's<00:02:33.430> not

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
we're still getting bubbles but it's not

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.630 
we're still getting bubbles but it's not
that<00:02:33.940> bad

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that bad

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.600 
that bad
move<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.790> out<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> little<00:02:37.150> bit<00:02:37.330> more<00:02:41.610> keep

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
move it out a little bit more keep

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
move it out a little bit more keep
pressure<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.950> rotate<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.580> ball

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.920

so<00:03:56.580> just<00:03:56.910> keep<00:03:57.090> going<00:03:57.450> on<00:03:57.709> keep<00:03:59.450> trying<00:04:00.450> till

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
so just keep going on keep trying till

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.979 
so just keep going on keep trying till
you<00:04:00.930> get<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.650> whole<00:04:01.860> thing<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.599> it<00:04:03.599> just<00:04:03.780> takes

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
you get the whole thing on it just takes

00:04:03.989 --> 00:06:06.250 
you get the whole thing on it just takes
time

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.680 

all<00:06:06.830> right<00:06:07.210> so<00:06:08.210> we've<00:06:08.360> got<00:06:08.390> it<00:06:08.750> on<00:06:08.900> and<00:06:10.690> it's

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
all right so we've got it on and it's

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.200 
all right so we've got it on and it's
not<00:06:11.810> perfect<00:06:12.410> what<00:06:13.220> we<00:06:13.340> can<00:06:13.550> do<00:06:13.730> is<00:06:13.970> try<00:06:14.180> to

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
not perfect what we can do is try to

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.510 
not perfect what we can do is try to
squeeze<00:06:14.570> out<00:06:14.810> as<00:06:14.960> much<00:06:14.990> as<00:06:15.350> you<00:06:15.380> can<00:06:15.680> up<00:06:16.250> any

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
squeeze out as much as you can up any

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.330 
squeeze out as much as you can up any
bubbles<00:06:16.970> that<00:06:17.180> are<00:06:17.600> there<00:06:18.040> when<00:06:19.040> you're<00:06:19.220> done

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
bubbles that are there when you're done

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.460 
bubbles that are there when you're done
with<00:06:19.580> the<00:06:19.640> ball<00:06:19.850> use<00:06:20.720> your<00:06:20.900> hand<00:06:21.140> to<00:06:21.350> go

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
with the ball use your hand to go

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.630 
with the ball use your hand to go
through<00:06:21.770> everything<00:06:24.010> it<00:06:25.010> doesn't<00:06:25.340> look<00:06:25.460> bad

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
through everything it doesn't look bad

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.810 
through everything it doesn't look bad
so<00:06:25.700> far<00:06:28.150> all<00:06:29.150> right<00:06:29.330> so<00:06:29.480> after<00:06:29.630> I'm<00:06:29.990> done<00:06:30.820> using

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
so far all right so after I'm done using

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.840 
so far all right so after I'm done using
a<00:06:32.060> tennis<00:06:32.360> ball<00:06:32.570> to<00:06:32.810> rub<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.500> area<00:06:33.710> on<00:06:34.550> what<00:06:34.820> I

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
a tennis ball to rub the area on what I

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.440 
a tennis ball to rub the area on what I
do<00:06:35.000> is<00:06:35.450> I<00:06:35.720> run<00:06:36.410> my<00:06:36.740> fingers<00:06:37.340> through<00:06:37.640> every

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
do is I run my fingers through every

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.210 
do is I run my fingers through every
single<00:06:38.930> line<00:06:40.240> here<00:06:41.240> and<00:06:41.480> then<00:06:42.080> down<00:06:42.440> like<00:06:42.740> that

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
single line here and then down like that

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.550 
single line here and then down like that
and<00:06:43.310> what<00:06:44.150> you're<00:06:44.300> left<00:06:44.540> with<00:06:44.750> is<00:06:44.930> a<00:06:45.500> very

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
and what you're left with is a very

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.710 
and what you're left with is a very
shallow<00:06:46.450> looking<00:06:47.450> bubbles<00:06:48.200> and<00:06:48.500> then<00:06:49.400> those<00:06:50.300> I

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
shallow looking bubbles and then those I

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.030 
shallow looking bubbles and then those I
think<00:06:51.080> will<00:06:51.680> go<00:06:51.860> away<00:06:52.160> in<00:06:52.660> once<00:06:53.710> it's<00:06:54.710> fully

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
think will go away in once it's fully

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.480 
think will go away in once it's fully
offset<00:06:56.140> but<00:06:57.140> then<00:06:57.350> if<00:06:57.620> you<00:06:57.800> have<00:06:57.980> any<00:06:58.190> bigger

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
offset but then if you have any bigger

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.370 
offset but then if you have any bigger
bubbles<00:06:59.470> you<00:07:00.470> can<00:07:00.580> use<00:07:01.580> a<00:07:01.610> pen<00:07:02.090> to<00:07:02.360> put<00:07:03.350> a

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
bubbles you can use a pen to put a

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.680 
bubbles you can use a pen to put a
little<00:07:03.680> hole<00:07:03.830> in<00:07:03.860> it<00:07:04.070> and<00:07:04.340> just<00:07:04.640> don't<00:07:05.090> try<00:07:05.660> to

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
little hole in it and just don't try to

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.620 
little hole in it and just don't try to
scratch<00:07:06.080> anything<00:07:06.530> and<00:07:06.760> just<00:07:07.760> push<00:07:08.450> it<00:07:08.600> down

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
scratch anything and just push it down

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.680 
scratch anything and just push it down
and<00:07:09.280> that's<00:07:10.280> pretty<00:07:10.490> much<00:07:10.610> what<00:07:11.330> I've<00:07:11.480> done

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
and that's pretty much what I've done

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.410 
and that's pretty much what I've done
and<00:07:11.960> it<00:07:12.740> looks<00:07:13.010> pretty<00:07:13.280> clear<00:07:13.550> after<00:07:14.180> a<00:07:14.210> couple

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 
and it looks pretty clear after a couple

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.240 
and it looks pretty clear after a couple
of<00:07:14.540> days<00:07:14.720> it<00:07:14.930> should<00:07:15.110> settle<00:07:15.440> it<00:07:15.710> settle<00:07:16.040> in<00:07:16.130> a

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
of days it should settle it settle in a

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.930 
of days it should settle it settle in a
little<00:07:16.280> bit<00:07:16.580> better<00:07:16.700> and<00:07:17.830> that<00:07:18.830> should<00:07:19.070> be<00:07:19.220> the

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
little bit better and that should be the

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.660 
little bit better and that should be the
finished<00:07:20.300> result
