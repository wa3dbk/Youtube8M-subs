00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
starting up if we can't do that then we

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.380

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
data off your computer we can also do a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.509 
data off your computer we can also do a
system<00:02:30.680> restore<00:02:30.739> that's<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> be<00:02:31.489> a

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
system restore that's going to be a

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.270 
system restore that's going to be a
little<00:02:31.640> bit<00:02:31.820> more<00:02:32.019> okay<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.530> guess<00:02:33.950> that's

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
little bit more okay so I guess that's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.160 
little bit more okay so I guess that's
better<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.820> do<00:02:34.970> then<00:02:35.150> send<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.630> back<00:02:35.780> because

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
better to do then send it back because

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.770 
better to do then send it back because
it's<00:02:36.440> still<00:02:36.620> under<00:02:36.769> warranty<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.780> maybe

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
it's still under warranty so maybe

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.390 
it's still under warranty so maybe
that's<00:02:39.019> not<00:02:39.200> covered<00:02:39.380> by<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.680> warranty<00:02:39.860> since

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
that's not covered by the warranty since

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.080 
that's not covered by the warranty since
it's<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:41.350> pulley<00:02:42.350> defective<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.070> sir<00:02:43.280> one<00:02:43.910> does

diagnostic<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.519> make<00:02:49.610> sure<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:50.030> not

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
diagnostic and make sure that it's not

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.340 
diagnostic and make sure that it's not
like<00:02:50.239> your<00:02:50.420> hard<00:02:50.600> drive<00:02:50.750> or<00:02:50.780> something<00:02:50.989> that's

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
like your hard drive or something that's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.949 
like your hard drive or something that's
you<00:02:51.530> know<00:02:51.560> really<00:02:52.370> my<00:02:52.580> stuff<00:02:52.850> okay<00:02:53.480> well<00:02:53.750> okay

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
you know really my stuff okay well okay

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.110 
you know really my stuff okay well okay
so<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.590> sounds<00:02:54.739> like<00:02:54.890> most<00:02:55.130> likely<00:02:55.489> HP<00:02:55.880> won't

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
so it sounds like most likely HP won't

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.940 
so it sounds like most likely HP won't
cover<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.630> then<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.900> guess<00:02:57.290> yeah<00:02:57.620> most<00:02:57.890> likely

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
cover that then I guess yeah most likely

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.289 
cover that then I guess yeah most likely
they<00:02:58.310> won't<00:02:58.459> we<00:02:58.610> just<00:02:58.820> needed<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.120> make<00:02:59.239> sure

they won't we just needed to make sure

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.210 
they won't we just needed to make sure
