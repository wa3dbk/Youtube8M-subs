00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.360

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.979
 full year place 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.380
 So good that this statement is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.380
 holding on to the defense and squeezing the front 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:16.290
 or always pulling it back too 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 behind with the others has no defense 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:42.569
 you can control and where the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.030

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:16.510

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:41.140
 hold the mine button and tighten the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.780
 defense and ended up squeezing the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.390
 all at the same time leaves the tv that without 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.459
