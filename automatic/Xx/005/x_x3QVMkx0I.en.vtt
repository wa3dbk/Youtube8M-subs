be<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:27.730> photon<00:02:28.730> streak<00:02:28.970> bouncer<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:31.180> sort

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
be a photon streak bouncer and sort

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.380 
be a photon streak bouncer and sort
breaker<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.990> in<00:02:33.440> theory<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.130> know<00:02:35.030> two<00:02:35.270> to
