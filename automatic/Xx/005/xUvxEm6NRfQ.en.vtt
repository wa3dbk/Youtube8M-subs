00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
it was going to die at one time because

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.870 
it was going to die at one time because
one<00:01:34.329> of<00:01:34.450> our<00:01:34.570> animals<00:01:35.159> started<00:01:36.159> eating<00:01:36.369> near

one of our animals started eating near
the<00:01:37.149> base<00:01:37.329> here<00:01:37.719> and<00:01:37.899> actually<00:01:38.289> took<00:01:38.560> almost

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
the base here and actually took almost

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.279 
the base here and actually took almost
half<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.789> tree<00:01:40.359> out<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.890> survived<00:01:42.399> it

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
half of the tree out and it survived it

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.429 
half of the tree out and it survived it
and<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.439> kind<00:01:44.649> of<00:01:44.710> just<00:01:45.959> bypassed<00:01:46.959> that<00:01:47.110> and

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
and it kind of just bypassed that and

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.929 
and it kind of just bypassed that and
just<00:01:47.560> kept<00:01:47.829> growing<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.399> getting<00:01:48.520> bigger<00:01:48.759> and

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
just kept growing and getting bigger and

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.499 
just kept growing and getting bigger and
bigger<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:50.079> so<00:01:50.709> here<00:01:50.979> we<00:01:51.100> are<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:55.329> the
