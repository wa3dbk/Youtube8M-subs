looking stuff I think we're going to see
an<00:00:47.309> improvement<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.910> his<00:00:48.320> 74.5<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
an improvement from his 74.5 over and

I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> 74.5<00:01:00.300> oh<00:01:02.420> we<00:01:03.420> take<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I think I'm on that 74.5 oh we take a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.350 
I think I'm on that 74.5 oh we take a
look<00:01:03.960> back<00:01:04.019> here's<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.460> hit<00:01:05.820> switch

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
look back here's that first hit switch

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.219 
look back here's that first hit switch
left<00:01:07.110> side<00:01:07.790> 900<00:01:08.790> hangs<00:01:09.090> out<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.600> seven<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
left side 900 hangs out the seven and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
left side 900 hangs out the seven and
then<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.380> quick<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:11.010> 180<00:01:11.490> mix<00:01:11.820> out<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> 9

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
then a quick little 180 mix out of 9

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
then a quick little 180 mix out of 9
landing<00:01:13.020> backwards<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
landing backwards right there and the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
landing backwards right there and the
big<00:01:15.090> combinations<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:15.960> definitely<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
big combinations are definitely the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
big combinations are definitely the
things<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> judges<00:01:17.369> love<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> see

switch<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:19.200> side<00:01:19.530> 720<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> switch

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
switch right side 720 so to switch

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.969 
switch right side 720 so to switch
tricks<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> left<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> right

1<00:01:23.280> 2<00:01:23.310> 901<00:01:23.909> a7<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.170> switching<00:01:25.500> things<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
1 2 901 a7 so switching things up in a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.090 
1 2 901 a7 so switching things up in a
big<00:01:26.549> way<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.119> there's<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> left<00:01:28.290> side<00:01:28.530> 900

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
big way there there's the left side 900

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
big way there there's the left side 900
could<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.430> cleaned<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.540> little

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
could have cleaned that one up a little

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
could have cleaned that one up a little
bit<00:01:31.200> no<00:01:31.470> doubles<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.220> run<00:01:32.460> i<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
bit no doubles in this run i think that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.300 
bit no doubles in this run i think that
those<00:01:33.659> those<00:01:33.990> could<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> only<00:01:34.530> negative

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
those those could be the only negative

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
those those could be the only negative
things<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.640> could<00:01:35.790> potentially<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
things you could potentially see the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.929 
things you could potentially see the
judges<00:01:37.439> beginning<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> point<00:01:38.340> out<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.759> their

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
judges beginning to point out in their

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.569 
judges beginning to point out in their
evaluation<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> run<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> grab

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
evaluation of this run look at the grab

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.420 
evaluation of this run look at the grab
right<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.150> Japan<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.320> life<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.100> such
