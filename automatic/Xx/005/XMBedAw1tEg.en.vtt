what<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.230> looks<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.529> out<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> box<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
what it looks like out of the box this

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.280 
what it looks like out of the box this
is<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.630> cargo<00:00:34.200> transport<00:00:35.989> helicopter<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
is the cargo transport helicopter like I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.569 
is the cargo transport helicopter like I
said<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.860> his<00:00:37.950> cup<00:00:38.100> repellers<00:00:38.460> on

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
said you can see his cup repellers on

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.950 
said you can see his cup repellers on
the<00:00:38.670> front<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.090> end<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.780> does

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the front in the back end so it does

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.319 
the front in the back end so it does
make<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.739> stable<00:00:41.309> I'd<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> say<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
make it really stable I'd have to say I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.540 
make it really stable I'd have to say I
think<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> easiest<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.800> fly<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
think this is the easiest to fly in the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.110 
think this is the easiest to fly in the
most<00:00:44.760> stable<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.360> any<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.730> micro<00:00:47.730> RC

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
most stable of any of the micro RC

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.029 
most stable of any of the micro RC
helicopters<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.110> I've<00:00:49.320> done<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> point

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
helicopters that I've done to this point

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
helicopters that I've done to this point
so<00:00:50.250> i'll<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.610> ahead<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.789> fly<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.059> around<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
so i'll go ahead and fly this around a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.029 
so i'll go ahead and fly this around a
little<00:00:51.629> bit<00:00:51.780> let<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> guys<00:00:52.289> check<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.649> just

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
little bit let you guys check out just

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
little bit let you guys check out just
how<00:00:53.219> easy<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> control<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
how easy this thing is to control and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
how easy this thing is to control and
just<00:00:55.590> how<00:00:55.710> stable<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.850> hover

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
just how stable it is and it's hover

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.240 
just how stable it is and it's hover
which<00:00:57.809> makes<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.260> fun<00:00:58.440> i<00:00:58.469> think<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> may<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
which makes it fun i think it may be a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.709 
which makes it fun i think it may be a
little<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.489> easier<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.850> younger<00:01:00.180> kids<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
little bit easier for younger kids and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.680 
little bit easier for younger kids and
stuff<00:01:00.930> too<00:01:01.190> alright<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> power<00:01:02.640> switch<00:01:03.570> is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
stuff too alright the power switch is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.929 
stuff too alright the power switch is
right<00:01:03.870> underneath<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.489> flip<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
right underneath here you just flip that

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.140 
right underneath here you just flip that
on<00:01:06.799> as<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.820> got<00:01:08.970> some

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
on as you can see it's actually got some

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
on as you can see it's actually got some
lights<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> stuff<00:01:09.930> underneath<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
lights and stuff underneath to which are

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.460 
lights and stuff underneath to which are
pretty<00:01:11.040> cool<00:01:11.750> alright<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.229> thing

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
pretty cool alright then this thing

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.880 
pretty cool alright then this thing
takes<00:01:13.860> six<00:01:14.310> double<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> batteries<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
takes six double a batteries and it is a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.600 
takes six double a batteries and it is a
3<00:01:17.490> channel<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.979> whoo<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
3 channel so you have just whoo just you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.200 
3 channel so you have just whoo just you
up<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.909> side

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
up down just the up down on this side

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
up down just the up down on this side
and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.200> down<00:01:25.409> left<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.070> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and then the up down left right on this

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
and then the up down left right on this
side<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.939> turn<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> helicopter<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
side so you can turn the helicopter and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.179 
side so you can turn the helicopter and
you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.350> make<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.560> forward<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:28.979> back<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you can make go forward and back and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
you can make go forward and back and
turn<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> left<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.810> right<00:01:30.960> let's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
turn it left and right all right let's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:58.399 
turn it left and right all right let's
see<00:01:31.259> how<00:01:31.350> she<00:01:31.439> does

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.740 

catch<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.219> little<00:01:59.369> bit<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.609> a<00:01:59.700> breeze<00:01:59.939> there

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.890 

now<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.950> how<00:02:05.160> how<00:02:05.850> stable<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
now you can see how how stable it is you

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.540 
now you can see how how stable it is you
kept<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> right<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.680> hand<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> take<00:02:08.340> off

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
kept it right in the hand and take off

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:47.500 
kept it right in the hand and take off
from<00:02:08.759> your<00:02:08.910> hand

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510
