00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.720 

the<00:00:00.719> anticoagulant<00:00:01.620> baits<00:00:01.829> can<00:00:02.129> be<00:00:02.250> used<00:00:02.490> for

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
the anticoagulant baits can be used for

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.840 
the anticoagulant baits can be used for
medical<00:00:02.909> control<00:00:03.859> anti<00:00:04.859> clients<00:00:05.490> are<00:00:05.609> baits

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
medical control anti clients are baits

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.760 
medical control anti clients are baits
that<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.180> animal<00:00:06.540> has<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.750> feed<00:00:07.200> on<00:00:07.410> for<00:00:07.740> a

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
that the animal has to feed on for a

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.089 
that the animal has to feed on for a
period<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.340> days<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.750> there<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.769> two<00:00:11.070> ways

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
period of days and so there are two ways

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.820 
period of days and so there are two ways
of<00:00:11.580> doing<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:12.090> either<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.630> put<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.679> out

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
of doing that either you can put it out

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.350 
of doing that either you can put it out
in<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> environment<00:00:14.730> but<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.179> to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
in the environment but you have to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.310 
in the environment but you have to
retreat<00:00:16.230> every<00:00:17.190> few<00:00:17.490> days<00:00:17.670> or<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.840> put<00:00:19.199> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
retreat every few days or you can put it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
retreat every few days or you can put it
in<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> bait<00:00:19.770> station<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> bait

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
in a bait station so this is a bait

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
in a bait station so this is a bait
station<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.680> an<00:00:22.769> appropriate

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
station this would be an appropriate

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.429 
station this would be an appropriate
size<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:23.640> metal<00:00:24.240> voles<00:00:24.449> about<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> 2-inch

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
size for metal voles about a 2-inch

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.660 
size for metal voles about a 2-inch
diameter<00:00:25.880> opening<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> animal<00:00:27.930> comes<00:00:28.199> in

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
diameter opening so the animal comes in

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.400 
diameter opening so the animal comes in
you<00:00:29.670> put<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> bait<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.170> kind<00:00:31.380> of

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
you put the bait in here so it's kind of

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.190 
you put the bait in here so it's kind of
like<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.679> feeding<00:00:32.550> station<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
like a feeding station if you will the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530 
like a feeding station if you will the
vole<00:00:34.410> comes<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.550> feed<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> bait

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
vole comes in you can feed on the bait

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.580 
vole comes in you can feed on the bait
and<00:00:36.840> leave<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> next<00:00:39.570> day<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.350> come

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and leave and the next day they can come

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.639 
and leave and the next day they can come
back<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.450> feed<00:00:42.780> some<00:00:43.020> more<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.440> that's

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
back in and feed some more so that's

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.049 
back in and feed some more so that's
what<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> have

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
what you have to have you have to have

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.150 
what you have to have you have to have
multiple<00:00:45.420> feedings<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> number<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.890> days

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
multiple feedings over a number of days

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.200 
multiple feedings over a number of days
for<00:00:47.550> metal<00:00:47.820> voles

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
for metal voles

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
for metal voles
now<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> things<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.739> metal<00:00:50.219> voles

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
now one of the things about metal voles

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
now one of the things about metal voles
is<00:00:50.700> they're<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.030> big<00:00:51.480> Rangers<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.890> into<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
is they're not big Rangers out into the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
is they're not big Rangers out into the
environment<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.780> were<00:00:54.899> using<00:00:55.199> bait

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
environment so if you were using bait

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.069 
environment so if you were using bait
stations<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.640> meadow<00:00:56.820> vole<00:00:57.030> control<00:00:57.539> you'd

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
stations for meadow vole control you'd

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
stations for meadow vole control you'd
have<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.590> them<00:00:58.829> right<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.340> areas<00:01:00.059> where

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
have to get them right into areas where

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.799 
have to get them right into areas where
metal<00:01:01.199> voles<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:02.070> found<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.420> would<00:01:03.660> have

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
metal voles are found so you would have

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
metal voles are found so you would have
to<00:01:03.989> put<00:01:04.199> them<00:01:04.439> near<00:01:05.100> their<00:01:05.309> burrows<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:06.119> near

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to put them near their burrows or near

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320 
to put them near their burrows or near
their<00:01:06.750> trails<00:01:07.400> put<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.270> were

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
their trails put them so that they were

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.660 
their trails put them so that they were
right<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> trail<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.159> trail<00:01:11.430> would

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
right on the trail so the trail would

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
right on the trail so the trail would
actually<00:01:12.030> lead<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> meadow<00:01:12.750> vole<00:01:13.049> into<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
actually lead the meadow vole into the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.270 
actually lead the meadow vole into the
bait<00:01:14.040> station<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.110> because<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
bait station so that is because the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.429 
bait station so that is because the
metal<00:01:17.460> bowls<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.450> range<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
metal bowls really don't range out and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
metal bowls really don't range out and
forage<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:20.640> large<00:01:20.909> areas<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> lot

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
forage over large areas there are a lot

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
forage over large areas there are a lot
of<00:01:22.650> different<00:01:23.220> kinds<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.700> bait<00:01:23.909> stations<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
of different kinds of bait stations that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.460 
of different kinds of bait stations that
you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.140> find<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.659> even<00:01:27.810> build<00:01:28.229> your

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you can find and you can even build your

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.530 
you can find and you can even build your
own<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> main<00:01:29.250> idea<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.150> want<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
own but the main idea is you want to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.590 
own but the main idea is you want to
have<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> bait<00:01:31.110> inside<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> metal<00:01:33.119> voles<00:01:33.299> can

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have the bait inside the metal voles can

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.020 
have the bait inside the metal voles can
come<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> secure<00:01:35.759> this

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
come in and out you want to secure this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.469 
come in and out you want to secure this
to<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> ground<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> fence<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.460> often<00:01:38.909> we

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to the ground or to a fence so often we

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.060 
to the ground or to a fence so often we
use<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.560> stake<00:01:41.270> where<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.509> would<00:01:43.290> place<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.860> if

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
use a stake where we would place this if

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
use a stake where we would place this if
there<00:01:44.250> were<00:01:44.399> metal<00:01:44.579> volt<00:01:44.939> rail<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.659> we

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
there were metal volt rail right here we

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
there were metal volt rail right here we
would<00:01:46.590> place<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> ground<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.210> then

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
would place that in the ground and then

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.940 
would place that in the ground and then
we<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.600> stake<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:51.450> is

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
we would stake it in so that it is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.450 
we would stake it in so that it is
secured<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.280> ground<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.920> be<00:01:55.920> picked

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
secured to the ground and will be picked

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.200 
secured to the ground and will be picked
up<00:01:56.700> taken<00:01:57.390> away<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.930> moved
