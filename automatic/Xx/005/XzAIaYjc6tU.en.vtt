back though is made out of different

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.540 
back though is made out of different
material<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.079> your<00:00:37.340> TPU<00:00:38.340> type

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
material so you have your TPU type

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.490 
material so you have your TPU type
material<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> edge<00:00:39.840> right<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.110> and

then the back is made out of a hard

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.450 
then the back is made out of a hard
plastic<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.379> case<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.860> implementation

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
plastic in this case the implementation

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
plastic in this case the implementation
is<00:00:44.610> clear<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> combination<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
is clear but you have the combination of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.279 
is clear but you have the combination of
two<00:00:46.890> materials<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.760> giving<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.719> nice

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
let's take a look and see how this case

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.560 
let's take a look and see how this case
looks<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.859> s5<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> we'll<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.420> ahead<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
looks on the s5 so we'll go ahead and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.960 
looks on the s5 so we'll go ahead and
take<00:01:03.780> our<00:01:03.809> rs5<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> i'll<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.549> ahead<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.700> slide

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
take our rs5 and i'll go ahead and slide

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.690 
take our rs5 and i'll go ahead and slide
it<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.439> notice<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.860> slid

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it in like this and you notice that slid

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.440 
it in like this and you notice that slid
in<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.510> easily<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.270> case

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
in really easily so we have the the case

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.789 
in really easily so we have the the case
in<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:12.900> let's<00:01:13.140> take<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> look<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.560> some<00:01:13.740> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the features of the case one of the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.609 
the features of the case one of the
things<00:01:15.540> i<00:01:15.630> always<00:01:15.659> look<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> case<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
things i always look for in a case is

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.499 
things i always look for in a case is
that<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:17.340> flush<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.150> actual

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
that it's not flush with the actual

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.700 
that it's not flush with the actual
screen<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> some

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
monitor are both exposed and if we put

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.550 
monitor are both exposed and if we put
it<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:28.760> an<00:02:28.849> angle<00:02:29.209> like<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.599> you'll<00:02:30.290> notice

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
it in an angle like this you'll notice

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.979 
it in an angle like this you'll notice
that<00:02:30.709> there<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.849> some<00:02:32.180> protection<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:32.959> a

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
that there is some protection this is a

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.229 
that there is some protection this is a
slimmer<00:02:33.440> case<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.310> while<00:02:34.519> there<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.849> some

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
slimmer case so while there is some

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.479 
slimmer case so while there is some
protection<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.840> not<00:02:36.079> as<00:02:36.230> deep<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.769> some<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
protection is not as deep as some of the

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.890 
protection is not as deep as some of the
other<00:02:37.640> cases<00:02:37.879> that<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.209> have<00:02:38.390> you'll<00:02:38.629> notice

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
other cases that we have you'll notice

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.420 
other cases that we have you'll notice
that<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.200> put<00:02:39.349> it<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:39.530> way<00:02:39.709> you'll<00:02:40.250> see

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that if I put it this way you'll see

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.640 
that if I put it this way you'll see
that<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.700> can't<00:02:41.000> see<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.390> camera<00:02:41.930> it's<00:02:42.440> not

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
that you can't see the camera it's not

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.309 
that you can't see the camera it's not
exposed<00:02:43.159> but<00:02:43.670> still<00:02:43.909> not<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.299> very<00:02:44.659> deep<00:02:45.019> case

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
exposed but still not a very deep case

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.140 
exposed but still not a very deep case
so<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:45.769> call<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.159> slim<00:02:46.579> profile

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
so that I would call this a slim profile

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.589 
so that I would call this a slim profile
case<00:02:47.450> when<00:02:48.109> it<00:02:48.230> comes<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.739> how<00:02:49.730> how<00:02:50.180> close

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
case when it comes to how how close

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.390 
case when it comes to how how close
you're<00:02:50.810> snug<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.409> fit<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.799> when<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.099> comes<00:02:52.280> to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you're snug the fit is when it comes to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.420 
you're snug the fit is when it comes to
your<00:02:52.459> phone<00:02:53.319> you'll<00:02:54.319> see<00:02:54.560> here<00:02:54.920> you're<00:02:55.099> cut

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430

nicely done it aligns well and on the
bottom<00:03:01.129> I've<00:03:01.609> been<00:03:01.790> doing<00:03:02.090> kind<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.569> test

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
bottom I've been doing kind of this test

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.479 
bottom I've been doing kind of this test
because<00:03:03.170> especially<00:03:03.769> now<00:03:04.099> with<00:03:04.159> this

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
because especially now with this

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.839 
because especially now with this
protective<00:03:05.139> kind<00:03:06.139> of<00:03:06.200> gasket<00:03:06.739> seal<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.609> have

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
protective kind of gasket seal you have

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.210 
protective kind of gasket seal you have
to<00:03:08.000> be<00:03:08.090> able<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.420> open<00:03:08.599> it<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.079> if<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.920> doesn't

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
to be able to open it and if it doesn't

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.580 
to be able to open it and if it doesn't
have<00:03:10.340> enough<00:03:10.639> of<00:03:10.909> a<00:03:11.329> gap<00:03:11.359> it<00:03:11.930> becomes<00:03:12.349> real

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
have enough of a gap it becomes real

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.960 
have enough of a gap it becomes real
difficult<00:03:13.010> for<00:03:13.129> you<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.250> get<00:03:13.430> your<00:03:13.549> nail<00:03:13.790> in
