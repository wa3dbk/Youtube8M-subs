what<00:00:00.450> makes<00:00:00.780> metal<00:00:01.110> storm<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:01.829> unique<00:00:02.220> and

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
what makes metal storm so unique and

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.220 
what makes metal storm so unique and
unlike<00:00:02.730> anything<00:00:03.179> that's<00:00:03.510> ever<00:00:03.720> come<00:00:04.020> before

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
unlike anything that's ever come before

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.829 
unlike anything that's ever come before
is<00:00:04.680> there's<00:00:05.370> basically<00:00:05.790> only<00:00:05.910> one<00:00:06.450> moving

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
is there's basically only one moving

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.509 
is there's basically only one moving
part<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.500> that's<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.580> bullet<00:00:10.130> metal<00:00:11.130> storms

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
part and that's the bullet metal storms

revolutionary<00:00:12.360> design<00:00:12.719> lies<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.469> combining

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
revolutionary design lies in combining

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.450 
revolutionary design lies in combining
the<00:00:14.040> barrel<00:00:14.370> with<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> magazine<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:17.070> bullets

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the barrel with the magazine the bullets

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.340 
the barrel with the magazine the bullets
are<00:00:17.580> preloaded<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> barrel<00:00:18.900> where<00:00:19.230> they

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
are preloaded into the barrel where they

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.220 
are preloaded into the barrel where they
are<00:00:19.410> lined<00:00:19.680> up<00:00:19.830> behind<00:00:20.189> each<00:00:20.609> other<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.080> can

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
are lined up behind each other so we can

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.890 
are lined up behind each other so we can
fire<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> much<00:00:23.039> faster<00:00:23.070> rate<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:26.900> these

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
fire at a much faster rate and these

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.990 
fire at a much faster rate and these
bullets<00:00:28.349> are<00:00:28.439> different<00:00:29.099> they're<00:00:29.670> fired
