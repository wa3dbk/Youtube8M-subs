00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 aldi quality advertises top prizes 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.790
 below 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 To the slip the discounter has the advertising 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.660
 true number one again cheaper 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 made the prices for meat and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.190
 poultry and the cold cuts to have that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.719
 company pressed the customer would have 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.880
 that is actually happy 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.390
 but with targeted demand sets 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.060
 think aldi puts it cheap 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 to make prices and as cheap as possible 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.150
 to buy everything 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
 what does that mean for the quality 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 By your sight , we think that you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.850
 gets worse 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 that's what you do with the others 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.239
 Business breaks only a certain amount 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.090
 quality already presupposed certain 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.129
 and with aldi praise I believe there 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.320
 just not really right 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 the refrigerated counter of this market is still emblazoned 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 the cheaper sign chicken breast fillet 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.129
 five cheap good schnitzel 3 percent 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.829
 girl almost checked 7 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.110
 the competitors moved quickly after all 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.410
 the time of this price round has 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.730
 a striking taste 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.039
 on the 18th of february the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.489
 poultry farming their 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.500
 self commitment back 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 exclusively GMO-free feed 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.950
 medium to use 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.810
 in other words that much cheaper 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.180
 genetically modified feed can 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.710
 to be used arbitrarily on the seventh 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.479
 march two and a half weeks later 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 aldi lowered the price of butter 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.189
 a day later for putter hook and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.890
 One week later, the prices fell 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.210
 poultry for cold cuts of pork 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.460
 a connection between these 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.220
 price reductions and the use of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.610
 Aldi Süd offers cheaper feed 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.990
 written back to wiso 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.000
 years ago we have it on 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.790
 pointed out that it is the reference 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.869
 of GMO-free feeds 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.880
 due to the global market development 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.979
 could make it more difficult in the future 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.899
 This development is also currently affecting 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.159
 on the area fresh poultry too 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.890
 this topic has to do with the current ones 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.759
 However, price cuts do nothing 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.500
 that contradicts greenpeace has the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.850
 responsibility and love as you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.829
 produce meat and what that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 offer consumers and that has all 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.920
 clearly what about the feed prices 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.079
 also to do and with the statement of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.020
 poultry farming in the future no more 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.879
 use on GM-free goods 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.289
 because you have to look carefully at neither 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.580
 that has responsibility and that is here 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.380
 The trade and he can say very clearly 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.780
 designers are produced on the meat 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 should have which qualities and at 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.050
 must do that too if he has environmental damage 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.720
 and maybe health damage 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.850
 wants to exclude so that the masthühner 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.710
 grow fast breeders 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.970
 mainly so yes that's it 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.380
 genetically modified and not 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.200
 genetically modified 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.980
 the main producers in south and south 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.840
 North America shipping both 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 plant varieties according to the huge quantities 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.830
 europe both variants when transporting 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.960
 not to mix so explain 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.510
 genetic engineering is an expert in wiso 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.040
 very elaborate that is the reproach of 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.170
 Connected food without genetic engineering 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.180
 if the poultry industry stops working 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.520
 pay and claim it simply exists 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.380
 not enough genetically engineered son 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.910
 The soy processed in Brazil and 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.780
 they must actually know 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.040
 said that in 2014 ten percent more 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.260
 GMO-free soy is harvested as 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.890
 2013 from a lack you can here 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.470
 do not speak 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.400
 he claims that free goods are not 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.090
 available 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.060
 either he has no idea or either 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.640
 quite deliberately disappointed eating pigs 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.560
 since the late 1990s he too 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.480
 genetically modified soybean 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.310
 meat price for the animals of farmer 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.440
 jörn ehlers determine other components 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.390
 For example, Russia at the moment because of 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.820
 swine flu in baltic no 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.530
 pork in the eu buys for the 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.900
 there is therefore no demand for animals 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.700
 at the moment little money how much learns 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.170
 farmer elas over the internet 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.180
 this week, the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.519
 then slaughter company on its own 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.280
 We are told that spain wants us 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.170
 get less and then you can 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.450
 I decide to deliver to them 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.970
 terms available or I love all even 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.070
 do not have to sell ehlers and hear 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.440
 his colleagues still are the animals 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.870
 fast big that brings the trade 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.239
 a good negotiating position does not 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.250
 few experts expect therefore in this 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.670
 a further price fight at the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.670
 meat
