00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.570 
language python and I'm now learning pi
gain<00:00:04.230> which<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:04.859> doing<00:00:05.009> more<00:00:05.160> graphical

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
mover photo resizer and photo rotator

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.850 
mover photo resizer and photo rotator
and<00:00:36.059> those<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.660> three<00:00:37.140> files<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.590> games

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and those are the three files on games

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.229 
and those are the three files on games
i'm<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> show<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.340> 28<00:00:38.550> nut<00:00:38.760> games<00:00:38.969> but

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
i'm going to show you 28 nut games but

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.709 
i'm going to show you 28 nut games but
programs<00:00:39.690> using<00:00:39.989> pi<00:00:40.260> game<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.719> they're

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
programs using pi game and they're

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
programs using pi game and they're
pretty<00:00:42.960> simple<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.829> I'm<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.070> start<00:00:44.190> them

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
pretty simple so I'm going to start them

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.350 
pretty simple so I'm going to start them
up<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.120> first<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.510> photo<00:00:46.170> mover<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
up here the first one is photo mover and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
up here the first one is photo mover and
it's<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.539> simple<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> displays<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.770> photo<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it's just simple it displays a photo and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.420 
it's just simple it displays a photo and
I<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.539> drag<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.809> around<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:52.530> finger<00:00:52.860> now

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
I can drag it around with my finger now

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.979 
I can drag it around with my finger now
all<00:00:53.640> three<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> these<00:00:54.090> applications<00:00:54.780> since

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
all three of these applications since

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.420 
all three of these applications since
they're<00:00:55.170> written<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.469> Python<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.039> pygame

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
they're written in Python with pygame

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.130 
they're written in Python with pygame
should<00:00:57.329> run<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:58.199> only<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:58.649> nokia<00:00:59.070> 900<00:00:59.910> but

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
should run not only on my nokia 900 but

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.520 
should run not only on my nokia 900 but
any<00:01:01.140> modern<00:01:01.710> distribution<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.640> linux<00:01:03.530> might

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
any modern distribution of linux might

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
any modern distribution of linux might
have<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.769> install<00:01:04.979> pygame<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.670> i<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:05.939> most

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
have to install pygame but i think most

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.679 
have to install pygame but i think most
of<00:01:06.210> them<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.510> pygame<00:01:06.960> installed<00:01:07.409> by<00:01:08.400> default

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
of them have pygame installed by default

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.440 
of them have pygame installed by default
and<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.170> should<00:01:10.380> also<00:01:10.530> run<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.180> mac<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and this should also run on mac and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.230 
and this should also run on mac and
windows<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:13.470> might<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:14.070> setup<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
windows but there might be some setup to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
windows but there might be some setup to
do<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:16.049> Mac<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.770> Python<00:01:17.340> installed<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
do I know Mac has Python installed I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
do I know Mac has Python installed I
don't<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.119> has<00:01:18.240> pygame<00:01:18.689> installed<00:01:19.110> by

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
don't know if has pygame installed by

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
don't know if has pygame installed by
default<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.860> Windows<00:01:20.759> doesn't<00:01:20.970> have

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
default and Windows doesn't have

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
default and Windows doesn't have
anything<00:01:21.659> installed<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.130> you'll<00:01:23.340> have

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
anything installed of use so you'll have

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.469 
anything installed of use so you'll have
to<00:01:23.549> go<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.880> download<00:01:25.130> Python<00:01:26.130> n<00:01:26.610> PI<00:01:26.850> game<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
to go and download Python n PI game and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.080 
to go and download Python n PI game and
set<00:01:27.689> those<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.320> your<00:01:28.710> Windows<00:01:28.979> machine<00:01:29.340> but

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
set those up on your Windows machine but

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.620 
set those up on your Windows machine but
anyway<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:30.900> my<00:01:31.110> photo<00:01:31.619> move<00:01:32.450> next<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
anyway that's my photo move next is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.120 
anyway that's my photo move next is
photo<00:01:33.930> resizer<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.049> are<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> go

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
photo resizer so here we are going to go

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.969 
photo resizer so here we are going to go
like<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.619> from<00:01:40.619> left<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
like this and I can go from left to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.190 
like this and I can go from left to
right<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.430> squish<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> picture<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
right to squish the picture and up to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590 
right to squish the picture and up to
squish<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> picture<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> that's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
squish the picture that way so that's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
squish the picture that way so that's
simple<00:01:46.140> little<00:01:46.680> manipulating<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> photo

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
simple little manipulating of a photo

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.539 
simple little manipulating of a photo
there<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.320> last<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.740> photo<00:01:50.040> rotate

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
there and the last one is photo rotate

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.690 
there and the last one is photo rotate
photo<00:01:51.420> rotate<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.320> move<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:53.070> as<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.310> move<00:01:53.549> it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
photo rotate will move but as I move it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.179 
photo rotate will move but as I move it
rotates<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> image<00:01:54.509> around<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:55.979> hoping

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
rotates the image around so I'm hoping

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.310 
rotates the image around so I'm hoping
