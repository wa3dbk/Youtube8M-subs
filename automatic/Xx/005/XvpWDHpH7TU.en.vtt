00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.859
 and I hope I 'm great perfectly 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 well I like it yet I did not see my channel now 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.730
 let's play private game let's 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 play against bots but I'm going to put this 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.990
 on veteran difficulty what do you mean 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.580
 playing against troubled bots 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.929
 the new truth is that the bots are 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 They put recruits pretty simple 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.140
 play not but if you put it in veteran it's 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.660
 play with I do not know is that they are god only the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.609
 bots on maximum difficulty are god and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.349
 let's play with evil and I have here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.630
 the class made this is the class should 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.160
 use I've put on and a p because it's 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.530
 against everything and it's no use putting 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.520
 Mena the tactical distraction do not let's 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 play to see if it is possible to win the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.360
 game has tried me before I was bear 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 from the first time I'm playing in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.010
 this difficulty is going to be now this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.180
 departure is the first voucher 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.469
 I do not know I do not know if this is really going to be 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.769
 is going to be with phil if it's going to turn out 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:03.530
 easy I do not know let's check it now 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.420
 same live well done here exposes 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.520
 you have to leave one that left 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.520
 of mission correct right now 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.590
 and that's how I think you have done it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.590
 but he said he gave himself twice my mother 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.600
 my mother 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.020
 yes yes that will cost me more 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.939
 shit yeah it's going to cost me I did with the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.750

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.650
 marker 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.650
 in the valleys 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.970

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.260
 son of a bitch like you know I 'm there is 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.000

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.160
 son of a bitch must be said more son of 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.160
 bitch more 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.180
 waiting 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.860
 is that there are two with shields of goats 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.610

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.830
 the 66 that I'll keep it all the time 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.180
 for the riot shield because not 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.450
 there is another way to kill her and if she comes 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 of face 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.390

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.930

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.569
 of that you have to film that I'm having 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.640
 the cognac the two and marquez remained 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.640
 and got more to give the uncle the end 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.460
 do not 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.730
 cabrÃ³n campero 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.680
 and how do they know what it does and if there is not 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.610
 nothing we're going to see what I've done to 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.610
 one and companions 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.400
 host weeks as I have eaten 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.980
 with the format if it killed him well 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.230
 Over there 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.470
 out there material world bank there's no 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.470
 luck 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:10.230
 that I die very important the streak 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.230
 but I really do not know if they go to success 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.560
 of month 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.060
 for you really are being low 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.680
 easy is the shield 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.680
 I have one attempt left a stretch 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.090
 do not kill me 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.180
 with the sk quite low at the end voice of 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.960
 shit 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.880
 as a low and we are already here 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.100
 We will finish finishing what will happen to us 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.840
 the usual will be the usual 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.490
 that we started super well and in the end 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.220
 we finish there they are leaving the pussy with 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.110
 it has not been so hard for me 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.730
 it costs the maximum difficulty true what 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.820
 I'm going to check now to see if I've been 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.910
 gone the clamp and I've put it in 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.590
 another difficulty we had did not have 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.000
 I was lucky that the one on the shield was 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.490
 all the time of our found 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.770
 It was easy then for no razor 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.509
 I do not know how many casualties you can do with me 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.180
 the one of the shield I do not know then there's the 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:19.889
 maximum difficulty or not 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:23.490
 or not if veteran recruits veteran appointment 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.949
 that is the maxim, because nothing 202 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.930
 simply because I wanted to, I wanted to 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.689
 try this I hope you liked the 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.810
 video and I could try more little things 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.629
 we play like this against you in this 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.760
 maximum or even truth and is that I 'm not going 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.130
 to agree on the challenge that I made 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.430
 a long time ago that good 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.710
 it did consumer and willy that was the challenge 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.110
 I am god is in private game in 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.780
 I think they did not know me for five minutes 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.360
 how much they could kill and we arrived 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.560
 at 200 casualties I think I remember something like that 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.630
 of our says talking about elche 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.180
 speaking from memory is we could 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.080
 try to do is to know if in five 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.900
 minutes only playing with the 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.910
 ballista we would be able to do more 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.280
 of 200 losses without gusts because in that 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.380
 video we use gusts and obviously 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.120
 they throw the dogs and start going to 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.340
 eat teles for unai papa dad 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.580
 we could kill just try to make us 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.380
 in five minutes 200 casualties only 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:28.510
 200 options in the genome well I think 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:32.230
 that 200 and make the 200 casualties only 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.760
 using the ballista if you would like 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.350
 let's try some challenge so maybe I 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.780
 I'm corrupting too much and doing that 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.840
 impossible but you would like it 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.210
 let's make a challenge a challenge so 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.490
 just tell me in the comments 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.099
 what will I try to try to bring 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.960
 new people this has been all for this 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.550
 video I hope you liked it and we 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.690
 we will see in a following video use to 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.690
 all until next time
