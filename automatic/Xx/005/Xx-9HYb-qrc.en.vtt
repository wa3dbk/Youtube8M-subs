00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.350 
in this story you you will as well
because<00:00:24.430> it's<00:00:24.580> really<00:00:24.759> from<00:00:24.880> Caesars<00:00:25.180> point

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
because it's really from Caesars point

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.300 
because it's really from Caesars point
of<00:00:25.420> view<00:00:25.539> but<00:00:25.990> the<00:00:26.140> human<00:00:26.440> story<00:00:26.619> is<00:00:26.830> also<00:00:27.160> very

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
of view but the human story is also very

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.040 
of view but the human story is also very
relatable<00:00:27.760> and<00:00:27.940> it<00:00:28.000> makes<00:00:28.180> it<00:00:28.270> a<00:00:28.359> very<00:00:28.390> complex

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
relatable and it makes it a very complex

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.720 
relatable and it makes it a very complex
problem<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.619> I<00:00:30.039> think<00:00:30.070> that<00:00:30.369> that's<00:00:30.400> going<00:00:30.670> to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
problem and I think that that's going to

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.890 
problem and I think that that's going to
be<00:00:30.820> exciting<00:00:31.029> for<00:00:31.210> an<00:00:31.359> audience<00:00:31.480> so<00:00:31.779> I'm

thing for me and what I realized by

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.020 
thing for me and what I realized by
looking<00:04:19.780> at<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.049> was<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:21.459> key<00:04:21.760> to

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
looking at that was that the key to

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.050 
looking at that was that the key to
motion<00:04:22.660> capture<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:23.860> actor<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.370> if<00:04:24.880> you

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
motion capture is the actor that if you

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.150 
motion capture is the actor that if you
can<00:04:25.240> get<00:04:25.419> a<00:04:25.450> performance<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.160> authentic

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
can get a performance that is authentic

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.890 
can get a performance that is authentic
and<00:04:27.310> emotional<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.390> that's<00:04:28.540> going<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.750> come

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
and emotional that that's going to come

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.330 
and emotional that that's going to come
across<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.470> genius<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.100> way<00:04:30.220> that

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
across and the genius is the way that

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.320 
across and the genius is the way that
wet<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.669> able<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:30.940> translate<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:31.570> but
