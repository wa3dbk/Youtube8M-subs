00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
importantly than the other is a DSLR but

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.500 
importantly than the other is a DSLR but
we<00:00:22.890> come<00:00:23.010> along<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> minute<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
we come along to that in a minute if you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.179 
we come along to that in a minute if you
and<00:00:24.689> wanted<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> just<00:00:25.380> run<00:00:25.560> us<00:00:25.680> through<00:00:25.920> um

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and wanted to just run us through um

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.790 
and wanted to just run us through um
your<00:00:26.580> two<00:00:26.760> lenses<00:00:27.119> first<00:00:27.390> start<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.560> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
your two lenses first start with that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.970 
your two lenses first start with that
this<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.660> 150<00:00:31.439> mil<00:00:31.619> macro

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this this one this is a 150 mil macro

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
this this one this is a 150 mil macro
lens<00:00:32.189> okay<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> we've<00:00:33.390> had<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.630> 150<00:00:34.050> no<00:00:34.170> desire

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
lens okay and we've had it 150 no desire

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520 
lens okay and we've had it 150 no desire
to<00:00:34.739> 2.8<00:00:35.219> I've<00:00:35.760> had<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> design<00:00:36.420> similar<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
to 2.8 I've had a design similar in the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
to 2.8 I've had a design similar in the
past<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> new<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:39.360> an

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
past but this is a new one with an

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.569 
past but this is a new one with an
optical<00:00:39.719> stabilizer<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
optical stabilizer here and so this is

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
optical stabilizer here and so this is
also<00:00:41.790> great<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.120> macro<00:00:42.450> photography<00:00:42.980> because

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
also great for macro photography because

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650 
also great for macro photography because
when<00:00:44.160> you're<00:00:44.280> close<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.000> know<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
when you're close as you know you can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.029 
when you're close as you know you can
get<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> lot<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> camera<00:00:46.530> shake<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.860> you're<00:00:46.980> not

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
get a lot of camera shake if you're not

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.310 
get a lot of camera shake if you're not
using<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.370> tripod<00:00:47.550> these<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> yeah<00:00:48.809> that's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
using a tripod these are the yeah that's

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.950 
using a tripod these are the yeah that's
a<00:00:49.410> useful<00:00:49.559> feature<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.660> on<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> side

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
a useful feature to have on the side

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.529 
a useful feature to have on the side
you'll<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.320> there's<00:00:53.120> different<00:00:54.120> positions

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you'll see there's different positions

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
you'll see there's different positions

also wildlife photographers you

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.560 
also wildlife photographers you
what<00:01:30.100> for<00:01:30.340> or<00:01:30.370> two<00:01:30.640> times<00:01:30.820> converters<00:01:31.390> on<00:01:31.510> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
what for or two times converters on the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.450 
back of their bringing maybe a 600 mil
5.6<00:01:34.300> so<00:01:34.630> that's<00:01:34.840> still<00:01:35.080> autofocus<00:01:35.740> definitely

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
5.6 so that's still autofocus definitely

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.400 
5.6 so that's still autofocus definitely
still<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:36.940> you've<00:01:37.300> got<00:01:37.480> I<00:01:37.900> understand<00:01:38.320> you've

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
still and you've got I understand you've

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.470 
still and you've got I understand you've
got<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> new<00:01:38.740> coating<00:01:39.160> on<00:01:39.280> this<00:01:39.430> lens<00:01:40.120> as<00:01:40.300> well

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
got a new coating on this lens as well

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.140 
got a new coating on this lens as well
yes<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.350> does<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.740> there's<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.520> new<00:01:42.670> finish<00:01:42.970> to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
yes it does and there's a new finish to

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.600 
yes it does and there's a new finish to
the<00:01:43.240> outside<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.930> there's<00:01:44.470> special<00:01:45.190> coatings

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
the outside and there's special coatings

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.190 
the outside and there's special coatings
to<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.910> glass<00:01:46.120> as<00:01:46.360> well<00:01:46.390> just<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.840> cut<00:01:46.990> down<00:01:47.140> on

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
to the glass as well just to cut down on

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.860 
to the glass as well just to cut down on
reflections<00:01:48.450> ghosting<00:01:49.450> which<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.690> very

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
reflections ghosting which is very

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.140 
reflections ghosting which is very
similar<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.140> Blair<00:01:50.440> yeah<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.670> also<00:01:51.790> with<00:01:52.060> this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
similar to Blair yeah and also with this

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.900 
similar to Blair yeah and also with this
it<00:01:52.390> comes<00:01:52.690> with<00:01:52.930> o-ring<00:01:53.290> ceilings<00:01:53.760> so<00:01:54.760> it's

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
it comes with o-ring ceilings so it's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.330 
it comes with o-ring ceilings so it's
weatherproof<00:01:55.210> so<00:01:55.780> if<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.710> take<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:56.920> out<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
weatherproof so if you take it out in a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.830 
weatherproof so if you take it out in a
light<00:01:57.670> shower<00:01:57.910> or<00:01:58.210> in<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.450> desert<00:01:58.780> for

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
light shower or in the desert for

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.990 
light shower or in the desert for
example<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.410> will<00:01:59.500> resist<00:02:00.040> getting<00:02:00.190> sand<00:02:00.670> or

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
example it will resist getting sand or

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.840 
example it will resist getting sand or
watering<00:02:01.540> them<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.890> really<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.400> made<00:02:03.580> for<00:02:03.760> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
watering them so really is made for the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.030 
watering them so really is made for the
elements<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.330> them<00:02:04.480> certainly<00:02:05.470> for<00:02:05.620> pro<00:02:05.800> use

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040
