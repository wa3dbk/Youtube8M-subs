00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the level changes the level changes are

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.280 
the level changes the level changes are
pretty<00:02:36.040> much<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.310> only<00:02:36.340> difference<00:02:37.150> now<00:02:37.390> I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
pretty much the only difference now I

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.930 
pretty much the only difference now I
have<00:02:38.500> Roy<00:02:38.710> Kapoor<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.250> at<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.460> front<00:02:39.610> i'm

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
have Roy Kapoor up at the front i'm

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.000 
have Roy Kapoor up at the front i'm
going<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.150> use<00:02:40.360> nasty<00:02:40.990> plot<00:02:41.460> against<00:02:42.460> gyarados

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
going to use nasty plot against gyarados

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.260 
going to use nasty plot against gyarados
because<00:02:45.010> that'll<00:02:45.280> raise<00:02:45.460> my<00:02:45.610> special<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.150> that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
because that'll raise my special to that

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.480 
because that'll raise my special to that
can<00:02:46.420> kind<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.660> set<00:02:46.840> me<00:02:46.990> up<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.440> also<00:02:48.010> if<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
can kind of set me up and also if you

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.310 
can kind of set me up and also if you
didn't<00:02:48.760> remember<00:02:48.970> from<00:02:49.360> before<00:02:50.200> gyarados<00:02:51.160> is

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
didn't remember from before gyarados is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.630 
didn't remember from before gyarados is
has<00:02:53.320> intimidates<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.250> anything<00:02:54.610> that's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
has intimidates so anything that's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.620 
has intimidates so anything that's
physical<00:02:55.300> probably<00:02:55.870> will<00:02:56.110> not<00:02:56.320> do<00:02:56.620> as<00:02:56.800> well

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
physical probably will not do as well

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.660 
physical probably will not do as well
against<00:02:58.630> ciertos<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.380> yeah<00:03:02.980> Thunder<00:03:03.430> pull

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
against ciertos so yeah Thunder pull

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.610 
against ciertos so yeah Thunder pull
Thunderbolt<00:03:04.480> will<00:03:04.630> definitely<00:03:05.170> take<00:03:05.320> him<00:03:05.470> out

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
Thunderbolt will definitely take him out

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.350 
Thunderbolt will definitely take him out
because<00:03:05.770> these<00:03:05.980> four<00:03:06.370> times<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.910> week<00:03:07.090> to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
because these four times a week to

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.960 
because these four times a week to
electric<00:03:08.020> so<00:03:08.260> even<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.130> physical<00:03:09.580> electric

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
electric so even if physical electric

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.190 
electric so even if physical electric
moves<00:03:10.180> should<00:03:10.300> probably<00:03:10.690> take<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:10.960> out

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
moves should probably take this out

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.070 
moves should probably take this out
something<00:03:12.130> like<00:03:12.220> thunder<00:03:12.700> fang<00:03:12.940> or<00:03:13.210> spark<00:03:13.780> if

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
something like thunder fang or spark if

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.490 
something like thunder fang or spark if
you're<00:03:14.560> using<00:03:14.710> a<00:03:14.860> luxray<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.290> should<00:03:17.470> be

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
you're using a luxray and you should be

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.640 
you're using a luxray and you should be
using<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.890> luxray<00:03:18.160> not<00:03:18.430> alexia<00:03:19.230> he<00:03:20.230> also<00:03:20.380> has

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
using the luxray not alexia he also has

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.090 
using the luxray not alexia he also has
Quagsire<00:03:21.340> which<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:22.120> part<00:03:22.720> ground<00:03:23.050> type<00:03:23.320> which

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
Quagsire which is part ground type which

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.280 
Quagsire which is part ground type which
means<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:24.580> is<00:03:24.700> resistant<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.780> electric

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
means that it is resistant to electric

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.260 
means that it is resistant to electric
types<00:03:26.470> but<00:03:26.830> it's<00:03:27.100> four<00:03:27.340> times<00:03:27.520> week<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.000> grass

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
types but it's four times week to grass

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.800 
types but it's four times week to grass
types<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:30.010> that's<00:03:30.310> why<00:03:30.430> I've<00:03:30.550> grass<00:03:30.790> not<00:03:31.090> now

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
types so that's why I've grass not now

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.880 
types so that's why I've grass not now
grass<00:03:32.080> not<00:03:32.350> is<00:03:33.340> grass<00:03:33.970> knots<00:03:34.180> power<00:03:34.480> is

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
grass not is grass knots power is

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.500 
grass not is grass knots power is
dependent<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.010> how<00:03:36.280> heavy<00:03:36.640> your<00:03:36.910> opponent<00:03:37.360> is

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
dependent on how heavy your opponent is

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.980 
dependent on how heavy your opponent is
but<00:03:38.100> four<00:03:39.100> times<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.400> week<00:03:39.610> nastyplot<00:03:40.540> i'm

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
but four times a week nastyplot i'm

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.920 
but four times a week nastyplot i'm
pretty<00:03:41.350> sure<00:03:41.530> it's<00:03:41.710> going<00:03:41.860> to<00:03:42.010> die<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.930> last

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
pretty sure it's going to die and last

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.690 
pretty sure it's going to die and last
is<00:03:44.200> floatzel<00:03:45.690> floatzel<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:47.460> pretty<00:03:48.460> much<00:03:48.550> the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
is floatzel floatzel is pretty much the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.820 
is floatzel floatzel is pretty much the
same<00:03:48.880> as<00:03:49.090> before<00:03:49.240> i<00:03:49.480> don't<00:03:49.750> think<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.960> got<00:03:50.530> any

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
same as before i don't think it got any

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.060 
same as before i don't think it got any
new<00:03:51.010> moves<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.610> was<00:03:52.210> Aquajet<00:03:52.930> ice<00:03:53.170> fang<00:03:53.560> crunch

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
new moves I was Aquajet ice fang crunch

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.840 
new moves I was Aquajet ice fang crunch
any<00:03:54.670> other<00:03:54.850> moves<00:03:55.320> all<00:03:56.320> right<00:03:56.530> now<00:03:57.160> I'm<00:03:57.430> almost

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
any other moves all right now I'm almost

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.650 
any other moves all right now I'm almost
positive<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:59.220> an<00:04:00.220> aqua<00:04:00.910> jet<00:04:00.940> will<00:04:01.300> kill<00:04:01.450> me

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
positive that a an aqua jet will kill me

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.330 
positive that a an aqua jet will kill me
and<00:04:01.780> I'm<00:04:01.900> even<00:04:02.200> pretty<00:04:02.620> sure<00:04:02.770> that<00:04:02.920> floatzel

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
and I'm even pretty sure that floatzel

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.449 
and I'm even pretty sure that floatzel
is<00:04:03.490> just<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:03.880> general<00:04:04.570> faster<00:04:05.290> than<00:04:05.440> me<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.430> I

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
is just in general faster than me so I

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.790 
is just in general faster than me so I
need<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.700> make<00:04:06.760> sure<00:04:07.180> that<00:04:07.660> I'm<00:04:08.440> at<00:04:08.620> full

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
need to make sure that I'm at full

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.760 
need to make sure that I'm at full
health<00:04:09.010> before<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.640> try<00:04:10.180> any<00:04:10.600> electric<00:04:11.560> moves

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
health before I try any electric moves

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.810 
health before I try any electric moves
against<00:04:12.100> them

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
against them

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.920 
against them
so<00:04:14.820> just<00:04:15.420> heal<00:04:15.900> up<00:04:16.110> right<00:04:16.380> there<00:04:17.510> tuba<00:04:18.510> dulce

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
so just heal up right there tuba dulce

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.850 
so just heal up right there tuba dulce
was<00:04:19.050> going<00:04:19.170> to<00:04:19.230> go<00:04:19.350> for<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.560> Aquajet<00:04:21.860> all

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
was going to go for the Aquajet all

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.950 
was going to go for the Aquajet all
right<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.100> think<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.580> can<00:04:23.730> survive<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:24.090> crunch<00:04:24.600> if

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
right I think I can survive a crunch if

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.390 
right I think I can survive a crunch if
he<00:04:25.080> tries<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.620> because<00:04:25.980> that's<00:04:26.190> what

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
he tries that because that's what

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.100 
he tries that because that's what
happened<00:04:26.700> on<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:26.820> yeah<00:04:27.450> there<00:04:27.690> he<00:04:27.750> goes<00:04:27.900> that

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
happened on the yeah there he goes that

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.330 
happened on the yeah there he goes that
that's<00:04:28.380> what<00:04:28.530> happened<00:04:28.560> on<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.890> ustream

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
that's what happened on the ustream

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.820 
that's what happened on the ustream
battle<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:29.970> should<00:04:30.750> survive<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.380> there<00:04:31.620> we

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
battle so should survive that there we

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.460 
battle so should survive that there we
go<00:04:32.070> in<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:33.120> Thunderbolt<00:04:33.750> hopefully<00:04:34.320> we'll

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
go in this Thunderbolt hopefully we'll

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.040 
go in this Thunderbolt hopefully we'll
take<00:04:34.650> him<00:04:34.770> out<00:04:36.320> so<00:04:37.320> let's<00:04:37.470> say<00:04:37.970> going<00:04:39.050> going

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
take him out so let's say going going

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.080 
take him out so let's say going going
and<00:04:40.620> he's<00:04:40.860> gone<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.780> there<00:04:43.170> we<00:04:43.320> go<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.800> was

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
and he's gone so there we go that was

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.990
