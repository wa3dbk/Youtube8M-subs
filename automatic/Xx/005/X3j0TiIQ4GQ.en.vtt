00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.010 
lot o when you're playing Ellis you have
to<00:01:10.700> actually<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> lot<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.299> kha'zix

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to actually do a lot more than kha'zix

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780

during<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> early<00:01:13.770> game<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.430> spirit

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
during the early game which spirit

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
during the early game which spirit
didn't<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:16.890> Meadows<00:01:17.100> did<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> really

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
didn't and I think Meadows did a really

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.539 
didn't and I think Meadows did a really
good<00:01:17.670> job<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.180> farming<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.340> growing<00:01:20.340> as
