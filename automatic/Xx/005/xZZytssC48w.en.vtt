00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.490
 another video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.440
 I often get with that people themselves 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.719
 have considered one of the two new 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.670
 ipad to buy but still extremely 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.849
 unsure if it would rather be a big one 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.170
 ipad r or a small ipad mini 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.420
 to become retina 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.529
 That's why I'm doing this video now 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.330
 the two devices will be together 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 compare where the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 differences lie and will end 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.539
 I also have a few words direction 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 buy advice lose around you so in the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.380
 end effect in your decision too 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.149
 help who generally does not know 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.469
 which ipad it should become 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.050
 he can also like my 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.879
 purchase advice video watch the see 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.410
 you linked up here and now wish 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.410
 I wish you much fun with this video 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.219
 you're really lucky that's in 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.289
 this video around the differences and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.329
 it's not about the similarities 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 The latter would be an extreme 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.340
 boring matter because almost everything 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 identical is we have the same design 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 the same colors the same 5 megapixels 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.409
 Camera on the front at both 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.240
 a 12 megapixel facetime camera and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.070
 not only visually are the devices the same 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.159
 also the hardware is identical 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.920
 both have an a7 processor with 64 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.759
 bit architecture and a m7 core 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.560
 processor 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.600
 So the devices are really the same 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.180
 fast and also reach the benchmark 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.159
 the same value is the first difference 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.000
 of course the size of what a 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.040
 surprise 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.250
 The iPad has a display diagonal 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.920
 of 9.7 inches will be the ipad mini retina 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.049
 7 9 inches has for the actual 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.229
 Device size means that at the end of a 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.409
 difference of 4 cm in height and good 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.619
 35 centimeters wide fat 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.990
 is the same for both devices with 75 mm 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.210
 I think really extremely thin so 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.549
 I really like that and that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.290
 weight is also relatively different 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.439
 so we have the ipad in the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 Wlan version 469 grams and the ipad 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.649
 mini retina only 3 131 grams 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.570
 say a difference of 140 grams and 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.079
 I would not have thought it one before 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.890
 more 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.350
 this 140 grams real 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.790
 very very strong if I both devices in 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.160
 the hand is it one 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.080
 huge difference but not only with 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.730
 the weight is connected but also 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.100
 already how to use this device in the reason 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.260
 must touch while holding the ipad mini 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.209
 retina very well in one hand 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.580
 can and then be comfortable with the other 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.070
 hand is that at the ipad he can 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.080
 not so easy you can do it in 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.120
 Only open on the left or right side 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.310
 then hold it by hand 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.380
 use or with both hands in 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.180
 to take the hand that you can do it like that 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.670
 ipad mini with one hand on the back 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.020
 touches is actually not possible there 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.450
 that gets a good deal wider 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.420
 i can do it with one hand just like that 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.580
 but comfortable, it really is 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.590
 not another is to be held so 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.330
 There is a small difference in the display 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.980
 it is with both devices 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.660
 around a retina display with a 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.280
 resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.600
 through the different display sizes 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.000
 but we have one 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.510
 have different pixel density so 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.739
 we at ipad a pixel density of 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.220
 264 ppi and ipad mini retina by 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.680
 326 ppi 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.329
 So there is a lot between when 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.440
 Let's get the two devices together like this 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.170
 consider or 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.540
 The displays then look looks 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.040
 both really super good and one 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.600
 does not really recognize it now 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.820
 right differences 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.829
 both displays are really cool it looks 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.750
 everything is great it is all that sharp 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.120
 Colors come across well over the displays 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.340
 are pretty bright so they are relative 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.600
 little mirror for such devices 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.970
 that was already all 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.519
 Differences in size and weight 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.299
 minimally better display of the ipad mini 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.860
 retina 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.019
 Of course, the question still remains 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.420
 open which ipad is for which 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.670
 better suited and there 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.360
 I'll share that with him at home and 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.370
 on road 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.470
 if you want an ipad what you want 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.840
 mainly used at home and even 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.910
 not or rarely traveling then 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.920
 In any case I advise you to ipad he 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.940
 it's just beautiful this big one 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.920
 to have a display 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.079
 It's more fun playing 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.269
 video watching and of course the 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.310
 surf the web because their quasi never 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.890
 because everything would automatically be big 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.900
 enough 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.730
 that is not always the case with the ipad mini 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.950
 You really have to do that very often 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.540
 zoom because otherwise you really make an effort 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.240
 it has to be sensible to read 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.060
 So there's the ipad he already is 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.430
 bit more comfortable this 140 grams 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.810
 the ipad he reusable for the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.880
 Home area then not really 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.350
 tragic because the device is so often 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.570
 not on the outstretched arm with him 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.130
 carries around but supported somewhere 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.800
 has or is lying somewhere and 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.540
 that's why it does not matter 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.860
 now and then you can do it quiet times 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.140
 take away that is by no means a 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.900
 problem but as daily and 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.600
 constant companion is me the ipad he 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.790
 too big too heavy a bit and 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.410
 almost unwieldy but that is 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.720
 among other things because I have one year 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.550
 long an ipad mini arte and the size 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.500
 I'm a little more used to that 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.710
 So really do tend for these purposes 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.810
 to go to the ipad mini you can do it 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.550
 always somewhere nor understood as not 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.600
 It's easy in the jacket pocket 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.070
 much easier to handle 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.660
 You can make it worse from the bag 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.510
 can pick it up in one hand what 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.100
 look better and that are 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.950
 All points on the way, of course 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.590
 It is important that it is important 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.210
 mobile device and also home is a lot 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.979
 the device will be bad in any case 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.200
 you can play it great and also 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.820
 Surf the web just as I have to say 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.830
 maybe zoom a bit more often than 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.720
 really big at the big ipad 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.680
 reasonable in a decent size 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.780
 to be able to read 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.850
 but that is not the end of the world 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.040
 Let's summarize everything again 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.680
 both the ipad rather than the ipad 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.240
 mini retina are wonderful devices 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.850
 they look good are impeccable 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.650
 processed super fast grandma can 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.340
 actually do everything with what you do 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.470
 has desire 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.630
 the differences are in size weight 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.460
 and the display where the display is not 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.530
 the crucial point is there you are 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.300
 not too much notice because of 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.490
 Displays are great looking good and 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.710
 also have really reasonable 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.450
 brightness and color values for the 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.400
 homecoming I tend mostly 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.930
 Definitely the ipad rather because you 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.070
 on the larger display just more 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.380
 looks and all a bit 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.330
 it is more comfortable to use that of the host 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.100
 but mostly on the way then 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.710
 In any case, I recommend you that 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.760
 ipad mini retina because it's a lot 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.320
 more mobile than the ipad 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.790
 in the end, the decision lies 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.260
 of course with you but I hope 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.390
 anyway that I have with this video 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.770
 could help a little bit further if 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.730
 that's how it scares me in times like 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.320
 the comments 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.000
 you and if you ask another 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.590
 Do not hesitate this also under the video 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.810
 to write then you get on each one 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.520
 if there is an answer if you have the video 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.080
 I would like to have one myself 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.030
 thumb up or an abo happy 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.860
 So you do not have any more videos 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.480
 missed and then I hope that we will 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.260
 next time see again until then 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.260
 market good people
