metal on the inside of your case to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.769 
metal on the inside of your case to
discharge<00:00:23.039> your<00:00:23.160> static<00:00:23.519> electricity<00:00:23.910> just

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
discharge your static electricity just

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.730 
discharge your static electricity just
to<00:00:24.869> make<00:00:24.990> sure<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.199> don't<00:00:25.380> harm<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
to make sure you don't harm the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.259 
to make sure you don't harm the
components<00:00:26.250> when<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.430> ton<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.699> touch<00:00:27.029> them

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
components when you ton just touch them

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.359 
components when you ton just touch them
and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> want<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and then what you want to do is to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.160 
and then what you want to do is to
remove<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> memory<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.539> do<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.810> unclip

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
remove the memory all you do is unclip

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.749 
remove the memory all you do is unclip
the<00:00:31.380> sides<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.130> apply<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> light

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the sides here you just apply a light

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
the sides here you just apply a light
pressure<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> side<00:00:33.540> pull<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> memory

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
pressure to the side pull the memory

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.350 
pressure to the side pull the memory
stick<00:00:34.860> straight<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.030> will<00:00:36.149> come

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
stick straight up and that will come

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
stick straight up and that will come
right<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.340> repeat<00:00:38.550> this

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
right out and you can just repeat this

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.819 
right out and you can just repeat this
on<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> memory<00:00:39.270> sticks<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.829> on

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
on all the memory sticks you have on

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.220 
on all the memory sticks you have on
some<00:00:41.700> systems<00:00:42.120> there's<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.570> one<00:00:42.719> clip<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
some systems there's just one clip and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.690 
some systems there's just one clip and
so<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.590> unclip<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.219> clip<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
so you just unclip the one clip and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
so you just unclip the one clip and
still<00:00:44.969> pull<00:00:45.329> straight<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.260> so

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
still pull straight up just like so

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.709 
still pull straight up just like so
you'll<00:00:47.309> notice<00:00:47.550> also<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.000> there's<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.450> key

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you'll notice also that there's this key

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
you'll notice also that there's this key
here<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.530> halfway<00:00:49.770> through<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.190> chip<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
here but halfway through the chip that

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.180 
here but halfway through the chip that
does<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.660> ensures<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.289> can't<00:00:52.559> try

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
does this it ensures that you can't try

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.439 
does this it ensures that you can't try
to<00:00:53.250> install<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.850> way<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> did

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
to install it the other way if you did

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
to install it the other way if you did
it<00:00:54.719> would<00:00:54.840> hurt<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.129> hurt<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it would hurt this is you would hurt the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
it would hurt this is you would hurt the
chip<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> actually<00:00:57.420> try<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.870> bend<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
chip and actually try to bend it a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
chip and actually try to bend it a
little<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.010> don't<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> do<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.609> make

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
little so you don't want to do that make

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.180 
little so you don't want to do that make
sure<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.149> chips<00:01:00.359> aligned<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
sure the chips aligned so then to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.179 
sure the chips aligned so then to
install<00:01:02.550> memory<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:03.780> reinstall<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> got

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
install memory to reinstall all you got

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.070 
install memory to reinstall all you got
to<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.549> apply<00:01:05.820> even<00:01:06.600> pressure<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to do is just apply even pressure on

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.649 
to do is just apply even pressure on
either<00:01:07.200> side<00:01:07.530> once<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> lined<00:01:08.280> up

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
either side once you have it lined up

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.609 
either side once you have it lined up
and<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.750> pushed<00:01:10.020> straight<00:01:10.170> down

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and is pushed straight down

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
and is pushed straight down
don't<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.430> afraid<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> hurt<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> motherboard

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
don't be afraid to hurt the motherboard

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.149 
don't be afraid to hurt the motherboard
you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.689> push<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.560> enough<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
you can push down enough to get them to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
you can push down enough to get them to
clip<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.549> without<00:01:14.850> hurting<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> there's<00:01:16.080> cured

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
clip in without hurting it there's cured

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
clip in without hurting it there's cured
pretty<00:01:16.650> well<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.509> once<00:01:18.630> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
pretty well in there and then once you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.210 
pretty well in there and then once you
got<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> installed<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.100> the
