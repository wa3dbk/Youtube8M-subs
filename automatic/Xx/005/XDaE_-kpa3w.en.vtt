gikai<00:01:28.040> sleeping<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.220> deal

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.670 

so<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.050> long<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.320> keep<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.590> this

straight

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.779 

sometimes<00:01:45.080> things<00:01:46.080> like<00:01:46.259> these<00:01:49.670> it's<00:01:50.670> only

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
sometimes things like these it's only

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:51.950 
sometimes things like these it's only
the<00:01:50.970> natural<00:01:51.149> thing<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.539> you<00:01:51.690> want<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> do

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the natural thing that you want to do

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:04.609 
the natural thing that you want to do
the<00:01:52.080> wrong<00:01:52.200> thing<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.700> technique<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.619> have

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the wrong thing it's a technique I have

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:21.160 
the wrong thing it's a technique I have
to<00:02:04.890> develop

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.270 

with<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> long<00:02:22.470> Spears<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.890> use<00:02:23.130> them<00:02:23.280> on

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
with the long Spears you use them on

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.470 
with the long Spears you use them on
Norfolk<00:02:26.280> Island<00:02:26.430> pines<00:02:27.530> because<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:29.240> have<00:02:30.240> such

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
Norfolk Island pines because I have such

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.430 
Norfolk Island pines because I have such
big<00:02:30.690> back<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.380> breaks<00:02:31.620> off<00:02:33.260> lays<00:02:34.260> out

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
big back that just breaks off lays out

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:46.330 
big back that just breaks off lays out
to<00:02:34.650> bear<00:02:34.830> these<00:02:35.010> jurors<00:02:36.650> or<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.800> game<00:02:38.040> says

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:55.130 

that<00:02:48.200> wasn't<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.290> very<00:02:49.410> good<00:02:49.500> technique<00:02:54.140> so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
that wasn't a very good technique so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.350 
that wasn't a very good technique so
another<00:02:55.650> thing<00:02:55.800> yes<00:02:56.160> there's<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> hope

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.560 

so<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.690> Kuan<00:03:01.670> can<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:03.680> do<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.570> advance

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
so just to Kuan can go up do you advance

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.420 
so just to Kuan can go up do you advance
the<00:03:06.810> rock<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.640> mean

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.770 

deal<00:03:15.430> deal

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.630 

especially<00:03:19.780> use<00:03:19.870> double<00:03:20.230> months<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.520> I'm

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
especially use double months and I'm

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:44.810 
especially use double months and I'm
just<00:03:21.820> learning<00:03:23.760> drop<00:03:28.650> drop

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.320 

you<00:03:45.820> don't<00:03:46.120> kill<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.510> tree<00:03:46.750> with<00:03:46.930> these<00:03:48.330> they

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
you don't kill the tree with these they

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:58.250 
you don't kill the tree with these they
just<00:03:49.540> heal<00:03:49.720> over<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:55.000> best<00:03:55.210> to<00:03:55.330> use<00:03:55.510> them

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.180 

when<00:03:59.260> falling<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.710> tree

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:31.060 

here's<00:04:05.190> where<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.370> gets<00:04:05.580> good<00:04:06.860> hot<00:04:20.120> damn<00:04:21.120> it

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.000 

don't<00:04:32.070> get<00:04:32.220> lazy<00:04:32.400> Dean
