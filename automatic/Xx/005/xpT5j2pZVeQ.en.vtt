I'm<00:01:07.500> using<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.070> hips<00:01:08.280> filament<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:08.909> came

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
I'm using the hips filament that came

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.750 
I'm using the hips filament that came
with<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> mini<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.220> make<00:01:11.220> sure<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.580> new

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
with the mini and make sure your new

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.600 
with the mini and make sure your new
filament<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.360> nice<00:01:12.630> clean<00:01:12.960> edge<00:01:12.990> and
