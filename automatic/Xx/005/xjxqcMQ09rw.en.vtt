 enough players are going to see us 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.479
 I would need about five players to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.020
 fill in the substitutes and they have one 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.030

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.670
 many forwards and here we have the 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.280
 team that has left us now only 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.830
 you need to leave it because here you have the team 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.790
 mounted and good the truth is that I was 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.890

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.760

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.209
 Mr. JimÃ©nez I have defenses yes but with 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.800
 58 and 53 we should be pretty pretty 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.050
 slow 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.210
 and then the other positions more or less 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:45.700
 well more or less decent but good 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.900

 team of Brazilians of silver and a half 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:10.650
