00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
sure you don't purchase a fake one but I

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.010 
sure you don't purchase a fake one but I
would<00:01:49.729> definitely<00:01:50.270> recommend<00:01:50.360> going<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.869> the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
would definitely recommend going to the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.719 
would definitely recommend going to the
store<00:01:51.259> this<00:01:51.709> is<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.950> black

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
store this is a black

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.850 
store this is a black
I<00:01:52.759> think<00:01:53.060> it's<00:01:53.179> box<00:01:53.509> calf<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.470> other<00:01:54.560> side

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
I think it's box calf and the other side

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.929 
I think it's box calf and the other side
is<00:01:55.099> a<00:01:55.130> kind<00:01:55.549> of<00:01:55.579> a<00:01:55.700> pebbled<00:01:56.149> brown<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.759> have

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
is a kind of a pebbled brown so you have

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.649 
is a kind of a pebbled brown so you have
a<00:01:58.970> stamp<00:01:59.360> right<00:01:59.509> here<00:02:00.189> you<00:02:01.189> can<00:02:01.369> see<00:02:01.579> I<00:02:01.759> got<00:02:02.630> a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
a stamp right here you can see I got a

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.229 
a stamp right here you can see I got a
size<00:02:02.989> 90<00:02:03.409> 90<00:02:03.739> centimeter<00:02:04.189> that<00:02:04.489> equates<00:02:05.119> to

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
size 90 90 centimeter that equates to

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:09.789 
size 90 90 centimeter that equates to
about<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:06.020> 32<00:02:06.530> inch<00:02:06.829> waist<00:02:08.410> I'm<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.679> between

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
about a 32 inch waist I'm in between

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.280 
about a 32 inch waist I'm in between
sizes<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:10.579> just<00:02:10.789> opted<00:02:11.540> for<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.810> larger<00:02:12.079> one

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
sizes so I just opted for the larger one

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
sizes so I just opted for the larger one
