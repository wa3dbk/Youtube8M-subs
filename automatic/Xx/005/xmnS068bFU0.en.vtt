00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.980
 with two guys since a new video of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.809
 minecraft and good guys I bring you this 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.759
 we have not called is line better or 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 stop it and how is it and well yes 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.850
 guys you can already imagine that what 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.910
 we add is more useful to the balls 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.220
 of es night and first as you can see no 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 add the slide work good as 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 you know how to get a line out there 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.279
 in the world it is quite difficult so 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.990
 this is another way to get online 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.820
 looking for this gold which I think should 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.410
 be difficult to find I do not know in what 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.790
 layer comes out or nothing because in the forum there 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 but hey that information came as 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.649
 those of adjustments not and well we can 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.860
 apply to mainly with peak 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 stone which is less easy is for 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 less any ball there is another way of 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 get it is burning good diamond 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.559
 I already have a weird way to get 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.149
 it's line but well I do not know why from 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 diamonds get line but good 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.920
 something pretty clear so no longer for 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.699
 check how good to see there 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.699
 there is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 so let's see what we do adds 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.850
 good as you can see coming doing 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.229
 what is here first what is not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.950
 that what could not be missing 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.310
 tools 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.740
 all the tools have 1601's 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.560
 durability or uses as you want to say 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.060
 so they serve me well or if it 's the same 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.429
 now let's see the attack the sword 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.100
 that comes to be 12 or double 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.600
 that a diamond as you can see the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.720
 peak so good all the tools 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.640
 they have more more damage and attack than one of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.500
 mega diamond the shovel even pec has 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.689
 9 damage in attack more than a sword 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.909
 of diamonds but connects very well the 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.860
 Frettings are the typical ones typical of 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.110
 we put sticks and shape 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 the tool that we want to create no longer 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.729
 there are more mysteries 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.030
 ok then I think that teaches us this 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.509
 let's leave it here the tools 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.799
 for the armor we're going to put on the and 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.350
 As you can see, it will give us an effect 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.420
 jump jump as you can see there 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.429
 and the durability is also pretty 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.929
 decent as you can see there in the part 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.670
 lower left if you want to know which 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.709
 is the way to see the durability is the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.360
 Video inside me it just in case I 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:19.280
 you ask and for good the helmet 500 551 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.010
 the chest 801 the trousers 751 and the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.680
 boots 651 which is good is 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.330
 pretty decent the the durability of 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.459
 the armor is decent enough besides 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.080
 of the effect it gives us and also fills us 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.120
 as you can see there the entire bar 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.670
 protection which is pretty good 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.770
 this armor that good we're going to the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.390
 here 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.860
 now we will add a new food 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.540
 also that comes doing this that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.250
 we came as a seed or something 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.100
 similar but good we are not going to 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.750
 find breaking the grass over there 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.360
 It's pretty weird that it comes out but 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.340
 good is another way to get food 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.810
 to feed us would be good to 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.540
 using our these seeds to 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.920
 do sly crops with something like that but 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.900
 Unfortunately not 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.330
 so well we already passed the community 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.400
 is now not going to add this new one is 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.970
 line bridge that we are going to get 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.980
 putting a ball on the table is fiddling 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.780
 and he's going to give us 16 line brick something 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.630
 quite illogical or with a wave in the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.000
 we got 16 in line bridge 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.970
 it's good that with this line we can 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.319
 make this new in the female that is in 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.420
 outdoor block and that comes 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.340
 doing this to decorate or to have 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.470
 there it serves quite decoration 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.000
 and good if you also do not add the line 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.040
 blog although this is not going to be useful anymore 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080
 the 1.8 because it is added 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.910
 already as everyone knows in the 1.8 have 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.640
 he added today les line blog and it's a lot 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.110
 better than this and blah blah blah but 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.599
 Well the point that these are added by 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.950
 mod and also not add this new thing 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.989
 what he sells doing 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.209
 the anti graph that good let's see 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.650
 let's try what you suppose to see 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.379
 already put a zombie fuck I came out 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.970
 small is supposed to right click 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.430
 I will send it to fly as you can see 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.560
 there for and died to see we put another 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.260
 they are from here because they come out small pussy 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.000
 and there is the zombie died we click 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.099
 right only that has no texture 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.950
 we still do not know how to make the texture 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.950
 or anything like the monkey mode is all 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.600
 full vale says that they will add a 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.060
 new lines biome and so on but it's worth it 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.859
 good that will be like in the future and 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.130
 well the punishment of this is with 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.570
 iron and a ball of es line do not teach 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.850
 the sides of the armor because they are 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.980
 the typical ones I do not know why they were taught 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.480
 if they are typical and others but good if 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.650
 boy this all the mold pretty 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.050
 simple 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.300
 and this the only thing that adds more 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.830
 utility is lines and good boy but 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.340
 that you liked, leave me your like and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.340
 until next time
