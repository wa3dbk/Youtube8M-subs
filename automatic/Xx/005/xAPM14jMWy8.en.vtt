00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:25.119
 Hello, we will do all the axes 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:26.710
 weaklings are unlikely to strengthen the data 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.150
 we will need the components to create 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.789
 of our device 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.890
 and now you can watch 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.160
 circuit diagram of our amplifier 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.469
 it contains 2 2 cascading channels first 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.350
 the cascade is built by a lamp 6 center n and 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.329
 is the second voltage amplifier 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.760
 cascade is a buffer let's tell 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.070
 It is designed as a repeater effluents 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.699
 and built on a field effect transistor and 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.260
 nut 540 let's proceed to the immediate 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.090
 assembling our headphone amplifier for 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 start you need to solder the led which 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.800
 will highlight our lamp 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.620
 then solder the socket on which 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.620
 the lamp itself will be mounted 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.010
 further solder all resistors in 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.010
 accordance with the concept of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 it's time to solder everyone 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 capacitors 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.880
 Now we solder all our connectors 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.960
 further we set the toggle switch and variable 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 resistor 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.019
 now came the turn for a stabilizer 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.920
 voltage and two transistors 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:19.630
 installed on radiators and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:22.470
 solder to our board insert our 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.470
 lamp panel 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.040
 can now fix brass racks 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.040
 on our board 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.160
 we install a cover from org glass 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:12.630
 how to make it I told 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:13.800
 previous video is our amplifier for 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.170
 headphone ready 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:33.900
 connect the signal source and 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:37.730
 Headphones to the right connector all necessary 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.730
 files you can download the link under the video 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.440
 after the test of this amplifier was 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.940
 revealed that he merges sound by 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.980
 about seven times the voltage 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.050
 despite having a transistor 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.840
 tube distortions are still present 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.100
 they make the sound more rich and vibrant 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.850
 I advise everyone to collect such strengthen 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.160
 subscribe to my channel and baking 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.020
 go to good shops decay then 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.020
 game in contact ulcer luck
