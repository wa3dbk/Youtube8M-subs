00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 yes 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.800
 fifth 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.070
 or not 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.970
 very good to all vaquitas welcome 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.000
 to a new trap in sky war and we're going to 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.850
 make a new trap that really is 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.740
 a push with the piston and the block that 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.840
 kill the block crushes you worth 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.000
 welcome clarify castle I will use a 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.670
 piston to make this trap does not matter 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.930
 if it is normal sticky piston because as 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.360
 the push will do the same no matter 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.739
 ok and well let's see what we 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.300
 find around here look sends a 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.989
 peak so I can already make the trap 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.640
 very quick and good after this 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.740
 starting what I will do is comment 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.210
 some clips that I have of the trap 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.280
 It's worth it because I do not know how I'm going to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.410
 give this game I do not know me are 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.990
 doing a lot of focus lately and 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.660
 when they see me I am youtuber they come to me 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.430
 between 7 and fuck it happened really bad is what 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.399
 happened really worth good let's do 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.320
 first the ace is worth so that the person 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.810
 is stuck to see is that it has 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.729
 touched the castle that I do not like the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.590
 light would be here it's going to go decorating 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.929
 this so that you understand this 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.270
 and good to see I will go placing first 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.070
 this we are going to give it shape is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.149
 simply place the piston so 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.950
 horizontal is ok and that's it and do the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.049
 push when they get caught and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.479
 then the block is killing him little 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.509
 I'll leave the table a little, I 'll go 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.990
 chop around here and good would already be what 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.600
 is the basis of the trap 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.049
 ok let's catch the stone we're going to 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.240
 place here stone and here will go the 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.980
 piston is obviously worth the people going to 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.680
 fall down here 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.890
 oh well, and this I have to take away, let's go 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.840
 to put this and well you can put what 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.450
 that is any block I am going to put 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.790
 wood is worth it because people not only do not 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.440
 usually have axes and this is already 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.380
 would be ready ok here we are going to make a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.530
 button to activate the trap the button will 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.690
 I did with sticks and with stone 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.180
 I remember that it was like that not the other way around 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 I have it there and it's worth it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.180
 we would place the button here and when 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.850
 someone chop activates the trap and the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.500
 block it kills it worth to see we would be 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.970
 here placed and have been careful is 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.100
 coming a little and see here go here 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.940

 you're going to die look at the arch book is almost 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.070
 you can not do anything good but you have 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.380
 seen the trap when it has been 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.180
 petado vale would have died to see me 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.360

 that attack me 35 my god that the departure 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.260
 we are 12 we are going to deactivate the push to 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.930
 see there I have it and see another one 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.440
 madrid no longer stop killing people 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.940
 equally when this game ends 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.430
 see how we tried to escape 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.140
 are opening up here I'm going to make a 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.870
 tutorial with the clips because I shit on 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.760
 milk this this focus not no small 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.390
 not small I'm going around here and taking 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.800
 coat 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.600
 let's try to escape we're going 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.650
 attacking in pairs above are felt 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.670
 fuck no please no 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.769
 and pain my good mother you have seen is 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.030
 the tremendous focus in the same way we are going to 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.069
 see the clips I'm going to comment on 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.799
 over and it's worth it come well 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.780
 here we are this is a clip that I made 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.909
 It's worth a separate game when I was 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.799
 trying the trap I remember I did not know 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.299
 if it worked and good the good thing about this 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.639
 cheat is that it works in multiplayer 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.759
 in a player you can escape very 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.440
 it's easily worth it but multiplayer is 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.070
 impossible to escape unless you have a 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.990
 peak or something like that very very fast okay I think 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.590
 ok here is now when he placed the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.510
 button and one comes and binds a little 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 it falls directly viral or they were two 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.860
 ok but I can kill him I think 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.199
 they kill each other you see that this one ends 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.720
 to enter the button active and little to 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.699
 little you see is dying then try 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.260
 attacking this is sometimes that they are team team 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.500
 they attack fingers then I can not do 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.940
 nothing but look you see this peak and it dies 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.620
 only with the trap can you attack 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.289
 below but I think not that 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.540
 it works to launch veis nioc dies 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.670
 as crushed 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.680
 exploits all the blood is worth if it had 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.950
 blood minecraft but peta let's go the 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.110
 piston to blood and this would be one of 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.730
 the clips that I liked I liked 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.560
 I'm going to show you another 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.630
 because I have several of this trap that 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.460
 is amazing and good for you to see 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.320
 This I think also I will kill 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.910
 let's see what kills and I do not remember this 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.730
 is the one that kills me this is the one that kills me 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.460
 so do not escape I escaped and good 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.290
 finally we have this last clip that 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.540
 Uncle is saying one the fuck and 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.510
 look little by little he is dying crushed 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.660
 for the or for the pleasant tooth of gold 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.330
 and dies this was my first low me 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.340
 agreement and I got excited I said that piece of 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.320
 trap and I liked it very much and good 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.060
 scoring how can you make this happen 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.290
 I can know a little better than to 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.760
 that I do the traps 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.830
 I hope that point is like that you 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.290
 subscribe if you like the games of 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.390
 sky wars and super chulas is worth with traps 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.550
 and well, these are the most traps 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.010
 creative that I climbed on the channel and 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.260
 I hope you like it okay button and 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.500
 until the next people 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.500
 yes
