00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 Hello 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.660
 a building is probably now sitting 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:23.439
 think of the calculator 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.869
 this is our task for week 1 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.800
 will be no finished products is 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.800
 proven to drink 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.960
 no idea why in this moment 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 I am the last one excited 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.530
 the spring has spoken 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.090
 Challenge is just my spring 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.860
 series with me every year so one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.900
 little try a small period 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.879
 to create in which we all times 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.890
 to think about how we feel 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.330
 you can feel and she should be for everyone 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.030
 the desire to have a little 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.440
 food for thought give what you so small 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.850
 and big things in your everyday life in 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.129
 can change their life around themselves 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.870
 overall, to feel better and healthier 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.729
 in the center of the series is but 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.560
 not necessarily to take 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.540
 but simply plain or 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.190
 to feel in his skin is just that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.380
 something different for everyone if one is 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.229
 it is the winter fur that dies away 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.509
 Get rid of things to eat next 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.890
 to take the skin cleanse for 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.690
 Next is more sport again 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 make or just look where is 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.290
 my body is able and in power 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.550
 all these things and essays and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.979
 I try to reflect 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.360
 I support with the speed challenge 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.220
 but this year will not sit here 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.750
 It is said that it is healthy and not 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.910
 because I think we are all aware 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.619
 that certain things are unhealthy we are 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.780
 Everyone knows that ready meals and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.850
 even finished producing the food 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.320
 not really good for us and ever 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.030
 more like that reduce the better 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.650
 and then we finally come 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 Everyone knows that drinking water is good 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.520
 thing is we all know that ours 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.229
 body needs enough fruit and vegetables and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.390
 less of that is generated with it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.369
 One of our fill up can do it all 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 know that sports are always good ideas too 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.670
 if we do not necessarily lose weight 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 Just want to get the body back 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.880
 show what he is actually capable of 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.830
 is and we all know that one 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.549
 a certain number of students sleep 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.590
 targeted 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.720
 It's easy to say, but it's true 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.700
 Living healthy is actually easy 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.380
 What is difficult is the changeover 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.519
 to make changes to one's own life 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.110
 And that's what I think 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.820
 irrelevant what kind of change 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.130
 we are always first 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.670
 exhausting change because the people 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.770
 easy 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.569
 Habitats are but if we are 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.800
 and things have changed 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.599
 have to his life and easy 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.370
 it is all about making healthier decisions 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.080
 us so much better in the end and me 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 believe that what many of us believe 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.940
 make an effort and the spring challenge should 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.110
 just motivate and inspire you 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.880
 make healthier decisions 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.950
 i have tips for you i have 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.540
 suggestion I have recipes things you 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.739
 can try and things maybe 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.510
 also about the one just a little bit 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.220
 has to think here decides itself 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.319
 which things want to try which 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.819
 I wanted to integrate my everyday life and things 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.680
 which things might not be for you 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.690
 In any case, there are so relevant 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.940
 in this brings the whole april now 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.890
 every wednesday and thursday one 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.180
 spring challenge video but quite 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.680
 normal coffee gossip and if I have it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.750
 somehow make it on monday 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.470
 video was nothing sport and healthy 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.670
 to do nutrition 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.040
 I think you have to go 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.049
 thoughts about another table though 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.970
 that as I said I do not promise me 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.739
 just think the switch is scary 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.110
 Do not be cool for four weeks 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.720
 alone feels with his eternal but me 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.310
 Do Tomorrow thoughts or now 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.230
 Chips and the dredgers are back 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.970
 it's nice and last year is the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.670
 seen in the comments but read 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.780

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.500

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.269

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.840

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.160
 works what feels good and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.079
 what really makes a difference 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.030
 and that motivates me personally and 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.200
