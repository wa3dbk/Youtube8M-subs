00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
so you can see my reader gunship which I

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.710 
so you can see my reader gunship which I
suspect<00:01:24.700> out<00:01:25.000> with<00:01:25.150> some<00:01:25.330> air-to-ground

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
suspect out with some air-to-ground

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.510 
suspect out with some air-to-ground
rockets<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.440> allow<00:01:26.620> it<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.770> do<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:26.980> really<00:01:27.340> good

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520
