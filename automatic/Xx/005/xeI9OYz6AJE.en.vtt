00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
really a good window to do something to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
really a good window to do something to
be<00:00:47.910> honest<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.989> no<00:00:49.200> good<00:00:49.469> time<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be honest there there is no good time to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.420 
be honest there there is no good time to
UCCS<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.110> PvP<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:53.129> dynamic

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
UCCS just because PvP is really dynamic

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
UCCS just because PvP is really dynamic
and<00:00:53.760> always<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> move<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.260> being

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and always on the move so I think being

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
and always on the move so I think being
more<00:00:55.980> spontaneous<00:00:56.820> than<00:00:56.850> having<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.539> good

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
more spontaneous than having a good

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
more spontaneous than having a good
reaction<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.469> what's<00:00:58.649> happening<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> game

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
reaction to what's happening in the game

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.849 
reaction to what's happening in the game
is<00:00:59.850> much<00:01:00.329> better<00:01:00.570> than<00:01:00.780> setting<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.350> strict

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
is much better than setting out strict

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.250 
is much better than setting out strict
rules<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.399> went<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> Cece<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.019> course

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
rules on went to Cece but of course

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.810 
rules on went to Cece but of course
there<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.650> some<00:01:04.920> general<00:01:05.189> lines<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.640> can

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
there are some general lines you can

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.690 
there are some general lines you can
follow<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> first<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.280> need<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.580> know

the diminishing returns with other cc's
in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:12.540> those<00:01:12.689> who<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:12.930> know

diminishing return is of 15 to 18 second
time<00:01:16.860> frame<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.400> plays<00:01:17.909> into<00:01:18.119> action<00:01:18.600> after

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
time frame that plays into action after

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.890 
time frame that plays into action after
you<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> cc<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.820> time<00:01:21.090> frame<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.600> next

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you use a cc in that time frame the next

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
you use a cc in that time frame the next
CC<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.610> same<00:01:23.909> school<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.479> does

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
CC that is from the same school or does

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.480 
CC that is from the same school or does
kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> same<00:01:25.409> thing<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.890> stunned<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
kind of the same thing like stunned the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
kind of the same thing like stunned the
zorian<00:01:26.700> silence<00:01:27.299> she'll<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.049> will<00:01:29.009> be

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
zorian silence she'll like that will be

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.130 
zorian silence she'll like that will be
reduced<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> half<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> its<00:01:30.119> original<00:01:30.270> duration

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
reduced to half of its original duration

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
reduced to half of its original duration
and<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:32.310> example<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> polymorph<00:01:33.630> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and so on for example you polymorph a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.719 
and so on for example you polymorph a
guy<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.259> goes<00:01:34.530> through<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.369> goes<00:01:35.520> eight

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
guy it goes through it goes eight

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.880 
guy it goes through it goes eight
seconds<00:01:36.150> after<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.200> done<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.409> Polly<00:01:37.710> him

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
seconds after that is done you Polly him

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.770 
seconds after that is done you Polly him
again<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> will<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.909> four<00:01:39.150> seconds<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
again it will go for four seconds and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
again it will go for four seconds and
again<00:01:40.530> we'll<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.009> two<00:01:41.189> seconds<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:41.790> one

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
again we'll go for two seconds then one

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.420 
again we'll go for two seconds then one
then<00:01:42.180> he<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.720> immune<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.259> good<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> track

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
then he is immune a good way to track

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.639 
then he is immune a good way to track
