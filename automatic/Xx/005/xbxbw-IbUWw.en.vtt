00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 Tell me the beauty, come on. 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.580
 comment on the various ads is the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.730
 several novelties of the game that were 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.700
 announced between the in tryon yesterday and today 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.100
 also not good the first is that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 fourth button will be the contention of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 caves and you must have seen it 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.350
 yesterday this news on the internet 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 for those who do not know the meaning of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.869
 contend let's go to the dictionary as 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.480
 circumstances in which conflicts 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.920
 discussion or discord in which the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:40.649
 violence fighting fights etc. where 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 happens to be a new module is a new 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.270
 game mode that happens every week 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.090
 There was a new color for you to 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.340
 play it and you will play against another 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.160
 player and not against the computer is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.469
 The same is true in game adventures, okay? 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.480
 moncada contention will have different rules 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.280
 and these rules are random so you can 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.890
 happen type in a week you have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.080
 a predetermined playing deck may 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.229
 be from another week some lackeys 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.479
 gain strength in this fight 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.810
 it may happen you have to do 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.540
 other situation then always random 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.000
 that's the way you're going to have to play 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.220
 In this feud it's ok for you to play. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.890
 she needs to have a hero at least 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 a hero in the game takes the listener but 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 she does not release 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.220
 You can also fight against a friend. 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.170
 in the tavern contest it can be 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.600
 option when you are inside the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 instead of challenging a 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.130
 Random player internet you can 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.020
 to challenge is a friend of yours from the list too 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.970
 to be able to play this will be 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.710
 very cool will bring a dynamic and the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.460
 more so you can do with your 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.220
 friends was announced starting in June 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.490
 ie're okay to be released so there is 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.890
 very cool and the fight will be closed 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.590
 some days between a feud and another 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.969
 that is if it releases on Tuesday 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.920
 example may be that she did on Sunday 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.020
 and stay second 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.300
 closed without anyone being able to play it 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.070
 while maintenance is performed to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.300
 a new fight for the youth will 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.310
 to be more or less so 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.590
 So be smart, tell this to 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.190
 leave for the last moment and strife 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.800
 be closed and you do not play on the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.230
 record tony says she'll be free 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.080
 when a new game mode starts 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.060
 so he hinted that maybe 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.060
 It's always free 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.750
 Let's see if it's always going to be free. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.970
 or not I believe it will not be 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.690
 I sincerely believe that we will not but 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.459
 to see 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.150
 and everyone who wins the first 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.150
 match of the first contest of the week is 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.940
 will receive a package as premium then 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.250
 in when will launch ii the galera runs 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.040
 make and the first contention that when 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.810
 wins the first match will win as 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.760
 reward in a package they do not 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.040
 well explained if ever 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.320
 there will be prizes for those who play 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.140
 fight like that is going to be this too 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.510
 they were not so many very clear 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.580
 I still think I have to have it free. 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.709
 and if you have to pay to play and not 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.420
 I do not know if I have any reward 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.940
 the crowd will cheer much to play is 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.220
 because the crew still has to 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.040
 conquer all the cards so the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.950
 good cards plan that is difficult 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.230
 Someone all already then she will want 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.420
 invest the money her goal in other 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.160
 situations there to have better cards 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.530
 other things believe in the good I do not know 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.410
 but let's see if it will have the reward 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.959
 every week or not they do not leave it 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.900
 very clear then these were the 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.269
 information on the new way of 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.440
 game that will be released later this month not 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.900

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.769
 everything to strive every week 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.080
 whether it is free or not 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.100
 already advance that it will be legal the 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.530
 channel or third games there that it seems 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.340
 they will be fun 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.799
 I make it clear that it is the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.199
 play these quarrels every week ok 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.760
 So that 's it, let's wait for the 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.889
 her release 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.160
