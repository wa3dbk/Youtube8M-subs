00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 the teacher we saw that so many had very 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.940
 little arrival in what was the first 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.440
 part and practically the first the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.370
 first goal shot that beautiful girl the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 minute 52 today really this is a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.850
 little the lack of productivity of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.760
 offensive no 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.220
 I laugh your analysis your comment no 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.530
 I deserve any kind of response 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.260
 javier solo from univision sports that 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.310
 he feels like leaving without teacher points when 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.960
 the ball crosses the line and now no 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.660
 I think you have to value the work of the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.150
 team as the gentleman said it seems that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.830
 you were subjected to a pressure of cougars 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.750
 overwhelming that you have not had a ball 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.640
 you have had arrivals you do not remember 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.140
 even the balls in the clubs do not 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.780
 Do you even remember the ball that enters 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.490
 it's something that makes me sad this kind of 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.520
 channels are as I would say 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.520
 be clear that you have in that in 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.140
 this kind of sense but what gives me 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.540
 It's a pleasure that our team within the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.300
 court to win the match in stages 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.580
 determined we knew what we wanted 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.400
 we knew how to play this at this cougars 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.540
 and it did not affect us minimally affected us 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.540
 what was the subject 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.360
 cristian the height of the schedule because 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.880
 after the data arrives from this 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.580
 party you will look if there is a bankruptcy 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.590
 of performance is a team between 2000 and 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.350
 3000 meters what is the performance 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.970
 decreases more with height but when 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.890
 you have all four games and the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.510
 data is said to have run higher 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.940
 distances that the rival to greater 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.979
 intensity plus sprint distance more 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.200
 number of sprints I do not know where the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.180
 height and today we have done that and we have 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.580
 made more soccer than the rival we have already 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.650
 had much more desire to win in the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.720
 game play with our way in a 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.220
 court that if it is difficult that if the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.250
 authority that we visited we broke a 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.960
 a time of 12 years without winning here but 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.790
 I do not want to go into other comments 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.740
 but what has been the performance of 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.820
 our team what is the analyze the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 ball entered 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.409
 and if he did not enter it was criminal because the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.800
 will remove with his hand the ball that is the 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.170
 goal 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.479
 there is a recargon on mill that already 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.640
 our task is your task 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.440
 of these annals what good do you do 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.290
 You have to do it in depth too 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.410
 because on the court when there are many 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.270
 teams are going to play nothing else two I think 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.180
 that there are three teams on the court and the 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.850
 football goes through what is the good of 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.640
 all those three teams that can add 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.440
 to the show then I'm going sad 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.630
 because we lost I'm not going totally 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.239
 defeated because we knew how we started 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.739
 this last series of six parties 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.810
 we had a margin of error that 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.340
 we counted as four points and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.709
 means that from now onwards no longer 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.890
 we have no brand or we won all three 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.930
 or we 're going to get married but if you 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.209
 they also have analysis capacity 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.019
 I invited them to do one thing is 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.269
 true that at the end of a tournament the 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.830
 arbitral errors or they are always 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.900
 there for rich people they will always be 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.100
 even be one of those desires because there 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.570
 way of arbitration 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.910
 other times you lose because there is an error 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.880
 I invite you to do arbitration 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.190
 type of analysis if you want to be 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.800
 a little more serious in what he touches 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.020
 but this word is not it 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.480
 can say or not but I do not care 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.510
 we are the assholes of this tournament and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.580
 we deserve respect then we are for 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.890
 whatever in the last three games 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.360
 against whoever is also in the three 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.370
 last matches because what I 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.340
 interesting is that they play with this attitude 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.870
 play with this quality because it can 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.080
 be that we win our lost to 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.410
 you do not know a soccer game no 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.370
 there are three teams on the court there is no 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.370
 three teams on the court 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.660
 I am the one who has to tell you who is 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.590
 the third team someone to help me 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.940
 please is this sports reporter 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.190
 then what do you say in front of 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.320
 everything or you want me to jesse I say 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.420
 the arbitration team is not a team 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.240
 it's not a referee team four 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.610
 elements is not a team is this that 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.920
 you wanted to hear thank you very much 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.390
 if you do not have the eggs to say I would 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.870
 I have 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.260
 it's clear it 's clear you do not call me 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.260
 management
