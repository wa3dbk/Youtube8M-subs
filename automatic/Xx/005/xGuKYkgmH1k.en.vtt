I'm going to keep mine in my pots I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
I'm going to keep mine in my pots I
think<00:02:10.500> it'll<00:02:10.619> be<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.770> little<00:02:10.890> bit<00:02:11.009> easier<00:02:12.590> these

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
think it'll be a little bit easier these

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.260 
think it'll be a little bit easier these
the<00:02:13.800> growth<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.550> absolutely

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
the growth on these is absolutely

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.369 
the growth on these is absolutely
phenomenal<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.810> don't<00:02:15.990> know<00:02:16.050> whether<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> can

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
phenomenal I don't know whether you can

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.000 
phenomenal I don't know whether you can
see<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.769> very<00:02:16.860> well<00:02:17.129> but<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:17.909> about

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
see that very well but this is about

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
see that very well but this is about
that's<00:02:20.010> about<00:02:20.189> 16<00:02:20.610> inches<00:02:20.700> from<00:02:21.180> from<00:02:21.480> the

that's about 16 inches from from the

that's about 16 inches from from the
plant<00:02:21.840> stalk<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.850> don't<00:02:24.240> have<00:02:24.480> any<00:02:24.660> flowers<00:02:25.080> on

fall if they're going to do them but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.170 
fall if they're going to do them but
again<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.820> first<00:02:39.030> year<00:02:39.120> that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
again this is the first year that

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.540 
again this is the first year that
they've<00:02:39.390> been<00:02:39.540> planted<00:02:39.960> so<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:41.130> have<00:02:41.370> any

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
they've been planted so I don't have any

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.640 
they've been planted so I don't have any
expectations<00:02:42.240> for<00:02:42.750> them<00:02:42.870> flower<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.380> year

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
expectations for them flower this year

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.510 
expectations for them flower this year
but<00:02:44.220> next<00:02:44.370> year<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.910> will<00:02:45.240> expect<00:02:45.600> something

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
but next year I will expect something

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.580

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
into that for the failing process I'll

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.780 
into that for the failing process I'll
say<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.630> all<00:03:15.750> your<00:03:15.930> fault<00:03:16.430> these<00:03:17.430> cuttings

were<00:03:17.910> absolutely<00:03:18.300> beautiful<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:19.440> guy<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.860> I

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
were absolutely beautiful the guy that I

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.550 
were absolutely beautiful the guy that I
was<00:03:20.130> speaking<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.490> gave<00:03:21.240> me<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:22.110> ones<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
was speaking to gave me the ones that

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.380 
was speaking to gave me the ones that
that<00:03:22.590> had<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:25.190> double<00:03:26.190> heads<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.610> them<00:03:26.760> so

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
that had the the double heads on them so

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.570 
that had the the double heads on them so
all<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:27.900> are<00:03:27.990> like<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.430> I

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
all of them are like that so I have I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.890 
all of them are like that so I have I
basically<00:03:30.000> doubled<00:03:30.480> my<00:03:30.600> my<00:03:31.530> plants<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.880> if<00:03:33.360> if

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
basically doubled my my plants and if if

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.199 
basically doubled my my plants and if if
that's<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.320> way<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.500> say<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.890> but<00:03:35.790> they've

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
that's the way to say it but they've

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.000 
that's the way to say it but they've
grown<00:03:36.450> quite<00:03:36.780> well<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.990> think<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:37.680> far<00:03:37.860> this

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
grown quite well I think so far this

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.970 
grown quite well I think so far this
season<00:03:38.250> they've<00:03:38.550> grown<00:03:39.030> about<00:03:39.320> 8<00:03:40.320> or<00:03:40.380> 9<00:03:40.560> inches

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
season they've grown about 8 or 9 inches

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.490 
season they've grown about 8 or 9 inches
on<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.850> stems<00:03:42.090> maybe<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.600> little<00:03:42.750> bit<00:03:42.930> taller

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
on the stems maybe a little bit taller

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.400 
on the stems maybe a little bit taller
than<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:44.540> last<00:03:45.540> year<00:03:45.840> because<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.230> bought

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
than that last year because I bought

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.100 
than that last year because I bought
them<00:03:46.620> as<00:03:46.830> cuttings<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.580> fall<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:48.150> did<00:03:48.870> grow

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
them as cuttings in the fall I did grow

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.479 
them as cuttings in the fall I did grow
them<00:03:49.290> under<00:03:49.380> my<00:03:49.590> grow<00:03:49.770> lights<00:03:50.040> over<00:03:50.400> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
them under my grow lights over the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.790 
them under my grow lights over the
season<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:50.970> did<00:03:51.209> kind<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.510> cheat<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.930> do<00:03:52.290> have

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
season so I did kind of cheat I do have

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.640 
season so I did kind of cheat I do have
a<00:03:52.830> winter<00:03:53.070> under<00:03:53.310> my<00:03:53.430> belt<00:03:53.610> on<00:03:53.820> these<00:03:54.060> guys<00:03:54.270> but

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
a winter under my belt on these guys but

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.370 
a winter under my belt on these guys but
but<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:56.010> didn't<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:57.360> didn't<00:03:57.870> overwinter<00:03:58.350> them

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
but I didn't I didn't overwinter them

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.710 
but I didn't I didn't overwinter them
dormant<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.040> was<00:03:59.459> afraid<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.820> if<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.330> kept<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
dormant I was afraid that if I kept the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.300 
dormant I was afraid that if I kept the
cuttings<00:04:01.050> by<00:04:01.230> themselves<00:04:01.739> all<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.190> way

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
cuttings by themselves all the way

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.920 
cuttings by themselves all the way
through<00:04:02.550> winter<00:04:02.760> they<00:04:03.390> wouldn't<00:04:03.630> have<00:04:03.720> enough

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
kind of go mushy so these plants by

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.970 
kind of go mushy so these plants by
nature<00:04:13.670> like<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.940> well-drained<00:04:15.840> soil<00:04:16.169> they

a week and at that point you could water

they will rot more than they will die of

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.860 
they will rot more than they will die of
of<00:04:49.620> lack<00:04:50.309> of<00:04:50.339> water<00:04:50.669> if<00:04:51.360> they<00:04:51.569> have<00:04:51.659> a<00:04:51.689> lack<00:04:51.839> of

of lack of water if they have a lack of

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.510 
of lack of water if they have a lack of
water<00:04:52.229> you<00:04:52.559> might<00:04:52.770> see<00:04:53.009> them<00:04:53.099> lose<00:04:53.339> their

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
water you might see them lose their

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.219 
water you might see them lose their
leaves<00:04:53.699> but<00:04:54.059> they<00:04:54.180> won't<00:04:54.419> they<00:04:54.779> won't<00:04:54.809> die
