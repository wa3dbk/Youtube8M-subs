you<00:00:05.700> know<00:00:05.819> really<00:00:06.180> wasn't<00:00:06.540> planning<00:00:06.870> on<00:00:06.990> doing

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
you know really wasn't planning on doing

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.960 
you know really wasn't planning on doing
a<00:00:07.410> second<00:00:07.799> video<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.460> transmission

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
a second video on the transmission

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.080 
a second video on the transmission
reseal<00:00:09.540> but<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> did<00:00:10.650> find<00:00:11.010> enough<00:00:11.580> interesting

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
reseal but I did find enough interesting

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.509 
reseal but I did find enough interesting
things<00:00:12.780> when<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.320> pull<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.889> seals<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.370> this

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
things when I pull the seals on this

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.000 
things when I pull the seals on this
transmission<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.900> thought<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.740> should

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
transmission that I thought I should

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.910 
transmission that I thought I should
show<00:00:17.190> them<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> let's<00:00:19.170> move<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.590> close

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
show them to you so let's move in close

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
show them to you so let's move in close
and<00:00:20.310> I'm<00:00:20.460> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> show<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.300> specifically

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and I'm going to show you specifically

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.679 
and I'm going to show you specifically
some<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> problems<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.090> found<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.660> I

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
some of the problems I found when I

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.839 
some of the problems I found when I
opened<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.289> transmission<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.820> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
opened up this transmission when I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880 
opened up this transmission when I
loosen<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> rear<00:00:27.539> lock<00:00:27.779> nut<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.349> remove<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
loosen the rear lock nut and remove the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
loosen the rear lock nut and remove the
rear<00:00:29.070> drive<00:00:29.400> coupling<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.660> very<00:00:30.869> pleased

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
rear drive coupling I was very pleased

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
rear drive coupling I was very pleased
to<00:00:31.410> find<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.279> no<00:00:32.520> adverse<00:00:32.700> we're

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to find that there was no adverse we're

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.729 
to find that there was no adverse we're
in<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.170> splines<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.430> same<00:00:35.670> time<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> checked

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
in the splines the same time I checked

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
in the splines the same time I checked
these<00:00:37.739> holes<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.550> attach<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.329> Flex<00:00:39.600> disk

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
these holes that attach to the Flex disk

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
these holes that attach to the Flex disk
for<00:00:40.530> anywhere<00:00:41.040> elongation<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
for anywhere elongation this can be a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.490 
for anywhere elongation this can be a
problem<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.750> you've<00:00:42.899> been<00:00:43.050> running<00:00:43.230> with

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
problem if you've been running with

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
problem if you've been running with
loose<00:00:43.710> bolts<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.850> sure<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> check<00:00:45.360> these

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
loose bolts so be sure and check these

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.880 
loose bolts so be sure and check these
holes<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> roundness<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.620> was

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
holes for out of roundness so that was

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.549 
holes for out of roundness so that was
okay<00:00:50.270> then<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> took<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.660> look<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> rear<00:00:52.289> seal

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
okay then I took a look at the rear seal

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.619 
okay then I took a look at the rear seal
and<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> went<00:00:53.610> oh<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:54.149> word<00:00:54.420> look

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and this is when I went oh my word look

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
and this is when I went oh my word look
at<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.899> thing<00:00:55.199> I've<00:00:55.770> seen<00:00:56.160> bad<00:00:56.520> rear<00:00:56.820> seals

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
at this thing I've seen bad rear seals

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.279 
at this thing I've seen bad rear seals
before<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.730> hard<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.600> had

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
before but this one was so hard it had

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.290 
before but this one was so hard it had
absolutely<00:01:01.559> no<00:01:02.190> flex<00:01:02.520> never<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> could<00:01:03.120> just

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
absolutely no flex never you could just

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
absolutely no flex never you could just
take<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> pieces<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> break<00:01:04.409> off<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.949> like

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
take the pieces and break off just like

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.130 
take the pieces and break off just like
that<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.790> was<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.810> made

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that so it was a good thing that I made

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
that so it was a good thing that I made
the<00:01:10.290> decision<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.979> replace<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.369> rear<00:01:11.729> seal

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the decision to replace the rear seal

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.550 
the decision to replace the rear seal
when<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> transmission<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.380> car

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
when the transmission was out of the car

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
when the transmission was out of the car
much<00:01:13.860> easier<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.760> out<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> car<00:01:15.990> then

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
much easier to do it out of the car then

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.190 
much easier to do it out of the car then
in<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> car<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.330> remove<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.720> front

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
in the car then we remove the front

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980 
in the car then we remove the front
section<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> transmission<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.990> removed

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
section of the transmission and removed

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.429 
section of the transmission and removed
the<00:01:22.500> pump<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> found<00:01:24.420> with<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the pump and look what I found with this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
the pump and look what I found with this
o-ring<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.610> previous<00:01:27.030> video<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> talked<00:01:27.630> about

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
o-ring in previous video I talked about

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
o-ring in previous video I talked about
the<00:01:28.049> o-rings<00:01:28.470> hardening<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.100> age<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.579> this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the o-rings hardening with age but this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.200 
the o-rings hardening with age but this
this<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.020> extreme<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.950> hard<00:01:32.280> just

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this one is extreme it's so hard just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.370 
this one is extreme it's so hard just
breaks<00:01:33.920> in<00:01:34.920> pieces<00:01:35.180> like<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.170> look

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
breaks in pieces like that if you look

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.560 
breaks in pieces like that if you look
at<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> new<00:01:37.950> o-ring<00:01:38.100> look<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.180> how<00:01:39.270> flexible

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
at a new o-ring look at how flexible

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.940 
at a new o-ring look at how flexible
that<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:41.909> obvious<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.680> ol

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that is so it was obvious that this ol

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.420 
that is so it was obvious that this ol
ring<00:01:44.189> had<00:01:44.399> kind<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.759> squared<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.390> harden<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
ring had kind of squared up harden and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
ring had kind of squared up harden and
the<00:01:47.430> transmission<00:01:48.299> fluid<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.899> flowing<00:01:49.200> right

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the transmission fluid was flowing right

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.350 
the transmission fluid was flowing right
through<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
through it

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.639 
through it
next<00:01:51.360> thing<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.570> did<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.899> remove<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> front

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
next thing I did was remove the front

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.300 
next thing I did was remove the front
seal<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.880> did<00:01:54.210> look<00:01:54.450> okay<00:01:55.040> still<00:01:56.040> very

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
seal and that did look okay still very

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.719 
seal and that did look okay still very
flexible<00:01:57.079> no<00:01:58.079> evidence<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.680> any<00:01:58.829> wear<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.520> this

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
flexible no evidence of any wear on this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.870 
flexible no evidence of any wear on this
lip<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.110> course<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.649> am<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> replace

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
lip but of course I am going to replace

install the front or the rear seal yet
but<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.540> thought<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.810> would<00:03:28.050> at<00:03:28.140> least<00:03:28.200> show<00:03:28.530> you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.310 
but I thought I would at least show you
my<00:03:29.580> approach<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.000> getting<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.720> seal<00:03:31.110> in

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
my approach to getting this seal in

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.360 
my approach to getting this seal in
properly<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.970> will<00:03:33.540> set<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:34.770> place<00:03:35.040> like

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
properly I will set this in place like

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.600 
properly I will set this in place like
this<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.150> using<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.750> special

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
this and then using this special

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.699 
this and then using this special
insertion<00:03:38.610> tool<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> have<00:03:39.330> made<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.959> can

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
insertion tool that I have made I can

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.350 
insertion tool that I have made I can
put<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.070> right<00:03:41.100> over<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.640> end<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.850> this<00:03:42.000> output

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
put it right over the end of this output

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.430 
put it right over the end of this output
shaft<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.380> get<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.190> outer<00:03:44.489> lip<00:03:44.880> and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
shaft and get it on the outer lip and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.580 
shaft and get it on the outer lip and
drive<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.980> seal<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.640> perfectly<00:03:48.270> straight

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
drive this seal in perfectly straight

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.530 
drive this seal in perfectly straight
this<00:03:49.590> tool<00:03:49.860> can<00:03:50.160> also<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.580> used<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.390> front

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
this tool can also be used for the front

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.050 
this tool can also be used for the front
seal<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.260> at<00:03:52.950> this<00:03:53.130> point<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.550> think<00:03:53.610> I'll<00:03:53.910> go

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
seal and at this point I think I'll go

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.510 
seal and at this point I think I'll go
ahead<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.660> provide<00:03:55.590> these<00:03:55.800> in<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.130> kits<00:03:56.400> that

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
difficult to get to so the wobble

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.970 
difficult to get to so the wobble
extension<00:05:03.900> is<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.050> must<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.590> get<00:05:04.770> these

of<00:05:07.680> course<00:05:07.890> you'll<00:05:08.070> also<00:05:08.250> need<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.670> seal

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
of course you'll also need a seal

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.210 
of course you'll also need a seal

the Flex discs and so i've acquired the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.680 
the Flex discs and so i've acquired the
new<00:05:23.100> flex<00:05:23.400> disc<00:05:23.640> you<00:05:23.850> can<00:05:24.030> really<00:05:24.360> tell<00:05:24.570> the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
new flex disc you can really tell the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.640 
new flex disc you can really tell the
difference<00:05:24.720> when<00:05:25.200> you<00:05:25.290> put<00:05:25.500> these

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
difference when you put these

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.130 
difference when you put these
side-by-side<00:05:26.120> particularly<00:05:27.120> in<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.840> amount

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
side-by-side particularly in the amount

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.640 
side-by-side particularly in the amount
of<00:05:28.320> swelling<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.420> cracking<00:05:30.420> on<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:31.080> old<00:05:31.380> one

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
of swelling and cracking on this old one

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.180 
of swelling and cracking on this old one
as<00:05:31.830> compared<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:33.030> new<00:05:33.180> flex<00:05:33.480> disc<00:05:34.190> and

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
as compared to the new flex disc and

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.190 
as compared to the new flex disc and
before<00:05:36.060> I<00:05:36.090> put<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.390> transmission<00:05:37.020> back

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
before I put the transmission back

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.770 
before I put the transmission back
together<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.650> back<00:05:37.830> in<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.310> decided<00:05:38.790> you<00:05:39.660> know

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
together and back in I decided you know

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.440 
there's one more thing I should really
do<00:05:42.330> on<00:05:42.510> this<00:05:42.660> car<00:05:43.730> before<00:05:44.730> that<00:05:44.910> transmission

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
do on this car before that transmission
