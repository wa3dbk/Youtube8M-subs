00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
purchases so those are usually my

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.290 
purchases so those are usually my
primary<00:01:43.990> things<00:01:44.229> my<00:01:44.500> major<00:01:44.740> plasmids<00:01:45.340> then

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
primary things my major plasmids then

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.910 
primary things my major plasmids then
health<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.780> Eve<00:01:46.900> and<00:01:47.200> then<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:49.210> combat<00:01:49.660> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
health and Eve and then the combat and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.550 
health and Eve and then the combat and
physical<00:01:50.920> slots<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:52.930> this<00:01:52.990> point<00:01:53.290> we're

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
physical slots so at this point we're

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.140 
physical slots so at this point we're
pretty<00:01:53.740> close<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.040> maxing<00:01:54.369> those<00:01:54.670> out<00:01:54.880> if<00:01:55.060> we

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
pretty close to maxing those out if we

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.760 
pretty close to maxing those out if we
haven't<00:01:55.330> already<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.690> can't<00:01:55.960> even<00:01:56.110> remember<00:01:56.350> so

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
haven't already I can't even remember so

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.060 
haven't already I can't even remember so
there<00:01:57.070> shouldn't<00:01:57.280> be<00:01:57.399> an<00:01:57.490> issue<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:59.070> think

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
there shouldn't be an issue I think

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.190 
there shouldn't be an issue I think
that's<00:02:00.190> pretty<00:02:00.280> much<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.700> this<00:02:00.789> vid<00:02:01.200> don't
