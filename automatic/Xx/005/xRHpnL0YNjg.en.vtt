00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.250
 tender pastels therefore opinions 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.529

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.900
 most loved this summer 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.580
 color and generally the most favorite lipstick is 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.610
 lipstick dior addict extreme 365 shade i 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.740
 I use it now every day 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.590
 the most favorite lipstick and she's just 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.750
 also gives just these kind of 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:15.320
 will gives a natural cube color 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:18.640
 if your lips are a little blue there 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.340
 some kind of faded then this here 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.080
 The most perfect seems to me lipstick for 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:27.110
 natural color and 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:32.240
 also from natural options similar 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:35.150
 shades of lively shade 03 already 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.510
 a little tears cut off the name from 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.020
 shade see that pink there is some well 0 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:45.830
 3 is also very similar, it is more fat 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.130
 By the way, well, Georgi seems to moisten but but 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.970
 if you have dry lips that may slightly 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.060
 dries here 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.730
 Zhivanshi very fat such and she 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.200
 dry will not be almost similar shades but 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:02.600
 it is more saturated because de 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.590
 vorovskaya still gives a little bit more 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.220
 light shade 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.160
 and this is a little brighter, but almost similar 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:14.150
 colors well here you can see that everything 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.180
 lipstick somewhere plus minus echo in 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.210
 shades but this is probably my most 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.150
 just favorite colors and really love this one 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.840
 set of two colors from inglot to 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.930
 sorry 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.350
 didn't fall and broke off on this one 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:35.470
 color is not very fond of chimeric by the way it 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:38.860
 21 but this one is just a pigment 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:41.479
 incredible super cool color just 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.090
 smartest but again see in such 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:49.760
 same color scheme now i will try it 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:53.860
 put a pen just incredibly cool 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.300
 the color and lips are just amazing 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.889
 I really think that this is one of 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:03.889
 The best products in and lot are very beautiful 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.600
 and generally incredibly cool moisturizes but 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:10.460
 actually here is such a small 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.320
 lipstick collection I love everything and decided 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.360
 maybe something to share with you 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.340
