it's<00:00:42.460> important<00:00:42.910> that<00:00:42.940> we<00:00:43.120> cast<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.630> very<00:00:43.840> thin

what<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.400> suggest<00:01:11.850> using<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> urethane<00:01:16.170> mat

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
what we suggest using is a urethane mat

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.289 
what we suggest using is a urethane mat
that<00:01:16.830> goes<00:01:17.009> underneath<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> compactor<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that goes underneath the compactor to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
that goes underneath the compactor to
protect<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> paver

during initial compaction the person

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.929 
during initial compaction the person
compacting<00:02:02.740> should<00:02:02.890> mark<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.220> broken<00:02:03.549> pavers

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
compacting should mark the broken pavers

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.850 
compacting should mark the broken pavers
while<00:02:04.240> another<00:02:04.479> person<00:02:04.930> follows<00:02:05.290> replacing

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
way of making sure that those pavers are

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.259 
way of making sure that those pavers are
compacted<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.290> use<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.739> 2x4<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.819> mallet

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.449 

also<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.330> can<00:02:22.569> use<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> 2x4<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.680> mallet<00:02:23.920> when

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
also you can use a 2x4 and a mallet when

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.009 
also you can use a 2x4 and a mallet when
you're<00:02:24.580> compacting<00:02:25.209> up<00:02:25.360> against<00:02:25.870> obstacles

you're compacting up against obstacles

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.720 
you're compacting up against obstacles
so<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.069> don't<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.459> worry<00:02:27.610> about

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
so that you don't have to worry about

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.640 
so that you don't have to worry about
