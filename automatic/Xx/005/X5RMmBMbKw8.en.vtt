tinuing from the unboxing and i found
specific<00:00:07.919> issues<00:00:08.280> on<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.580> camera<00:00:10.130> it<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.400> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
specific issues on this camera it is the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.390 
specific issues on this camera it is the
thing<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.630> basically<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.349> miniaturized<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
thing it is basically a miniaturized and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
thing it is basically a miniaturized and
lightened<00:00:15.299> version<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> three<00:00:17.210> it<00:00:18.210> is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
lightened version of the three it is

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:41.479 
lightened version of the three it is
lighter<00:00:18.949> like<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> find<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.760> weight

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:52.560 

on<00:00:42.489> out<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.390> 1<00:00:45.570> 500<00:00:46.570> grams<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:49.989> lens<00:00:51.570> I'm

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
on out and 1 500 grams with the lens I'm

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.210 
on out and 1 500 grams with the lens I'm
I<00:00:52.750> write<00:00:53.620> it<00:00:53.800> on<00:00:53.860> that<00:00:54.239> um<00:00:58.500> actually<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.710> hundred

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
I write it on that um actually a hundred

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.900 
I write it on that um actually a hundred
grams<00:01:00.460> of<00:01:00.699> 190<00:01:01.510> grams<00:01:02.280> body<00:01:03.280> alone<00:01:03.610> without

the memory card lens battery um

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.870 
the memory card lens battery um
guesstimate<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.690> lens<00:01:10.960> might<00:01:11.590> be<00:01:12.450> 600<00:01:13.450> I<00:01:14.880> best

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
guesstimate the lens might be 600 I best

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.080 
guesstimate the lens might be 600 I best
consider<00:01:16.780> be<00:01:16.930> like<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.619> three<00:01:18.310> off<00:01:19.030> of

it was you won't get any shadowing of

the lens or lets her diffusing inning so
there<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.390> go<00:04:49.960> so<00:04:50.960> lens<00:04:52.990> 18-55<00:04:53.990> now<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:56.419> is

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
there you go so lens 18-55 now it is

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.159 
there you go so lens 18-55 now it is
less<00:04:57.169> than<00:04:57.669> 300<00:04:58.669> lengths<00:04:59.560> 1570<00:05:00.560> mill<00:05:02.169> same

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
less than 300 lengths 1570 mill same

apertures<00:05:03.770> of<00:05:04.010> 3.5<00:05:04.700> in<00:05:05.000> what<00:05:05.630> six<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:11.750> that's

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
apertures of 3.5 in what six and that's

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.230 
apertures of 3.5 in what six and that's
it<00:05:13.930> all<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:16.340> course<00:05:16.640> some<00:05:16.790> more<00:05:17.000> vids

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
it all of course some more vids

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.140 
it all of course some more vids
hopefully<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.490> post<00:05:19.490> them<00:05:19.610> up<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:19.940> let<00:05:20.030> you

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
hopefully and post them up and let you

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.570 
hopefully and post them up and let you
know<00:05:20.210> how<00:05:20.950> I<00:05:21.950> go<00:05:22.250> with<00:05:22.400> this<00:05:22.520> camera<00:05:22.790> so
