tuned cuz I'm gonna show you how easy it
is<00:00:23.540> to<00:00:23.690> do<00:00:23.810> with<00:00:23.990> one<00:00:24.170> of<00:00:24.200> these<00:00:24.410> kits

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
is to do with one of these kits

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.130 
is to do with one of these kits
now<00:00:26.000> some<00:00:26.210> people<00:00:26.390> install<00:00:26.930> these

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
now some people install these

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.109 
now some people install these
high-intensity<00:00:27.500> blue<00:00:28.100> lights<00:00:28.369> because<00:00:28.790> they

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
high-intensity blue lights because they

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.330 
high-intensity blue lights because they
like<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.480> way<00:00:29.510> they<00:00:29.779> look<00:00:29.990> but<00:00:30.950> me<00:00:31.160> I'm

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
like the way they look but me I'm

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.890 
like the way they look but me I'm
putting<00:00:31.550> them<00:00:31.700> in<00:00:31.790> cuz<00:00:32.000> I'm<00:00:32.119> getting<00:00:32.450> old<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
putting them in cuz I'm getting old and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.440 
putting them in cuz I'm getting old and
they<00:00:33.350> work<00:00:33.560> three<00:00:33.920> times<00:00:33.950> better<00:00:34.640> at<00:00:34.940> night<00:00:35.150> so

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
they work three times better at night so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.080 
they work three times better at night so
I<00:00:35.510> can<00:00:35.750> see<00:00:35.990> I<00:00:36.290> just<00:00:37.130> got<00:00:37.460> mine<00:00:37.670> from<00:00:37.880> motor

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
I can see I just got mine from motor

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.590 
I can see I just got mine from motor
féin<00:00:38.420> for<00:00:38.720> 59<00:00:39.230> bucks<00:00:40.420> installation<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.540> pretty

féin for 59 bucks installation is pretty

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.160 
féin for 59 bucks installation is pretty
simple<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:42.230> just<00:00:42.500> take<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.800> old<00:00:42.950> bulb<00:00:43.310> out

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
simple you just take the old bulb out

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.799 
simple you just take the old bulb out
then<00:00:45.170> I'll<00:00:45.290> plug<00:00:45.590> it<00:00:46.510> then<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:47.600> get<00:00:47.719> the

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
then I'll plug it then you get the

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.590 
then I'll plug it then you get the
ballast<00:00:48.170> resistor<00:00:48.320> in<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.829> wiring<00:00:49.449> plug<00:00:50.449> it

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
ballast resistor in the wiring plug it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.380 
ballast resistor in the wiring plug it
in<00:00:50.719> to<00:00:50.840> where<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.140> light<00:00:51.320> was<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:52.760> clip<00:00:53.059> here

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
in to where the light was this clip here

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.020 
in to where the light was this clip here
fits<00:00:53.989> right<00:00:54.649> in<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:54.949> where<00:00:55.129> your<00:00:55.340> old<00:00:55.489> socket

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
fits right in to where your old socket

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.270 
fits right in to where your old socket
was<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:58.670> snapped<00:00:58.940> right<00:00:59.120> in<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:01.100> new

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
was that just snapped right in the new

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.270 
was that just snapped right in the new
HID<00:01:01.820> bulb<00:01:02.179> goes<00:01:02.449> back<00:01:03.199> into<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.500> car<00:01:03.800> fits

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
HID bulb goes back into the car fits

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.580 
HID bulb goes back into the car fits
into<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.610> hole<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.180> twists<00:01:05.630> in<00:01:05.720> place<00:01:05.990> to

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
into the hole and it twists in place to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.650 
into the hole and it twists in place to
lock<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.980> and<00:01:07.550> then<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> other<00:01:08.120> end<00:01:08.360> plugs

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
lock it and then the other end plugs

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.060 
lock it and then the other end plugs
into<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.050> ballast<00:01:09.320> resistor<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.590> voila

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
into the ballast resistor and voila

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.240 
into the ballast resistor and voila
there<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:15.410> look<00:01:15.590> at<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.860> difference

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
there is and just look at the difference

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.300 
there is and just look at the difference
here's<00:01:16.730> the<00:01:16.940> new<00:01:17.120> one<00:01:17.560> here's<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.770> old<00:01:18.920> one<00:01:19.189> it

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
here's the new one here's the old one it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.770 
here's the new one here's the old one it
doesn't<00:01:19.490> work<00:01:19.700> nearly<00:01:19.909> as<00:01:20.119> well<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.509> doesn't

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
doesn't work nearly as well it doesn't

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.080 
doesn't work nearly as well it doesn't
look<00:01:20.869> as<00:01:20.990> cool<00:01:21.140> later<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.729> course<00:01:22.939> you

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
look as cool later and of course you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.359 
look as cool later and of course you
want<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.270> do<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.450> neat<00:01:23.689> job<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.350> bolt<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:25.310> in

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
want to do a neat job so bolt it in

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.740 
want to do a neat job so bolt it in
place<00:01:25.579> with<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:25.820> bolts<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.360> comes<00:01:26.540> with

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
place with the bolts that it comes with

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.539 
place with the bolts that it comes with
so<00:01:27.259> it's<00:01:27.380> nice<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:27.590> solid<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.280> doesn't

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
so it's nice and solid and doesn't

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.609 
so it's nice and solid and doesn't
rattle<00:01:28.729> around<00:01:28.970> then<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.990> course<00:01:30.170> do<00:01:30.590> the

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
rattle around then of course do the

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.460 
rattle around then of course do the
other<00:01:30.890> side<00:01:31.189> so<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.759> match<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:33.049> voila

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
other side so the to match and voila

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.370 
other side so the to match and voila
there<00:01:34.340> they<00:01:34.579> are<00:01:34.610> all<00:01:35.360> done<00:01:35.750> didn't<00:01:36.079> take<00:01:36.200> but

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
there they are all done didn't take but

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.630 
there they are all done didn't take but
five<00:01:36.619> minutes<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.840> believe<00:01:39.799> it<00:01:39.920> or<00:01:39.979> not<00:01:40.189> they

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
five minutes and believe it or not they

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.060 
five minutes and believe it or not they
actually<00:01:41.060> use<00:01:41.240> 35<00:01:41.899> percent<00:01:42.350> less<00:01:42.560> energy<00:01:42.740> than

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
actually use 35 percent less energy than

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.850 
actually use 35 percent less energy than
halogen<00:01:43.729> bulbs<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:45.229> if<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.439> want<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.649> look

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
halogen bulbs so if you want to look

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.520 
halogen bulbs so if you want to look
cool<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.520> see<00:01:46.909> better<00:01:47.149> at<00:01:47.329> night<00:01:47.360> why<00:01:48.110> not<00:01:48.320> try

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
cool and see better at night why not try

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.289 
cool and see better at night why not try
some<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:48.890> these<00:01:48.950> high<00:01:49.159> intensity<00:01:49.670> xenon

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299
