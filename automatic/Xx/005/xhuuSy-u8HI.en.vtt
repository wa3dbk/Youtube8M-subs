okay<00:00:01.560> I've<00:00:01.740> got<00:00:01.770> another<00:00:01.949> turntable<00:00:02.790> on<00:00:02.850> the

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay I've got another turntable on the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.270 
okay I've got another turntable on the
bench<00:00:03.179> today<00:00:03.890> this<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.270> pioneer<00:00:06.270> P<00:00:06.899> L<00:00:07.080> -<00:00:07.470> L<00:00:07.740> 50

linear tracking table and a lot of the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.769 
linear tracking table and a lot of the
mechanical<00:00:28.920> stuff<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.910> actually<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> top

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
mechanical stuff is actually in the top

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.370 
mechanical stuff is actually in the top
cover

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
cover

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.910 
cover
so<00:00:32.780> put<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> towel<00:00:34.020> down<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> bench<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.770> keep

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
so put a towel down on the bench to keep

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.650 
so put a towel down on the bench to keep
the<00:00:35.010> cover<00:00:35.190> from<00:00:35.399> getting<00:00:35.700> scratched<00:00:35.880> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the cover from getting scratched and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.619 
the cover from getting scratched and
before<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> flip<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.770> over<00:00:38.360> I've<00:00:39.360> got<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
before you flip it over I've got to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.080 
before you flip it over I've got to
remove<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.050> platter<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.370> mat<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
remove the platter and the mat so it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
remove the platter and the mat so it
doesn't<00:00:42.360> fall<00:00:42.510> down<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.230> hit<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> top<00:00:44.040> cover

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
doesn't fall down and hit the top cover

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660 
doesn't fall down and hit the top cover
or<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> cartridge<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> remove

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
or the cartridge you also want to remove

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.720 
or the cartridge you also want to remove
that<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.180> for<00:00:48.660> safety<00:00:49.020> reasons

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
that for for safety reasons

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
that for for safety reasons
flip<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> over<00:00:50.910> take<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.300> bottom<00:00:51.660> cover<00:00:51.840> off

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
flip it over take the bottom cover off

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.139 
flip it over take the bottom cover off
and<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> stage<00:00:53.489> we're<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.789> here

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.700 

when<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> found<00:00:57.510> after<00:00:58.020> poking<00:00:58.350> around<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.559> my

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
when I found after poking around with my

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.790 
when I found after poking around with my
multimeter<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.550> had<00:01:00.390> 20<00:01:00.809> volts<00:01:01.079> AC<00:01:01.260> coming<00:01:01.710> out

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
multimeter I had 20 volts AC coming out

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
multimeter I had 20 volts AC coming out
of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> transformer<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.850> knew<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> was

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
of the transformer so I knew that was

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.859 
of the transformer so I knew that was
good<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:04.559> was<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.949> through<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> switch<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
good it was going through the switch and

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.640 
good it was going through the switch and
coming<00:01:06.869> back<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> main<00:01:07.500> board<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
coming back to the main board here and

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.630 
coming back to the main board here and
of<00:01:10.650> course<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> can't<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> other<00:01:11.430> side

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of course you can't see the other side

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
of course you can't see the other side
of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> board<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.720> full<00:01:13.020> wave

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
of the board but there's a full wave

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.859 
of the board but there's a full wave
rectifier<00:01:14.010> circuit<00:01:14.430> under<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
rectifier circuit under here and a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
rectifier circuit under here and a
filter<00:01:16.200> cap<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.340> voltage<00:01:17.670> was<00:01:17.790> coming<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
filter cap the voltage was coming out of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
filter cap the voltage was coming out of
the<00:01:18.360> rectifier<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.500> twenty<00:01:19.770> six

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the rectifier I had about twenty six

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
the rectifier I had about twenty six
volts<00:01:20.280> DC<00:01:20.750> across<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> main<00:01:22.080> filter<00:01:22.350> cap

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
volts DC across the main filter cap

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.570 
volts DC across the main filter cap
there<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:25.200> was<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> nothing

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
there and it was going out and nothing

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.850 
there and it was going out and nothing
was<00:01:26.820> clinging<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.299> there's<00:01:27.900> test<00:01:28.409> points

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
was clinging back there's test points

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
was clinging back there's test points
throughout<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.640> board<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.090> five<00:01:30.509> volts

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

on either test point nada and first I

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.760 
on either test point nada and first I
checked<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> interlock<00:01:46.020> switches<00:01:46.380> those

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
checked the interlock switches those

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.210 
checked the interlock switches those
were<00:01:46.950> okay<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.329> got<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.600> looking<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:48.930> these

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
were okay and I got to looking at these

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
were okay and I got to looking at these
voltage<00:01:50.220> regulators<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.079> now<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.350> are

voltage regulators here now these are

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 
voltage regulators here now these are
very<00:01:52.829> common<00:01:53.549> three<00:01:53.790> terminal<00:01:54.240> voltage

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
very common three terminal voltage

one's a 7812 basically you got your
input<00:02:00.990> voltage<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> first<00:02:01.799> pin<00:02:02.100> ground<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
input voltage on the first pin ground is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
input voltage on the first pin ground is
the<00:02:03.360> second<00:02:03.719> pin<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.259> output<00:02:04.649> voltage<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the second pin and output voltage is the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.290 
the second pin and output voltage is the
third<00:02:05.430> pin<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:07.350> had<00:02:08.160> 22<00:02:08.550> volts<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:08.940> in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
third pin and I had 22 volts going in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.910 
third pin and I had 22 volts going in
and<00:02:09.629> 1<00:02:09.899> volt<00:02:10.140> coming<00:02:10.530> out<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.009> there's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and 1 volt coming out so there's

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.440 
and 1 volt coming out so there's
question<00:02:12.340> about<00:02:12.520> that<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.940> 12<00:02:13.240> volt

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
question about that that 12 volt

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.040 
question about that that 12 volt
regulator<00:02:13.690> was<00:02:13.959> bad<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.300> got<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.690> changed

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
regulator was bad so I got that changed

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.850 
regulator was bad so I got that changed
out<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.599> since<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:19.750> also<00:02:19.959> feeds<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.650> five

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
out and since that also feeds the five

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.940 
out and since that also feeds the five
volts<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.090> now<00:02:22.239> working<00:02:22.450> as<00:02:22.780> well<00:02:22.959> all

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
volts that is now working as well all

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.830 
volts that is now working as well all
the<00:02:24.010> voltages<00:02:24.730> are<00:02:24.790> normal<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:28.300> now<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.540> have

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the voltages are normal and now we have

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.000 
the voltages are normal and now we have
an<00:02:28.989> LED<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:31.110> I'm<00:02:32.110> gonna<00:02:32.230> flip<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.800> over

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
an LED so I'm gonna flip this back over

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.180 
an LED so I'm gonna flip this back over
put<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.400> platter<00:02:33.730> back<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:36.040> how<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
put the platter back on and see how the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.670 
put the platter back on and see how the
motor<00:02:36.430> runs<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:38.050> hopefully<00:02:38.380> there's<00:02:38.590> no

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
motor runs and hopefully there's no

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.470 
motor runs and hopefully there's no
other<00:02:38.800> major<00:02:39.100> issues<00:02:39.550> with<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.880> I'd<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.300> to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
other major issues with this I'd like to

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.800 
other major issues with this I'd like to
just<00:02:40.900> clean<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.560> see<00:02:42.250> how<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.459> plays

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
just clean it up and see how it plays

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.259 
just clean it up and see how it plays
could<00:02:43.810> have<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:45.370> know<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.850> tracking

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
could have you know the tracking

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.110 
could have you know the tracking
mechanism<00:02:46.750> might<00:02:46.930> need<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> belt<00:02:47.410> or

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
mechanism might need a belt or

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.220 
mechanism might need a belt or
adjustment<00:02:49.120> who<00:02:49.209> knows<00:02:49.450> we'll<00:02:49.810> find<00:02:50.049> out<00:02:50.200> a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
adjustment who knows we'll find out a

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.020 
adjustment who knows we'll find out a
little<00:02:50.560> bit<00:02:50.680> here<00:02:53.670> all<00:02:54.670> right<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.880> got<00:02:55.000> it

that are up here in the top cover that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.640 
that are up here in the top cover that
are<00:03:16.209> for<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:17.010> automatic<00:03:18.010> sized<00:03:18.600> circuit<00:03:19.650> what

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
are for the automatic sized circuit what

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.110 
are for the automatic sized circuit what
they<00:03:20.769> do<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:21.100> they<00:03:21.220> shine<00:03:21.489> down<00:03:21.730> through<00:03:22.000> these

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
they do is they shine down through these

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.699 
they do is they shine down through these
holes<00:03:22.359> in<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.630> platter<00:03:22.870> mat<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.410> hit<00:03:23.500> some

holes in the platter mat and hit some

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.940 
holes in the platter mat and hit some
photo<00:03:23.920> transistors<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.870> tells<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.440> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
photo transistors and that tells the the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.370 
photo transistors and that tells the the
turntable<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:27.640> size<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.150> record<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.660> so

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
turntable what size the record is so

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.110 
turntable what size the record is so
that<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> can<00:03:29.739> drop<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.250> cartridge<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:31.030> the
