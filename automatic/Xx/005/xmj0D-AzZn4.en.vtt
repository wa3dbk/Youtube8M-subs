 China but copied from italian and 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.600
 have less refined color range and 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.610
 Polyester ties are cheaper 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.729
 but worse tied 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.190
 artificial fabric less fluid except 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.830

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.720
 cheap glitter fabric while

 made of polyester 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.140
 look carefully at the surface of the fabric 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.520
 and check for possible defects 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.830
 workmanship if you put a tie 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.530
 across the palm of the wide end should 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.959
 hanging from 1 in the same plane not 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.450

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.509
 lie flat after

 give preference to a tie with a label 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.340
 hand-made which just means 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.920
 that the central seam of the tie is made 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.020
 by hand but the quality of the tie is 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.789
