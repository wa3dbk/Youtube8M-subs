00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.200 
Roger how do you feel that you turned
around<00:00:02.040> what<00:00:02.399> was<00:00:02.580> potentially<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> very

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
around what was potentially a very

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.780 
around what was potentially a very
difficult<00:00:03.540> situation<00:00:03.810> tonight<00:00:04.609> well<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.640> mean

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
difficult situation tonight well I mean

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.150 
difficult situation tonight well I mean
was<00:00:05.970> incredibly<00:00:06.690> close<00:00:06.930> he<00:00:07.529> was<00:00:07.560> serving<00:00:07.950> at

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
was incredibly close he was serving at

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.640 
was incredibly close he was serving at
64<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.760> tiebreaker<00:00:09.210> came<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.050> net<00:00:10.230> did

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
64 in a tiebreaker came to the net did

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.290 
64 in a tiebreaker came to the net did
everything<00:00:10.920> right<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.610> came<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.090> good

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
everything right and I came with a good

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.430 
everything right and I came with a good
passing<00:00:12.660> shot<00:00:13.759> look<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.880> mean<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.120> think<00:00:15.509> he

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
passing shot look I mean I think he

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.230 
passing shot look I mean I think he
deserved<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> mat<00:00:17.160> as<00:00:17.279> much<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.640> i<00:00:17.760> did<00:00:18.000> today

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
deserved the mat as much as i did today

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.330 
deserved the mat as much as i did today
and<00:00:18.420> maybe<00:00:19.020> even<00:00:19.170> bit<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:19.830> he<00:00:20.160> was

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and maybe even bit more because he was

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.710 
and maybe even bit more because he was
first<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.760> their<00:00:20.850> meaning<00:00:21.090> position<00:00:21.539> but

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
first in their meaning position but

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840 
first in their meaning position but
tennis<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.039> any<00:00:23.189> drawers<00:00:23.490> there's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
tennis we don't have any drawers there's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.880 
tennis we don't have any drawers there's
always<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.420> winner<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.710> guess

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
always going to be a winner and I guess

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.950 
always going to be a winner and I guess
I<00:00:26.039> got<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> bit<00:00:26.250> lucky<00:00:26.670> today<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.570> don't<00:00:27.840> like

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
I got a bit lucky today but I don't like

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.540 
I got a bit lucky today but I don't like
to<00:00:28.080> use<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.410> word<00:00:28.619> because<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.130> probably

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to use the word because I probably

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.130 
to use the word because I probably
forced<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> lock<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.480> side<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> end

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
forced the lock on my side in the end

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.979 
forced the lock on my side in the end
and<00:00:31.669> played<00:00:32.669> well<00:00:32.850> action<00:00:33.210> again<00:00:33.390> because<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and played well action again because the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.569 
and played well action again because the
beginning<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.500> tough<00:00:34.710> he<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.130> serving<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
beginning was tough he was serving so

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.330 
beginning was tough he was serving so
well<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.910> playing<00:00:36.120> good<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.010> really<00:00:38.010> relieved

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
away after those two obviously depends

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
away after those two obviously depends
