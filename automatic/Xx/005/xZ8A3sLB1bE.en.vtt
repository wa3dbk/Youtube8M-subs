00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
trip when I'm being on a Wi-Fi source I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
trip when I'm being on a Wi-Fi source I
mean<00:00:50.489> there's<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:50.760> much<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.390> anyway

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
mean there's not much you can do anyway

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
mean there's not much you can do anyway
so<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.050> don't<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> quit<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so you don't want to quit out of it you

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.889 
so you don't want to quit out of it you
want<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.879> stay<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> app<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
want to stay on the app if you want to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.750 
want to stay on the app if you want to
keep<00:00:54.989> plugging<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.399> see<00:00:56.579> right

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
keep plugging it so as you can see right

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.270 
keep plugging it so as you can see right
now<00:00:57.109> it's<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.289> opening<00:00:58.800> without

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
now it's actually opening without

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.319 
now it's actually opening without
internet<00:00:59.730> no<00:01:00.300> internet<00:01:00.750> connection<00:01:02.329> so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
internet no internet connection so

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.640 
internet no internet connection so
that's<00:01:03.870> how<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.409> take

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that's how you do that and it will take

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's how you do that and it will take
a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> load<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.760> does

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a little bit to load but it does

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.300 
a little bit to load but it does
eventually<00:01:10.010> load<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> I'll<00:01:13.799> wait<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
eventually load so I'll wait for it to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.739 
eventually load so I'll wait for it to
load<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.700> guys

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:25.820 

let's<00:01:19.170> wait<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> bit

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.550 

so<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.550> does<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so you does take a bit but then it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200 
so you does take a bit but then it
actually<00:01:28.590> does<00:01:29.190> see<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.000> making

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
actually does see now it's making

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
actually does see now it's making
progress<00:01:31.640> may<00:01:32.640> take<00:01:32.910> a<00:01:32.940> little<00:01:33.180> while<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:35.100> as

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
progress may take a little while but as

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.370 
progress may take a little while but as
you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.580> see<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.510> actually<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> loading<00:01:39.380> so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can see it actually is loading so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.630
