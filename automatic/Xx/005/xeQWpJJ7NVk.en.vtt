if<00:00:27.180> nothing<00:00:27.599> else<00:00:27.689> i<00:00:28.050> guess<00:00:28.230> i<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.500> still<00:00:28.680> put

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
if nothing else i guess i can still put

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.560 
if nothing else i guess i can still put
this<00:00:29.070> one's<00:00:29.400> own<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:29.880> i<00:00:30.029> don't<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.449> they

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
this one's own but i don't think they

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.510
