00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
the top so we're going to start with the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.500 
the top so we're going to start with the
bottom<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.640> a<00:00:55.850> mixture<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.559> 50/50<00:00:58.510> salt

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510
