00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
all right this is what I think about

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.720 
all right this is what I think about
people<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.980> this<00:00:19.980> words<00:00:20.250> gonna<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.580> really

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
people and this words gonna get really

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.460 
people and this words gonna get really
weird<00:00:20.940> I<00:00:21.380> think<00:00:22.380> human<00:00:23.220> beings<00:00:23.720> are<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
weird I think human beings are just a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980 
weird I think human beings are just a
very<00:00:25.770> complicated<00:00:26.369> form<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.180> bacteria<00:00:27.720> I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
very complicated form of bacteria I

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.630 
very complicated form of bacteria I
think<00:00:28.470> if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> looked<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> earth<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.580> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
think if you looked at the earth as a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
think if you looked at the earth as a
living<00:00:29.789> organism<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.960> who's<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.619> say<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
living organism and who's to say that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
living organism and who's to say that
it's<00:00:32.010> not<00:00:32.160> some<00:00:32.430> sort<00:00:32.580> of<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.760> super<00:00:33.120> organism

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
it's not some sort of a super organism

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840 
it's not some sort of a super organism
it's<00:00:33.780> certainly<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> host<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.769> life<00:00:34.949> and<00:00:35.309> we're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's certainly a host for life and we're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's certainly a host for life and we're
considered<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> living<00:00:37.050> organism<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.590> really

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
considered a living organism but really

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.459 
considered a living organism but really
we're<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> host<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.640> life<00:00:38.820> there's<00:00:39.480> more<00:00:39.750> ecoli

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
we're a host for life there's more ecoli

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.770 
we're a host for life there's more ecoli
living<00:00:41.040> inside<00:00:41.489> our<00:00:41.550> gut<00:00:42.059> than<00:00:42.480> they've<00:00:42.629> ever

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
living inside our gut than they've ever

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.380 
living inside our gut than they've ever
been<00:00:42.960> people<00:00:43.500> ever<00:00:43.739> there's<00:00:44.309> bacteria<00:00:44.550> that's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
been people ever there's bacteria that's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
been people ever there's bacteria that's
constantly<00:00:46.079> around<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> your<00:00:47.190> your

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
constantly around you and your your

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
constantly around you and your your
body's<00:00:47.879> fighting<00:00:48.300> off<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> bacteria<00:00:49.260> until

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
body's fighting off that bacteria until

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.069 
body's fighting off that bacteria until
your<00:00:49.950> body<00:00:50.129> grows<00:00:50.550> old<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.940> dies<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
your body grows old and dies and then it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.600 
your body grows old and dies and then it
doesn't<00:00:52.350> fight<00:00:52.500> anymore<00:00:52.950> that's<00:00:53.129> bacteria

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
doesn't fight anymore that's bacteria

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
doesn't fight anymore that's bacteria
just<00:00:53.730> eats<00:00:54.030> your<00:00:54.270> body<00:00:54.480> that's<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.440> does

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
just eats your body that's what it does

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.240 
just eats your body that's what it does
I<00:00:55.620> mean<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:56.160> that's<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:56.969> for

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
I mean that's that's what it's there for

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
I mean that's that's what it's there for
okay<00:00:59.250> well<00:00:59.579> if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.360> looked<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> earth<00:01:01.020> as

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
rebuilds light it on fire

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.390 
rebuilds light it on fire
rebuilds<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.040> were<00:01:29.250> an

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
rebuilds and I think if you were an

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.399 
rebuilds and I think if you were an
intelligent<00:01:29.729> lifeform<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.720> another<00:01:30.930> planet

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
intelligent lifeform from another planet

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
intelligent lifeform from another planet
and<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.590> were<00:01:31.680> looking<00:01:31.830> at<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> earth<00:01:32.570> you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and you were looking at the earth you

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
and you were looking at the earth you
wouldn't<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.259> individual<00:01:35.189> people<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
wouldn't see individual people you

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
wouldn't see individual people you
wouldn't<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.860> housekeepers<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.189> limo

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
wouldn't see housekeepers and limo

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.550 
wouldn't see housekeepers and limo
drivers<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.299> stand-up<00:01:39.689> comedians<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
drivers and stand-up comedians you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.310 
drivers and stand-up comedians you
wouldn't<00:01:40.860> see<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.880> would<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.360> mold<00:01:42.869> on

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
wouldn't see that you would see mold on

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.920 
wouldn't see that you would see mold on
a<00:01:43.380> sandwich<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.479> look<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.840> us

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
a sandwich I think if you look at us

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
a sandwich I think if you look at us
objectively<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> way<00:01:47.189> we're<00:01:47.399> headed<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
objectively and the way we're headed and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.789 
objectively and the way we're headed and
the<00:01:48.119> way<00:01:48.270> we've<00:01:48.450> always<00:01:48.600> been<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.500> doesn't

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the way we've always been it doesn't

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.380 
the way we've always been it doesn't
matter<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.100> much<00:01:50.220> access<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> information<00:01:51.000> we

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
matter how much access to information we

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.270 
matter how much access to information we
have<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:52.020> doesn't<00:01:52.229> matter<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:53.009> much

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
have it doesn't matter how much

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
have it doesn't matter how much
technological<00:01:54.119> innovation<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.840> we're

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
technological innovation we have we're

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
technological innovation we have we're
always<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> destroy<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.909> earth

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
always going to destroy the earth

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.960 
always going to destroy the earth
because<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.409> somehow<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.939> another
