 Alkmaar is continuing to move on from one event to the other 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.709

 new jetta in the pants 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.399
 another week and then the car is driving 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.749
 after the 2009 edition, this is how old familiar design followed 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.989
 With own votes for the brands and niek I understand that there is even one 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.060
 world first 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.840
 yes that is nothing more or less than a road tax free ford focus to 105 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.810
 pk diesel and the 34 gram emissions between citizens that is enough for the 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.109
 road tax-free status 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.969
 and it is also the first profit of inter in that segment year and six people so bad 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.929
 that unfortunately it is only that the parents are unsure but that is okay 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.160
 road tax free with a diesel in the focus 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.430
 yes and focus on the next top of the new stadium 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.200
 yes that's right that is before your anti state on the autorai was away from five or 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.889
 six states 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:03.569
 Once in a while, natural design for tennis player became a reality 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:04.739
 the eyes must look 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:09.190
 with it 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.260
 the support to greece the fans have blown the spot 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.930
 and now shorter and governments are becoming fuel-efficient cars with too little addition 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.830
 but is also still a bit to take away, certainly when they ask 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.600
 not at all at fc emmen passage he expects the world first so it is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.160

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.380
 why in china 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.900

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.030
