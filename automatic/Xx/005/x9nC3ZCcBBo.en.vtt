think the pros really look upon a short

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.370 
think the pros really look upon a short
stack<00:01:32.040> play<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:33.150> being<00:01:33.570> totally<00:01:34.020> different

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

where I think a lot of pros just want to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.819 
where I think a lot of pros just want to
shove<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.500> try<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.650> get

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
shove it all in there and try to get

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.149 
shove it all in there and try to get
lucky<00:01:41.750> betting<00:01:42.750> all<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.170> sometimes<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.040> have

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
lucky betting all of it sometimes I have

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
lucky betting all of it sometimes I have
a<00:01:44.220> short<00:01:44.430> stack<00:01:44.640> I'll<00:01:44.790> bet<00:01:45.000> twenty<00:01:45.780> five

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
a short stack I'll bet twenty five

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.450 
a short stack I'll bet twenty five
percent<00:01:45.960> thirty<00:01:46.619> percent<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.070> chips<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
percent thirty percent of my chips and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
percent thirty percent of my chips and
I'll<00:01:47.520> fold<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> race<00:01:48.240> rather<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.170> just

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
I'll fold for a race rather than just

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.780 
I'll fold for a race rather than just
bad<00:01:49.500> at<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> kind<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> different

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
bad at all so it's a kind of a different

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.510 
bad at all so it's a kind of a different
philosophy<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:53.009> many<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.250> mean

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
philosophy that I have how many I mean

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.450 
philosophy that I have how many I mean
when<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.329> Phil<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> mean<00:01:55.130> even<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
when you do that Phil I mean even if you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.920 
when you do that Phil I mean even if you
pick<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.969> big<00:01:57.149> hand<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> double<00:01:57.869> up

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
pick up a big hand and you double up

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.389 
pick up a big hand and you double up
you're<00:01:58.140> still<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> short<00:01:58.619> stack<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you're still a short stack then the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
you're still a short stack then the
problem<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.790> cloning<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.600> me<00:02:00.719> especially

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
problem is cloning for me especially

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
problem is cloning for me especially
when<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> antes<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
when the antes are out there is that so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
when the antes are out there is that so
many<00:02:03.689> times<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.110> my<00:02:04.200> life<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.530> been<00:02:04.619> down<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
many times in my life have been down to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
many times in my life have been down to
two<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.130> three<00:02:05.310> hundred<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> ships<00:02:05.850> when

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
two or three hundred and ships when

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.510 
two or three hundred and ships when
everyone<00:02:07.049> else<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.259> 12,000<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.160> I've<00:02:08.310> come

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
everyone else has 12,000 and I've come

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.010 
everyone else has 12,000 and I've come
back<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:09.030> pretty<00:02:09.209> good<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> short<00:02:09.750> stack

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
back I'm pretty good at the short stack

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.630 
back I'm pretty good at the short stack
and<00:02:10.289> I'm<00:02:10.379> come<00:02:10.590> back<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.979> chip<00:02:11.160> lead<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and I'm come back to the chip lead and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.070 
and I'm come back to the chip lead and
so<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
so I have the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.780 
so I have the
kind<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.650> know<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.890> sting<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.430> makes<00:02:14.610> me

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
kind of you know the sting that makes me

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
kind of you know the sting that makes me
want<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> save<00:02:15.390> some<00:02:15.420> chips<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.110> those

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
want to save some chips because those

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.620 
want to save some chips because those
comebacks<00:02:17.340> happen<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.240> when<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.450> give

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
comebacks happen you know when I give

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.570 
comebacks happen you know when I give
myself<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.050> best<00:02:19.170> chance<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.890> yet<00:02:20.370> definitely

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
myself the best chance so yet definitely

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.160 
myself the best chance so yet definitely
fill<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.540> very<00:02:21.780> different

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
fill and I have very different

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.230 
fill and I have very different
philosophies<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.920> i<00:02:22.950> mean<00:02:23.460> i<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.880> phil

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
philosophies on that i mean i think phil

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.420 
philosophies on that i mean i think phil
has<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> lot<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.080> faith<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.350> his<00:02:25.590> ability<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:26.220> win

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
has a lot of faith in his ability to win

has a lot of faith in his ability to win
a<00:02:26.460> few<00:02:26.790> hands<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.630> back<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> chip

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
a few hands and get back to the chip

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.120 
a few hands and get back to the chip
lead<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.710> I<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.710> make<00:02:31.710> my<00:02:31.860> stand

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
lead I I like to kind of make my stand

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.730 
lead I I like to kind of make my stand
before<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.640> get<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.210> short<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.380> feel<00:02:34.620> like

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
before I get that short and I feel like

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.100 
before I get that short and I feel like
if<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.130> have<00:02:35.220> enough<00:02:35.550> chips<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.930> can

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
if you have enough chips so that you can

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.530 
if you have enough chips so that you can
pick<00:02:37.320> your<00:02:37.500> spot<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:38.940> Mike<00:02:39.210> agrees

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
pick your spot and I know Mike agrees

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.820 
pick your spot and I know Mike agrees
with<00:02:39.690> me<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.650> can

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
with me on this is this so that you can

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.920 
with me on this is this so that you can
pick<00:02:41.040> your<00:02:41.190> spot<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.700> raise<00:02:42.090> somebody<00:02:42.510> with

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
pick your spot and raise somebody with

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.780 
pick your spot and raise somebody with
enough<00:02:43.290> chips<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.740> they<00:02:43.890> can't<00:02:44.160> even<00:02:44.370> call<00:02:44.550> you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
enough chips so they can't even call you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.750 
enough chips so they can't even call you
and<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.080> pick<00:02:46.350> your<00:02:46.530> spot<00:02:46.800> right<00:02:47.430> like

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
and then you pick your spot right like

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.520 
and then you pick your spot right like
two<00:02:48.000> or<00:02:48.150> three<00:02:48.180> or<00:02:48.510> four<00:02:48.540> times<00:02:48.900> sometimes<00:02:49.260> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
two or three or four times sometimes you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.560 
two or three or four times sometimes you
can<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.800> back<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> strong<00:02:50.700> step<00:02:51.000> without

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
can get back to a strong step without

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.449 
can get back to a strong step without
even<00:02:52.020> risking<00:02:52.410> going<00:02:52.560> broke<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.070> have<00:02:53.310> this

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
even risking going broke I have this

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.240 
even risking going broke I have this
thing<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:54.140> say<00:02:55.140> okay<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.470> grab<00:02:55.830> my<00:02:55.860> chips

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
thing that I say okay I grab my chips

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.040 
thing that I say okay I grab my chips
and<00:02:56.459> there's<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.730> breaking<00:02:57.150> point<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.870> get

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
and there's a breaking point if I get

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.260 
and there's a breaking point if I get
below<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.320> breaking<00:02:58.770> point<00:02:58.950> I'm<00:02:59.610> out<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.150> it

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
below the breaking point I'm out of it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.030 
below the breaking point I'm out of it
so<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.660> leave<00:03:00.959> myself<00:03:01.110> like<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> couple<00:03:01.800> ship

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
so I leave myself like a couple ship

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.920 
so I leave myself like a couple ship
above<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.640> breaking<00:03:02.970> point<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.630> where<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> can

above the breaking point to where I can

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.980

to double up a short stack either early
in<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.390> tournament<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.290> understand<00:04:05.010> we're

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
in the tournament so I understand we're
