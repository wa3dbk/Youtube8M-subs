00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.870
 of pc gt5 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.600
 this bike does not brake anything efe 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.800
 better said and why do you put this 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.210
 strange that played the weird we're 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.350
 here with beautiful and we are not with 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.090
 subscribers because I do not know why but 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.210
 the writers said 5 it seems like 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.710
 if he had as if there were no is 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.410
 totally non - existent there is none 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 male the stray and burying in a 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.980
 motorcycle race so we're going to 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.500
 give it a shot to see if we can win 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.770
 this race is worth it for now 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.960
 fourth and for the face is called brook 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.510
 up I think the juve I do not remember god 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.950
 I go to so many races so we go to 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
 the management is very positive 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.050
 just like the little mouse paints we're going 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.280
 the chemical guide all in which each side 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.050
 that you have me as if I stayed 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.780
 still that the site and that then makes 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.159
 my speed then back off ok let's go 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.670
 quarters and keeps talking to me it seems 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.229
 perfect 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.479
 these because I think I have the graphics 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.400
 too many bottles and then between that 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.140
 and that recorded to more powerful still and that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.909
 obviously all the power then 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.710
 makes the computer say they have 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.090
 done a little bit mate that veto 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.080
 that water is coming to my neck 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.030
 after 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.909
 those are the consequences of life I 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.759
 I go in Tokyo this goes more pull is that 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.149
 there is more fan minute life but 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.360
 operates of rather well do you know the face the 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.360
 lifetime 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.280
 here what happens is a little bit 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.470
 that yes it is true I have in 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.060
 how many points are uncle what I do know 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.670
 that today there are people who shit on me 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.550
 has and ends and ends the barriers 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.960
 this is the political beginning go back 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.330
 what a return, as you are seeing, we are in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.940
 another different career and in this case 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.200
 well, a race with super- site cars 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 each career is in contact 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.340
 thing I do not understand why watches 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.780
 two in the same place gave the case we're going 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.550
 first and I need each one career 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.870
 I started uncle I started, I'm given this a 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.100
 bit wrong but do not look here is that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.540
 do not change a charge god saw a post 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.310
 of fruits I love the posts the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.570
 dish they give me they give me as joy for 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.490
 inside you know a fruit stand and I 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.080
 I put myself happy I do not know why the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.080
 case we could say that the fruit 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.690
 it gives me happiness that sounds like a mute 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.880
 Poetry phrase do not tell me no boy 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.140
 of increases first this is without contact 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.940
 thing that selling because it's a 5 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.130
 kilometers and the race pretty the rich 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.080
 and as you can see I wear the color of the crew 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.380
 to whom I started the bet if blue and 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.850
 is super pretty that is written is worth 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:51.570
 when we first got nobody 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:53.280
 I think my teammates catch me but 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.300
 nothing happens because there is no contact 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.930
 although I prefer that there is contact 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.180

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.380
