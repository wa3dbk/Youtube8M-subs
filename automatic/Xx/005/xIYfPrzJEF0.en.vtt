works michelle explain what happens with
a<00:01:41.210> laser<00:01:41.420> oh<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.530> boys<00:01:42.740> are<00:01:43.100> we<00:01:43.310> grid<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.060> off

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
a laser oh it boys are we grid you off

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.260 
a laser oh it boys are we grid you off
and<00:01:44.600> then<00:01:44.859> each<00:01:45.859> pulse<00:01:46.460> will<00:01:46.640> cover<00:01:46.850> about<00:01:46.939> the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
and then each pulse will cover about the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.980 
and then each pulse will cover about the
size<00:01:47.479> of<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.719> quarter<00:01:47.990> everything<00:01:48.590> is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
size of a quarter everything is

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.219 
size of a quarter everything is
the<00:01:49.110> circle<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.850> fairly<00:01:51.570> quick<00:01:51.990> once

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the circle and so it's fairly quick once

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
the circle and so it's fairly quick once
we<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.790> over<00:01:54.329> that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
we get going and then we just over that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.740 
we get going and then we just over that
and<00:01:54.840> what's<00:01:55.799> happening<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.240> laser<00:01:57.509> is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and what's happening is the laser is

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.700 
and what's happening is the laser is
going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.470> target<00:01:59.390> the<00:02:00.390> melanin<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.140> here

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
