as much as the first book one of them

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.850 
as much as the first book one of them
being<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.660> really<00:02:13.959> wanted<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.319> go<00:02:14.440> back<00:02:14.620> into

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
being I really wanted to go back into

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.979 
being I really wanted to go back into
Wonderland<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.180> she<00:02:16.270> doesn't<00:02:16.510> go<00:02:16.959> to

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
Wonderland so she doesn't go to

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.470 
Wonderland so she doesn't go to
wonderland<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.160> book<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:19.150> kind<00:02:19.390> of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
wonderland in this book and it kind of

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.570 
wonderland in this book and it kind of
leaves<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.900> knowing<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.470> probably<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
leaves you knowing that probably the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.490 
leaves you knowing that probably the
third<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.150> final<00:02:22.330> book<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.900> really<00:02:23.170> gonna

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
third and the final book is really gonna

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.790 
third and the final book is really gonna
be<00:02:23.739> spent<00:02:24.300> basically<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.870> main<00:02:26.020> whole<00:02:26.470> book

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
be spent basically the main whole book

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.850 
be spent basically the main whole book
in<00:02:27.040> Wonderland<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.270> understand<00:02:29.020> why<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
in Wonderland so I understand why the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.050 
in Wonderland so I understand why the
second<00:02:30.730> book<00:02:30.880> has<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.330> be<00:02:31.780> in<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.200> human<00:02:32.620> realm

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
second book has to be in the human realm

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.820 
second book has to be in the human realm
so<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.090> way<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.420> can<00:02:34.690> lead<00:02:34.930> up<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.530> third

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
so that way I can lead up to the third

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.770 
so that way I can lead up to the third
book<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.610> shows<00:02:36.880> her<00:02:37.090> struggle<00:02:37.540> between

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
book and it shows her struggle between

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.890 
book and it shows her struggle between
her<00:02:38.680> Wonderland<00:02:39.280> soften<00:02:39.760> her<00:02:39.910> human<00:02:40.269> self<00:02:40.630> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
her Wonderland soften her human self and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.460 
her Wonderland soften her human self and
I<00:02:41.230> get<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.519> loved<00:02:43.050> Wonderland<00:02:44.050> and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
I get that I really loved Wonderland and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.759 
I get that I really loved Wonderland and
that's<00:02:45.160> what<00:02:45.370> really<00:02:45.400> made<00:02:46.090> me<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.959> tune<00:02:47.470> to

that's what really made me so in tune to

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.220 
that's what really made me so in tune to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
series for Alyssa I really like Morpheus

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.190 
series for Alyssa I really like Morpheus
and<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:16.090> first<00:03:16.359> book<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.840> didn't<00:03:17.109> really

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
and in the first book I didn't really

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.050 
and in the first book I didn't really
like<00:03:17.410> Morpheus<00:03:17.890> at<00:03:18.040> all<00:03:18.250> but<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> second

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
like Morpheus at all but in the second

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.060 
like Morpheus at all but in the second
book<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.269> just<00:03:19.299> felt<00:03:19.720> that<00:03:19.959> Jeb's<00:03:20.350> character

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
book I just felt that Jeb's character

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.930 
book I just felt that Jeb's character
was<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:22.109> blah<00:03:23.109> there<00:03:23.799> wasn't<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.310> lot<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.790> his

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
was just blah there wasn't a lot to his

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.910 
was just blah there wasn't a lot to his
character<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.510> so<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.500> made<00:03:26.739> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
character and so it made the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.670 
character and so it made the
interactions<00:03:27.579> between<00:03:27.900> Alyssa<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.200> Morpheus

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
interactions between Alyssa and Morpheus

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.430 
interactions between Alyssa and Morpheus
all<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.519> more<00:03:30.670> exciting<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.510> he<00:03:31.750> calls<00:03:32.109> to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
all that more exciting and he calls to

because it would be great to kind of see

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.660 
because it would be great to kind of see
them<00:03:54.670> both<00:03:54.970> but<00:03:55.569> at<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.810> same<00:03:56.019> time<00:03:56.319> I<00:03:56.829> feel

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
them both but at the same time I feel

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.030 
them both but at the same time I feel
like<00:03:57.819> that's<00:03:57.940> already<00:03:58.390> been<00:03:58.720> done<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.769> another

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
like that's already been done in another

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.420 
like that's already been done in another
series<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.299> don't<00:04:01.720> want<00:04:02.079> it<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:03.100> kind<00:04:03.280> of

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
series and so I don't want it to kind of

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.190 
series and so I don't want it to kind of
have<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:03.640> same<00:04:04.000> repetitive<00:04:04.359> feeling<00:04:05.019> as

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
have that same repetitive feeling as

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.920 
have that same repetitive feeling as
much<00:04:05.799> as<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.340> don't<00:04:06.519> want<00:04:06.730> Alyssa<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.209> choose<00:04:07.569> I

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
much as I don't want Alyssa to choose I

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.020 
much as I don't want Alyssa to choose I
think<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.380> choice<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.829> necessary<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:09.940> I'm

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
think that a choice is necessary so I'm

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.970 
think that a choice is necessary so I'm
kind<00:04:10.269> of<00:04:10.329> torn<00:04:10.480> on<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.109> want<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.560> be<00:04:11.680> oh

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
kind of torn on that I want it to be oh

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.370 
kind of torn on that I want it to be oh
yeah<00:04:12.370> everyone<00:04:12.790> gets<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.000> happy<00:04:13.150> ending<00:04:13.299> but<00:04:14.260> at

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
yeah everyone gets a happy ending but at

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.460 
yeah everyone gets a happy ending but at
the<00:04:14.470> same<00:04:14.769> time<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.670> think<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:17.019> it's

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
the same time I think that it's

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.690 
the same time I think that it's
important<00:04:18.039> to<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.159> story<00:04:18.489> line<00:04:18.820> if<00:04:19.120> she<00:04:19.330> chew

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
important to the story line if she chew

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.700 
important to the story line if she chew
and<00:04:20.060> in<00:04:20.180> that<00:04:20.240> case<00:04:20.630> if<00:04:20.930> she<00:04:21.080> chooses<00:04:21.290> I<00:04:21.500> hope

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
and in that case if she chooses I hope

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.770 
and in that case if she chooses I hope
she<00:04:21.890> was<00:04:22.040> just<00:04:22.160> Morpheus<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.760> did<00:04:23.180> like<00:04:23.510> how<00:04:23.720> we

crown and the thing that surprised me is

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.030 
crown and the thing that surprised me is
I<00:05:07.820> did<00:05:08.000> not<00:05:08.150> suspect<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.840> second<00:05:09.200> sister<00:05:09.560> but

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
I did not suspect the second sister but

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.820 
I did not suspect the second sister but
what<00:05:10.220> I<00:05:10.250> was<00:05:10.460> kind<00:05:10.760> of<00:05:10.850> disappointed<00:05:10.910> at<00:05:11.720> is<00:05:11.990> so

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
what I was kind of disappointed at is so

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.700 
what I was kind of disappointed at is so
there<00:05:13.280> was<00:05:13.430> second<00:05:14.120> sister<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.870> then<00:05:15.110> read<00:05:15.380> of

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
there was second sister and then read of

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.920 
there was second sister and then read of
course<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:16.340> then<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.120> was<00:05:17.180> like<00:05:17.270> her<00:05:17.660> two

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
course and then it was like her two

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.080 
course and then it was like her two
different<00:05:18.410> sides<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:19.130> her<00:05:19.370> so<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:19.760> was<00:05:19.940> the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
different sides to her so that was the

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.810 
different sides to her so that was the
four<00:05:20.450> I<00:05:20.780> thought<00:05:21.440> for<00:05:21.620> sure<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.890> was<00:05:22.190> going<00:05:22.340> to
