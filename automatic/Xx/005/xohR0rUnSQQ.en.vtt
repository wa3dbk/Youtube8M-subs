of choices now

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.069 
of choices now
now<00:00:53.789> we're<00:00:53.940> gonna<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.210> focusing<00:00:54.690> mainly<00:00:54.870> on

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
now we're gonna be focusing mainly on

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
now we're gonna be focusing mainly on
the<00:00:55.320> v40<00:00:55.800> mini<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.789> impact<00:00:57.210> grenade

the v40 mini and the impact grenade

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
the v40 mini and the impact grenade
because<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.109> know<00:00:58.289> how<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> m67<00:00:59.160> works<00:00:59.579> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
because we all know how the m67 works of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
because we all know how the m67 works of
course<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.180> are<00:01:00.300> flashbangs<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> there

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
course there are flashbangs and there

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
course there are flashbangs and there
are<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.410> cinder<00:01:01.710> area<00:01:01.949> grenades<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> game

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
are in cinder area grenades in the game

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
are in cinder area grenades in the game
now<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.359> those<00:01:03.510> behave<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.110> differently

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
now but those behave a lot differently

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.320 
now but those behave a lot differently
than<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.040> typical<00:01:05.369> grenade<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.210> gonna

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
than the typical grenade so we're gonna

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
than the typical grenade so we're gonna
focus<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.840> these<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> bat

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
focus on these two but right off the bat

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.590 
focus on these two but right off the bat
let's<00:01:08.670> talk<00:01:08.909> about<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> main

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
let's talk about one of the main

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.880 
let's talk about one of the main
differences<00:01:09.869> between<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:10.650> three

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
differences between these three

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
differences between these three
different<00:01:11.040> types<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.520> grenades<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.360> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
different types of grenades and that's a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.690 
different types of grenades and that's a
distance<00:01:12.900> thrown<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.799> minis<00:01:14.130> biggest

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
distance thrown the minis biggest

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.340 
distance thrown the minis biggest
advantage<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.270> least<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.570> my<00:01:15.720> eyes<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.170> how

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
advantage at least in my eyes is how

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
advantage at least in my eyes is how
easily<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> throat<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.180> that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
easily it is the throat you can see that

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330 
easily it is the throat you can see that
it<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.320> long<00:01:19.500> distance<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it can go a really long distance at a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
it can go a really long distance at a
normal<00:01:20.700> arc<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.360> me<00:01:21.509> facing<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
normal arc that's just me facing the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.719 
normal arc that's just me facing the
wall<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.560> forward<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.580> that's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
wall there forward you can see that's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
wall there forward you can see that's
quite<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> Chuck<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.080> great<00:01:25.229> thing<00:01:25.380> about

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
quite a Chuck and the great thing about

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
quite a Chuck and the great thing about
the<00:01:25.650> minis<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.670> three<00:01:26.909> because

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the minis is you do get three because

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.700 
the minis is you do get three because
they<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.659> smaller<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.170> means<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
they are smaller that means they have a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
they are smaller that means they have a
smaller<00:01:29.040> blast<00:01:29.369> radius<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.909> I've<00:01:30.030> never

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
smaller blast radius but I've never

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.580 
smaller blast radius but I've never
really<00:01:30.420> had<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.689> whole<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> problems

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
really had a whole lot of problems

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.469 
really had a whole lot of problems
killing<00:01:32.070> people<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.460> them<00:01:32.579> because<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
killing people with them because like I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510 
killing people with them because like I
said<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.200> three<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.890> usually<00:01:35.009> chuck

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
said you get three you can usually chuck

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.399 
said you get three you can usually chuck
two<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.909> three<00:01:36.210> far<00:01:36.509> enough<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.290> get

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
two or three far enough that you can get

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.569 
two or three far enough that you can get
the<00:01:37.560> person<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> you're<00:01:38.070> needing<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> get

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the person that you're needing to get

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580 
the person that you're needing to get
and<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.600> clearly<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.350> from<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and you can clearly see just from the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
and you can clearly see just from the
blast<00:01:40.860> radius<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> still

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
blast radius you have on that it still

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.880 
blast radius you have on that it still
does<00:01:42.600> enough<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.200> you're<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.770> able

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
does enough that you're going to be able

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
does enough that you're going to be able
to<00:01:44.130> take<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.520> targets<00:01:44.970> that's<00:01:45.149> not<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to take out targets that's not really a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.980 
to take out targets that's not really a
problem

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
problem

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.230 
problem
the<00:01:46.470> rgo<00:01:46.799> grenades<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> other<00:01:47.640> hand<00:01:47.909> they

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the rgo grenades on the other hand they

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240 
the rgo grenades on the other hand they
are<00:01:48.270> hard<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> throw<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:49.770> facing

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
are hard to throw you can see I'm facing

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.190 
are hard to throw you can see I'm facing
the<00:01:50.340> same<00:01:50.549> direction<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> takes<00:01:51.840> much

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the same direction and it takes much

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.380 
the same direction and it takes much
more<00:01:52.530> arc<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.369> throw<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> go

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
more arc in your throw to get it to go

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.270 
more arc in your throw to get it to go
the<00:01:54.689> distance<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.259> wanted<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.799> because

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the distance you wanted to go because

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
the distance you wanted to go because
they<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:56.939> bit<00:01:57.180> fatter<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.930> do

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
they are a little bit fatter they do

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.749 
they are a little bit fatter they do
take<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.439> lot<00:01:58.560> more<00:01:58.890> effort<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.280> kind<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.610> bounce

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
take a lot more effort to kind of bounce

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.940 
take a lot more effort to kind of bounce
around<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.630> explode<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.409> impact<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
around and they do explode on impact and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.990 
around and they do explode on impact and
that<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> something<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.790> consider

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that is something you have to consider

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.310 
that is something you have to consider
when<00:02:03.450> choosing<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.960> these<00:02:04.079> grenades

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
when choosing one of these grenades

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.630 
when choosing one of these grenades
because<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.740> can't<00:02:04.979> bounce<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.430> around

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
because you can't bounce it around

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
because you can't bounce it around
corners<00:02:06.030> but<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
corners but that is one of the

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.479 
corners but that is one of the
advantages<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> now<00:02:08.009> let's<00:02:08.190> look<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
advantages to it now let's look at the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.969 
advantages to it now let's look at the
m67<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.569> your<00:02:09.690> normal<00:02:09.929> grenade<00:02:10.289> kind<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
m67 which is your normal grenade kind of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.559 
m67 which is your normal grenade kind of
in<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> middle<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.550> doesn't<00:02:11.580> really<00:02:12.180> throw<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
in the middle it doesn't really throw a

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.820 
in the middle it doesn't really throw a
whole<00:02:12.900> lot<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.140> distance

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
whole lot of distance

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
whole lot of distance
but<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.310> does<00:02:14.490> have<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> bigger<00:02:15.390> blast<00:02:15.810> radius

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
but it does have a bigger blast radius

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.600 
but it does have a bigger blast radius
you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.380> see<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> blast<00:02:16.830> radius<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.460> was

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you can see the blast radius on that was

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.520 
you can see the blast radius on that was
a<00:02:17.640> little<00:02:17.910> bit<00:02:18.120> larger<00:02:18.630> than<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
a little bit larger than that of the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.610 
a little bit larger than that of the
impact<00:02:20.070> grenade<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.970> mini<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.990> terms

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
impact grenade and the mini so in terms

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
impact grenade and the mini so in terms
of<00:02:22.740> your<00:02:22.890> distance<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.490> you<00:02:23.610> want<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.210> just

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
of your distance if you want to just

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.210 
of your distance if you want to just
chuck<00:02:24.750> nades<00:02:25.050> as<00:02:25.260> far<00:02:25.470> as<00:02:25.590> humanly<00:02:26.190> possible

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
chuck nades as far as humanly possible

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.640 
chuck nades as far as humanly possible
in<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.000> game<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.780> minis<00:02:28.110> are<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.440> ones

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
in this game the minis are the ones

in this game the minis are the ones
you're<00:02:28.800> gonna<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.460> for<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
you're gonna want to go for but if you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.970 
you're gonna want to go for but if you
want<00:02:30.450> something<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.870> has<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.170> more<00:02:31.590> tactical

want something that has a more tactical

approach the rgo grenades offer a really

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.310 
approach the rgo grenades offer a really
cool<00:02:35.370> advantage<00:02:35.820> now<00:02:36.450> me<00:02:36.630> personally<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.170> like

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
cool advantage now me personally I like

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.990 
cool advantage now me personally I like
the<00:02:37.680> bouncing<00:02:38.070> aids<00:02:38.220> off<00:02:38.430> things<00:02:38.730> that's

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the bouncing aids off things that's

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.430 
the bouncing aids off things that's
something<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.510> I've<00:02:39.600> got<00:02:39.840> really<00:02:40.110> good<00:02:40.260> at

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
something that I've got really good at

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440 
something that I've got really good at
from<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.160> playing<00:02:41.370> battlefield<00:02:41.850> 3<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> all

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
from just playing battlefield 3 and all

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.760 
from just playing battlefield 3 and all
the<00:02:42.480> first-person<00:02:42.930> shooters<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.680> be

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
the first-person shooters I like to be

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.860 
the first-person shooters I like to be
able<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.190> kind<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.550> hit<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.090> grenade<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.720> it

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
able to kind of hit a grenade have it

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.150 
able to kind of hit a grenade have it
bounce<00:02:46.020> off<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.350> wall<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.710> land<00:02:46.950> where<00:02:47.100> I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
bounce off the wall and land where I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.220 
bounce off the wall and land where I
wanted<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.580> go<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.360> find<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> rgo

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
wanted to go and I find that the rgo

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.930 
wanted to go and I find that the rgo
impact<00:02:49.740> grenades<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> really<00:02:50.460> can't<00:02:50.640> do<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
impact grenades you really can't do that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.970 
impact grenades you really can't do that
with<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.240> because<00:02:51.390> when<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.290> hits<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.560> wall<00:02:52.800> it

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
with it because when it hits a wall it

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.280 
with it because when it hits a wall it
blows<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.490> whereas<00:02:54.360> with<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> minis<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:54.990> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
blows up whereas with the minis in the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
blows up whereas with the minis in the
long<00:02:55.500> distance<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> lot<00:02:56.760> with<00:02:56.940> them

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
long distance you can do a lot with them

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.400 
long distance you can do a lot with them
I<00:02:57.240> mean<00:02:57.390> look<00:02:57.540> how<00:02:57.660> far<00:02:57.870> I'm<00:02:58.020> just<00:02:58.050> checking

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
I mean look how far I'm just checking

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.440 
I mean look how far I'm just checking
those<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.890> roofs<00:02:59.130> right<00:02:59.310> there<00:02:59.580> causing

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
those on the roofs right there causing

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.970 
those on the roofs right there causing
damage<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.840> them<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.230> know<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.650> splash

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
damage to them you know just the splash

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.890 
damage to them you know just the splash
damage<00:03:02.280> itself<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.940> enough<00:03:03.240> so<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.720> can

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
damage itself is enough so that I can

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.990 
damage itself is enough so that I can
finish<00:03:04.080> them<00:03:04.320> off<00:03:04.470> with<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.770> weapon<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.670> find

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
finish them off with my weapon so I find

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.210 
finish them off with my weapon so I find
the<00:03:06.120> minis<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.600> be<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.350> most<00:03:07.620> useful<00:03:07.860> new

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
the minis to be the most useful new

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.610 
the minis to be the most useful new

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.100 
campers and this clip right here is a
perfect<00:03:15.030> example<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.510> someone<00:03:15.720> who<00:03:15.930> got

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
perfect example of someone who got

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.290 
perfect example of someone who got
behind<00:03:16.350> cover<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.070> because<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.970> knew<00:03:18.090> he<00:03:18.180> was

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
behind cover and because I knew he was

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.000 
behind cover and because I knew he was
back<00:03:18.450> there<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> was<00:03:18.810> able<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.050> basically<00:03:19.440> smoke

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
back there I was able to basically smoke

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.370 
back there I was able to basically smoke
them<00:03:20.160> out<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.610> rgo<00:03:20.970> grenade<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:21.930> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
them out with the rgo grenade now the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.930 
them out with the rgo grenade now the
blast<00:03:22.620> radius<00:03:22.800> is<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.220> these<00:03:23.400> things<00:03:23.700> aren't

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
blast radius is on these things aren't

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.479 
blast radius is on these things aren't
that<00:03:24.209> great<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:25.260> are<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> little<00:03:25.800> bit<00:03:26.070> smaller

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
that great they are a little bit smaller

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.300 
that great they are a little bit smaller
than<00:03:26.760> your<00:03:26.910> typical<00:03:27.060> m67<00:03:28.019> grenade<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:29.100> you

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
to get a camper that's behind the wall

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.850 
to get a camper that's behind the wall
you're<00:03:39.810> gonna<00:03:39.900> want<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.170> go<00:03:40.290> with<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.500> rgo

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
you're gonna want to go with the rgo

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.590 
you're gonna want to go with the rgo
impact<00:03:41.310> because<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.790> basically<00:03:42.060> throw

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
impact because you can basically throw

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.960 
impact because you can basically throw
it<00:03:42.840> right<00:03:43.380> at<00:03:43.500> its<00:03:43.650> feet<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.340> gonna<00:03:44.580> explode

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
it right at its feet it's gonna explode

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.820 
it right at its feet it's gonna explode
and<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.330> blast<00:03:45.660> radius<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.200> big<00:03:46.410> enough<00:03:46.620> on

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
and that blast radius is big enough on

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.110 
and that blast radius is big enough on
those<00:03:46.950> things<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:47.459> not<00:03:47.580> really<00:03:47.910> going<00:03:48.030> to

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
those things that's not really going to

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.970 
those things that's not really going to
be<00:03:48.269> an<00:03:48.330> issue<00:03:48.450> we're<00:03:49.140> was<00:03:49.260> with<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.530> mini<00:03:49.769> I

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
be an issue we're was with the mini I

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.740 
be an issue we're was with the mini I
find<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.489> mini<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.820> great<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.360> hallways

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
find the mini is great for a hallways

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.210 
find the mini is great for a hallways
like<00:03:51.989> when<00:03:52.170> you're<00:03:52.290> down<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.470> these<00:03:52.709> tunnels

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
like when you're down in these tunnels

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.160 
like when you're down in these tunnels
you<00:03:53.700> can<00:03:53.850> usually<00:03:53.970> bank<00:03:54.360> one<00:03:54.660> or<00:03:54.780> two<00:03:54.900> around

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
you can usually bank one or two around

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.300 
you can usually bank one or two around
the<00:03:55.260> corner<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.860> don't<00:03:56.070> get<00:03:56.190> them

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the corner and if you don't get them

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
the corner and if you don't get them
with<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.550> first<00:03:56.760> one<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:56.970> can<00:03:57.090> usually

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
with the first one you can usually

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.060 
with the first one you can usually
finish<00:03:57.660> them<00:03:57.900> off<00:03:58.080> with<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.440> second<00:03:58.769> one<00:03:58.890> so

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
finish them off with the second one so

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.590 
finish them off with the second one so
minis<00:03:59.430> are<00:03:59.580> great<00:03:59.790> for<00:04:00.000> banking<00:04:00.300> around

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
minis are great for banking around

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.720 
minis are great for banking around
corners<00:04:01.019> it's<00:04:01.860> kind<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.130> like<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.310> little

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
corners it's kind of like a little

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.310 
corners it's kind of like a little
middle<00:04:03.000> ground<00:04:03.269> between<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.750> impact<00:04:04.140> grenade

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
middle ground between the impact grenade

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.350 
middle ground between the impact grenade
and<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:05.160> frag<00:04:05.400> round<00:04:05.670> but<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:05.970> thing<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.180> like

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
and the frag round but the thing I like

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.300 
and the frag round but the thing I like
most<00:04:06.510> about<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.930> mini<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.860> fact<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.160> you

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
most about the mini is the fact that you

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.949 
most about the mini is the fact that you
can<00:04:08.459> carry<00:04:08.700> three<00:04:09.090> that's<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.660> big<00:04:09.840> advantage

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
can carry three that's a big advantage

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.479 
can carry three that's a big advantage
in<00:04:10.350> my<00:04:10.470> eyes<00:04:10.620> because<00:04:10.950> even<00:04:11.190> if<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.340> don't

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
in my eyes because even if you don't

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.310 
in my eyes because even if you don't
kill<00:04:11.820> them<00:04:12.030> with<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> grenade<00:04:12.540> it'll<00:04:13.049> scare

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
kill them with the grenade it'll scare

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.960 
kill them with the grenade it'll scare
them<00:04:13.500> enough<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.860> get<00:04:14.070> out<00:04:14.250> from<00:04:14.519> behind<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
them enough to get out from behind the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.820 
them enough to get out from behind the
cover<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.720> where<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.019> can<00:04:16.200> finish<00:04:16.380> them<00:04:16.650> off

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
cover to where you can finish them off

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.830 
cover to where you can finish them off
with<00:04:16.859> your<00:04:17.160> main<00:04:17.370> gun<00:04:17.609> whereas<00:04:18.600> with<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
with your main gun whereas with the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.030 
with your main gun whereas with the
impact<00:04:19.140> grenade<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.560> got<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.769> be<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:19.859> little

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
impact grenade you got to be a little

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.199 
impact grenade you got to be a little
bit<00:04:20.190> more<00:04:20.280> tactical<00:04:20.519> about<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.060> because

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
bit more tactical about it because

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.029 
bit more tactical about it because
you've<00:04:21.330> only<00:04:21.479> got<00:04:21.720> about<00:04:21.870> 3/10<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.680> second

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
you've only got about 3/10 of a second

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.350 
you've only got about 3/10 of a second
after<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.430> hits<00:04:23.610> something<00:04:23.850> before<00:04:24.270> it

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
after it hits something before it

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.510 
after it hits something before it
detonates<00:04:24.560> granada'<00:04:25.560> does<00:04:25.740> have<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:25.979> larger

radius than the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.530 
radius than the
then<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.320> minis<00:04:28.650> but<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.400> isn't<00:04:29.760> as<00:04:29.880> big<00:04:30.300> as

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
then the minis but it isn't as big as

then the minis but it isn't as big as
the<00:04:30.780> m67<00:04:31.260> m67<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.490> greatest<00:04:32.970> blast<00:04:33.270> radius

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510
