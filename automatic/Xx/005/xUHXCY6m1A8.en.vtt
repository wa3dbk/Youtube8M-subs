two<00:01:06.990> weeks<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.410> thought<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.710> just

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
two weeks but I thought it was just

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.969 
two weeks but I thought it was just
because<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.160> a<00:01:08.220> different<00:01:08.520> ramp<00:01:08.700> why<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
because it was a different ramp why I

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.020 
because it was a different ramp why I
really<00:01:10.979> thought<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.280> had<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
really thought I had it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
really thought I had it
I<00:01:12.060> thought<00:01:12.510> mentally<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> took

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
I thought mentally it was good it took

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
I thought mentally it was good it took
off<00:01:13.650> felt<00:01:13.950> good<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.430> got<00:01:14.729> about<00:01:14.880> halfway<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.390> I

think<00:01:38.580> he<00:01:38.670> got<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> twist<00:01:39.390> he<00:01:39.690> wanted

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
think he got the twist he wanted

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.070 
think he got the twist he wanted
originally<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.550> ends<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
originally and then he ends up with the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.050 
originally and then he ends up with the
under<00:01:43.500> rotation<00:01:44.160> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> twist<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.940> not

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
under rotation of the twist and not

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.580 
under rotation of the twist and not
coming<00:01:45.300> around<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> flip<00:01:46.080> sequence<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
coming around in the flip sequence it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
coming around in the flip sequence it
almost<00:01:46.860> looked<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.160> he<00:01:47.520> missed<00:01:48.270> both<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
almost looked like he missed both the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
almost looked like he missed both the
flip<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.440> twist<00:01:49.850> definitely<00:01:50.850> didn't

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
flip and the twist definitely didn't

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.730 
flip and the twist definitely didn't
come<00:01:51.150> in<00:01:51.360> flat<00:01:51.630> enough<00:01:51.990> he<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
come in flat enough he was going like a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.070 
come in flat enough he was going like a
double<00:01:53.159> backflip<00:01:53.730> and<00:01:54.300> see<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.630> bike<00:01:54.840> isn't

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
double backflip and see the bike isn't

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.990 
double backflip and see the bike isn't
flat<00:01:55.560> enough<00:01:55.830> right<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
flat enough right here and this is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.280 
flat enough right here and this is
probably<00:01:57.180> where<00:01:57.360> he<00:01:57.480> started<00:01:57.750> thinking<00:01:57.930> all

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
probably where he started thinking all

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.899 
probably where he started thinking all
right<00:01:58.409> what's<00:01:58.620> gonna<00:01:58.800> happen<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.370> I<00:01:59.400> land<00:01:59.700> he

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
right what's gonna happen when I land he

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.060 
right what's gonna happen when I land he
came<00:02:00.150> in<00:02:00.300> flat<00:02:00.690> laying<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> bike<00:02:01.530> over<00:02:01.800> that's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
came in flat laying the bike over that's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920 
came in flat laying the bike over that's
what<00:02:02.190> happens<00:02:02.640> when<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.330> don't<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.720> flat

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
what happens when you don't get it flat

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.170 
what happens when you don't get it flat
enough<00:02:04.080> off<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> take-off<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.940> he<00:02:06.030> was

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
enough off the take-off I think he was

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
enough off the take-off I think he was
