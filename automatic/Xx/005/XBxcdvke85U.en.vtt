easy it makes me wonder why it isn't
more<00:02:15.740> well<00:02:15.950> known<00:02:16.190> because<00:02:16.460> if<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:16.940> did<00:02:17.210> there

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
more well known because if we did there

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.450 
more well known because if we did there
could<00:02:18.140> be<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.380> many<00:02:18.470> well<00:02:18.710> trained<00:02:19.010> dogs<00:02:19.250> out

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
could be so many well trained dogs out

could be so many well trained dogs out
there

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
to know a little bit more about what

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.009 
to know a little bit more about what
Milo<00:04:06.459> does<00:04:06.669> for<00:04:06.909> you<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:07.239> opens<00:04:07.599> up<00:04:07.810> a

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
Milo does for you and that opens up a

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.259 
Milo does for you and that opens up a

lot of doors for social opportunities

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.539 
lot of doors for social opportunities
and<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:11.049> think<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.409> was<00:04:11.590> probably<00:04:11.799> one<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.340> the

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
and I think that was probably one of the

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.210 
and I think that was probably one of the
biggest<00:04:12.939> things<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.049> really<00:04:14.739> noticed<00:04:15.159> how

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
biggest things that I really noticed how

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.949 
biggest things that I really noticed how
he's<00:04:15.430> improved<00:04:15.849> my<00:04:16.000> life<00:04:16.150> dramatically<00:04:16.630> from

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
he's improved my life dramatically from

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.890 
he's improved my life dramatically from
the<00:04:17.079> start

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
the start

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.320 
the start
right<00:04:19.900> before<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:21.190> guess<00:04:21.699> I<00:04:21.820> didn't<00:04:22.060> realize

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
right before I guess I didn't realize

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.820 
right before I guess I didn't realize
how<00:04:22.690> many<00:04:22.870> times<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.259> would<00:04:23.320> drop<00:04:23.590> something

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
how many times I would drop something

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.460 
how many times I would drop something
onto<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.280> floor<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.759> wait<00:04:24.940> for<00:04:25.180> somebody<00:04:25.470> to

onto the floor and wait for somebody to
walk<00:04:26.620> by<00:04:26.919> where<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.310> could<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.610> them<00:04:27.699> come
