00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.279
 we will start looking back on Sunday half past 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 five with rankings and results in the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.970
 nec kom psv program booklet 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.929

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.610
 ranking list 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.590
 but then we look at the results 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.480
 psv really has a view of the second 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.330
 position in the competition 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.270
 well i know i do n't know that ajax 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.930
 lost and also twente but the dungeon 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.960
 first 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.869
 just money with honey and ajax 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.880
 then another becomes and I don't know 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.420
 for the end city inside rest me 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 when do you use what, yes 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 that always helps and during the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.969
 competition have been the head is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.020
 looked that Ajax had lost and tents 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.059
 equal it like 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.450
 and what does that not do with me playing it 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.399
 motivates them extra motivates you 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.620
 it lasted until the 85th 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.660
 minute before psv duel open wide with 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.610
 a goal from zakaria labyad 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.489
 george no good assumption almost matas 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.480
 maybe stroo man yet stroo man 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.230
 can go to labyad 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 labyad for a european lot of labyad yes 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.510
 Leroy George 's mistake and they become 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.250
 'm crazy nec what how is this possible 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.479
 and less than two minutes later 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.479
 tim matavz the duel final 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.799
 mertens hoop top mattress is never there either 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.360
 I still so quickly got the ball 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.330
 but no, I have to pay again 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.130
 with nuytinck and curl tybalt in that is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.790
 200 bag 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.369
 what is psv effective in the final phase what 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.229
 she said deadly and so psv wins the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.490
 away match against nec 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.960
 but the people from Eindhoven have the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.880
 match it on the rest of the book 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.190
 clearly still in the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.780
 legs 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.400

 just a week's competition 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.340
 yes it is going to hurt them 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.680
 things are often in the head 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.270

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.220
 team anyway 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.360
 number that you have through it anyway 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.550

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.640

 this I saw max 2 steps and goes the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.040
 went wrong in the right direction because this switch 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.060
 say it and start a lesson that you like 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.400
 base 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.990
 what do you expect from the year here yes 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.670
 just as many as possible do not play there 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.760
 as much as possible my coach pick that up 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.790
 is only through 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.380

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.730
 found you as an experienced player 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.180
 return to psv 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:15.240
 I hope so port 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.800
 no offside but the ball is hard for 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.460
 move is good george 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.660

 for jeremain lens well it was every 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.100
 I think it is nice to fall in 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.500
 if you market minutes and play good 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.540
