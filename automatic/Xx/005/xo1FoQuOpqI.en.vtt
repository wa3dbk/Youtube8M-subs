pretty creative red overbust it's a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.680 
pretty creative red overbust it's a
halter<00:00:43.469> top<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> things<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
halter top so it's got the things on the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
halter top so it's got the things on the
front<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> laces<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> back<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
front and the laces in the back this is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
front and the laces in the back this is
a<00:00:48.450> steel<00:00:48.809> boned<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.010> lot<00:00:50.160> harder<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
a steel boned so it's a lot harder to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.950 
a steel boned so it's a lot harder to
put<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> lot<00:00:52.410> firmer<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> we'll

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
put on and it's a lot firmer so we'll

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.650 
put on and it's a lot firmer so we'll
start<00:00:55.230> where<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.440> always<00:00:55.649> start<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:57.480> one

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
start where we always start this one

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.560 
start where we always start this one
also<00:00:57.809> has<00:00:58.079> something<00:00:58.289> called<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.570> covering

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
also has something called a a covering

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
also has something called a a covering
flap<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:01.109> something<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.920> along

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
flap or something I like that along

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.490 
flap or something I like that along
those<00:01:02.340> lines<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.750> covers<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.170> laces

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
those lines and it just covers the laces

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
those lines and it just covers the laces

so when you pull it closed you don't see

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.149 
so when you pull it closed you don't see

looks<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.280> when<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.549> not<00:02:18.610> done<00:02:18.970> see<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
looks like when it's not done see the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.660 
looks like when it's not done see the
pretty<00:02:20.049> silk<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.530> everything<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.519> what

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
pretty silk and everything this is what

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.110 
pretty silk and everything this is what
it<00:02:21.760> looks<00:02:21.910> like

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
it looks like

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.759 
it looks like
in<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> back<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.599> lot<00:02:25.780> easier<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.500> do<00:02:26.650> this

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
in the back it's a lot easier to do this

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:27.990 
in the back it's a lot easier to do this
when<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.099> have<00:02:27.129> somebody<00:02:27.370> doing<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.790> back

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
when you have somebody doing the back

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.280 
when you have somebody doing the back
with<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.959> flip<00:02:29.319> flap<00:02:29.860> because<00:02:31.140> somebody<00:02:32.140> can

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
with the flip flap because somebody can

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.280 
with the flip flap because somebody can
see<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.620> better<00:02:32.829> than<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.129> can<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.200> there<00:02:35.200> we

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
see it better than you can so there we

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.490 
see it better than you can so there we
go

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
go

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.250 
go
and<00:02:36.069> then<00:02:36.640> these<00:02:36.970> ones<00:02:37.180> start<00:02:37.599> lower<00:02:37.810> than<00:02:38.110> my

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and then these ones start lower than my

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.449 
and then these ones start lower than my
under<00:02:38.500> bust<00:02:38.940> they<00:02:39.940> start<00:02:40.209> down<00:02:40.360> here<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.220> then

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
under bust they start down here and then

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.330 
under bust they start down here and then
you<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.610> start<00:02:42.910> pulling<00:02:43.120> now<00:02:44.049> on<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:45.069> side

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
you just start pulling now on this side

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.339 
you just start pulling now on this side
I<00:02:45.579> can't<00:02:45.940> feel<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> laces<00:02:46.629> however<00:02:47.109> on<00:02:47.230> this

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
I can't feel the laces however on this

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.430 
I can't feel the laces however on this
side<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.769> feel<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.010> laces<00:02:48.310> tightening<00:02:49.440> so

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
side I can feel the laces tightening so

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.720 
side I can feel the laces tightening so
I<00:02:50.470> go<00:02:50.620> ahead<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.829> I<00:02:50.950> start<00:02:51.190> tightening<00:02:51.489> it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
I go ahead and I start tightening it

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.809 
I go ahead and I start tightening it
trying<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.720> keep<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.769> flap<00:02:54.040> as<00:02:54.250> far<00:02:54.519> over<00:02:54.549> as

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
trying to keep the flap as far over as

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.410 
trying to keep the flap as far over as
possible<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:55.959> far<00:02:56.230> cop<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.590> possible

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.330 

and<00:03:01.420> like<00:03:02.139> I<00:03:02.170> said<00:03:02.470> before<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:02.950> just<00:03:03.160> like<00:03:03.310> a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and like I said before it's just like a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:16.140 
and like I said before it's just like a
shoe<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:06.099> just<00:03:14.190> see<00:03:15.190> how<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.669> starting

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
shoe and you just see how it's starting

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.360 
shoe and you just see how it's starting
to<00:03:16.359> come<00:03:16.510> together<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.799> can't<00:03:18.069> see<00:03:18.250> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
to come together and you can't see the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.920 
to come together and you can't see the
gap<00:03:18.579> or<00:03:18.819> my<00:03:18.940> skin<00:03:19.269> is

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.449 

now<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:27.989> bottom<00:03:28.410> doesn't<00:03:28.770> go<00:03:28.860> as<00:03:29.010> far<00:03:29.040> as<00:03:29.370> I

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
now the bottom doesn't go as far as I

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.640 
now the bottom doesn't go as far as I
was<00:03:29.610> like<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:30.780> that

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.190 

my<00:03:34.650> hips<00:03:34.950> are<00:03:35.130> bigger<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.900> kind<00:03:37.140> of

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
my hips are bigger so it's kind of

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:47.330 
my hips are bigger so it's kind of
painful<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.770> keep<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.130> too<00:03:38.280> tight<00:03:45.890> and<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.950> can

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
painful to keep it too tight and you can

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.920 
painful to keep it too tight and you can
see<00:03:47.489> its<00:03:47.610> bones<00:03:47.849> all<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.269> way<00:03:48.360> together<00:03:48.660> now

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
see its bones all the way together now

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.130 
see its bones all the way together now
this<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.349> a<00:03:49.410> smaller<00:03:49.709> size<00:03:49.800> as<00:03:50.280> well<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.930> one

is only at 30 and it's a different maker

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.449 
is only at 30 and it's a different maker
whereas<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.269> 30<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:57.959> maker<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.620> 24<00:03:59.190> or

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
to happen you're putting too much strain

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.490 
to happen you're putting too much strain
on<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.799> corset<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.110> wait<00:04:13.230> for<00:04:13.410> your

leave<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.090> how<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.560> so<00:04:19.560> I've<00:04:19.680> got<00:04:19.919> it

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
leave it how it is so I've got it

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.830

fastened<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.639> can<00:04:20.880> almost<00:04:21.120> get<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.450> far<00:04:21.750> enough

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
fastened I can almost get it far enough

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.780 
fastened I can almost get it far enough
but<00:04:22.229> usually<00:04:22.680> when<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.250> have<00:04:23.340> somebody<00:04:23.520> else

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
doing it it's a lot easier but there you

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.090 
doing it it's a lot easier but there you
go<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.970> can<00:04:27.120> see<00:04:27.330> what<00:04:27.419> it<00:04:27.510> looks<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:27.720> now

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
go you can see what it looks like now

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.060 
go you can see what it looks like now
there's<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.220> lot<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.700> busts<00:04:30.030> it's<00:04:30.780> very<00:04:31.070> very

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
there's a lot of busts it's very very

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.659 
there's a lot of busts it's very very
very<00:04:32.370> busty<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:34.380> halter<00:04:34.950> top<00:04:35.160> makes<00:04:35.430> it

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
very busty and the halter top makes it

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.110 
very busty and the halter top makes it
even<00:04:36.330> more<00:04:36.510> framing<00:04:37.260> here<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:38.100> there's<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.000> lot

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
even more framing here and there's a lot

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.450 
even more framing here and there's a lot
more<00:04:39.240> shape<00:04:39.600> because<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.560> steel<00:04:40.950> so<00:04:41.250> it's<00:04:41.400> a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
more shape because it is steel so it's a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.450 
more shape because it is steel so it's a
lot<00:04:41.610> harder<00:04:41.850> here<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:42.539> here<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.220> around<00:04:44.220> here

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
lot harder here in here and around here

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.330 
lot harder here in here and around here
so<00:04:45.620> that's<00:04:46.620> what<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.830> looks<00:04:46.950> like<00:04:47.039> when<00:04:47.220> it's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
so that's what it looks like when it's

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.670 
so that's what it looks like when it's
on<00:04:49.220> see<00:04:50.220> and<00:04:50.789> you<00:04:51.570> can<00:04:51.720> see<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:51.960> like<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.410> wear<00:04:52.650> a

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
skirt with this one because it gets a

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.290
