00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.689
 hello for today mileage 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.289
 11,000 nine hundred ninety six 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:29.619
 kilometers a small video shot you 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:36.860
 show natural fuel consumption of ai-95 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:42.100
 on cars geely sc7 for quality 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:46.280
 shoot at times sorry right away 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.700
 because take and manage 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.260
 car is a bit complicated 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 we today 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.980
 Mogilev highway around Mogilev she 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.980
 passes bypass 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.230
 we have a lot of cars here track Colima 2 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.240
 lane therefore 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.240
 let's go on a quiet sadness 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.049
 and when transferring 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 it's not very easy to achieve a big expense 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.710
 enough to imagine that between your 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.540
 foot and gas pedal or pedal 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.920
 accelerator is an egg and if still 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.360
 imagine what is your reason 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.110
 your own fuel consumption 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.560
 will only please 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.970
 Here we have the fifth gear 100 kilometers 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.730
 at one o'clock 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.659
 consumption 5 7 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.880
 5 8 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.880
 71 hour small gorochka let's go 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.479
 fifth gear with us 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.950
 try to accelerate here to 120 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.520
 if she doesnâ€™t hurt me that truck 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.420
 when overclocking 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.459
 up to 120 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.459
 pretty fast mashenka accelerates 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.350
 20 set cruising speed 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.719
 cruising speed 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.719
 a little less than 120 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.660
 the crust will be 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.400
 it's already an hour 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.580
 release the pedal q 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.990
 multiply the same 57 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.000
 7 and 7 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.190
 average consumption somewhere well 6 liters 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.910
 it's safe to say this I'm going 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.590
 still with dipped headlights 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.560
 so we have 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.210
 the week left before September 1st is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.070
 recommendation to and but 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.760
 fuck some leaves should be 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.799
 to slow down 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.170
 You see, he only needed 5 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.170
 meters drive and turn left so 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.970
 60 60 to 80 overclocking 4 gears 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.620
 but then we put the time code will be visible 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.620
 how long did it take 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.549
 often in some kind of lawn 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.549
 fire and lawn 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.120
 not even gazonchik and tonearm snare 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.400
 Accelerate to hundred fifth gear 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.250
 now from hundreds to 120 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.019
 pedal well, not to the floor let's say so somewhere 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.049
 to about half of the power reserve 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.879
 the pedals still have one of the liters on 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.560
 big overclocking on fifth gear you 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.560
 120 kW hour we reached 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.480
 or further just support speed 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.060
 you can even drive economically on a BMW x5 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.390
 on which recently a 400 slide roll 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.689
 kilometers average consumption was 7 of 7 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.700
 three-liter diesel engine therefore 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.700
 good luck on the road save fuel
