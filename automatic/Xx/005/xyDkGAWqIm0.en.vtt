that<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> characters<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that all of the characters are going to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.670 
that all of the characters are going to
pair<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> next<00:00:35.969> episode<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:37.110> who's

thought<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.469> would<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.680> cool<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> Ruby<00:00:41.309> paired

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
thought it would be cool it Ruby paired

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010 
thought it would be cool it Ruby paired
up<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.760> Blake<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.809> noticed

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
up with Blake but then I noticed

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.959 
up with Blake but then I noticed
something<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> look<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.700> scene

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
something take a look at this scene

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660 
something take a look at this scene
Blake's<00:00:45.960> nowhere<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.739> seen<00:00:46.770> did<00:00:47.489> she

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
Blake's nowhere to be seen did she

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150 
Blake's nowhere to be seen did she
somehow<00:00:47.879> miss<00:00:48.420> initiation<00:00:49.110> forgetting<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
somehow miss initiation forgetting to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
somehow miss initiation forgetting to
list<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> main<00:00:51.180> characters<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> bit

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
list one of the main characters is a bit

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.340 
list one of the main characters is a bit
extreme<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> simple<00:00:53.820> oversight

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
extreme just to be a simple oversight

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.689 
extreme just to be a simple oversight
especially<00:00:55.350> because<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.980> her<00:00:56.250> image<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
especially because it's her image it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.060 
especially because it's her image it
appears<00:00:57.000> during<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> end<00:00:57.629> credits<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> let's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
appears during the end credits so let's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790 
appears during the end credits so let's
say<00:00:59.250> instead<00:00:59.460> Ruby<00:01:00.120> pairs<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.780> Weiss<00:01:01.109> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
say instead Ruby pairs with Weiss you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.380 
say instead Ruby pairs with Weiss you
know<00:01:01.920> plenty<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.489> potential<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:03.090> comic

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
