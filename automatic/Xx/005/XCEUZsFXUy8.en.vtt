00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.449
 Bolivian people of Israel Fornax and today once again a game is missing 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.329
 by herself 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.829
 and and and and and 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.689
 Look here 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.489
 I show again with aggressive 40 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.969
 and suddenly the match becomes Angel and it's decided Dirk Mesch 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.840
 what is today but not 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.090
 you certainly know 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.380
 if you are good already out of the title race 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.860
 filter 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.130
 Dr 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.320
 today we want to liven you up on the subject of anticipation it is not 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.789
 Gasoline always i find 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.410
 around 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.550
 but I just wanted to say it appealing and today what I say 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.300
 think of it and Prof 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.640
 that's the way it is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.480
 I have now I want a luminous flux of three years I am there 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 I'm certainly not the only one and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.790
 RST but it bothers me quite honestly that the player wants to be with 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.380
 Asbeck Pope annoys me the Black Ops is Katinka Games I'm the course 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.620
 I think Makarov is better than the end of 2002 are empty 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.380
 let's just say it's fun but me too 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.189
 I just want to play live so high tech i - so stay tuned 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.460
 and 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.420
 I was always so stupid as a kid, but I have such expectation of a message 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.940
 I have 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.960
 i have i had feature film which is multi-layered i know now 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.510
 that is welcome necessarily casually he will be shopping either way 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.820
 when pre-order 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.719
 but not the Swiss 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.710
 not much better with a little bit less 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.200
 No other than Blatter Stalingrad is offensive 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.289
 So it's always stay explored today as you expect so many breaks 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.979
 Gameplay was not great but you expected more and then 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.729
 then you get annoyed and that's just as much a problem with the whole thing 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.249
 I personally thought I hope that the game 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.589
 So a mix will excerpt Siro with 2 it should also be logical 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:14.699
 it will 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:18.099
 Serey the foul I also hope that you realize that you have been 1 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.360
 Mertens 1 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.689
 become similar 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.919
 and 10 again the majorities 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.139
 where is our rinsed here for example at 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:32.079
 because I should leave you or 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.659
 he meant that I will and can go on 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.389
 the network remain smaller art the Bundeswehr everything become more modern 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.869
 a modern warfare 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.229
 beautiful 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.969
 Experts speak 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.889
 Stanisic 1 percent the Greens and that's what I expect me too 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.869
 when does our wakes, I have no special wishes 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.329
 except the hacker 47 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.519
 interested in the Villinger I still know how to put them - and be there 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.829
 and otherwise looked at the concerns and here and there though 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.709
 I do not really care about films or other free ones 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.689
 Day 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.689
 i feel i mean the weapons i mean if anyone 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.459
 For one thing, our overburdened game without him does not overwhelm that 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.479
 is not our player does not bring home 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.919
 and percent 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.939
 There you lie down again and again 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:22.839
 but 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.899
 As I said you can not change it is in the man makes a week 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:28.309
 to be used over 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:30.899
 and finally stronger than the others and 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.899
 i have to do what he wants out of his for the beginner and 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.939
 the first problems that will then trigger for the turn of the century slider 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.189
 I shall not be able to take two weeks to be elected in the middle of the year 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.359
 Question it is so bad sheer pool hall can be 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.640
 It is not always such a thing but what I am looking forward to 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.010
 In the beginning I have what it's like 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.460
 again guided in both directions Levels interesting built emphasizes it 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.700
 is not allowed to transfer a playground that would be like anywhere on the grounds 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.650
 one supposed the crisis was not overlooked or that was 5000 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.030
 thus ending their relative calm 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.560
 and that although it means but of course he is only one in four 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.489
 Hiding the title fights sees are we want to want to change or the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.230
 explore the whole country but weight the next example that one 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.800
 Already better I lament a new hype Alpe d'Huez more info below and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.860
 it's just fun so it was interest zolt I'm there too 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.370
 already very excited so very honest 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.979
 and 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.469
 What else can you do for a living? 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.899
 Century virtually impossible and I can not do it anymore 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:44.620
 would have to wait 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.860
 for a short time the actual percent will be through them 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.830
 because with two tips so not at all 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.610
 As I said, I'm the boss that's always playing 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.080
 that's the way it was 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.189
 what my opinion and 7 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:06.129
 otherwise the end is already 4 millions I hope you liked it 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.599
 the politics you can write what you expect from mp3 even if you already 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.460
 probably wrote more often 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.270
 No, I thought Hitler too, the three partners are simply overrules 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.550
 If you write there I hope I fell behind what happened here today 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.070
 but not just ineffective with the car Gelabert round not 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.620
 released 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.639
 like this 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.820
 exactly three people 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.460
 at first hurt the painter
