I<00:00:20.150> really<00:00:21.150> feel<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.470> that<00:00:22.470> could<00:00:22.830> complicate

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I really feel like that could complicate

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.490 
I really feel like that could complicate
things<00:00:23.850> within<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> game<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.810> think<00:00:25.230> iron

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
things within the game I think iron

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.720 
things within the game I think iron
banner<00:00:25.710> gets<00:00:25.980> away<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
banner gets away with it because the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.429 
banner gets away with it because the
guns<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:26.970> expensive<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.689> only<00:00:28.080> comes<00:00:28.260> around

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
guns are expensive it only comes around

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019 
guns are expensive it only comes around
once<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.859> month<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:29.670> what<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.880> can

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
once a month you got to get what you can

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.640 
once a month you got to get what you can
out<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> there's<00:00:30.960> only<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.199> couple<00:00:31.230> guns

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
out of it and there's only a couple guns

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.510 
out of it and there's only a couple guns
it's<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.160> pick<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.460> choose

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it's not like you can pick and choose

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.280 
it's not like you can pick and choose
and<00:00:32.820> straight<00:00:33.360> buy<00:00:33.510> them<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> vendor<00:00:34.260> or

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

anything like that and I've come up with

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.139 
anything like that and I've come up with
a<00:00:36.090> complex<00:00:36.800> theory<00:00:37.800> sort<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.250> idea<00:00:38.670> towards

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
a complex theory sort of idea towards

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.410 
a complex theory sort of idea towards
this<00:00:39.930> area<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.399> moment<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.059> anyone

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this area because the moment that anyone

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.450 
this area because the moment that anyone
can<00:00:42.570> buy<00:00:42.809> weapons<00:00:43.379> from<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> vendor<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> roll

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
can buy weapons from the vendor and roll

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.979 
can buy weapons from the vendor and roll
them<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:44.730> perfect<00:00:44.940> weapons<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> moment

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
them into perfect weapons or the moment

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.690 
them into perfect weapons or the moment
that<00:00:46.050> anyone<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:47.070> something<00:00:47.370> from<00:00:47.460> dead

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that anyone can get something from dead

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.250 
that anyone can get something from dead
orbit<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.120> something<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.870> then

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
orbit or something like that and then

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.479 
orbit or something like that and then
have<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> chance<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> roll<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> into<00:00:50.280> whatever

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
have the chance to roll it into whatever

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.650 
have the chance to roll it into whatever
they<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:50.969> things<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.390> gonna<00:00:51.480> get

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
they want things are gonna get

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.000 
they want things are gonna get
complicated<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.469> everything<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.890> gonna

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
complicated because everything is gonna

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.939 
complicated because everything is gonna
be<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.340> stale<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.469> there's<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.739> less

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
be so stale and there's gonna be less

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.709 
be so stale and there's gonna be less
reason<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> grind<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.000> anything<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:57.390> once<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719

is nothing because you are just happy
and<00:01:12.000> satisfied<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.880> my

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and satisfied with what you have so my

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910 
and satisfied with what you have so my
theory<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.840> how<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
theory with this and how I think you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
theory with this and how I think you
should<00:01:17.220> look<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.820> fix<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.180> would

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
should look at this and fix this would

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260 
should look at this and fix this would
be<00:01:19.040> make<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> extremely<00:01:20.549> expensive<00:01:21.000> as

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
be make it extremely expensive as

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
be make it extremely expensive as
something<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> happen<00:01:22.380> there

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
something like this for the happen there

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960 
something like this for the happen there
has<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> be<00:01:22.920> things<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.520> would<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
has to be things that you would do to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
has to be things that you would do to
