the<00:01:05.030> playoffs<00:01:05.680> arizona<00:01:06.680> didn't<00:01:07.189> i<00:01:07.399> think<00:01:08.000> the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the playoffs arizona didn't i think the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.620 
the playoffs arizona didn't i think the
better<00:01:08.720> team<00:01:09.110> missed<00:01:09.890> out<00:01:10.390> arizona<00:01:11.390> at<00:01:11.540> the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
better team missed out arizona at the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.359 
better team missed out arizona at the
end<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.930> season<00:01:12.110> i<00:01:12.470> think<00:01:12.890> was<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.070> much

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
end of the season i think was a much

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.730 
end of the season i think was a much
better<00:01:13.610> team<00:01:13.909> than<00:01:14.119> san<00:01:14.720> diego<00:01:15.200> obviously

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
better team than san diego obviously

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.929 
better team than san diego obviously
different<00:01:16.280> conferences<00:01:17.149> but<00:01:17.750> i<00:01:17.810> think<00:01:18.170> that

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
different conferences but i think that

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.550 
different conferences but i think that
arizona<00:01:19.939> was<00:01:20.090> one<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.359> the<00:01:20.420> best<00:01:20.569> teams<00:01:20.929> not<00:01:21.350> to

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
arizona was one of the best teams not to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.739 
arizona was one of the best teams not to
make<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.889> playoffs<00:01:22.340> in<00:01:22.520> recent<00:01:22.969> years<00:01:22.999> they

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
make the playoffs in recent years they

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.480 
make the playoffs in recent years they
played<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.409> well<00:01:24.439> down<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:25.009> stretch<00:01:25.039> because

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
played so well down the stretch because

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.789 
played so well down the stretch because
i'm<00:01:25.639> sorry<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.270> many<00:01:26.600> expect<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.109> regression

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
i'm sorry and many expect the regression

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.410 
i'm sorry and many expect the regression
from<00:01:28.249> Arizona<00:01:28.700> because<00:01:28.819> no<00:01:29.090> one<00:01:29.210> saw<00:01:29.389> it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
from Arizona because no one saw it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.929 
from Arizona because no one saw it
coming<00:01:29.539> last<00:01:30.139> year<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:31.159> this<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.369> franchise

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
coming last year so is this a franchise

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.770 
coming last year so is this a franchise
on<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.299> rise<00:01:32.539> or<00:01:32.959> was<00:01:33.469> that<00:01:33.499> just<00:01:33.649> a<00:01:33.979> fluke

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
on the rise or was that just a fluke

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.629 
on the rise or was that just a fluke
defensively<00:01:35.780> they<00:01:35.990> were<00:01:36.049> great<00:01:36.499> the<00:01:37.459> only

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
defensively they were great the only

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.699 
defensively they were great the only
problem<00:01:37.909> with<00:01:38.179> that<00:01:38.209> is<00:01:38.539> this<00:01:38.869> year<00:01:39.229> they<00:01:39.439> lost

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
problem with that is this year they lost

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:42.969 
problem with that is this year they lost
Dansby<00:01:40.310> he's<00:01:40.880> gone<00:01:41.179> washington<00:01:42.170> docket<00:01:42.649> both

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
Dansby he's gone washington docket both

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.980 
Dansby he's gone washington docket both
her<00:01:43.249> honey<00:01:43.729> badger<00:01:44.029> not<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.569> hundred<00:01:44.840> percent

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
her honey badger not a hundred percent

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.859 
her honey badger not a hundred percent
so<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.219> defense<00:01:46.609> is<00:01:46.759> ailing<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.420> little

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
so that the defense is ailing a little

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.269 
so that the defense is ailing a little
bit<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.109> may<00:01:48.200> not<00:01:48.350> be<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.619> same<00:01:48.799> Arizona

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:49.279 
bit it may not be the same Arizona

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:52.889 
bit it may not be the same Arizona
defense<00:01:49.639> that<00:01:49.969> we<00:01:50.119> saw<00:01:50.359> late<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.259> last<00:01:51.499> season

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
defense that we saw late and last season

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.419 
defense that we saw late and last season

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
had to lose because i think the Super

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.090 
had to lose because i think the Super
Bowl<00:04:23.120> was<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.600> NFC<00:04:24.050> Championship<00:04:24.860> more<00:04:25.010> or

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
Bowl was the NFC Championship more or

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.430 
Bowl was the NFC Championship more or
less<00:04:25.280> more<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.300> than<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.600> Super<00:04:26.960> Bowl<00:04:27.140> itself

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
less more so than the Super Bowl itself

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.000 
less more so than the Super Bowl itself

builds in a natural favoritism to the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.310 
builds in a natural favoritism to the
over<00:05:38.450> a<00:05:38.480> little<00:05:38.690> but<00:05:38.900> you're<00:05:39.020> going<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:39.200> pay<00:05:39.290> a

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
over a little but you're going to pay a

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.220 
over a little but you're going to pay a
price<00:05:39.620> for<00:05:39.650> it<00:05:40.040> and<00:05:40.160> this<00:05:41.000> number<00:05:41.240> I<00:05:41.600> thinks

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
price for it and this number I thinks

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.900 
price for it and this number I thinks
too<00:05:42.410> high<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.620> think<00:05:43.130> that<00:05:43.280> these<00:05:43.400> two<00:05:43.640> teams

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
too high I think that these two teams

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.330 
too high I think that these two teams
are<00:05:44.120> more<00:05:44.570> ball<00:05:44.870> control<00:05:45.350> yes<00:05:45.890> they<00:05:46.070> score

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
are more ball control yes they score

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.640 
are more ball control yes they score
points<00:05:46.580> but<00:05:46.820> they<00:05:46.940> work<00:05:47.300> at<00:05:47.570> it<00:05:47.750> doing<00:05:48.169> it<00:05:48.320> and

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
points but they work at it doing it and

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.500 
points but they work at it doing it and
as<00:05:48.860> I<00:05:48.950> said<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:49.280> Arizona<00:05:49.700> defense<00:05:49.970> much

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
as I said the Arizona defense much

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.450 
as I said the Arizona defense much
