the<00:03:56.590> edges<00:03:56.890> of<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.160> tear<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.910> that's<00:03:58.600> why<00:03:58.750> I'm

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
the edges of the tear so that's why I'm

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.220 
the edges of the tear so that's why I'm
not<00:03:59.020> showing<00:03:59.290> it<00:04:00.390> it's<00:04:01.390> basically<00:04:01.690> it's<00:04:02.020> good

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
not showing it it's basically it's good

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.270

to<00:04:02.350> go<00:04:02.470> in<00:04:02.650> small<00:04:03.130> little<00:04:03.310> sections<00:04:03.820> at<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.060> time

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
to go in small little sections at a time

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.450 
to go in small little sections at a time
so<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.840> makes<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:08.020> easier<00:04:08.350> as<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:08.590> move

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460

peel<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:16.900> back<00:04:20.040> why<00:04:21.040> it's<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:22.090> beginning<00:04:22.680> you

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
peel it back why it's the beginning you

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.880
