the weight down low and centralizing the
frame<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.810> see<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> layout

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
frame you can see the with the layout

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
frame you can see the with the layout
the<00:00:32.790> rear<00:00:33.000> end<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.540> pushed<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.380> low<00:00:34.440> as

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the rear end is is pushed down as low as

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.020 
the rear end is is pushed down as low as
possible<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.070> shocks<00:00:35.309> push<00:00:35.579> down<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:35.820> low<00:00:35.880> as

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
possible the shocks push down as low as

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.760 
possible the shocks push down as low as
possible<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.899> very<00:00:36.960> important<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> bike

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
possible it's very important the bike

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.970 
possible it's very important the bike
turns<00:00:38.430> well<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:40.140> bikes<00:00:40.320> very<00:00:40.590> balanced

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
turns well and the bikes very balanced

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.830 
turns well and the bikes very balanced
so<00:00:41.070> again<00:00:41.280> lots<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.000> effort<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.450> pushing<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
so again lots of effort and pushing the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.330 
so again lots of effort and pushing the
weight<00:00:42.960> down<00:00:43.170> low<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> keeping<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
weight down low and keeping it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.000 
weight down low and keeping it
centralized<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> frame<00:00:46.010> another

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
centralized in the in the frame another

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
centralized in the in the frame another
important<00:00:47.489> detail<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.989> new

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
important detail this of the the new

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.920 
important detail this of the the new
bike<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.829> longer<00:00:50.489> stroke<00:00:50.789> shock<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
bike was a longer stroke shock and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
bike was a longer stroke shock and
longer<00:00:52.260> eye-to-eye<00:00:52.590> shocks<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.219> goes<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
longer eye-to-eye shocks so it goes to a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.490 
longer eye-to-eye shocks so it goes to a
three<00:00:53.789> inch<00:00:53.940> stroke<00:00:54.180> shock<00:00:54.449> still<00:00:55.079> say<00:00:55.289> made

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
three inch stroke shock still say made

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.619 
three inch stroke shock still say made
into<00:00:55.770> travel<00:00:56.160> front<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.610> rear<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
into travel front and rear but with a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.349 
into travel front and rear but with a
longer<00:00:57.870> stroke<00:00:58.379> three<00:00:59.039> inch<00:00:59.160> shock<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.059> idea

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
longer stroke three inch shock the idea

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.930 
longer stroke three inch shock the idea
there<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:02.309> more<00:01:02.430> options<00:01:02.850> for

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
there is a little more options for

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.570 
there is a little more options for
tuning<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.750> tweaking<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.430> ride

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
tuning and tweaking the the ride

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.890 
tuning and tweaking the the ride
characteristics<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> shocks<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
characteristics of the shocks with the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.830 
characteristics of the shocks with the
lip<00:01:07.290> longer<00:01:07.650> with<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> longer<00:01:08.189> stroke<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.840> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
lip longer with a longer stroke and we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840 
lip longer with a longer stroke and we
revised<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> rear<00:01:10.619> end<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> bit<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
revised the rear end a bit to make it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
revised the rear end a bit to make it
make<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> suspension<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.380> more

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
make the suspension a little more

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
make the suspension a little more
progressive<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> end<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> its<00:01:14.610> travel<00:01:14.790> but

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
progressive at the end of its travel but

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.490 
progressive at the end of its travel but
important<00:01:15.750> detail<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.200> 2011<00:01:16.830> demo<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.729> new

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.569 
also allows us to move this pivot point
back<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.600> basically<00:01:46.320> where<00:01:46.710> it'd<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.430> by

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
back to basically where it'd be right by

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
back to basically where it'd be right by
the<00:01:47.640> by<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.149> wheel<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.780> mentioned

make<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> make<00:01:51.540> suspension<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> bit<00:01:52.290> more

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
make the make suspension a bit more

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.980 
make the make suspension a bit more
progressive<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.700> end<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.970> its<00:01:54.090> travel<00:01:54.299> so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
progressive at the end of its travel so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.499 
progressive at the end of its travel so
again<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:56.009> new<00:01:56.189> suspension<00:01:56.610> kinematics<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
again all new suspension kinematics to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.590 
again all new suspension kinematics to
to<00:01:58.259> tune<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.909> some<00:01:59.909> other<00:01:59.969> details<00:02:00.420> on

to tune that in some other details on

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.870 
to tune that in some other details on
the<00:02:00.689> bike<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.799> bike<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:02.159> comes<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.610> four

the bike the bike now comes in four

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.910 
the bike the bike now comes in four
sizes<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> new<00:02:03.810> extra<00:02:04.110> small<00:02:04.350> size<00:02:04.590> up

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
sizes we have a new extra small size up

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.429 
sizes we have a new extra small size up
to<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.579> size<00:02:05.759> large<00:02:06.090> geometry<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> same

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
to up to size large geometry is the same

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.100 
to up to size large geometry is the same
as<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> 2010<00:02:08.429> demo<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> exception<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
as the 2010 demo with the exception of a

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
as the 2010 demo with the exception of a
little<00:02:10.259> bit<00:02:10.349> shorter<00:02:10.830> seat<00:02:11.520> tubes<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.940> some

little bit shorter seat tubes on some

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.230 
little bit shorter seat tubes on some
sizes<00:02:12.599> and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
sizes and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and a little bit shorter headtube so you

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.990 
and a little bit shorter headtube so you
can<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:15.940> lower<00:02:16.420> your<00:02:16.510> bar<00:02:16.780> just<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.110> bit

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
can you can lower your bar just a bit

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.910 
can you can lower your bar just a bit
lastly<00:02:19.000> major<00:02:19.480> change<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.140> bike<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.740> a

lastly major change on the bike is a

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.400 
lastly major change on the bike is a
much<00:02:21.490> much<00:02:21.730> narrower<00:02:22.090> rear<00:02:22.330> end<00:02:22.540> even<00:02:23.230> with<00:02:23.380> a

system the rear end is as narrow as
possible<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:30.340> wanted<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.670> make<00:02:30.880> sure<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
possible we wanted to make sure that the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.110 
possible we wanted to make sure that the
riders<00:02:32.050> didn't<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.410> problems<00:02:33.370> equipping

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
riders didn't have problems equipping

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.720 
riders didn't have problems equipping
their<00:02:34.270> their<00:02:34.690> heels<00:02:34.960> on<00:02:35.200> there<00:02:35.410> on<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.580> back

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
their their heels on there on the back

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.270 
their their heels on there on the back
of<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.970> stays<00:02:37.210> so<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:37.930> made<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.320> rear<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> nice

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
of the stays so we made the rear a nice

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.790 
of the stays so we made the rear a nice
narrow<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.850> tucked<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.440> also<00:02:41.440> you'll<00:02:41.590> notice

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
narrow and tucked in also you'll notice

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.940 
narrow and tucked in also you'll notice
all<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.670> lines<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.150> all<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.800> fourteens<00:02:44.800> and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
all the lines and all the fourteens and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.160 
all the lines and all the fourteens and
the<00:02:45.010> tubes<00:02:45.250> are<00:02:45.850> smooth<00:02:46.270> as<00:02:46.420> possible<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:47.020> keep

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
the tubes are smooth as possible to keep

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.170 
the tubes are smooth as possible to keep
mud<00:02:47.440> collection<00:02:47.890> down<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> minimum<00:02:48.610> so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
mud collection down to a minimum so

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.150 
mud collection down to a minimum so
obviously<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.720> guys<00:02:49.870> raced<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.440> super<00:02:51.010> muddy

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
obviously the guys raced on super muddy

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.650 
obviously the guys raced on super muddy
courses<00:02:51.670> quite<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> bit<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.300> we're<00:02:52.420> trying<00:02:52.570> to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
courses quite a bit so we're trying to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.510 
courses quite a bit so we're trying to
keep<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> mud<00:02:53.110> from<00:02:53.230> collecting<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.920> keeping

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
keep the mud from collecting and keeping

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.680 
keep the mud from collecting and keeping
all<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> mud<00:02:54.910> just<00:02:55.120> flowing<00:02:55.300> through<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
all the mud just flowing through the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.910 
all the mud just flowing through the
through<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.170> frame<00:02:57.090> lastly<00:02:58.710> frame<00:02:59.710> weight

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
through the frame lastly frame weight

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.580 
through the frame lastly frame weight
goes<00:03:00.160> down<00:03:00.190> by<00:03:00.730> three-quarters<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.450> pound

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
goes down by three-quarters of a pound

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.110 
goes down by three-quarters of a pound
compared<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.740> last<00:03:02.890> year's<00:03:03.160> frame<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.000> it's<00:03:04.090> a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
compared to last year's frame so it's a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.510 
compared to last year's frame so it's a
big<00:03:04.270> big<00:03:04.480> weight<00:03:04.630> reduction<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.380> on<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
big big weight reduction on the on the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.449 
big big weight reduction on the on the
2011<00:03:07.180> demo

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
2011 demo

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.729 

some<00:03:10.060> other<00:03:10.180> detail<00:03:10.510> changes<00:03:10.720> on<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.230> on<00:03:11.560> the

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
some other detail changes on the on the

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.569 
some other detail changes on the on the
2011<00:03:12.299> demo<00:03:13.299> would<00:03:13.900> be<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.500> thru-axle<00:03:15.099> system

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
2011 demo would be a thru-axle system

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.429 
2011 demo would be a thru-axle system
that<00:03:16.060> we<00:03:16.209> prototyped<00:03:16.689> last<00:03:17.049> year<00:03:17.230> with<00:03:17.349> the

that we prototyped last year with the
muster<00:03:17.739> guys<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:18.220> goes<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.420> pretty<00:03:19.840> much

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019
