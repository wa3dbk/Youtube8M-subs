 satellite game of Chinese web 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.130
 National Learning Service 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.130
 destination or departure in the number or fonsi 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.750
 let's look at two things in terms of 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.660
 pronunciation of the numbers first the 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.300
 p of set is not pronounced and in second 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.600
 place if you say although they are written with 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.909
 x are pronounced as indies as if 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.909
 were written with s follow 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.479
 it is said of snap suite &amp; not for 

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:49.010
 pronounce these numbers correctly 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.739
 we must take into account the sound of the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.019
 letter z it is a sound phoneme is 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.320
 say that the vocal cords vibrate by 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:01.490
 example 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.980
 let's go now from 20 to 90 mount hope 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:08.690
 sanz count his action his action says that 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:12.470
 means 60 and 10 or 60 10 that gives 70 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.280
 for those 70s of sex are 10 80 is 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.940
 affirms that it means 4 times 20 and that gives 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.390
 80 then for example 83 it says here 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.970
 frankfurt and 90 is hat ferrÃ¡ndiz that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.479
 means four times 2010 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.240
 then 95 would say capturing cannes 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.990
 which means 4 times 20 that that gives 80 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.610
 more 15 common cause when we want to join 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.920
 any number with the number one 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.880
 we must use the conjunction 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.970
 for example pantheon champion champion are 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.190
 champion that strontium the rest of the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.490
 figures if we join them directly by 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.060
 example where I put ancap van sant 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.920
 lancet van wyk van der let's go to 100 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.070
 what is said are then 200 are said 2 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.910
 300 are and so on 1000 are 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.349
 they say a thousand and one million is a million now 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.360
 who already saw the numbers in French 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.849
