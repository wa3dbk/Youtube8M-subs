00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.879
 so hello to all we are two and 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.799
 we created a city that is 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.330
 now perfect and we will you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:17.100
 present it so we set up 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.539
 several things like that we did 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.500
 illegal public works 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.680
 this is it so we installed a floor 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.859
 all over the nation all over the city 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.359
 on the whole surface of the city 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.920
 so we have perfect oranges and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.620
 cherries perfect and we have flowers of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.879
 all kinds 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 yes we have installed all over the village 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.840
 but there is not clear is Mr. 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 is not a good place to conch 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.870
 the disadvantage of having installed all the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.000
 soil like that is that when we shake 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.219
 the trees its fruits eh ben they 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.510
 disappear but hey it's not very 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.559
 important because we all have now 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.559
 Yes, it's true 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.680
 so we have all the fruits you do 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.400
 a good public of fruits so these ci 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.950
 are perfect so that's the cases that one 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.100
 has them in the gallery but wins a 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.590
 once we have the gallery and with the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:28.759
 bamboo too so let's go to the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.190
 beach we have a rather special beach because 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.350
 that in fact we have to go on the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.299
 second beach by swimming because we have 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.659
 two things to go down to the beach and 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.399
 low 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.190
 our two paths to get down to the 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.850
 beach they are not connected to the second 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.670
 beach so we will not go but yeah 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.880
 it's just to show 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.509
 here is a well that's the spirit of 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.990
 blizzard comes from plants and so a 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.530
 lighthouse is well on the way to the beach 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.330
 which is so at NASA has been very 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.850
 long climb of all these flowers and in 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.830
 the more you have to deal with them all 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.250
 the days otherwise she should not fan them 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.040
 to crush 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.989
 so here I took a mushroom and when 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.180
 the canton does not eat that's it 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.340
 becomes run for a second 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.970
 yeah that's not it lasts but it's 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.130
 pity but here we have the post of 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.380
 police so we win it after one 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.890
 moment we buy it in the works 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.630
 public 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.370
 we can simply see that we have 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.459
 all kinds of flowers violets 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:48.260
 der orange or more capped have filed the 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:51.130
 camping here the moment there's nobody there 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.130
 at the pergola 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:14.170
 so the train station is good so we also 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 all objects gilded a the fishing rod 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.080
 the golden call the watering can we have when we 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.330
 to the gilded watering can we have it when 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.370
 we in the perfect city the golden call he 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.660
 must plant a shovel of such 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.880
 for one night 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.950
 the gold fishing rod and there you have to 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.190
 have all the fish the net must 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.550
 to see all the same sex and yesterday it is necessary 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.050
 to have 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.430
 there must at all will catch a 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.739
 number of balloons and one can 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.510
 after having the 16th thrower it's a 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.769
 throws stones that will be the chair there are 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.769
 a silver slingshot too 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.989
 so that's when there is everything in bloom 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.090
 what can we 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:04:01.310
 show moment table has for name of m 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:03.620
 that one lives have so bah goes their 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.290
 show the tree we will show you to 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.450
 our special tree because actually 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.489
 abbas is waiting for signs that beyond 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:20.650
 our code 5 and reframes his notes yesterday 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:23.440
 so here I tell you us and that's it 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.660
 so our game tree dozens we have a 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.340
 special tree because we have a city 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.030
 perfect 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.110
 besides, that's why we had 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.610
 of golden watering can and here he is there so 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.440
 once you have a perfect view 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.940
 can change the shape of our tree 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.560
 so we decided to put like this 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.280
 you see it's not like the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:57.029
 So here this other track liters 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:05:00.519
 here's 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:04.719

 the weather the weather will stay 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:19.679
 so that's because it's a city 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.899
 perfect 

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:27.039
 So here we have you just about everything 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:28.719
 presented one you can see so we're going 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:35.589
 tell you the code if you ever wanted 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:37.329
 come as a dream because our 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.959
 code on iric 

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:43.360
 so we can take it we can 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:45.669
 take in the township has the salon of 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.050
 relaxation that we unlock that we must 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:55.319
 buy and unlock 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:58.149

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:08.289
 marry the secretary he proposes so 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:10.349
 the code is 1300 0 481 3618 thanks to the 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.349
 meet again
