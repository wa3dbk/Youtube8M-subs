00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
what you can imagine the remote I think

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
what you can imagine the remote I think
fits<00:00:21.449> perfectly<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.170> soul<00:00:22.350> calibur<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.890> in

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
fits perfectly with soul calibur and in

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.890 
fits perfectly with soul calibur and in
the<00:00:23.250> fact<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.029> know<00:00:24.060> anybody<00:00:24.449> can<00:00:24.600> swing

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the fact that you know anybody can swing

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900 
the fact that you know anybody can swing
the<00:00:24.990> remote<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.350> swing<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.340> sword<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the remote and swing it like a sword and

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820 
the remote and swing it like a sword and
I<00:00:26.970> think<00:00:27.119> I've<00:00:27.300> transistor<00:00:27.750> very<00:00:28.080> well<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
I think I've transistor very well so

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.320 
I think I've transistor very well so
basically<00:00:29.099> when<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.760> swing<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.119> remote

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
basically when you swing the remote

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.730 
basically when you swing the remote
you'll<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.660> able<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> control<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.260> weapon<00:00:31.560> as

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you'll be able to control your weapon as

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.560 
you'll be able to control your weapon as
if<00:00:32.189> you're<00:00:32.340> slashing<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:33.030> hack<00:00:33.210> eating

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
if you're slashing your hack eating

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.940 
if you're slashing your hack eating
stuff<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.350> also<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.770> their

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
stuff like that but also use their

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.860 
stuff like that but also use their
nunchucks<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> patrol<00:00:36.420> you're<00:00:36.540> kept<00:00:36.719> by

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
nunchucks to a patrol you're kept by

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.540 
nunchucks to a patrol you're kept by
moving<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.410> dashing<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:37.950> guarding<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
moving and dashing and guarding and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.830 
moving and dashing and guarding and
stuff<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> moments<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
stuff the moments that you do with the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.299 
stuff the moments that you do with the
remote<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.320> really<00:00:40.530> depend<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> character

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
remote I really depend on the character

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
remote I really depend on the character
that<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.780> IV<00:00:43.110> you'll<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that you use so for IV you'll have to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.440 
that you use so for IV you'll have to
use<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.129> remote<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> throw<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.239> room

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
use a remote you have to throw that room

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389 
use a remote you have to throw that room
or<00:00:45.570> forward<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.260> physically<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> way<00:00:47.219> but
