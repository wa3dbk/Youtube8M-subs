00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
I'm not so good at making them so I

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.180 
I'm not so good at making them so I
think<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.760> did<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.210> better<00:00:37.140> job<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.649> time<00:00:37.710> um

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
think I did a better job this time um

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.180 
think I did a better job this time um
it's<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.260> shells<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.950> little

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it's just that the shells are a little

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.319 
it's just that the shells are a little
bit<00:00:41.460> dirty<00:00:42.140> if<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:45.300> are

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
bit dirty if you can see that there are

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.920 
bit dirty if you can see that there are
some<00:00:45.629> dust<00:00:47.000> particles<00:00:48.000> yeah<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.750> there

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
some dust particles yeah right there

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
some dust particles yeah right there
especially<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> pink<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.340> annoying

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
especially on the pink one so annoying

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.389 
especially on the pink one so annoying
so<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.899> purple<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> dark<00:00:52.949> purple

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
so this is a purple one of a dark purple

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
so this is a purple one of a dark purple
filling<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> pink<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
filling and is a pink one of the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.740 
filling and is a pink one of the
strawberry<00:00:55.590> filling<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:57.270> had<00:00:57.390> gold<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
strawberry filling and they had gold I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.680 
strawberry filling and they had gold I
pincers<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.440> make<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.190> pretty

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
pincers I think make it really pretty

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
pincers I think make it really pretty
then<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.020> made<00:01:01.820> some<00:01:03.170> popsicles<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:05.030> there<00:01:06.030> is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
then I made some popsicles so there is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200 
then I made some popsicles so there is
this<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.380> use<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:08.220> translucent<00:01:08.820> clay

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this one and I use some translucent clay

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
this one and I use some translucent clay
so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.630> looks<00:01:09.930> um<00:01:10.820> more<00:01:11.820> realistic<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so it looks um more realistic so you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.620 
so it looks um more realistic so you
can't<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.700> camera<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
can't really see it on camera but it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.740 
can't really see it on camera but it
does<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.380> bit<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.770> translucent

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
does look a little bit more translucent

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.060 
does look a little bit more translucent
normally<00:01:18.750> when<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> made<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> last<00:01:19.439> time<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.890> use

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
normally when I made it last time I use

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
normally when I made it last time I use
like<00:01:20.369> solid<00:01:20.880> green<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.540> red<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.110> didn't

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
like solid green and red so it didn't

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.170 
like solid green and red so it didn't
really<00:01:22.409> look<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:22.950> pretty<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
really look very pretty so I think it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
really look very pretty so I think it
looks<00:01:24.210> much<00:01:24.570> better<00:01:24.750> now<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.640> yeah<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.670> really

there's<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.950> bigger<00:02:03.160> ones<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.730> smaller

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
there's the bigger ones and the smaller

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.370 
there's the bigger ones and the smaller
ones<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.270> think<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.480> smaller<00:02:04.750> ones<00:02:04.960> look<00:02:05.170> much

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
ones I think a smaller ones look much

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.560 
ones I think a smaller ones look much
cuter<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.210> yeah<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.910> voice<00:02:10.090> sounds<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> little

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
cuter so yeah my voice sounds a little

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.450 
cuter so yeah my voice sounds a little
bit<00:02:10.660> funny<00:02:10.869> if<00:02:11.140> you're<00:02:11.440> wondering<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:12.040> have

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
bit funny if you're wondering I have

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.290 
bit funny if you're wondering I have
been<00:02:12.700> coughing<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.150> lot<00:02:13.240> recently<00:02:14.610> okay<00:02:15.610> so

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
been coughing a lot recently okay so

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.750 
been coughing a lot recently okay so
then<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.660> made<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.200> burger<00:02:17.470> for<00:02:18.010> no<00:02:18.340> reason<00:02:18.670> at

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
then I made a burger for no reason at

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.500 
then I made a burger for no reason at
all<00:02:18.850> because<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.450> was<00:02:19.720> bored<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:21.790> does<00:02:22.270> not

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
all because I was bored and it does not

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.860 
all because I was bored and it does not
look<00:02:22.780> very<00:02:22.840> nice<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:24.210> don't<00:02:25.210> really<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.480> how

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
look very nice I don't really like how

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.810 
look very nice I don't really like how
it<00:02:26.050> turned<00:02:26.080> out<00:02:26.470> because<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.310> tomato<00:02:27.670> is

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
it turned out because the tomato is

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.500 
it turned out because the tomato is
split<00:02:28.090> smashed<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.840> my<00:02:29.800> red<00:02:30.010> clay<00:02:30.310> has<00:02:31.120> this

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
split smashed and my red clay has this

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.420 
split smashed and my red clay has this
problem<00:02:32.350> like<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:32.920> always<00:02:33.130> becomes

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
problem like it always becomes

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.660 
problem like it always becomes
especially<00:02:34.210> soft<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:35.080> some<00:02:35.260> reason<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
especially soft for some reason but the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.150 
especially soft for some reason but the
rest<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> clay<00:02:37.210> works<00:02:37.450> fine<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.680> i<00:02:38.710> guess

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
rest of the clay works fine so i guess

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.790 
rest of the clay works fine so i guess
i'll<00:02:39.400> have<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.610> improve<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.210> tomato<00:02:40.800> but

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
i'll have to improve on a tomato but

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.190 
i'll have to improve on a tomato but
yeah<00:02:42.960> then<00:02:43.960> i<00:02:44.230> made<00:02:44.910> some<00:02:45.910> really<00:02:46.180> teeny<00:02:46.780> tiny
