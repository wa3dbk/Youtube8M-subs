00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
my views on it on a video i've been

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.370 
my views on it on a video i've been
wanting<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.760> make<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> while<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.690> my

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
wanting to make for a while it's my

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.460 
wanting to make for a while it's my
perfect<00:00:19.949> console<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:20.910> least<00:00:21.199> Nintendo's<00:00:22.199> what

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
perfect console at least Nintendo's what

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.439 
perfect console at least Nintendo's what
Nintendo<00:00:23.100> should<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> next

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
Nintendo should do for the next

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.089 
Nintendo should do for the next
generation<00:00:25.140> now<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> believe<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.890> winning

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
generation now I believe it's a winning

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.740 
generation now I believe it's a winning
formula<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.789> don't<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.119> how<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.420> could<00:00:27.480> lose

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
formula I don't see how they could lose

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200 
formula I don't see how they could lose
so<00:00:28.560> let's<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:28.980> right<00:00:29.039> into<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:30.060> their

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
so let's just get right into for their

agree<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.619> wii<00:01:10.770> u<00:01:10.920> i<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:11.820> an

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
agree with the wii u i think that's an

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.670 
agree with the wii u i think that's an
optional<00:01:12.450> kind<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> features<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.439> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
optional kind of features to have that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100 
optional kind of features to have that
game<00:01:13.950> pad<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> off<00:01:14.880> TV<00:01:15.299> play<00:01:15.330> but

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
game pad with the off TV play but

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.710 
game pad with the off TV play but
unfortunately<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.280> develop<00:01:17.790> some<00:01:18.090> games<00:01:18.420> in

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
unfortunately they develop some games in

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.130 
unfortunately they develop some games in
the<00:01:19.049> OS<00:01:19.470> itself<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.250> mandatory<00:01:21.060> using<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the OS itself to be mandatory using that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.830 
the OS itself to be mandatory using that
controller<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.280> cannot<00:01:23.700> release<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.390> base

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
controller so they cannot release a base

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200 
controller so they cannot release a base
model<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> controller<00:01:26.340> i<00:01:26.610> want

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
model with just the controller i want

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
model with just the controller i want
them<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> opposite<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
them to do the opposite I want them to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
them to do the opposite I want them to
go<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.130> reverse<00:01:29.280> make<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.329> standard<00:01:30.780> version

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
go in reverse make the standard version

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
go in reverse make the standard version
with<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> controller<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.220> everyone<00:01:32.700> else

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
with the controller for everyone else

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
with the controller for everyone else
and<00:01:33.119> then<00:01:33.659> make<00:01:33.869> an<00:01:34.110> accessory<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.860> top<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.280> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and then make an accessory on top of it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.819 
and then make an accessory on top of it
and<00:01:35.460> features<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.360> top<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.110> case<00:01:37.350> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
and features on top of it in case that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399 
and features on top of it in case that
feature<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.549> enabled<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:40.020> make<00:01:40.200> the

feature is enabled and to make the

feature is enabled and to make the
experience<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.280> greater<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
experience that much more greater the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
experience that much more greater the
analogy<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.079> philosophy<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
analogy to that philosophy would have to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
analogy to that philosophy would have to
be<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> kinect<00:01:44.880> microsoft<00:01:45.869> has<00:01:45.990> made<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> so

it's<00:01:48.390> not<00:01:48.540> mandatory<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
it's not mandatory but if you get it it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's not mandatory but if you get it it
just<00:01:50.340> adds<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.149> experience<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.810> adds<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
just adds to the experience it adds the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.350 
just adds to the experience it adds the
functionality<00:01:53.040> that's<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:54.030> way<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> go

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
functionality that's the right way to go

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.139 
functionality that's the right way to go
for<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> next<00:01:55.560> generation<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.850> personally

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
see that that would be the perfect

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.980 
see that that would be the perfect
console<00:06:21.039> and<00:06:21.250> it<00:06:21.550> would<00:06:21.669> demolish<00:06:22.150> it<00:06:22.539> would

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990
