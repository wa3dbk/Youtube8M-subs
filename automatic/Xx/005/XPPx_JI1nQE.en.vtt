00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:03.044
Semmy Schilt

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:06.628
Q: Tell us about the fight.

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:21.325
A: It was a tough fight, but it was a good one.

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:48.086
Q: It looked easy. Was it tough?

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:54.886
A: Yes. I took more damage than last year's tournament. It was a hard fight.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:22.040
Q: Does that mean that Zimmerman is that strong?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:57.665
A: He's really become strong and because we are on the same team, it was hard to punch and kick him.
But this will happen again and again. It's something I'll have to get over.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:03:07.249
Q: Since you are from the same gym, how did you practice?

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:24.923
A: We practiced at the same place and sometimes we were training at the same time.
But since we have different trainers, the environment was different.

00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:57.450
Q: Who do you want to fight next.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:09.913
A: I don't have that list in my head. I let the producers decide my opponents and then I beat them one by one.
