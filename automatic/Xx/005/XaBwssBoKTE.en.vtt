but you take these claws from the
Bionicles<00:02:33.150> sets<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:34.140> lego<00:02:34.950> sets<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.970> put

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
Bionicles sets or lego sets and you put

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.430 
Bionicles sets or lego sets and you put
in<00:02:39.180> my<00:02:39.239> hair<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.660> ones<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.959> used<00:02:40.140> last<00:02:40.200> time

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
in my hair the ones I used last time

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.509 
in my hair the ones I used last time
we're<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.799> slippery<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.370> they<00:02:41.459> were

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
we're really slippery and they were

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.500 
we're really slippery and they were
sliding<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> didn't<00:02:43.049> use<00:02:43.170> them<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.510> then

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
sliding so I didn't use them and then

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.570 
sliding so I didn't use them and then
you<00:02:45.599> add<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.060> front<00:02:48.239> right<00:02:48.360> there<00:02:49.580> and

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
you add it to the front right there and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.460 
you add it to the front right there and

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
yeah and then you need to take um you

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:21.620 
yeah and then you need to take um you
could<00:06:13.440> use<00:06:16.010> this<00:06:17.010> guy<00:06:19.610> you<00:06:20.610> should<00:06:20.670> use<00:06:21.090> these

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
could use this guy you should use these

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.050 
could use this guy you should use these
take<00:06:21.870> pieces<00:06:22.110> if<00:06:22.440> you<00:06:22.560> um<00:06:22.980> I<00:06:23.310> had<00:06:23.640> originally

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
take pieces if you um I had originally

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.980 
take pieces if you um I had originally
these<00:06:24.690> type<00:06:24.930> of<00:06:24.960> pieces<00:06:25.440> for<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.770> sides<00:06:26.690> but<00:06:27.690> I

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
these type of pieces for the sides but I

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.550 
these type of pieces for the sides but I
think<00:06:28.740> if<00:06:28.890> you<00:06:29.250> can<00:06:29.370> if<00:06:29.610> you<00:06:29.760> can't<00:06:29.940> find<00:06:30.060> those

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
think if you can if you can't find those

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.350 
think if you can if you can't find those
you<00:06:31.560> should<00:06:31.710> originally<00:06:32.250> use<00:06:32.550> this<00:06:33.120> type<00:06:33.330> of

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
you should originally use this type of

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:39.130 
you should originally use this type of
piece<00:06:34.940> but<00:06:35.940> what<00:06:36.150> you<00:06:36.270> need<00:06:36.390> to<00:06:36.510> do<00:06:37.220> anyway<00:06:38.220> is

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
piece but what you need to do anyway is

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.700 
piece but what you need to do anyway is
take<00:06:40.140> the<00:06:40.290> piece<00:06:40.530> any<00:06:41.160> two<00:06:41.430> of<00:06:41.460> them<00:06:41.640> and<00:06:42.710> add

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
take the piece any two of them and add

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.420 
take the piece any two of them and add
them<00:06:44.030> onto<00:06:45.030> the<00:06:45.660> side<00:06:45.930> like<00:06:46.650> this<00:06:46.890> so<00:06:47.280> let's

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
them onto the side like this so let's

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.320 
them onto the side like this so let's
are<00:06:47.550> slanted<00:06:49.310> my<00:06:50.310> original<00:06:50.670> warthog<00:06:51.000> dost

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
are slanted my original warthog dost

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.620 
are slanted my original warthog dost
hurt<00:06:51.630> was<00:06:51.930> flat<00:06:52.760> what<00:06:53.760> they<00:06:54.240> need<00:06:54.420> to<00:06:54.510> be

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
hurt was flat what they need to be

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.310 
hurt was flat what they need to be
slanted<00:06:56.480> because<00:06:57.480> originally<00:06:57.660> it<00:06:57.900> was<00:06:57.960> a<00:06:58.050> one

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
slanted because originally it was a one

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.910 
slanted because originally it was a one
by<00:06:58.440> three<00:06:58.470> with<00:06:59.190> one<00:06:59.550> recipes<00:06:59.940> right<00:07:00.030> here<00:07:00.920> but

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
by three with one recipes right here but

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.320 
by three with one recipes right here but
I<00:07:02.070> upgraded<00:07:02.670> it<00:07:02.850> and<00:07:03.650> heat<00:07:04.650> up<00:07:04.770> 1<00:07:04.890> by<00:07:05.040> 3<00:07:05.250> 2<00:07:06.060> 1<00:07:06.210> by

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
I upgraded it and heat up 1 by 3 2 1 by

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.790 
I upgraded it and heat up 1 by 3 2 1 by
threes<00:07:06.600> and<00:07:07.220> take<00:07:08.220> the<00:07:08.490> center<00:07:09.380> and<00:07:10.380> put<00:07:10.560> it<00:07:10.650> on

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
threes and take the center and put it on

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.270 
threes and take the center and put it on
the<00:07:11.310> stud

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.070 

so<00:07:18.910> that<00:07:19.120> it's<00:07:19.240> slanted<00:07:20.370> but<00:07:21.660> for<00:07:22.660> the<00:07:22.810> gas

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 
so that it's slanted but for the gas

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.190 
so that it's slanted but for the gas
chamber<00:07:23.680> you're<00:07:24.220> going<00:07:24.400> to<00:07:24.520> take<00:07:24.670> one<00:07:25.200> by

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.200 
chamber you're going to take one by

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:33.210 
chamber you're going to take one by
three<00:07:26.410> and<00:07:27.780> a<00:07:28.780> large<00:07:29.680> cylinder<00:07:31.139> and<00:07:32.139> put<00:07:33.040> the

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.220 
three and a large cylinder and put the

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.360 
three and a large cylinder and put the
bottom<00:07:33.550> two<00:07:33.700> studs<00:07:33.940> right<00:07:34.210> here<00:07:35.100> and<00:07:36.100> take<00:07:36.340> a

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370 
bottom two studs right here and take a

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.900 
bottom two studs right here and take a
cylinder<00:07:37.980> and<00:07:38.980> add<00:07:39.220> it<00:07:39.400> right<00:07:39.430> here<00:07:41.280> and<00:07:42.280> take

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910 
cylinder and add it right here and take

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.240 
cylinder and add it right here and take
the<00:07:43.330> last<00:07:43.660> part<00:07:44.050> of<00:07:44.200> the<00:07:44.440> one<00:07:44.590> by<00:07:44.740> three<00:07:44.950> and

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.250 
the last part of the one by three and

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.060 
the last part of the one by three and
add<00:07:45.669> it<00:07:45.850> on<00:07:45.970> to<00:07:46.120> the<00:07:46.240> stud<00:07:46.680> that<00:07:47.680> just<00:07:47.860> sort<00:07:47.980> of

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.070 
add it on to the stud that just sort of

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.590 
add it on to the stud that just sort of
gives<00:07:48.220> the<00:07:48.340> detail<00:07:48.700> of<00:07:48.910> the<00:07:50.730> gauss<00:07:51.730> missile

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:52.600 
gives the detail of the gauss missile

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.020 
gives the detail of the gauss missile
