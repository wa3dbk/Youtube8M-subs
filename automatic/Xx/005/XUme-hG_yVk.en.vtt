 Hi Akochan I bought a piano recently 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:16.440
 Part number is a big Leo np Eleven of the mountain 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:21.120
 It is so light that you can move various rooms . 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.090
 I bought another chair when I went down the bed and Spain 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:28.700
 Hmm 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:31.670
 It is the first time in 10 years to touch the era of Fear, but it is the keyboard in the band 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.820
 I did it, but I am good at suma originally 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:38.059
 I wanted to play the piano again and bought a game

 I'm trying hard now and practicing songs 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:47.850
 It is Ayaka's rainbow-colored This is practice at karaoke 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:52.730
 At first I practiced as much as myself but it is still not something I can do with both hands 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.360
 I'm only practicing the pharynx I want to record how long I become a visceral 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.710
