00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.439
 there is this hype and the headline 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.970
 the hype is in ten years, everyone has so 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.330
 a 3d printer at home and presses 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.090
 everything from what he lives for 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.489
 Who does not need his clothes 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.590
 medicine foods but that is 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.840
 not realistically at the moment 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.590
 There are five six different ones 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.969
 methods to print 3d objects so 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 different materials and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.290
 Technologies with which one can in the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.149
 moment though there are already quite a lot 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.559
 there are still very few and do 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.089
 So you are from the materials ago 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.379
 still very limited it is too expensive 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.519
 and the second is that the application 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.819
 is already so specific that one 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.019
 actually has to get used to and 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.129
 So I think he does that 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.129
 service provider market is 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.640
 that probably makes the most sense 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.290
 field of application prototyping 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.410
 So , for example, product development 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.990
 you can do it within a few 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.830
 hours prototypes print and the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 Check haptics or 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.330
 how does llb medicine work ? 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.520
 probably a big one 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.980
 application area so because of the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.990
 medicine comes a moment most money 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.680
 example what I think is pretty 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.250
 a radiologist from the charitÃ© 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.980
 he builds exercise phantoms for X-ray 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.260
 So groups with whom you practice x-rays 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.880
 can be quasi within this group must 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.040
 There are areas that give X-rays 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.560
 different levels of absorption and there 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.180
 he's just working on the things 3d 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.729
 to produce printed so that one can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.820
 doll has the ten different ones 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.040
 concentration of iodine for example by 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.980
 you then have printing material with it 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.500
 just can practice the franken 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.030
 in medicine you could use it 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.700
 Spare parts for people, so to speak 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.780
 you somehow produce prosthesis for 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.890
 his body which must needs have 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.840
 fit and therefore, such offer 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.090
 technologies because they are good for 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.420
 small objects and small quantities 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.190
 could work at the moment skin 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.500
 produce the one implanted one 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.250
 could produce organs we 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.250
 implanted 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.320
 the community has an estimated size 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.420
 from 10 to 40,000 i know i can 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.430
 no number here say how many people 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.790
 Now in Germany a 3d printer 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.130
 So those are really few would 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.240
 I say so when you hull protrudes 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.280
 somewhere if you have a bigger audience 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.700
 has as more and sign up only a very 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.400
 Couple then if you ask who have one 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.110
 almost everybody wants to get in touch 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.110
 that is quite interesting 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.550
 The printer is an open source 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.790
 hardware project that means that there is one 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.550
 whole series by people are the world 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.330
 always make improvements 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:52.740
 publish online and that will be 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.870
 so to speak collected and there will be 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.670
 distributions homemade, so to speak 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.700
 So if parts are collected to one 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.020
 printer and then you can get that 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.880
 download templates for the components 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.130
 you can download the software 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.709
 i can also order all parts also parts 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.000
 you can change and produce yourself 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.280
 she can also publish again 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.650
 without any patent rights 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.799
 there are now hurt there 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.329
 Even commercial printers in the lower 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.650
 But price segment are only because of the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.650
 build on this system 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.330
 I have to say that because I know myself 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.979
 little to say that now 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.930
 was fair or did not think straight 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.090
 in the usa, they are also easy again 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.509
 much more present than here because they are with you 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.830
 so with chris anderson the wepad is 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.439
 Chris Anderson always play 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.599
 The balls are beautiful with the ones with the book 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.189
 what chris anderson wrote there 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.279
 comes there is the more broken then 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:58.499
 is the 3d printer in the book that is 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:01.469
 a huge hype just and so me 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:03.840
 think the brand is already worth a lot 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.400
 and you have to say that that 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.319
 the printer is not quite 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.319
 cheap but the really good quality 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.230
 that is how it is right now 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.210
 just not enough 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.320
 application possibilities so that's the 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.480
 things that you can print the 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.290
 nobody really needs it 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.880
 right now and that's why 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.970
 also no money what you at the moment 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.560
 still has to pay for investing but 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.330
 if someday you will someday 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.080
 It is possible to think about whether you like your children 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.490
 an xbox shop or in 3d printer and 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.130
 that works as well as an xbox 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.140
 So you turn it on and leave that 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.140
 why not play it?
