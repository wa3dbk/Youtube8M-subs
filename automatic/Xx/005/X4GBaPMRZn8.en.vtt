00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 very good everyone welcome again 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 to the channel today we are going to see a movement 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.000
 with a single letter I do not know if I have 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.069
 said once for my movements 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 with a single letter I love them I think 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.830
 They are great especially for the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.929
 simplicity that the fact of doing 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
 a movement with the the letter is something 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.460
 which is very beautiful is very elegant and for 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.109
 they are my favorite movements in 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.970
 concrete the one that we're going to see today what 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.970
 called twitter and I hope you like it 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.039
 m 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.920
 even though it's a movement with a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.570
 letter let's start with the whole deck and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.909
 I think it's interesting because 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.350
 usually when you do something 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.479
 manipulation or some magic for the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.369
 people do not have a single letter but 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.229
 you have the deck I like to start all 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.879
 movements with a single letter from 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.530
 the deck so let's see how 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.820
 we do first of all mega I'm going to 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.020
 to say that this movement costs me 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.460
 so much slow it but I'm going to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.990
 try just so you can 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.390
 understand fast would be something like that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.040
 but let's see what exactly does 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.600
 every finger to start we'll do it with the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 Then the upper floor is worth the finger 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.290
 left thumb in case you are 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 right-handed because you already know that you are from 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.680
 you have to hold the deck with 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.700
 the left hand that by the way I think 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.299
 who has never said any video 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.420
 We push with the left thumb 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.030
 ok and we put the middle finger underneath 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 right index finger above is worth it already 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.690
 we have the letter so that we help 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.480
 annul to defeat it 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.620
 so until it reaches the little finger it's worth 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.620
 once little finger comes 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:51.080
 we do this 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.670
 and we extend it that is to say in 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.220
 We extend in we take extend we are worth the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.159
 little finger stops acting and finger 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.050
 ring and middle finger rotate it again 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.570
 then index finger 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.260
 just rotate the voucher we see it again 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.220
 thumb off the middle finger 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.870
 index and ring 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:26.730
 little finger is worth in we catch extend 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.860
 again an index finger happens to enter 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.830
 I play the thumb that will be the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.750
 In charge of making the closing voucher is a 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.910
 little complicated explain it always slow 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.040
 I say it but well let's see it a 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.819
 little marx accelerator we do not see him 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.499
 more less this is the movement worth 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.849
 As you can see, it's very cool, it 's a very 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.849
 pretty very dynamic 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.209
 this movement is also going to be done 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.080
 with the card face up, it's just that 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.150
 the final part will change and something will remain 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.069
 well but you can also do 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.780
 we will be therefore turning the letter 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.440
 in a very elegant way it's worth 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.140
 I would repeat 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.590
 so it is worth saying at the time of entering the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.790
 game in play the thumb 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.620
 It does not do what it used to , but only 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.209
 accompanies to turn and well this would be 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.230
 everything more or less destroy is a 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.780
 movement that as I say I like 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.370
 very much let's see some details and 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.580
 at the end of the video is any 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.580
 curiosity 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.770
 with this it is true to add that 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.950
 simply that for routines 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.110
 One-handed manipulation of throwing cards 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.640
 or do pitches many many times 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.650
 I start with the twitter is a 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.080
 movement that I like very much because 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.030
 It is very dynamic and at the same time it is simple 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.190
 in fact and what I want to tell you there 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.620
 what to do with the entities of the movement 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.420
 About a year ago, I collaborated with a 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.300
 friend to make a kind of movie 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.730
 short film and they told me that I had to 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.040
 teach the actor a movement that was 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.650
 with a letter is worth but clear 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.330
 I tried to teach the pirouette and like xavi 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.950
 the pirouette costs does not leave a day for 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.230
 another in fact we leave a few hours the 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.880
 pirouette and it occurred to me that I could do 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.400
 the tour the tour is a movement that 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.160
 well it's not very complicated it 's very 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.960
 resultón and you can even teach 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.280
 Some friend or someone who tells you and what 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.870
 you do with the cards and such and you say 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.849
 you want to learn something easy if you are 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.189
 tired of teaching the charly is a 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.629
 an option and if you only have one letter is 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.520
 teach him the tweet as I say is a 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.839
 movement very nice and good I tell you 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.550
 it's from my favorites I hope what 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.169
 enjoy it if you do not know it already 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.719
 you know if you know any variant or 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.610
 some similar movement this is how 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.289
 I do it and well I hope that I have 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.990
 liked to remember if you liked thumb 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.819
