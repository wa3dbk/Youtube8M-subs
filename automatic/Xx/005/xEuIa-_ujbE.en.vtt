 the butterfly curtain leading 3 to 0 face 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.710
 at the French stage after only four 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.150
 minutes the answer comes from the old 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.769
 catalan jérôme porical who was at 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.939
 perpignan last season and who 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.369
 also passes three points both 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.279

 attack with an audio guide hold 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.770
 a lot of trouble during this 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.420
 evening in international form 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.559
 french the ball goes out to hook the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 little kick to follow is the fault 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.590
 of paul williams the Parisian center that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.899
 will receive a yellow card after 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.910
 of this voluntary obstruction on li 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.200
 fei lead my daughter suddenly parisians 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 will find themselves in inferiority 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.910
 digital for 10 minutes 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.530
 james hook takes the opportunity to spend three 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.620
 new points and give back three points 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.230
 advance to his team 6 to 3 in favor of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.190
 perpignan 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.110
 we expect a new reaction from the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.460
 share of Parisians we find them here l 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.170
 attack with a balloon that goes so far 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.240
 in the hands of porical porical jérôme 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.880
 who took a good account is side 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.470
 perpignanais licked poite whistles a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.360
 penalty in favor of the Catalan side 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.759
 Parisian to both penalties we get 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.680
 quietly noted it will replace 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.030
 gently but surely only that's it 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 james hook comes running 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 of the Welsh opener passes it to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.430
 foot the penalty played quickly the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 pass for Richard haughton who 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.970
 face him a pillar aled de malmanche 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.500
 and left behind 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.030
 autumn accelerates that he can not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.890
 take them the last hook for 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 go mark the first try this 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.670
 match a try of 80 meters she was going 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.780
 well on idle jérôme fillol is in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.490
 chatting with his elbow with 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.290
 his players in his back james cook who 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 quickly plays the pass to the foot for 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.829
 richard haughton who is going to conclude this 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.970
 action for the first try of the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.579
 meeting for Peruvians who 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 then leads 11 to 3 after 18 minutes on 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.399
 the lawn of the French stadium but 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.659
 Catalans who commit some seals 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.890
 so I go back for ical benefits 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.850
 to pass three penalties one of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.250
 almost 50 m here it's a little bit 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 later an offer of more than 50 meters 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.969
 he had the distance before there 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.500
 still he will see her 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.700
 three penalties that one is important 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.599
 since it allows the French stage to 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.220
 pass in front of the score for the first 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.319
 Match times 12 to 11 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.790
 look at laussucq husband john who are following 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.469
 the ball 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.900
 looks and who know that this penalty 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.859
 is actually very important just 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.420
 before returning to the locker room 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.590
 the occasion for jean paul ii redonner 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.209
 the advantage to its colors but it touches 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 the post is perhaps a sign the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.069
 sign that luck has turned in favor 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.870
 from the French stadium to break 12 to 11 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.000
 for Parisians but in the gallery 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.099
 official we stay very very very close 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.140
 tense at the beginning of the second period with 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.620
 Parisians who go on a beating 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.510
 Paris fell in love with 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.909
 jérôme fucking violent girl for piss 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.859
 the Paris opener tries the drop and 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.450
 passes three new points to wear 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.159
 the mark at 15 to 11 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.470
 after eight minutes 4 points ahead 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.720
 for the mighty parisians jules who 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.609
 had already dropped a drop in the 2nd 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.560
 day it was in bayonne he reoffends 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.959

 minutes when a cooking and 18 to 11 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.829

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.530
 this match we find the Catalans to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.330
