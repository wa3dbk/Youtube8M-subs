00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.980
 hi everyone here for 349 cros for a 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.110
 little video on minecraft 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.430
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.970
 little tutorial on how to make bob 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.710
 the sponge you square boards 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.250
 nickelodeon character 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.109
 we all know him I like me 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.320
 answer ah that's why I tried 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.059
 to do it and I succeeded so that's it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.969
 it's a personal creation there is 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.170
 not copying videos on the internet or 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.370
 nothing so we'll start right now 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.040
 so first of all you will need them 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.559
 blacks to do the feet so you the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.590
 ask three like that 2/3 of length 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:56.149
 also finally the middle what are two 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.699
 like that there you have the base of the feet 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.840
 then I put a white wing 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.540
 officers am in 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.299
 then the white wool red noses 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.689
 blue helen of course your materials 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.650
 white 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.880
 if that's recognized the cease 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.400
 socks so has it then you put 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.350
 of the boards such as cis is made 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.590
 so feet 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:30.860
 then the swell surrounded by departure we go 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 to look for her 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:51.200
 so that on one side you are like 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:55.080
 the other one is gone up about 3 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.620
 two voices two or three same sells 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.560
 then moto2 then you move here 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.479
 you put in the place of the time I 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.020
 so I was at elmar we see TV that 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:15.660
 then at that level you 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:20.570
 go up though see the level will be 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.570
 more beautiful what I did 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:34.140
 that's it so here you still get 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.390
 that to do that is so open neither 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.320
 a base like this so judged to count 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:49.340
 to refuse the same 2.3 and I mount it 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:54.450
 more in the 4g step back 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.730
 so four counting the growth of 3.4 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.280
 then the white wool put two 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.830
 Copyright blocks while gentlemen have 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.060
 such as all here like it 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.060
 two in height 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.830
 so here you have 6 get there there you 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.980
 can if you want to put the tie 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.230
 now its not so bad but 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.930
 now we're going to be the head of 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.650
 their maintenance expenses make it the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.580
 base of the compound head every 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.580
 banks here 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.760
 so here you go up a little bit more 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:07.390
 so I still check game 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.099
 will go to 100% I think it's 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.519
 certainly that's what I thought I 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.709
 believe it's in two three four 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.150
 five six shots set 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.150
 bob's head 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.300
 So here I love you check for you 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.020
 but two three four five six is 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.949
 perfect and you get this so 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:03.250
 then you pose here made break like 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:05:04.449
 that's the blocks here are the blacks because 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.360
 they know the series well 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.210
 actually this kind of pants 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.919
 there are black lines like that so 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.080
 you can put different places 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.570
 if you start here drop and it will do 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.610
 like there good short so that's it 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.910
 gets her then with the white night 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.419
 is going to do the eyes then you put in 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.630
 the angle is good where everywhere from here 4 4 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.630
 otherwise 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.680
 so that's all white with the 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.810
 nba 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.340
 we're going to make it squint album so here 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:44.650
 it's like that with the dive way 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:53.970
 piss is just below the mouth 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:53.970
 so from then I made a mistake 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.349
 So here we have the head of our bab 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.419
 so I know a lot of people 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.629
 founded in all that good me I do 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:11.830
 simple me like that I like it me 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:15.310
 just so that's it after that makes you 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.949
 his arm that pushes you have several 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:22.719
 choice except it's as if if I like 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:27.639
 do it usually this is after 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:30.330
 you can extend his arm 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.530
 when he did something like that 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:39.849
 so there in fact when you leave yourself 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:41.199
 the arms here is the simplest if it 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.889
 it's pretty simple so the water 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:49.180
 radioactive that looks like it's doing a 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:53.560
 little fake but hey I do not think so 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:58.270
 still not good so here is our 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.940
 bob is finished he is happy especially so 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.539
 it's not easy it's not it's 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.669
 no video game 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:07.750
 it's very easy to get bored 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.940
 page I hope it helped you in 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.589
 this video 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.150
