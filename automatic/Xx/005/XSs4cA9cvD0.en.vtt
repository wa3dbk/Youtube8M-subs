gonna<00:05:25.650> do<00:05:25.920> it<00:05:25.950> but<00:05:26.280> honestly<00:05:26.880> we<00:05:27.180> need<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.450> find

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
gonna do it but honestly we need to find

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.740 
gonna do it but honestly we need to find
a<00:05:27.780> way<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:27.990> that<00:05:28.230> like<00:05:28.970> ninja<00:05:29.970> shinobi<00:05:30.480> can

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
a way so that like ninja shinobi can

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.600 
a way so that like ninja shinobi can
understand<00:05:31.260> each<00:05:31.380> other's<00:05:31.620> true<00:05:31.890> feelings<00:05:32.400> I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
understand each other's true feelings I

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.460 
understand each other's true feelings I
mean<00:05:33.030> it's<00:05:33.150> impossible<00:05:33.270> for<00:05:33.930> them<00:05:34.200> to<00:05:34.260> be<00:05:34.440> able

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
mean it's impossible for them to be able

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.830 
mean it's impossible for them to be able
to<00:05:34.710> do<00:05:34.830> that<00:05:35.040> understand<00:05:35.850> each<00:05:35.940> other<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.720> that

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
to do that understand each other to that

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.330 
to do that understand each other to that
kind<00:05:36.990> of<00:05:37.110> level<00:05:37.320> but<00:05:37.680> like<00:05:37.830> that's<00:05:38.040> what<00:05:38.220> we

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
kind of level but like that's what we

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.100 
kind of level but like that's what we
need<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.610> happen<00:05:38.760> for<00:05:39.090> peace<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.570> then<00:05:40.050> he

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
need to happen for peace and then he

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.720 
need to happen for peace and then he
like<00:05:40.260> first<00:05:40.500> stone<00:05:40.770> across<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.250> water<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.550> I

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
like first stone across the water and I

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.220 
like first stone across the water and I
guess<00:05:41.910> is<00:05:42.030> symbolism<00:05:42.450> that<00:05:42.630> he<00:05:42.840> has<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.080> right

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
guess is symbolism that he has the right

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.470 
guess is symbolism that he has the right
answer<00:05:43.680> because<00:05:43.890> his<00:05:44.160> stone<00:05:44.880> probably<00:05:45.330> she's

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
answer because his stone probably she's

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.180 
answer because his stone probably she's
the<00:05:45.540> other<00:05:45.660> side<00:05:45.900> yeah<00:05:46.380> I<00:05:46.410> mean<00:05:46.919> it<00:05:47.040> was<00:05:47.100> a

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
the other side yeah I mean it was a

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.090 
the other side yeah I mean it was a
really<00:05:47.310> good<00:05:47.520> chapter<00:05:48.710> I'll<00:05:49.710> probably<00:05:49.860> give

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
really good chapter I'll probably give

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
really good chapter I'll probably give
it<00:05:50.130> like<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:50.960> clean<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.700> don't<00:05:53.700> know<00:05:53.760> I<00:05:53.910> kind<00:05:54.090> of
