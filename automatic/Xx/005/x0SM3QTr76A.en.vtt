00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
comparisons which I don't think feels

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.849 
comparisons which I don't think feels
right<00:03:04.180> because<00:03:04.510> because<00:03:05.230> we're<00:03:05.560> out<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:05.799> the

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
right because because we're out in the

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.470 
right because because we're out in the
same<00:03:06.010> age<00:03:06.280> group<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.730> seems<00:03:06.970> as<00:03:07.180> if<00:03:07.209> it's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
same age group it seems as if it's

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.780 
same age group it seems as if it's
normal<00:03:07.659> for<00:03:08.439> people<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.069> say<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.519> with<00:03:09.760> a

like scoring poetry scores because I

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.500 
like scoring poetry scores because I
feel<00:04:12.280> if<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.519> get<00:04:12.669> those<00:04:12.819> goals<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.180> probably

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510

a good start whether it be a point or
win<00:04:46.060> but<00:04:46.350> against<00:04:47.350> all<00:04:47.440> opposition<00:04:47.590> it's

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
win but against all opposition it's

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.290 
win but against all opposition it's
going<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.280> be<00:04:48.370> difficult<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:48.940> we<00:04:49.090> can't

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
going to be difficult and we can't

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.820 
going to be difficult and we can't
underestimate<00:04:49.540> moreover<00:04:50.199> because<00:04:50.380> we<00:04:50.650> do

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
underestimate moreover because we do

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.770 
underestimate moreover because we do
know<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.070> they<00:04:51.370> will<00:04:51.580> have<00:04:51.729> quality<00:04:52.270> players

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
know that they will have quality players

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.659 
know that they will have quality players
because<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.680> players<00:04:53.919> you<00:04:54.070> don't<00:04:54.280> know<00:04:54.400> about

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
because the players you don't know about

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.950 
because the players you don't know about
they're<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.000> ones<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.300> worry<00:04:55.449> about<00:04:55.690> because

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
they're the ones you worry about because

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.330 
they're the ones you worry about because
you<00:04:56.050> never<00:04:56.169> know<00:04:56.440> what<00:04:56.949> they're<00:04:57.070> going<00:04:57.190> to<00:04:57.250> be

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
you never know what they're going to be

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.850 
you never know what they're going to be
like<00:04:57.490> on<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.699> day
