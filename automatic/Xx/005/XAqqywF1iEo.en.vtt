00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
it's near the bottom and there it is

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.089 
it's near the bottom and there it is
right<00:02:41.390> there<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:42.470> one's<00:02:42.680> really<00:02:42.830> cool

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
right there this one's really cool

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.220 
right there this one's really cool
because<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.940> basically<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.050> know<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
because it basically it's you know you

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.640 
because it basically it's you know you
can<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.560> any<00:02:45.860> background<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.580> want<00:02:46.790> any<00:02:47.030> any

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650

desktop<00:02:48.650> wallpaper<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.220> want<00:02:49.400> but<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.450> you

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
desktop wallpaper you want but then you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.270 
desktop wallpaper you want but then you
put<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.870> live<00:02:51.110> wallpaper<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:51.739> top<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:51.980> it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
put this live wallpaper over top of it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.340 
put this live wallpaper over top of it
and<00:02:52.489> it's<00:02:53.209> basically<00:02:53.600> just<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.080> bunch<00:02:54.230> of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
and it's basically just a bunch of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.699 
and it's basically just a bunch of
floating<00:02:54.739> bubbles<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:57.110> can<00:02:57.230> customize

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
floating bubbles that you can customize

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.190 
floating bubbles that you can customize
so<00:02:58.010> for<00:02:58.250> instance<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:59.000> bubble<00:02:59.390> will<00:02:59.989> have

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
so for instance this bubble will have

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.050 
so for instance this bubble will have
notifications<00:03:00.739> for<00:03:01.280> my<00:03:01.400> for<00:03:01.819> one<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:02.030> my

and it's this little you can see a
little<00:03:16.430> heart<00:03:16.730> bubble<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.269> these<00:03:17.420> are<00:03:17.540> for

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
little heart bubble and these are for

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.660 
little heart bubble and these are for
your<00:03:17.840> most<00:03:18.079> contacted<00:03:18.799> users<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.459> course

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
your most contacted users and of course

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.160 
your most contacted users and of course
you<00:03:19.820> would<00:03:19.940> click<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.450> they<00:03:20.900> would<00:03:21.049> all

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
you would click on that they would all

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.199 
you would click on that they would all
stop<00:03:21.440> generally<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.370> would<00:03:22.459> think<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.970> bubble

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
stop generally I would think the bubble

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.880 
stop generally I would think the bubble
should<00:03:23.420> keep<00:03:23.600> moving<00:03:24.079> except<00:03:24.590> for<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.769> one

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
should keep moving except for the one

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.110 
should keep moving except for the one
that<00:03:25.010> you've<00:03:25.100> clicked<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.519> but<00:03:25.790> nevertheless

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
that you've clicked on but nevertheless

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.400 
that you've clicked on but nevertheless
I'm<00:03:26.510> sure<00:03:26.660> there's<00:03:26.840> going<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.019> be<00:03:27.049> future

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
I'm sure there's going to be future

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.440 
I'm sure there's going to be future
updates<00:03:27.769> for<00:03:27.890> that<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.130> future<00:03:28.450> this

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
updates for that in the future this

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.449 
updates for that in the future this
little<00:03:29.930> tiny<00:03:30.320> circle<00:03:30.859> here<00:03:31.130> is<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> little

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
little tiny circle here is a little

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.949 
little tiny circle here is a little
envelope<00:03:31.910> probably<00:03:32.450> should<00:03:32.630> look<00:03:32.810> like<00:03:32.840> a

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
envelope probably should look like a

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.740 
envelope probably should look like a
messaging<00:03:33.650> bubble<00:03:34.100> but<00:03:34.359> anyways<00:03:35.359> that<00:03:35.540> takes

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
messaging bubble but anyways that takes

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.599 
messaging bubble but anyways that takes
you<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.930> text<00:03:36.320> messages<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.459> other

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
you to text messages and the other

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.780 
you to text messages and the other
little<00:03:37.910> one<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.239> an<00:03:38.390> end<00:03:38.660> call<00:03:39.549> symbol<00:03:40.549> which

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
little one is an end call symbol which

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.940 
little one is an end call symbol which
should<00:03:41.090> look<00:03:41.329> kind<00:03:41.600> of<00:03:41.660> like<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.870> making<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.739> call

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
should look kind of like a making a call

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.710 
should look kind of like a making a call
symbol<00:03:43.430> or<00:03:43.730> sending<00:03:44.090> call<00:03:44.269> symbol<00:03:44.600> but

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
symbol or sending call symbol but

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
you a graph of see for instance your

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.140 
you a graph of see for instance your
battery<00:05:15.840> life<00:05:15.870> your<00:05:16.590> Wi-Fi<00:05:17.100> signal<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.850> a

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
battery life your Wi-Fi signal and a

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.640 
battery life your Wi-Fi signal and a
couple<00:05:18.510> of<00:05:18.600> things<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.230> haven't<00:05:19.440> looked

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
couple of things that I haven't looked

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.050 
couple of things that I haven't looked
too<00:05:19.770> much<00:05:19.980> into<00:05:20.370> but<00:05:20.640> they<00:05:20.730> seem<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:20.940> be

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
too much into but they seem to be

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.850 
too much into but they seem to be
bouncing<00:05:21.480> around<00:05:21.570> so<00:05:21.960> I'm<00:05:22.050> assuming<00:05:22.170> one<00:05:22.680> is

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
bouncing around so I'm assuming one is

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.490 
bouncing around so I'm assuming one is
for<00:05:23.220> perhaps<00:05:23.490> reception<00:05:24.450> and<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:25.230> other<00:05:25.350> one

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
for perhaps reception and the other one

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.870 
for perhaps reception and the other one
is<00:05:25.530> for<00:05:26.040> I<00:05:26.250> don't<00:05:26.850> know<00:05:28.190> moving<00:05:29.190> on<00:05:29.340> um<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:30.330> also

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
is for I don't know moving on um it also

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.760 
is for I don't know moving on um it also
interacts<00:05:32.880> with<00:05:33.060> your<00:05:33.350> accelerometers<00:05:34.350> so<00:05:34.590> if

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
interacts with your accelerometers so if

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.200 
interacts with your accelerometers so if
you'll<00:05:34.890> watch<00:05:35.100> this<00:05:35.310> little<00:05:35.460> gray<00:05:35.670> box<00:05:35.940> down

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
you'll watch this little gray box down

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.970 
you'll watch this little gray box down
here<00:05:36.240> as<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.750> move<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.410> left<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:37.890> the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
here as I move it to the left and to the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.060 
here as I move it to the left and to the
right<00:05:38.100> it<00:05:38.610> actually<00:05:39.210> moves<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:40.770> can<00:05:40.920> also

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
right it actually moves you can also

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.770 
right it actually moves you can also
switch<00:05:41.490> some<00:05:41.730> options<00:05:42.060> around<00:05:42.270> so<00:05:42.540> that<00:05:42.570> you

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
switch some options around so that you

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.630 
switch some options around so that you
can<00:05:42.930> tilt<00:05:43.140> it<00:05:43.350> back<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.860> forth<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:44.370> do<00:05:44.490> other

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
can tilt it back and forth and do other

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.780 
can tilt it back and forth and do other
stuff<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.680> does<00:05:46.860> cool<00:05:47.070> stuff<00:05:47.280> for<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.580> but

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
stuff and it does cool stuff for you but

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.950 
stuff and it does cool stuff for you but
I<00:05:47.970> don't<00:05:48.090> know<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.360> point<00:05:48.660> of<00:05:48.780> that

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
I don't know the point of that

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.040 
I don't know the point of that
nevertheless<00:05:49.820> it's<00:05:50.820> kind<00:05:51.000> of<00:05:51.030> neat<00:05:51.240> now

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050

nevertheless it's kind of neat now
there's<00:05:52.260> also<00:05:52.440> some<00:05:52.710> options<00:05:53.130> in<00:05:53.250> there<00:05:53.400> where

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
there's also some options in there where

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.640 
there's also some options in there where
you<00:05:53.700> can<00:05:53.730> customize<00:05:54.480> these<00:05:54.870> buttons<00:05:55.290> on<00:05:55.530> the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
you can customize these buttons on the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.020 
you can customize these buttons on the
screen<00:05:55.770> so<00:05:55.980> for<00:05:56.400> instance<00:05:56.460> I've<00:05:56.700> already<00:05:56.820> gone

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
you can see this is the warp core if you

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.450 
you can see this is the warp core if you
guys<00:06:24.780> are<00:06:24.930> familiar<00:06:25.020> with<00:06:25.440> Star<00:06:25.860> Trek<00:06:26.160> get<00:06:26.340> all

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
this is the warp core starts yoooo at

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.110 
this is the warp core starts yoooo at
warp<00:06:31.200> speed<00:06:31.380> one<00:06:31.830> and<00:06:32.100> all<00:06:32.550> you<00:06:32.700> have<00:06:32.820> to<00:06:32.940> do

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
warp speed one and all you have to do

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.200 
warp speed one and all you have to do
come<00:06:33.990> on<00:06:34.110> increase<00:06:34.470> yeah<00:06:35.460> I'll<00:06:35.729> have<00:06:35.880> to<00:06:36.030> go

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
come on increase yeah I'll have to go

come on increase yeah I'll have to go
like<00:06:36.330> that<00:06:36.450> in

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
like that in

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.969 
like that in
increase<00:06:38.810> and<00:06:39.810> as<00:06:40.110> you<00:06:40.229> can<00:06:40.349> see<00:06:40.379> it<00:06:40.710> starts

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
increase and as you can see it starts

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.700 
increase and as you can see it starts
going<00:06:41.129> up<00:06:41.430> now<00:06:41.610> its<00:06:41.789> warp<00:06:41.969> speed<00:06:42.270> 5.0<00:06:43.110> the

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
going up now its warp speed 5.0 the

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.670 
going up now its warp speed 5.0 the
animation<00:06:44.460> is<00:06:44.789> interacting<00:06:45.779> we<00:06:46.139> can<00:06:46.289> go<00:06:46.409> all

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
animation is interacting we can go all

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.879 
animation is interacting we can go all
the<00:06:46.860> way<00:06:46.889> up<00:06:47.069> i<00:06:47.219> believe<00:06:49.729> 29.9<00:06:50.729> and<00:06:51.770> you<00:06:52.770> can

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
the way up i believe 29.9 and you can

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.649 
the way up i believe 29.9 and you can
see<00:06:53.039> it<00:06:53.099> goes<00:06:53.219> all<00:06:53.430> crazy<00:06:53.460> there<00:06:53.969> as<00:06:54.360> well<00:06:54.569> as

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
see it goes all crazy there as well as

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:56.330 
see it goes all crazy there as well as
if<00:06:54.779> you<00:06:54.870> just<00:06:55.050> double<00:06:55.319> tap<00:06:55.529> anywhere<00:06:55.979> on<00:06:56.129> the

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
if you just double tap anywhere on the

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.010 
if you just double tap anywhere on the
screen<00:06:56.490> it<00:06:56.819> changes<00:06:57.419> the<00:06:57.539> buttons<00:06:57.870> around

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
screen it changes the buttons around

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.629 
screen it changes the buttons around
slightly<00:06:58.529> I'm<00:06:58.800> not<00:06:58.949> what<00:06:59.099> you<00:06:59.219> what<00:06:59.340> the<00:06:59.430> point

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
slightly I'm not what you what the point

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.189 
slightly I'm not what you what the point
of<00:06:59.819> that<00:06:59.969> is<00:07:00.180> but<00:07:00.389> I<00:07:00.419> guess<00:07:00.629> if<00:07:00.779> you<00:07:00.870> just<00:07:01.050> like

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
of that is but I guess if you just like

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.749 
of that is but I guess if you just like
a<00:07:01.229> different<00:07:01.680> I<00:07:01.860> don't<00:07:02.400> know<00:07:02.460> color

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
a different I don't know color
