00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
anything that doesn't work for me so I

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.470 
anything that doesn't work for me so I
can't<00:03:04.070> invite<00:03:04.400> on<00:03:04.700> anything<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.180> doesn't

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.090 
can't invite on anything that doesn't
work<00:03:05.690> for<00:03:05.720> me<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.290> would<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.500> kind<00:03:06.799> of<00:03:06.859> silly

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
work for me that would be kind of silly

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.960 
work for me that would be kind of silly
but<00:03:07.459> if<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.209> works<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.630> fine<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.790> might

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
but if it works for you fine you might

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.340 
but if it works for you fine you might
want<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.239> try<00:03:11.390> cuz<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.840> know<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.170> whole

want to try cuz you know this whole

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.259 
want to try cuz you know this whole
thing<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:13.340> know<00:03:13.430> that's<00:03:13.609> why<00:03:13.730> they<00:03:13.850> call<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.120> a

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
thing you know that's why they call it a

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.740 
thing you know that's why they call it a
journey<00:03:15.400> because<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.670> process

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
journey because of the process

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.430 
journey because of the process
you<00:03:19.380> know<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.990> kind<00:03:21.990> of<00:03:22.110> try

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
you know you have to kind of try

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.550 
you know you have to kind of try
different<00:03:22.830> things<00:03:22.890> up<00:03:23.450> now<00:03:24.450> when<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.930> finish

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
side of prints or made the solution and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.770 
side of prints or made the solution and
then<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:03.260> Nexus<00:04:04.610> humectant<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.780> detail

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
then the Nexus humectant I detail

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.860 
then the Nexus humectant I detail
everything<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.800> do<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:08.280> then<00:04:09.060> at<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.360> end<00:04:09.390> i

everything I do and then at the end i

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.440 
everything I do and then at the end i
write<00:04:10.230> like<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:11.190> like<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.459> journal<00:04:11.910> entry<00:04:12.000> so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
write like it's like a journal entry so

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.550 
write like it's like a journal entry so
it'll<00:04:13.320> is<00:04:13.500> real<00:04:14.160> brief<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:15.090> mean<00:04:15.360> it's<00:04:15.540> no<00:04:15.780> I'm

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
it'll is real brief I mean it's no I'm

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.979 
it'll is real brief I mean it's no I'm
not<00:04:16.850> making<00:04:17.850> sure<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.150> punctuation<00:04:18.540> is

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
not making sure the punctuation is

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.039 
not making sure the punctuation is
correcting<00:04:19.560> everything<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.370> like<00:04:21.049> cars

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
correcting everything is like cars

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.090 
correcting everything is like cars
period<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.700> might<00:04:24.240> even<00:04:24.270> put<00:04:24.630> feel<00:04:24.930> very<00:04:25.710> you

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
period I might even put feel very you

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.710 
period I might even put feel very you
know<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.940> um<00:04:27.330> but<00:04:28.080> but<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.919> helps<00:04:29.220> me<00:04:29.720> track

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
know so um but but this helps me track

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.540 
know so um but but this helps me track
what<00:04:31.229> works<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.740> what<00:04:31.830> doesn't<00:04:31.919> work<00:04:32.280> now

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
what works and what doesn't work now

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.920 
what works and what doesn't work now
today<00:04:32.970> I'm<00:04:33.150> using<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.510> different<00:04:33.870> method

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
today I'm using a different method

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.640 
today I'm using a different method
because<00:04:34.580> I've<00:04:35.580> been<00:04:35.640> trying<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.150> minimize<00:04:36.720> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.219 

the<00:04:40.650> shedding<00:04:41.450> because<00:04:42.450> I<00:04:42.570> do<00:04:42.630> get<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.990> lot<00:04:43.169> of

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
the shedding because I do get a lot of

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.050 
the shedding because I do get a lot of
shedding<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.340> I'm<00:04:44.460> doing<00:04:44.790> something

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
shedding so I'm doing something

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.240 
shedding so I'm doing something
different<00:04:45.330> I'm<00:04:45.630> co-washing<00:04:46.320> from<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.950> braid

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
different I'm co-washing from a braid

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.219 
different I'm co-washing from a braid
out<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.700> don't<00:04:48.300> care<00:04:48.450> what's<00:04:48.690> going<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:49.110> I

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
out I don't care what's going on I

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.210 
out I don't care what's going on I
normally<00:04:49.500> just<00:04:49.680> just<00:04:50.370> just<00:04:50.910> wash<00:04:51.260> but<00:04:52.260> um<00:04:52.830> you

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
normally just just just wash but um you

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.150 
normally just just just wash but um you
know<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:54.000> definition<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.960> insanity<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.770> you

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
know the definition of insanity is you

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.040 
know the definition of insanity is you
keep<00:04:56.430> doing<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.790> same<00:04:56.820> thing<00:04:57.300> are<00:04:57.930> you

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
keep doing the same thing are you

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.960 
keep doing the same thing are you
getting<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.320> same<00:04:58.530> results<00:04:58.890> now<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.310> haven't

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
getting the same results now I haven't

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.070 
getting the same results now I haven't
gotten<00:05:00.300> this<00:05:00.479> many<00:05:00.780> knots<00:05:02.090> now<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:03.930> know

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
gotten this many knots now that I know

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.390 
gotten this many knots now that I know
better<00:05:04.530> but<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.580> still<00:05:05.610> get<00:05:06.479> them<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:07.160> i<00:05:08.160> don't

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
better but I still get them and i don't

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.710 
better but I still get them and i don't
like<00:05:08.490> them<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.640> I<00:05:11.910> definitely<00:05:12.330> want<00:05:12.660> to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
like them and so I definitely want to

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.680 
like them and so I definitely want to
minimize<00:05:13.080> any<00:05:13.470> not<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:14.970> I<00:05:15.060> could<00:05:15.240> potentially

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
minimize any not so I could potentially

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.810 
minimize any not so I could potentially
get<00:05:15.870> because<00:05:16.290> that<00:05:16.500> means<00:05:16.710> breakage<00:05:17.610> because

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
get because that means breakage because

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.500 
get because that means breakage because
obviously<00:05:18.000> when<00:05:18.390> you're<00:05:18.540> here

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
obviously when you're here

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.350 
obviously when you're here
is<00:05:20.600> that<00:05:20.900> it's<00:05:21.230> in<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:22.730> most<00:05:23.000> fragile

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
is that it's in it the most fragile
