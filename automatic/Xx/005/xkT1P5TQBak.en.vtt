 Carefully not slowed down 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.189
 finally forget this tempo nonsense 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.420
 Damn it to me to live 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.970

 the wretched reality an existence 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.939

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.570

 I am leaded and this is mine 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.650
 I'm fast as a shadow though 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.940
 shadows are not fast 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.980
 more quickly 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.330
 I still see you at a tempo 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.520

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.870

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.340
 is not a sugar lick 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.930
 we have to switch off the machines 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.920
 before the night leave the island 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.920
