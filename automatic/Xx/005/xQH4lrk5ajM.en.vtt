some residue from the sticker on my fit
vf1<00:00:27.859> relatively<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.490> couple<00:00:29.820> months

like four months I've had this bike only

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
like four months I've had this bike only
thing<00:00:35.430> I've<00:00:35.550> done<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> taking<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
thing I've done to it is taking the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.400 
thing I've done to it is taking the
breaks<00:00:36.870> off

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.960 

just<00:00:40.150> change<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.270> grips<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.320> got<00:00:42.650> some<00:00:43.239> sorry

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
just change the grips I got some sorry

just change the grips I got some sorry
just<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.660> food<00:00:46.870> check<00:00:47.110> out<00:00:47.290> some<00:00:47.500> on<00:00:49.500> DK<00:00:50.500> like

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
just the food check out some on DK like

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.350 
just the food check out some on DK like
grips<00:00:51.700> decays<00:00:52.240> schuko<00:00:52.660> grips<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.170> their

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
grips decays schuko grips on their

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.490 
grips decays schuko grips on their
softer<00:00:55.360> than<00:00:55.540> what<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:55.750> had<00:00:55.930> and<00:00:56.080> I<00:00:56.140> like<00:00:56.320> I'm

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
softer than what I had and I like I'm

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.220 
softer than what I had and I like I'm
kind<00:00:56.770> of<00:00:56.830> soft<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.340> that's<00:00:57.550> pretty<00:00:57.760> good<00:00:58.230> but

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
kind of soft so that's pretty good but

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.320 
kind of soft so that's pretty good but
let's<00:00:59.410> get<00:00:59.530> on<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.830> tutorial<00:01:01.650> down<00:01:02.650> here

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
let's get on to the tutorial down here

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.859 
let's get on to the tutorial down here
so<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:04.390> can<00:01:04.510> see<00:01:04.720> there<00:01:05.440> is<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.760> residue

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
so you can see there is the residue

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.080 
so you can see there is the residue
in<00:01:08.929> what<00:01:09.229> we're<00:01:09.320> gonna<00:01:09.409> do<00:01:09.789> things<00:01:10.789> are<00:01:11.000> gonna

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
in what we're gonna do things are gonna

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.419 
in what we're gonna do things are gonna
get<00:01:11.299> real<00:01:12.460> good<00:01:13.689> rag<00:01:14.979> probably<00:01:15.979> be<00:01:16.070> better<00:01:16.280> if

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
get real good rag probably be better if

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:17.859 
get real good rag probably be better if
it<00:01:16.490> was<00:01:16.609> clean<00:01:16.939> but<00:01:17.119> I<00:01:17.179> don't<00:01:17.329> have<00:01:17.479> any<00:01:17.630> clean

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
it was clean but I don't have any clean

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.980 
it was clean but I don't have any clean
ones<00:01:18.079> so<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:18.679> one<00:01:18.859> will<00:01:18.979> do<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.060> uh<00:01:20.359> plain

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
ones so this one will do and uh plain

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.980 
ones so this one will do and uh plain
old<00:01:21.200> wd-40<00:01:22.039> don't<00:01:22.670> need<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:22.939> nozzle<00:01:23.719> or

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
old wd-40 don't need a nozzle or

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.529 
old wd-40 don't need a nozzle or
