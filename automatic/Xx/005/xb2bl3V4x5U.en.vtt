Nail string art

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.080
Hi Guys, how are you?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.400
Today I'm here to teach you
how to make this Nail String Art

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.220
Made with wood, nail and thread

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.060
It's gorgeous and gives a
super different effect to your wall!

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.760
The materials you will need
to make this frame are:

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.660
A piece of walnut wood
(I used the size 30 x 30 cm)

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.660
Transparent varnish for wood

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.660
masking tape

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.660
Set of thin nails

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.160
Brush and Hammer

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.860
Line in the color of your choice

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.980
sulfite sheet, scissors and Pencils

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.540
Start the work by folding the paper
because my drawing is symmetrical

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.860
here I have a A3 size sheet, but if
you don't have one you just join two sheets A4 size

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.860
now I will do the drawing of the frame

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.520
Chose to make a heart,
but you can choose any way you want

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.420
including writing letters, names and 
phrases or anything you want

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.320
I I lined my table with a plastic tablecloth 
because I don't want to risk ruining it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.400
Before you start preaching

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.300
the first thing you will do is brush the
varnish across the surface of your wooden frame

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.020
It must be clean so that the varnish is secure
and give a beautiful shine to your frame

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.400
Be careful when Brush this varnish
because it stain, so do it in a lined surface

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.760
It's simple, just pass the varnish 
on the entire surface of timber

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.040
the smell of the varnish is strong 
then open the windows before passing it

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.000
then put your art to dry 
in an outdoor area or near a window

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.940
I'll varnish only the front 
and the sides of my frame

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.580
I will not do in the back because 
it will be hidden by the wall 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.720
Saw how it changed the look of the picture?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.420
It is rustic and beautiful only through the varnish

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.700
When buying wood in the shop

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.340
ask to leave the wood as smooth as possible 
because it facilitated your work

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.720
Now that our frame is dry 
we ca begin to make the design

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.940
I will take the paper cut heart
and stick it with tape to not come unglued

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.300
Now I'll nailing with the hammer some major points

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.820
Here in the junction and down here

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060
two points up here

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.720
and two points in the side

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.220
now just preach the nails carefully 
a finger distance

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.840
To fill the entire perimeter of the drawing 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.600
Remove the tape when you get close to it, 
so it won't stick to the nails!

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.760
Now that I finished preaching 
let's take off the heart 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.340
and this part has no secrets, secure the line 
with a knot and start braiding the line in nails

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.360
I will start by the middle of the heart 
and make the design go-and-back on the nails

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.520
when you done filling 
finalize knotting up

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.060
And our design is already done!

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:39.200
Measure the median point behind the frame

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:48.520
And attach the hook to hang on the wall

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.520
Now that the project is done, go to the blog 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.920
