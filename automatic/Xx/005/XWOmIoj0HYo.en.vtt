neither painting or sculpture because it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.609 
neither painting or sculpture because it
leans<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> wall<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> wall<00:01:31.200> like

leans on the wall it is on the wall like

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.460 
leans on the wall it is on the wall like
a<00:01:31.680> painting<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.090> also<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.140> floor

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
a painting but it's also on the floor

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.999 
a painting but it's also on the floor
like<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> sculpture<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.590> room<00:01:37.799> we

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
like a like a sculpture in this room we

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.389 
like a like a sculpture in this room we
see<00:01:38.299> mainly<00:01:39.299> art<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:41.520> historically

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
see mainly art which is historically
