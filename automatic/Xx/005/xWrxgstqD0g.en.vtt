00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.910
 this site is a new video in this 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.830
 occasion is I bring another application this 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.170
 it's a kind of game where the idea 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.179
 general is deciphering the name of the 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.650
 new ones that appear that is to say they put you 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.539
 sides of brands and you have to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.490
 decipher the name of that brand the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.740
 true that this is very entertaining 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.150
 game was recommended to me by this user and the 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.220
 I really liked that they have the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.599
 free version and the normal version and the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.340
 The only thing that changes is that the 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.019
 free version has some ads 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.550
 and in the paid version it gives you the option 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.380
 to have more opportunities to 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.270
 mistake that part right now I was giving 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.310
 understand better but let's see how 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.190
 the application works simply 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.440
 we give here in playing and as you see here 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.360
 a brand appears then you're from 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.000
 general electric for example and that's 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 from here 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.230
 and here so simple for example my 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.930
 highest score to 173 and every time here 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.330
 it tells us 49 and squeezing the nodes 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.890
 we can jump and it gives us the option of 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.320
 put fewer selections then gives us 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.020
 the option of coca-cola or said names is 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.640
 coca cola for example here is water but 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.990
 also for example if I'm wrong and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.960
 I put comcast 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.610
 will give me the option that I can 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.070
 continue the game 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.130
 occupying 5 errors then we are going to 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.470
 occupy and someone will take away 5 but 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.630
 we keep playing well in brand of everything 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.689
 type for example if not cell phone 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.369
 from the USA and you have to go 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.280
 deciphering the wolves in some 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.649
 only the contour appears in 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 some only appears to them that 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.640
 some letters then and it goes away 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.229
 turning very fun and good there 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.420
 some brands that really are not very 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.789
 known here in america simply in 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.069
 us for global transition by 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.700
 example to burger king 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.680
 safeway 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.689
 not if it's a matter of knowing a 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 little of brands the truth that has a 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.159
 great variety I do not have to repeat myself 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.079
 none and entertaining this crazy game in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.789
 rooms with your friends and another thing is 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.950
 that maybe this mark is not so 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.869
 example does not need a brand to be able to 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.549
 take off inducing a bit since here we 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.350
 the letters then appear the only 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.090
 how aware I am here the truth that 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.989
 they are very funny the game do not doubt 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.150
 to prove it 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.099
 I loved many thanks to this 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.420
 left user recommended and this was 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.420
 we all see each other next video
