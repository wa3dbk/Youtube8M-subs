00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
400 450 degrees to do that I usually

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.200 
400 450 degrees to do that I usually
start<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> pan<00:01:10.740> covered<00:01:11.250> let<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> heat

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
up then uncover it before I remove the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.030 
up then uncover it before I remove the
thermometer<00:01:15.320> I'm<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> hot<00:01:17.009> pad

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
thermometer I'm going to use a hot pad

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649

to<00:01:17.430> remove<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> thermometer<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> don't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to remove the thermometer so I don't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.710 
to remove the thermometer so I don't
burn<00:01:18.810> myself<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:20.400> nice<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.850> spoon

burn myself and a nice little spoon

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.830 
burn myself and a nice little spoon
round<00:01:22.049> works<00:01:22.560> great<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> next<00:01:24.659> step

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
round works great for that the next step

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.740 
round works great for that the next step
is<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> take<00:01:25.320> my<00:01:25.500> half<00:01:25.710> pound<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.189> coffee

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
important to the ham they even reach

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
important to the ham they even reach
help<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> evenly<00:01:30.450> covers<00:01:30.930> bottoms<00:01:31.740> in

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
help so that it evenly covers bottoms in

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
help so that it evenly covers bottoms in
want<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> make<00:01:32.820> sure<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.119> nice<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.329> even<00:01:33.840> and

over<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> heat<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.460> close<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.180> I'm<00:01:52.110> going

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
over the heat or close to it I'm going

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.980 
over the heat or close to it I'm going
to<00:01:52.320> keep<00:01:52.500> moving

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
to keep moving

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.649 
to keep moving
so<00:01:53.620> that<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.920> never<00:01:54.100> settles<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:54.970> spot<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
so that it never settles in one spot and

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.810 
so that it never settles in one spot and
so<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.020> will<00:01:56.200> burn<00:01:56.440> as<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.310> can<00:01:57.460> see<00:01:57.640> the

Bob<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:32.289> think<00:04:32.620> that's<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.099> best<00:04:33.280> way<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.550> do<00:04:33.760> it

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
Bob I think that's the best way to do it

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
but you can do it inside the strainer

will force some of the chaps to fall to
the<00:04:38.440> floor<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.889> might<00:04:39.160> make<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.370> bit<00:04:39.550> of<00:04:39.639> a<00:04:39.699> mess
