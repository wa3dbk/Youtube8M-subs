00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.010
 and with friends as are the greetings 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.950
 doubles welcome again to my channel 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.490
 now I bring you what would be a boxing 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.410
 and review of a speaker or speaker of the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.910
 company coaching the truth that has 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.189
 left surprised what is this is 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.949
 spicy that is well portable since it is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.099
 small and apart from that it also counts 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.769
 with what it would be to connect him explain 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.899
 even a you esb and the truth that is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.600
 pretty good and what I like the most is 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.660
 the price as it offers quite 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.540
 functions for a reasonable price of 59 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.860
 dollars with 99 cents there is also a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 discount that in the description does not 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 can check which one at the end of this 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 video let's get it out of here so that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.050
 you can see it much better 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.699
 let's start looking for what would be me 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.960
 I imagine that below this are what 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.820
 is the cable the guide and the instructions 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.710
 and I also imagine that the cable that already 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.619
 they bring to connect it to what it would be 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.480
 our phone we are going to take out what I 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.590
 it's costing a little 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.860
 ok let's go here they have to go out let's see 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.160
 if there they are as they can see there they are 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.470
 the two cables the usb and the other for 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.450
 put it the one in the 3.5 entry for 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.510
 can put it to what is ours 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.400
 phone or any other device besides 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.260
 that's how I told them the truth that I 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.880
 like since it is not so big 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.250
 Now I'm going to teach you a little bit 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.040
 better from various angles so that you 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.440
 see that it is very portable and also the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.480
 Battery life is from 5 hours to 6 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.790
 as you can see there back we see that 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.060
 they have the two inputs and the usb and about 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.220
 all the card that is something innovative 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.070
 apart from that it also brings what is a 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.860
 is a built-in microphone so that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.330
 we can answer calls when we go 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.850
 to do some tests for you 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.800
 can see how it sounds right now 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.090
 let's connect connect very simple 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.400
 that we do not need more than to light 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.320
 our bluetooth and hope that the 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.660
 phone there as you can see 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.510
 really this device is very simple 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.790
 it detects it but very fast so no 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.380
 we would have no problem connecting it 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.700
 we hear a beep 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.340
 and that's what it means that the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.350
 phone is already connected let's go too 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.230
 let's do some audio tests 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.690
 although I will be honest I can not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 ensure that you hear the best 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.740
 because you can see that it's maybe because 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.660
 microphone quality of the camera but 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.320
 well let's hope and you can 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.320
 listen 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.230
 Y 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.190
 Y 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.610
 good friends the truth that has 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.300
 convinced enough in what would be the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.100
 sound of this speaker or speaker 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.100
 I really recommend it and they already have 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.840
 an idea of ​​what sound is like 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.720
 I said at the beginning of the video here is a 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.420
 code what they would have 10% discount 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.210
