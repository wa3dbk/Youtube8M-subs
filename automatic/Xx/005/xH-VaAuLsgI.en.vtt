is definitely the way to go anyway um
that<00:05:23.270> said<00:05:23.539> you<00:05:23.930> know<00:05:24.050> sometimes<00:05:24.469> it's<00:05:24.620> nice

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
that said you know sometimes it's nice

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.320 
that said you know sometimes it's nice
to<00:05:24.800> just<00:05:24.919> kick<00:05:25.189> back<00:05:25.219> with<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:25.699> controller<00:05:26.090> and

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
play and so for that console is a little

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.260 
play and so for that console is a little
better<00:05:29.750> especially<00:05:30.080> with<00:05:30.620> its<00:05:30.969> you<00:05:31.969> know<00:05:32.090> and
