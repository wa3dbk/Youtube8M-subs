00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.490
 thing that we can also do is 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.389
 disable the the screensaver 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 regularly, what are you going to do about 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.040
 putting the mouse over the text of the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.680
 desktop and you're going to customize 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.539
 or will it be to the properties if you're 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.740
 in windows xp and you will see once a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.740
 little girl who is going to say 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.720
 screensaver or things like that not here in this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.329
 case we are going to do it where it says 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.010
 we'll see 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:46.460
 because you're going to do it where it says 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.229
 screensaver I in this case appears 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.960
 this symbol because I do not have it 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.909
 activated then you will deactivate another 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 very important thing that we can also 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.100
 do to improve stability 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.510
 of our computer is to make it a 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.879
 clean up 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 a cleaning this this disc clean up 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.180
 or cleaning the disc 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.490
 practically it serves you to erase things 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.860
 in your machine as cookies are 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.610
 cookies and many things I'll tell you 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.700
 how I did it 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.340
 in windows vista or windows 7 nothing more 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.460
 you write clean up 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.250
 or disk cleanup and automatically you 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.679
 it's going to look like if you have windows xp you're going 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.790
 to go to all the programs is going to be 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:37.440
 accessories 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.570
 you're going to go where it says there are tools or 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.190
 system tools and there you will see 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.280
 the disk link up ok you're going to open it and 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.620
 you are going to select the drive in this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.950
 case you know that the most computers 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.700
 recent bring 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.829
 a partition where the system comes 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.049
 operative because in this case the cce is 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.700
 where we have the operating system and 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.360
 all our programs and there we go 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.360
 to give ok 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.120
 once this window appears you 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.620
 we are going to select all this all that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.620
 I will also erase you from the trash can 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.640
 and we give it to erase 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.050
 in this way you are releasing your 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.420
 machine of things that you do not use and 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.209
 especially we will give you more 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.269
 speed now let's do it since 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.940
 we finished deleting all the files 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.450
 they do not deal with now we're going to go to 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.650
 do 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.490
 a fragment that in Spanish would be like 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.940
 defrag your hard drive 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.200
 in windows xp we are going to do it 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.470
 same way in existing accessories and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.780
 here you will see fragment in windows 7 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.740
 and in view then nothing else you put 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.740
 de frank de fragment in Spanish is 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.740
 defrag 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.440
 you are going to select 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.990
 the cce and you do not give him to analyze you go 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.990
 to give to do the process once 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.049
 in this case I will not do it but you 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.480
 you're going to leave it doing all night 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.500
 Sometimes it can take an hour two hours 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.690
 three hours depends ok 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.290
 another point and the last one that I'm going to 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.450
 to mention so that your machine is 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.230
 exactly as you need it is that 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.310
 have an antivirus installed but that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.290
 antivirus that is not so heavy I 'm going to 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.540
 give an example 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.239
 for example some machines come with 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.040
 a sample of this system this 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.040
 antivirus called norton 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.790
 I personally do not use norton 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.700
 because it makes my computer very slow 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.700
 especially when the prendo takes 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.480
 I do not know what is due and that 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.340
 program has so many things that already each 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.990
 while it is updating that same me 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.160
 despair in its entirety 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.400
 then I 'm going to recommend a 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.360
 antivirus that not many people know 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.960
 it's called microsoft security essentials 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.340
 this 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.580
 antivirus is very very good and let me 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.610
 tell you it's from Microsoft but you know 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.340
 what is the best that is free 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.699
 how are we going to find it we are going to go 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.699
 to google 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.990
 and we're going to write microsoft 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.620
 security essentials 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.190
 and the first one that will seem to you is the 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.560
 website of them 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.969
 and here you will be able to download it even 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.449
 it comes in several languages 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.610
 let's put Spanish and if you select 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.639
 the type of operating system that you have 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.980
 if you have shakespeare windows 7 of 32 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:21.550
 bits or 64 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.000
 and you install the only requirement that 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.620
 you need to be able to complete 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.390
 correctly installing this from 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.780
 this software is that your system 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:35.140
 operative is legitimate if you are 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.480
 using one that was pirate or what 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.120
 you bought out there and have a serial 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.400
 name that you got on the internet does not 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.180
 it's going to work because you're going to bali 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.130
 to validate the serial name of your from your 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.290
 operating system so if your machine 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.990
 already came with the operating system then 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.770
 well this is to be sure that the serial 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:00.529
 name then it is legitimate then it goes to 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.740
 pass the validation test 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.110
 and well 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.780
 I gave you practically all the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.729
 necessary tools for you 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.349
 machine is perfectly 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.990
 when you have an event and when 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:18.099
 use thickened software such as peace and 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.300
 dj or virtual dj or even programs for 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.690
 edit video 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.210
