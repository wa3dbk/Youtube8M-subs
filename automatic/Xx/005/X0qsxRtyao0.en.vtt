we have six screws removed the little

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
we have six screws removed the little
just<00:00:37.380> come<00:00:37.530> off<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> top<00:00:38.010> let's<00:00:38.430> lift<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.760> off

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
just come off the top let's lift it off

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.990 
just come off the top let's lift it off
white<00:00:39.120> star<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:41.280> panel<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.760> holds

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
white star and the back panel that holds

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.990 
white star and the back panel that holds
the<00:00:42.120> battery<00:00:42.420> will<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.930> follow<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.219> move

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the battery will just follow it so move

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.279 
the battery will just follow it so move
all<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:47.329> peel<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
all that out the way and peel it you it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.660 
all that out the way and peel it you it
closed<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.280> probably<00:00:53.489> best

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
closed here this way it's probably best

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.139 
closed here this way it's probably best
you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.020> button<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.149> this

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you can see this little button here this

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.580 
you can see this little button here this
is<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> drive<00:00:57.629> sensible<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.350> when<00:00:58.469> it's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
is a drive sensible and so when it's

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.560 
is a drive sensible and so when it's
back<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.489> unit<00:00:59.760> thinks<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:00.270> closed

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
back the unit thinks on that's closed

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.959 
back the unit thinks on that's closed
right<00:01:01.440> its<00:01:01.559> forward<00:01:01.980> unit<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> lids

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
right its forward unit think the lids

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.149 
right its forward unit think the lids
open<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.500> secure<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.070> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
open so we're just going to secure it in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.590 
open so we're just going to secure it in
the<00:01:05.250> closed<00:01:05.519> position<00:01:05.549> with<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> bit<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.390> an

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the closed position with a bit of an

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.510 
the closed position with a bit of an
electrical<00:01:07.200> tape<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:08.040> could<00:01:08.189> use<00:01:08.310> hot<00:01:08.490> glue

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
electrical tape you could use hot glue

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
electrical tape you could use hot glue
but<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> temporary

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
but this is just going to be a temporary

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.780 
but this is just going to be a temporary
fix<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.830> mates<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> mod

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
fix for mates I'm going to get a mod

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
fix for mates I'm going to get a mod
chip<00:01:12.030> soon<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.560> use<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.680> small

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
chip soon so I was going to use a small

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
chip soon so I was going to use a small
bit<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.100> tip<00:01:15.860> about<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.390> only<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> small

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
bit of tip about this much only a small

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.359 
bit of tip about this much only a small
amount<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.860> we're<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:22.280> oggle<00:01:23.280> we

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
amount and we're just going to oggle we

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.840 
amount and we're just going to oggle we
can<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:25.189> hold<00:01:26.189> us<00:01:26.340> back<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
can see like that hold us back in the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.430 
can see like that hold us back in the
the<00:01:27.210> closed<00:01:27.540> position

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.130 

so<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.120> do<00:01:33.300> a<00:01:33.330> disk<00:01:33.630> swap<00:01:33.900> on

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
so that then we can do a disk swap on

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.170 
so that then we can do a disk swap on
the<00:01:34.860> unit<00:01:35.100> i<00:01:35.130> think<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.460> closed<00:01:35.730> when<00:01:36.030> it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the unit i think it's closed when it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.570 
the unit i think it's closed when it's
actually<00:01:36.630> open<00:01:37.140> them<00:01:37.230> with<00:01:37.350> walking<00:01:37.650> disks

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.070 

all<00:01:44.580> right<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.150> see<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> secured<00:01:45.900> that

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
all right so if we see a secured that

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.650 
all right so if we see a secured that
one<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.490> work<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.480> we're<00:01:48.570> going

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
one down there work it what we're going

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.630 
one down there work it what we're going
to<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.260> just<00:01:49.350> give<00:01:50.160> the<00:01:50.250> units<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
to do now is just give the units and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
to do now is just give the units and
power<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:52.670> just<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.760> see<00:01:53.910> this<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.470> is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
power and just to see this that is

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
power and just to see this that is
actually<00:01:55.830> working<00:01:56.040> before<00:01:56.340> we<00:01:56.580> begin<00:01:56.910> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
actually working before we begin to

actually working before we begin to
reassemble<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> let<00:01:58.650> me<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.360> again<00:02:00.510> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
reassemble so let me just so again this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.250 
reassemble so let me just so again this
power<00:02:00.870> cable<00:02:01.260> here<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.690> is<00:02:03.780> pump<00:02:04.020> at<00:02:04.140> your

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
power cable here so this is pump at your

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.120 
power cable here so this is pump at your
skin<00:02:04.490> sega<00:02:05.490> rally<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.910> hit<00:02:06.420> power<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.070> the

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
skin sega rally and hit power and if the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.130 
skin sega rally and hit power and if the
disc<00:02:08.310> spins<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.360> doing<00:02:09.480> there<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
disc spins like it's doing there it
