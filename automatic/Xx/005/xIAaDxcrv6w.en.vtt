created a sprite and an object for a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.830 
created a sprite and an object for a
bullet<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.460> simple<00:00:20.880> round

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
to want to do on this is give it one
event<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.140> add<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> man<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> go<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> other<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> I

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
event so I add a man I go to other and I

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900 
event so I add a man I go to other and I
put<00:00:33.540> outside<00:00:34.110> room<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> bullet

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
put outside room so that if the bullet

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
put outside room so that if the bullet
goes<00:00:36.149> outside<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> room<00:00:37.010> I'll<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
goes outside the room I'll go to the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.130 
goes outside the room I'll go to the
main<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.760> tab<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> destroy

main one tab and I want it to destroy

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.790 
main one tab and I want it to destroy
itself

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
itself

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.549 
itself
so<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.160> print<00:00:41.489> destroy<00:00:42.390> itself<00:00:42.960> that's<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so I print destroy itself that's all the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.430 
so I print destroy itself that's all the
bullets<00:00:43.890> gonna<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.809> we're<00:00:45.809> gonna<00:00:45.870> create<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
bullets gonna do we're gonna create the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.069 
bullets gonna do we're gonna create the
bullet<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.489> boy<00:00:47.670> object<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.840> we're<00:00:48.989> gonna

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
bullet in the boy object so we're gonna

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.660 
bullet in the boy object so we're gonna
go<00:00:49.260> back<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.559> character's<00:00:50.010> object<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
go back to your character's object and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.920 
go back to your character's object and
we're<00:00:50.879> gonna<00:00:50.969> add<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.770> couple<00:00:52.770> things<00:00:53.930> number

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
we're gonna add a couple things number

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
we're gonna add a couple things number
one<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:56.129> gonna<00:00:56.190> add<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> create<00:00:56.820> event

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
one we're gonna add a create event

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.549 
one we're gonna add a create event
because<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> use<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> variable

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
because we have to use a variable

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.910 
because we have to use a variable
miscalled<00:00:59.160> facing<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.649> gonna<00:01:01.739> go

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
miscalled facing and so we're gonna go

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740 
miscalled facing and so we're gonna go
to<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> control<00:01:02.370> tab<00:01:02.550> drag<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> set

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to the control tab drag in a set

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.140 
to the control tab drag in a set
variable<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:05.100> gonna<00:01:05.189> call<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.580> variable

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
variable we're gonna call this variable

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.469 
variable we're gonna call this variable
facing<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.820> ahead<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.030> give<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.299> value

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
facing and go ahead and give it a value

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.740 
facing and go ahead and give it a value
of<00:01:09.689> zero<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.060> how<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.240> declare

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
of zero for now this is how we declare

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
of zero for now this is how we declare
our<00:01:12.960> variable<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.590> set<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.340> can

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
our variable or we set it up so we can

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.870 
our variable or we set it up so we can
use<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.270> object<00:01:16.100> now<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.790> we're

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
use it in the object now what we're

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.640 
use it in the object now what we're
gonna<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> spacing<00:01:19.290> variables

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
gonna do and with the spacing variables

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260 
gonna do and with the spacing variables
we're<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.159> change<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.820> face<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
we're going to change the face and

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.660 
we're going to change the face and
variable<00:01:21.540> every<00:01:21.659> time<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.200> press<00:01:22.500> either<00:01:23.400> left

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
variable every time we press either left

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.789 
variable every time we press either left
up<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.360> down<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.409> quickest<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
up right or down so the quickest way to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.520 
up right or down so the quickest way to
do<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> copy<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.350> we're<00:01:28.350> going

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
do this is to copy this and we're going

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.980 
do this is to copy this and we're going
to<00:01:28.590> paste<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.460> left<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.960> left

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
to paste it in to the left the left

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.499 
to paste it in to the left the left
event<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.729> left<00:01:35.939> event<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> press

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
event so the left event want to press

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
event so the left event want to press
the<00:01:36.659> left<00:01:36.869> arrow<00:01:37.079> key<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.590> wants<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.009> facing

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the left arrow key he wants to be facing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.719 
the left arrow key he wants to be facing
the<00:01:39.000> left<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.680> way<00:01:40.860> GameMaker<00:01:41.400> keeps

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the left so the way GameMaker keeps

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.170 
the left so the way GameMaker keeps
track<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.860> direction<00:01:44.399> you're<00:01:44.520> facing<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
track of the direction you're facing is

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.399 
track of the direction you're facing is
in<00:01:45.360> degrees<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.590> circle<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.360> right<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.630> 0<00:01:48.930> up

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
in degrees of a circle so right is 0 up

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.649 
in degrees of a circle so right is 0 up
is<00:01:49.920> 90<00:01:50.430> left<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> hundred<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.439> 80<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:54.450> don't

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
is 90 left is a hundred and 80 you don't

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.830 
is 90 left is a hundred and 80 you don't
want<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> check<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> relative<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.840> so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
want to check for a relative on this so

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.469 
want to check for a relative on this so
up<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> said<00:01:58.770> before<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.790> 90

going to be created in is you're facing
variable<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.860> type<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.580> direction

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
variable so I just type in for direction

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.320 
variable so I just type in for direction
the<00:03:06.510> word<00:03:06.660> facing<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.880> that's<00:03:08.880> going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.150> use

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
the word facing and that's going to use

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.650 
the word facing and that's going to use
the<00:03:09.480> whatever<00:03:09.660> value<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.860> facing

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
the whatever value that the facing

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.330 
the whatever value that the facing
whatever<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:12.870> gave<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.560> our<00:03:13.709> different

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
whatever we gave it for our different

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.600 
whatever we gave it for our different
directions<00:03:14.760> down<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.150> 270<00:03:15.690> right<00:03:15.959> at<00:03:16.140> 0<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:17.310> is

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
directions down is 270 right at 0 up is

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.400 
directions down is 270 right at 0 up is
90<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.030> left<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> hundred<00:03:18.989> eighty<00:03:19.110> it'll

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
90 and left is a hundred eighty it'll

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.259 
90 and left is a hundred eighty it'll
now<00:03:19.530> create<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:19.980> in<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.280> current<00:03:20.730> direction

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
now create it in that current direction

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.150 
now create it in that current direction
so<00:03:21.510> let's<00:03:22.230> go<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.410> try<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.680> see<00:03:22.980> how<00:03:23.040> this

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
so let's go and try and see how this

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.830 
so let's go and try and see how this
works

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
works

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.580 
works
so<00:03:24.840> we'll<00:03:24.930> go<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.200> run<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.410> game<00:03:27.590> remember

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
so we'll go and run the game remember

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.199 
so we'll go and run the game remember
last<00:03:28.769> time<00:03:28.890> we<00:03:29.040> were<00:03:29.100> able<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.280> move<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.180> I

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
last time we were able to move it so I

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.320 
last time we were able to move it so I
press<00:03:30.540> space<00:03:31.220> he<00:03:32.220> went<00:03:32.430> down<00:03:32.670> if<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:32.940> go<00:03:33.060> left

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
press space he went down if I go left

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.960 
press space he went down if I go left
he's<00:03:33.780> not<00:03:33.930> gonna<00:03:34.019> shoot<00:03:34.260> left<00:03:34.590> up<00:03:35.040> go<00:03:35.489> up<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
he's not gonna shoot left up go up and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.449 
he's not gonna shoot left up go up and
right<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.840> direction<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.100> can<00:03:38.310> move

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
right is that direction so I can move

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.790 
right is that direction so I can move
and<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.700> can<00:03:39.480> move<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.170> shoot<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.680> any

and I can move and I can shoot in any

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.220 
and I can move and I can shoot in any
direction<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.489> I'd<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.360> let's<00:03:43.049> how<00:03:43.170> you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
direction that I'd like so let's how you

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.269 
direction that I'd like so let's how you
create<00:03:44.269> bullets
