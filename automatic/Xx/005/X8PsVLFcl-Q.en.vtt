best to get it in the green and that was

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:47.580 
best to get it in the green and that was
it<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.860> perfect<00:01:29.890> launch

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.190 

you<00:01:48.070> can<00:01:48.250> see<00:01:48.430> off<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.670> line<00:01:49.060> 380<00:01:49.780> that's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
pretty bad

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.120 
pretty bad
that's<00:01:52.240> like<00:01:52.479> a<00:01:52.510> level<00:01:52.869> 2<00:01:53.049> bike<00:01:54.450> ok<00:01:55.799> d1<00:01:56.799> warm

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.980 
that's like a level 2 bike ok d1 warm
and<00:01:57.400> this<00:01:57.820> woman<00:01:58.180> will<00:01:58.420> try<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.750> get<00:01:58.900> it

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
and this woman will try to get it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.520 
and this woman will try to get it
perfect<00:01:59.409> launch<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.299> then<00:02:01.479> I'll<00:02:01.600> use<00:02:01.780> nitrous

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
perfect launch and then I'll use nitrous

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:24.630 
perfect launch and then I'll use nitrous
in<00:02:02.710> first<00:02:02.950> gear

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.790 

you<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:25.360> see<00:02:25.540> pretty<00:02:25.750> much<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:26.050> little<00:02:26.350> second

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
you can see pretty much a little second

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.110 
you can see pretty much a little second
and<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.980> half<00:02:27.010> almost<00:02:27.490> two<00:02:27.819> seconds<00:02:28.270> faster<00:02:30.120> and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
and a half almost two seconds faster and

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.630 
and a half almost two seconds faster and
it's<00:02:32.020> mending<00:02:32.410> all<00:02:32.560> off<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.340> line<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.040> that's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it's mending all off the line so that's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.280 
it's mending all off the line so that's
the<00:02:36.850> YZF<00:02:37.420> 1000<00:02:38.290> I've<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.770> level<00:02:39.250> six<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.290> just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the YZF 1000 I've a level six and just

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.199 
the YZF 1000 I've a level six and just
showing<00:02:41.620> how<00:02:41.860> old<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.640> without

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
showing how old that it is without

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.540 
showing how old that it is without
tuning<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.810> now<00:02:44.470> if<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.830> go<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.459> you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
tuning it now if you do go in and you

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.940 
tuning it now if you do go in and you
tune<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.330> actual<00:02:46.840> gears<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.530> bike<00:02:47.770> is

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
tune the actual gears this bike is

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.460 
tune the actual gears this bike is
extremely<00:02:48.580> fast<00:02:48.820> but<00:02:49.750> with<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:50.020> upgrades

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
extremely fast but with your upgrades

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.650 
extremely fast but with your upgrades
that<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.800> do<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.340> have<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.670> continuously<00:02:52.390> go

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
that you do you have to continuously go

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.490 
that you do you have to continuously go
in<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.050> tune<00:02:53.260> your<00:02:53.440> bike<00:02:54.150> my<00:02:55.150> best<00:02:55.420> bet<00:02:55.660> my

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
in and tune your bike my best bet my

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.010 
in and tune your bike my best bet my
best<00:02:56.770> recommendation<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.850> if<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.690> are<00:02:58.810> going

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
best recommendation is if you are going

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.800 
best recommendation is if you are going
to<00:02:59.080> buy<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.290> bike<00:02:59.880> don't<00:03:00.880> plan<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.120> racing<00:03:01.660> it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
to buy this bike don't plan on racing it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.290 
to buy this bike don't plan on racing it
or<00:03:01.989> using<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.620> until<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.370> fully<00:03:03.640> upgraded

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
or using it until it is fully upgraded

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.880 
or using it until it is fully upgraded
so<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.630> way<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.810> can<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.140> turn<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> once

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
so that way you can just turn it once

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.720 
so that way you can just turn it once
and<00:03:06.220> not<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.350> make<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.620> big<00:03:09.070> charade<00:03:09.370> about

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
and not have to make a big charade about

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.410 
and not have to make a big charade about
the<00:03:09.880> bike<00:03:11.640> all<00:03:12.640> right<00:03:12.790> that's<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.239> way<00:03:13.390> yeah

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the bike all right that's the way yeah

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.290 
the bike all right that's the way yeah
1000
