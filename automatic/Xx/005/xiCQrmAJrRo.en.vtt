lot of these other systems they've got a

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.880 
lot of these other systems they've got a
frontside<00:00:49.719> bus<00:00:49.960> that's<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.379> highway<00:00:50.739> that

process which all the rest of the parts
of<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.739> computer<00:00:53.920> they've<00:00:54.430> got<00:00:54.609> like<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.760> 533

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
of the computer they've got like a 533

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.080 
of the computer they've got like a 533
megahertz<00:00:56.230> frontside<00:00:56.590> bus<00:00:56.859> well<00:00:57.370> this<00:00:57.609> has<00:00:58.059> a

10 33 megahertz frontside bus that's

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.310 
10 33 megahertz frontside bus that's
like<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.329> other<00:01:01.449> little<00:01:01.600> highway<00:01:01.870> cars<00:01:02.140> going

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
like the other little highway cars going

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
like the other little highway cars going
by<00:01:02.410> but<00:01:02.559> this<00:01:02.620> was<00:01:02.769> like<00:01:02.859> a<00:01:02.920> big<00:01:03.100> mega

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
by but this was like a big mega

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.920 
by but this was like a big mega
superhighway<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.059> informations<00:01:04.689> flying

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
superhighway the informations flying

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.830 
superhighway the informations flying
everywhere<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:05.619> fast<00:01:06.460> straight<00:01:07.119> in<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.540> the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
everywhere so fast straight in to the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.719 
everywhere so fast straight in to the
monitor<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.259> straight<00:01:08.530> into<00:01:08.680> your<00:01:08.770> brain<00:01:09.159> and

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
monitor it straight into your brain and

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:10.380 
monitor it straight into your brain and
guess<00:01:09.880> what<00:01:10.030> else

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
guess what else

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.120 
guess what else
see<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.840> little<00:01:10.960> remote<00:01:11.320> right<00:01:11.470> here<00:01:11.530> well

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
see this little remote right here well

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.710 
see this little remote right here well
this<00:01:12.280> little<00:01:12.369> remote<00:01:12.759> lets<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.150> you<00:01:13.600> know

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
this little remote lets you you know

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.380 
this little remote lets you you know
control<00:01:14.170> everything<00:01:14.560> from<00:01:14.830> 15<00:01:15.790> feet<00:01:16.119> away<00:01:16.240> so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
control everything from 15 feet away so

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.149 
control everything from 15 feet away so
you<00:01:16.750> can<00:01:16.900> be<00:01:17.020> hanging<00:01:17.380> out<00:01:17.470> on<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.680> couch<00:01:17.890> and

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
you can be hanging out on the couch and

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.480 
you can be hanging out on the couch and

watching TV you say TV yes Randy
it<00:01:21.670> has<00:01:21.970> TV<00:01:22.479> this<00:01:23.259> is<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.380> TV<00:01:23.590> port<00:01:23.950> in<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.070> back

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
it has TV this is a TV port in the back

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.710 
it has TV this is a TV port in the back
of<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:24.549> can<00:01:24.670> plug<00:01:24.850> your<00:01:24.880> TV<00:01:25.150> right<00:01:25.450> into

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
of this you can plug your TV right into

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.710 
of this you can plug your TV right into
here<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.049> guess<00:01:26.229> what<00:01:26.409> Windows<00:01:27.250> XP<00:01:28.180> Media

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
here and guess what Windows XP Media

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.080 
here and guess what Windows XP Media
Center<00:01:28.750> Edition<00:01:29.110> will<00:01:29.740> act<00:01:29.920> as<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.130> TiVo<00:01:30.640> so

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
Center Edition will act as a TiVo so

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.910 
Center Edition will act as a TiVo so
while<00:01:31.270> you're<00:01:31.420> watching<00:01:31.570> TV<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.409> can<00:01:32.560> record

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
while you're watching TV you can record

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.910 
while you're watching TV you can record
it<00:01:33.130> right<00:01:33.820> into<00:01:34.329> media<00:01:35.320> center<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:35.799> it'll

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
it right into media center and it'll

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.789 
it right into media center and it'll
save<00:01:36.159> on<00:01:36.340> your<00:01:36.750> 320<00:01:37.750> gigabyte<00:01:38.500> hard<00:01:38.680> drive

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
save on your 320 gigabyte hard drive

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.679 
save on your 320 gigabyte hard drive
that's<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.579> lot<00:01:39.729> of<00:01:39.759> hard<00:01:40.000> drive<00:01:40.180> space<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:40.450> you

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
that's a lot of hard drive space and you

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.450 
that's a lot of hard drive space and you
know<00:01:40.810> what<00:01:40.930> else<00:01:41.140> that's<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.710> SATA<00:01:41.979> hard<00:01:42.159> drive

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
know what else that's a SATA hard drive

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.340 
know what else that's a SATA hard drive
so<00:01:42.820> that's<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.210> newest<00:01:43.509> technology<00:01:44.079> and<00:01:44.259> the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
so that's the newest technology and the
