if you do not have a crankshaft locking

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.910 
if you do not have a crankshaft locking
tool<00:02:04.850> get<00:02:05.570> yourself<00:02:05.930> some<00:02:06.200> sort<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:06.710> tool

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
tool get yourself some sort of a tool

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.729 
tool get yourself some sort of a tool
with<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.220> rubberized<00:02:07.970> grip<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:09.349> will<00:02:09.590> work

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
with a rubberized grip this will work

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.270 
with a rubberized grip this will work
just<00:02:09.769> as<00:02:10.220> well<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.930> use<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.069> more

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
just as well I like to use that the more

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.630 
just as well I like to use that the more
rubbery<00:02:14.030> grip<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:15.290> whereas<00:02:16.190> these<00:02:16.340> ones<00:02:16.520> are

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
rubbery grip then whereas these ones are

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.740 
rubbery grip then whereas these ones are
more<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.850> like<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> padded<00:02:17.720> cushion<00:02:18.110> on<00:02:18.290> there

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
more of like a padded cushion on there

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.690 
more of like a padded cushion on there

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
but what we want to do is using my

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.380 
but what we want to do is using my
rubberized<00:02:52.020> grip<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.739> art<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.400> our<00:02:53.520> tool<00:02:53.790> we're

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
rubberized grip of art of our tool we're

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.470 
rubberized grip of art of our tool we're
going<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> want<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> insert<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.209> manner

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
going to want to insert this in a manner

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.160 
going to want to insert this in a manner
to<00:02:57.780> where<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.380> doesn't<00:02:58.739> allow<00:02:59.130> our<00:02:59.750> arm<00:03:00.750> in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
to where it doesn't allow our arm in

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.430 
to where it doesn't allow our arm in
here<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:02.000> continuously<00:03:03.000> move<00:03:03.360> while<00:03:03.989> we<00:03:04.020> lock

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
here to continuously move while we lock

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.430 
here to continuously move while we lock
everything<00:03:04.800> down<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.489> top<00:03:05.850> here<00:03:06.180> so

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
everything down to the top here so

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.520 
everything down to the top here so
basically<00:03:07.440> what<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.739> mean<00:03:08.010> by<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:09.380> if<00:03:10.380> we

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
basically what I mean by that is if we

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.690 
basically what I mean by that is if we
want<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.739> go<00:03:10.860> ahead<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.040> start<00:03:11.340> getting<00:03:11.370> this

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
want to go ahead and start getting this

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.840 
want to go ahead and start getting this
prepared<00:03:12.180> we're<00:03:13.020> going<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.200> take<00:03:13.410> our<00:03:13.560> fan<00:03:13.860> and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
prepared we're going to take our fan and

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.820 
prepared we're going to take our fan and
depending<00:03:15.600> upon<00:03:15.630> make<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.440> model<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.770> your

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
depending upon make and model of your

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.460 
depending upon make and model of your
motor<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.459> things<00:03:17.640> like<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.930> on<00:03:18.930> mind<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
motor and things like that on mind the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.830 
motor and things like that on mind the
line<00:03:19.650> 600<00:03:20.220> our<00:03:20.310> fan<00:03:20.580> fins<00:03:21.450> are<00:03:21.570> going<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.750> be

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
line 600 our fan fins are going to be

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.840 
line 600 our fan fins are going to be
facing<00:03:22.080> down<00:03:22.260> which<00:03:23.250> means<00:03:23.489> our<00:03:23.640> clutch

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
facing down which means our clutch

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.750 
facing down which means our clutch
assembly<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.420> up<00:03:24.570> top<00:03:24.780> okay<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.670> we're<00:03:26.670> going

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
assembly is up top okay and we're going

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.880 
assembly is up top okay and we're going
to<00:03:26.850> set<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.209> down<00:03:27.269> on<00:03:27.630> here<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.140> then<00:03:28.739> we're

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
to set that down on here and then we're

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.320 
to set that down on here and then we're
going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.070> start<00:03:29.310> threading<00:03:29.610> our<00:03:29.820> bolt<00:03:30.120> on

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
going to start threading our bolt on

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.789 
going to start threading our bolt on
through<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.780> top<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.410> that's<00:03:31.500> going<00:03:31.739> to

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
through the top and that's going to

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.340 
through the top and that's going to
compress<00:03:32.250> everything<00:03:32.549> down<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.209> lot<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.049> motors

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
compress everything down a lot of motors

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.580 
compress everything down a lot of motors
guys<00:03:34.590> take<00:03:35.100> note<00:03:35.310> this<00:03:35.489> bottom<00:03:35.880> part<00:03:36.590> it's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
made to fit really tight but as I

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.410 
made to fit really tight but as I
compress<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.230> down<00:03:40.530> onto<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.850> sleeve<00:03:42.150> of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
compress this down onto the sleeve of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.900 
compress this down onto the sleeve of
the<00:03:42.450> motor<00:03:42.750> here<00:03:43.200> motor<00:03:43.799> shaft<00:03:44.070> is<00:03:44.549> it's<00:03:44.790> going

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the motor here motor shaft is it's going

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.660 
the motor here motor shaft is it's going
to<00:03:44.970> expand<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.690> make<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.019> like

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
to expand that and make it like

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.159 
down and once it starts turning the
motor<00:05:30.700> then<00:05:31.030> we<00:05:31.150> need<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.390> stick<00:05:31.900> in<00:05:32.080> our

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
motor then we need to stick in our

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.540 
motor then we need to stick in our
crankshaft<00:05:32.590> locking<00:05:33.280> tool<00:05:33.490> okay<00:05:35.130> so<00:05:36.130> now<00:05:36.370> it's

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
crankshaft locking tool okay so now it's

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.850 
crankshaft locking tool okay so now it's
turning<00:05:36.760> my<00:05:36.940> motor<00:05:37.180> okay<00:05:37.500> so<00:05:38.500> what<00:05:38.710> we're

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
turning my motor okay so what we're

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.370 
turning my motor okay so what we're
going<00:05:38.980> to<00:05:39.010> do<00:05:39.540> is<00:05:40.540> guys<00:05:40.780> we<00:05:40.930> just<00:05:41.110> want<00:05:41.290> to

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
going to do is guys we just want to

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.650 
going to do is guys we just want to
wedge<00:05:41.560> something<00:05:42.130> right<00:05:42.790> in<00:05:42.940> between<00:05:43.120> there

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
wedge something right in between there

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.380 
wedge something right in between there
so<00:05:44.230> that<00:05:44.440> it<00:05:45.370> doesn't<00:05:45.400> allow<00:05:45.820> the<00:05:45.880> motor<00:05:46.180> to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
so that it doesn't allow the motor to

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.590 
so that it doesn't allow the motor to
turn<00:05:46.419> be<00:05:47.200> careful<00:05:47.680> not<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:48.060> damage<00:05:49.060> your<00:05:49.390> motor

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
turn be careful not to damage your motor

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.820 
turn be careful not to damage your motor
when<00:05:49.810> you're<00:05:49.930> doing<00:05:50.140> this<00:05:50.260> this<00:05:50.380> is<00:05:50.560> really

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
when you're doing this this is really

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.440 
when you're doing this this is really
not<00:05:50.979> a<00:05:51.040> good<00:05:51.250> example<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.790> be<00:05:51.910> shown<00:05:52.120> anyone

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
not a good example to be shown anyone

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.870 
not a good example to be shown anyone
but<00:05:53.080> I've<00:05:53.380> never<00:05:53.560> used<00:05:53.680> a<00:05:53.919> crankshaft<00:05:54.220> locking

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
but I've never used a crankshaft locking

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.820 
but I've never used a crankshaft locking
tool<00:05:55.090> so<00:05:55.419> you'll<00:05:55.870> see<00:05:56.080> I'm<00:05:56.169> wedged<00:05:56.440> in<00:05:56.680> there

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
tool so you'll see I'm wedged in there

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.740 
tool so you'll see I'm wedged in there
and<00:05:57.010> now<00:05:57.130> it's<00:05:57.280> allowing<00:05:57.550> me<00:05:57.700> to<00:05:57.760> turn<00:05:58.090> so<00:05:58.570> just

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
and now it's allowing me to turn so just

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.570 
and now it's allowing me to turn so just
keep<00:05:58.900> turning<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.380> this<00:06:00.010> is<00:06:00.130> going<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.340> seat

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
keep turning and this is going to seat

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.250 
keep turning and this is going to seat
all<00:06:00.790> the<00:06:00.910> way<00:06:01.000> down<00:06:01.210> onto<00:06:01.450> that<00:06:01.570> thrust<00:06:01.870> washer

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
all the way down onto that thrust washer

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.659 
all the way down onto that thrust washer

guys<00:07:36.040> don't<00:07:36.280> forget<00:07:36.430> to<00:07:36.730> tighten<00:07:36.940> these<00:07:37.240> down

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
guys don't forget to tighten these down

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.570 
guys don't forget to tighten these down
here<00:07:37.770> these<00:07:38.770> are<00:07:38.830> going<00:07:38.980> to<00:07:39.130> these<00:07:39.430> are<00:07:39.490> going

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580 
here these are going to these are going

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.610 
here these are going to these are going
to<00:07:39.760> further<00:07:40.030> compress<00:07:40.330> that<00:07:40.810> fan<00:07:41.110> hub<00:07:41.380> onto

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
to further compress that fan hub onto

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.440 
to further compress that fan hub onto
that<00:07:41.830> shaft<00:07:42.190> so<00:07:42.430> that<00:07:42.460> it<00:07:42.700> doesn't<00:07:43.000> never<00:07:43.150> come

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:43.450 
that shaft so that it doesn't never come

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.110 
that shaft so that it doesn't never come
off<00:07:43.950> and<00:07:44.950> do<00:07:45.130> take<00:07:45.340> note<00:07:45.550> you<00:07:45.580> do<00:07:45.880> need<00:07:46.090> a

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 
off and do take note you do need a

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.060 
off and do take note you do need a
removal<00:07:46.750> tool<00:07:46.990> to<00:07:47.200> get<00:07:47.290> that<00:07:47.470> off<00:07:47.680> that's<00:07:47.860> why

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.070 
removal tool to get that off that's why

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.290 
removal tool to get that off that's why
it<00:07:48.160> was<00:07:48.280> really<00:07:48.520> important<00:07:48.880> that<00:07:48.940> we<00:07:49.060> did

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.300 
it was really important that we did

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.040 
it was really important that we did
everything<00:07:49.570> proper<00:07:50.170> the<00:07:50.290> first<00:07:50.530> time<00:07:52.050> so

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.050 
everything proper the first time so

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.330 
everything proper the first time so
that's<00:07:53.590> just<00:07:53.770> about<00:07:53.980> it

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:54.340 
that's just about it

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.580 
that's just about it
