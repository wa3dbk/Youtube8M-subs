all<00:00:00.599> right<00:00:00.719> I'm<00:00:00.810> driving<00:00:01.110> my<00:00:01.230> 1999<00:00:02.040> Yukon<00:00:02.460> and

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
all right I'm driving my 1999 Yukon and

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.110 
all right I'm driving my 1999 Yukon and
I've<00:00:03.330> got<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.600> pretty<00:00:03.959> interesting<00:00:05.029> wobble<00:00:06.029> in

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
I've got a pretty interesting wobble in

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.089 
I've got a pretty interesting wobble in
the<00:00:06.210> front<00:00:06.420> end<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.810> truck<00:00:07.020> when<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.830> drive

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
the front end of this truck when I drive

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.509 
the front end of this truck when I drive
it<00:00:08.280> anywhere<00:00:08.940> from<00:00:09.179> 30<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.599> 45<00:00:10.469> miles<00:00:10.769> per<00:00:10.920> hour

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
it anywhere from 30 to 45 miles per hour

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.789 
it anywhere from 30 to 45 miles per hour
and<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.690> wobbles<00:00:13.080> back<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.259> forth<00:00:13.440> pretty

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
and it wobbles back and forth pretty

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.510 
and it wobbles back and forth pretty
good<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> steering<00:00:14.370> wheel<00:00:14.639> shakes<00:00:14.940> and

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
good the steering wheel shakes and

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.410 
good the steering wheel shakes and
trying<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> figure<00:00:17.760> out<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.119> world's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
trying to figure out what in the world's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.700 
trying to figure out what in the world's
causing<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:20.810> now<00:00:21.810> my<00:00:21.930> truck<00:00:22.140> doesn't<00:00:22.500> always

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
causing this now my truck doesn't always

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.359 
causing this now my truck doesn't always
wobble<00:00:23.900> at<00:00:24.900> those<00:00:25.380> speeds<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.130> get<00:00:26.250> on

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
wobble at those speeds if I can get on

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550 
wobble at those speeds if I can get on
it<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.760> accelerate<00:00:27.689> pretty<00:00:27.930> quickly<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.320> can

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
it and accelerate pretty quickly I can

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
it and accelerate pretty quickly I can
go<00:00:28.680> through<00:00:28.920> those<00:00:29.099> speeds<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.670> doesn't

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
go through those speeds and it doesn't

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.810 
go through those speeds and it doesn't
shake<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.720> all<00:00:31.340> but<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.430> I'm<00:00:32.579> just

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
shake it all but if I'm just

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
shake it all but if I'm just
accelerating<00:00:34.460> smoothly<00:00:35.460> through<00:00:36.860> smooth<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
accelerating smoothly through smooth to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.930 
accelerating smoothly through smooth to
those<00:00:38.719> speeds<00:00:40.160> got<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> wobble<00:00:41.579> pretty<00:00:41.790> bad

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
those speeds got a wobble pretty bad

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.720 
those speeds got a wobble pretty bad
sometimes<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.710> doesn't<00:00:43.950> then

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
sometimes like right now it doesn't then

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.970 
sometimes like right now it doesn't then
other<00:00:45.180> times<00:00:45.480> where<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.960> notice<00:00:46.590> wobble

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
other times where just notice wobble

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.100 
other times where just notice wobble
like<00:00:47.100> right

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.369 

about<00:00:51.680> 40<00:00:52.180> 43<00:00:53.180> miles<00:00:53.360> an<00:00:53.570> hour<00:00:53.719> kind<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.200> going

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
about 40 43 miles an hour kind of going

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.690 
about 40 43 miles an hour kind of going
up<00:00:54.440> an<00:00:54.590> incline<00:00:55.510> thanks<00:00:56.510> relief

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
up an incline thanks relief

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:06.510 
up an incline thanks relief
really<00:00:59.120> shake<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.510> now

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.649 

still<00:01:07.420> wobbles<00:01:07.840> pretty<00:01:08.049> good<00:01:09.479> seems<00:01:10.479> like

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
still wobbles pretty good seems like

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.300 
still wobbles pretty good seems like
sometimes<00:01:10.900> I<00:01:11.229> hit<00:01:11.440> some<00:01:11.590> bumps<00:01:11.799> that<00:01:12.070> are<00:01:12.190> my

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
sometimes I hit some bumps that are my

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.520 
sometimes I hit some bumps that are my
my<00:01:12.729> aggravated<00:01:13.420> cause<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.900> wobble<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:17.350> what

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
my aggravated cause it wobble now what

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.410 
my aggravated cause it wobble now what
do<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:17.710> think<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.979> problem<00:01:18.430> is<00:01:18.580> well<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.240> could

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
do I think the problem is well it could

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.180 
do I think the problem is well it could
be<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.600> tire<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:21.250> pickup<00:01:22.210> had<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.860> belt<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:23.950> was

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
be a tire my pickup had a belt that was

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.969 
be a tire my pickup had a belt that was
starting<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.550> go<00:01:24.670> bad<00:01:24.909> on<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.740> top

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
starting to go bad on it and the top

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.090 
starting to go bad on it and the top
part<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.369> tread<00:01:27.610> got<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.119> nice<00:01:28.390> knot<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:29.770> it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
part of the tread got a nice knot in it

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.310 
part of the tread got a nice knot in it
and<00:01:30.250> so<00:01:30.430> whenever<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.790> hit<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.149> knot<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.690> make

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
and so whenever I hit that knot it make

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.219 
and so whenever I hit that knot it make
the<00:01:32.560> back<00:01:33.430> in<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.759> truck<00:01:34.000> wiggle<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.780> looked

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
the back in the truck wiggle it looked

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.469 
the back in the truck wiggle it looked
like<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.440> was<00:01:35.530> twerking<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.000> don't<00:01:37.270> think

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
like it was twerking but I don't think

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.580 
like it was twerking but I don't think
it's<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:38.500> tires<00:01:38.800> on<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:39.910> truck<00:01:39.970> because

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's the tires on this truck because

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.440 
it's the tires on this truck because
they're<00:01:41.590> brand<00:01:41.920> new<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.369> could<00:01:43.090> be<00:01:43.210> wrong<00:01:43.390> but

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
they're brand new I could be wrong but

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.919 
they're brand new I could be wrong but
it<00:01:44.170> could<00:01:44.380> be<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> warped<00:01:45.429> rotor<00:01:45.759> brake<00:01:46.659> rotor

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
it could be a warped rotor brake rotor

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.800 
it could be a warped rotor brake rotor
in<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.200> front<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:48.179> don't<00:01:49.179> think<00:01:49.570> it's<00:01:49.659> that

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
in the front I don't think it's that

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.480 
in the front I don't think it's that
either<00:01:49.990> because<00:01:50.289> when<00:01:50.679> I<00:01:50.710> push<00:01:50.979> on<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.220> brake

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
either because when I push on the brake

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.120 
either because when I push on the brake
I<00:01:51.700> don't<00:01:51.909> feel<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.509> vibration<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.679> pedal

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
I don't feel the vibration in the pedal

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.040 
I don't feel the vibration in the pedal
the<00:01:54.369> next<00:01:54.640> thing<00:01:54.789> I<00:01:54.880> could<00:01:55.090> think<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.479> maybe

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
the next thing I could think is maybe

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.460 
the next thing I could think is maybe
it's<00:01:56.289> got<00:01:56.619> something<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.979> do<00:01:57.100> with<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:58.690> end

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
it's got something to do with the end

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.620 
it's got something to do with the end
links<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.190> steering<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:00.970> know<00:02:01.090> linkages

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
and the idler arm or something the ball

and the idler arm or something the ball
joints<00:02:05.530> or<00:02:05.649> something<00:02:06.039> maybe<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:06.280> just<00:02:06.429> need<00:02:06.580> to

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
joints or something maybe I just need to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.779 
joints or something maybe I just need to
grease<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:08.470> grease<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.950> put<00:02:09.310> grease<00:02:09.550> in<00:02:09.700> the

grease the grease to put grease in the
fittings<00:02:10.149> maybe<00:02:11.079> it's<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.940> has<00:02:12.940> something<00:02:13.239> to

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
fittings maybe it's a has something to

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.210
