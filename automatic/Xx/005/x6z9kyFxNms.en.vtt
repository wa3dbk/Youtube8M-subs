a<00:00:09.960> blank<00:00:10.559> four<00:00:11.190> spindle<00:00:11.490> turning<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.450> it's

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
a blank four spindle turning so it's

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.730 
a blank four spindle turning so it's
really<00:00:12.809> simple<00:00:13.080> all<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.330> is<00:00:15.330> you

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
really simple all you do is that is you

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.730 
really simple all you do is that is you
take<00:00:16.740> your<00:00:16.949> little<00:00:17.039> ruler<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.380> put<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.500> across

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
take your little ruler and put it across

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.759 
take your little ruler and put it across
both<00:00:20.220> corners<00:00:20.730> you're<00:00:21.480> gonna<00:00:21.570> make<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.080> mark<00:00:22.560> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
both corners you're gonna make a mark a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.290 
both corners you're gonna make a mark a
line<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> way<00:00:23.369> across<00:00:23.519> or<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.150> just

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
line all the way across or you can just

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.720 
line all the way across or you can just
do<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> center<00:00:25.160> do<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> same<00:00:26.490> thing

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
do it just the center do the same thing

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.759 
do it just the center do the same thing
here<00:00:28.279> mark<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.369> right<00:00:29.519> there<00:00:30.320> if<00:00:31.320> you're<00:00:31.500> off<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
here mark it right there if you're off a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.110 
here mark it right there if you're off a
little<00:00:32.099> that's<00:00:32.279> okay<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:37.219> there<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.730> your

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
little that's okay so there is your your

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
little that's okay so there is your your
point<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.870> Center<00:00:41.719> and<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:45.350> next<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
point your Center and then next do the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.850 
point your Center and then next do the
same<00:00:47.190> thing<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> other<00:00:47.579> side<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.050> they

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
same thing on the other side and they

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
same thing on the other side and they
have<00:00:50.039> jigs<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.449> with

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
have jigs that that you can do this with

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
have jigs that that you can do this with
on<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> square<00:00:52.140> blank<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> jigs

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
on a square blank I don't think the jigs

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.369 
on a square blank I don't think the jigs
are<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.149> necessary<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> round<00:00:55.110> length

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
are all that necessary on a round length

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.599 
are all that necessary on a round length
the<00:00:55.559> J<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> jigs<00:00:56.309> help<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the J the jigs help a lot and then you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:09.800 
the J the jigs help a lot and then you
just<00:00:59.760> mark<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:07.159> just<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:09.150> me<00:01:09.299> at<00:01:09.420> least<00:01:09.630> I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
just mark that just for me at least I'm

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.030 
just mark that just for me at least I'm
sure<00:01:09.840> other<00:01:10.110> guys<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> differently<00:01:10.890> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
sure other guys do it differently but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.300 
sure other guys do it differently but
for<00:01:11.220> me<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.689> pound<00:01:13.970> both<00:01:14.970> sides<00:01:16.310> there

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
for me I like to pound both sides there

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.499 
for me I like to pound both sides there
so<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.820> at<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> beauty

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so I know where it's at and the beauty

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.580 
so I know where it's at and the beauty
of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> lathe<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:20.700> doesn't<00:01:21.030> matter<00:01:21.590> if

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
of the lathe is it doesn't matter if

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.440 
of the lathe is it doesn't matter if
you're<00:01:22.799> exact<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.400> there<00:01:23.549> or<00:01:23.640> not<00:01:23.790> unless<00:01:24.210> your

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
you're exact on there or not unless your

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.670 
you're exact on there or not unless your
piece<00:01:24.630> has<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> certain<00:01:25.259> size<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
piece has to be a certain size then it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
piece has to be a certain size then it
matters<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.220> otherwise<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.509> doesn't<00:01:27.689> matter

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
matters but otherwise it doesn't matter

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
matters but otherwise it doesn't matter
because<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.530> turn<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> you'll<00:01:29.100> turn<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
because when you turn it you'll turn it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.910 
because when you turn it you'll turn it
round<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> piece<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.299> round<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.689> itself<00:01:31.049> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
round so the piece is round to itself so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.980 
round so the piece is round to itself so
it<00:01:31.979> doesn't<00:01:32.250> matter<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.390> how<00:01:33.810> accurate

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it doesn't matter you know how accurate

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.210 
it doesn't matter you know how accurate
that<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.570> put<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.780> here

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.350 

bring<00:01:43.220> up<00:01:43.340> your<00:01:43.520> tail<00:01:43.700> stock<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:45.860> point

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.940 

now<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.540> depends<00:01:50.840> on<00:01:50.930> what<00:01:51.140> drives<00:01:51.680> me<00:01:51.860> are

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
now it depends on what drives me are

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.340 
now it depends on what drives me are
you're<00:01:52.070> using<00:01:52.250> 'too<00:01:53.470> but<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.990> just<00:01:57.170> match

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
you're using 'too but you just match

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.230 
you're using 'too but you just match
those<00:01:57.619> two<00:01:57.800> points<00:01:58.040> you<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.670> made<00:01:58.850> earlier

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
those two points you you made earlier

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.740 
those two points you you made earlier
and<00:01:59.860> lock<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.070> down<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.670> now<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.300> just<00:02:02.570> put

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
and lock that down and now you just put

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.910 
and lock that down and now you just put
pressure<00:02:02.899> on<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:03.380> don't<00:02:03.440> want<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.680> put<00:02:03.799> too

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
pressure on it you don't want to put too

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.950 
pressure on it you don't want to put too
much<00:02:03.950> pressure<00:02:04.310> or<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.970> bows<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.540> spindle

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
much pressure or that bows the spindle

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.419 
much pressure or that bows the spindle
but<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.009> don't<00:02:07.130> have<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.460> little<00:02:07.790> either<00:02:07.940> so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
but you don't have to little either so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.650 
but you don't have to little either so
it's<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.580> kind<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.819> a<00:02:10.910> field<00:02:11.180> thing<00:02:11.390> as<00:02:11.540> you

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
it's just kind of a field thing as you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.460 
it's just kind of a field thing as you
be<00:02:11.780> going

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.210 

I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.940> that's<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.900> turn<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:21.040> go

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
I think that's it you turn it on and go

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.120 
I think that's it you turn it on and go
to<00:02:21.280> town<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.790> set<00:02:22.150> your<00:02:22.270> tool<00:02:22.450> rest<00:02:22.510> up<00:02:23.130> to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
to town and set your tool rest up to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.240 
to town and set your tool rest up to
want<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:24.910> be<00:02:25.000> within<00:02:25.680> within<00:02:26.680> about<00:02:26.890> an<00:02:27.130> eighth

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
want to be within within about an eighth

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.290 
want to be within within about an eighth
of<00:02:27.400> an<00:02:27.490> inch<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.920> can<00:02:30.160> be<00:02:30.400> but<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.000> need<00:02:31.180> to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
of an inch if you can be but you need to
