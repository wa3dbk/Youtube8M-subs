00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
but I think parsley I've said this

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.949 
but I think parsley I've said this
before<00:04:15.890> makes<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.370> great<00:04:16.730> culinary<00:04:17.090> band-aid

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
before makes a great culinary band-aid

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.840 
before makes a great culinary band-aid
it's<00:04:18.590> just<00:04:18.739> like<00:04:18.890> whipping<00:04:19.190> cream

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
it's just like whipping cream

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.909
