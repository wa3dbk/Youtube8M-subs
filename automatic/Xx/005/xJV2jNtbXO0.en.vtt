00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
get okay so i was looking around for a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.780 
get okay so i was looking around for a
while<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> i<00:02:10.679> finally<00:02:10.920> found<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.400> world

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
while and i finally found this world

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.190 
while and i finally found this world
gate<00:02:12.150> thing

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
gate thing

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020 
gate thing
basically<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.760> guess

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
basically this is going to I guess

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.610 
basically this is going to I guess
feature<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.720> quest<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.260> think<00:02:16.470> there's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
feature in the quest and I think there's

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.900 
feature in the quest and I think there's
actually<00:02:16.920> something<00:02:17.129> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.610> with<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
actually something you can do with the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.820 
actually something you can do with the
WorldGate<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.750> do<00:02:18.900> need<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.590> bring

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
WorldGate you do need to bring

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.710 
WorldGate you do need to bring
visibility<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.360> take<00:02:21.540> off

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
visibility to see it so if I take off

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.000 
visibility to see it so if I take off
the<00:02:21.900> ring<00:02:21.989> visibility<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.590> can't<00:02:22.800> see

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the ring visibility you can't see

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.740 
the ring visibility you can't see
anything<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.489> flat<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.239> put<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.629> you

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
anything with a flat if I put it on you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.199 
anything with a flat if I put it on you
can<00:02:24.870> see<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.110> again<00:02:25.610> but<00:02:26.610> there<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
can see it again but there is like a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.360 
can see it again but there is like a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.319 
this is how much I made from doing all
that<00:03:04.590> divination<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> actually<00:03:05.489> made<00:03:05.760> 2.2

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
that divination so I actually made 2.2

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.970 
that divination so I actually made 2.2
mill<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.750> think<00:03:07.170> I'm<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.620> hold<00:03:07.799> on

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
mill I think I'm just going to hold on

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.190 
mill I think I'm just going to hold on
to<00:03:08.130> these<00:03:08.220> energies<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.900> mean<00:03:10.049> it's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
to these energies because I mean it's

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.130 
to these energies because I mean it's
just<00:03:10.260> two<00:03:10.530> mill<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.790> case<00:03:12.140> invention

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
just two mill and in case invention

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.800 
just two mill and in case invention
comes<00:03:13.319> out<00:03:13.560> anytime<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.549> guess<00:03:15.030> what's<00:03:15.599> in<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
comes out anytime I guess what's in the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.720 
comes out anytime I guess what's in the
next<00:03:15.930> year<00:03:16.319> I'll<00:03:16.470> probably<00:03:17.040> need<00:03:17.459> those<00:03:17.519> for

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
next year I'll probably need those for

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.300 
next year I'll probably need those for
invention<00:03:18.209> also<00:03:18.780> i<00:03:19.019> got<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.829> wealth<00:03:20.010> checker

mil<00:03:45.510> at<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.049> absolute<00:03:46.380> most<00:03:46.680> but<00:03:47.069> i<00:03:47.250> don't

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
mil at the absolute most but i don't

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.770 
mil at the absolute most but i don't
have<00:03:47.670> any<00:03:47.850> more<00:03:48.060> than<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.540> i<00:03:48.569> don't

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
have any more than that so i don't

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.410 
have any more than that so i don't
exactly<00:03:49.049> know<00:03:49.410> what<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.549> thing<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:50.880> saying

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
exactly know what this thing is saying

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.599 
exactly know what this thing is saying
that<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.019> worth<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.560> much<00:03:52.769> in<00:03:52.980> my<00:03:53.010> bank<00:03:53.340> so

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
that is worth that much in my bank so

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.120 
that is worth that much in my bank so
that's<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.850> little<00:03:53.940> bit<00:03:54.120> weird<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:55.709> anyway<00:03:56.099> i

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
that's a little bit weird but anyway i

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.690 
that's a little bit weird but anyway i
guess<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:57.660> update<00:03:58.349> kind<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.829> felt<00:03:59.220> failed

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
guess that update kind of felt failed

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.490 
guess that update kind of felt failed
they<00:04:00.239> also<00:04:00.359> had<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.599> high<00:04:00.720> scores<00:04:01.049> update<00:04:01.349> but

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
they also had the high scores update but

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.319 
they also had the high scores update but
i'm<00:04:01.590> not<00:04:01.709> going<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:01.950> go<00:04:02.010> over<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:03.060> pretty

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
i'm not going to go over that so pretty

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.319 
i'm not going to go over that so pretty
much<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.319> updates<00:04:04.650> today<00:04:05.099> the<00:04:05.819> majorette

much of the updates today the majorette
memories<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.810> kind<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.139> cool<00:04:07.260> it's<00:04:07.470> definitely

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
memories is kind of cool it's definitely

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.620
