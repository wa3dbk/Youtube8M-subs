work<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> iphones<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> little

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
work for the iphones you have a little

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.000 
work for the iphones you have a little
mounting<00:00:58.949> screw<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:01.140> actually<00:01:01.530> fastens

existing<00:01:07.439> camera<00:01:07.890> ring<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> screw

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
existing camera ring and then you screw

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.480 
existing camera ring and then you screw
on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:14.210> new<00:01:15.210> lens<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:17.040> we're<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.280> going

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
on the new lens so we're actually going

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.270 
on the new lens so we're actually going
to<00:01:17.580> demonstrate<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> ring<00:01:20.009> here

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
to demonstrate this the ring here

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.090 
to demonstrate this the ring here
actually<00:01:20.520> has<00:01:20.939> an<00:01:21.119> adhesive<00:01:21.240> side<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
actually has an adhesive side so you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.590 
actually has an adhesive side so you
peel<00:01:23.460> off<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> adhesive

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.920 

and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.820> with<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.000> head<00:01:31.150> Center<00:01:31.600> that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
and then you with a head Center that

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.910 
and then you with a head Center that
adhesive<00:01:32.320> side<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:34.479> around<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.530> camera

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
adhesive side right around the camera

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:47.520 
adhesive side right around the camera
lens<00:01:36.070> whereas<00:01:36.909> start<00:01:37.210> with<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.630> iphone<00:01:38.200> 3

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.600 

and<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.220> sent<00:01:48.460> her<00:01:48.520> as<00:01:48.640> best<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:48.940> can<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
then because it's magnetic the lens

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.430 
then because it's magnetic the lens
snaps<00:01:56.950> right<00:01:57.100> on<00:01:59.640> now<00:02:00.640> that's<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> iphone<00:02:02.110> 3

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440

adhesive may not stick as well we're
going<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.610> try<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.660> as<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> matter<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.110> fact

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
going to try it but as a matter of fact

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.890 
going to try it but as a matter of fact
the<00:02:14.770> photojojo<00:02:15.310> site<00:02:15.790> specifically<00:02:16.450> says

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the photojojo site specifically says

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.510 
the photojojo site specifically says
that<00:02:16.930> you're<00:02:17.860> probably<00:02:18.100> going<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.340> have<00:02:18.430> a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
that you're probably going to have a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.490 
that you're probably going to have a
problem<00:02:19.000> with<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> rings<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.200> try<00:02:20.470> to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
problem with the rings when you try to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.930 
problem with the rings when you try to
install<00:02:20.709> them<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.580> iphone<00:02:22.030> 4<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:24.220> we're

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
install them on the iphone 4 but we're

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.690 
install them on the iphone 4 but we're
optimistic<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:26.769> let's<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.190> give<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.519> shot

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
optimistic so let's just give it a shot

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:39.030 
optimistic so let's just give it a shot
okay<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.420> it's<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.630> place<00:02:37.560> linds<00:02:38.560> drops<00:02:38.830> into

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
okay so it's in place linds drops into

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.790 
okay so it's in place linds drops into
place<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:43.150> too<00:02:43.330> bad<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.290> actually<00:02:44.440> works

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
place not too bad so it actually works

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.350 
place not too bad so it actually works
after<00:02:45.220> fashion<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:45.819> again<00:02:46.060> caveat<00:02:46.630> emptor

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
after fashion but again caveat emptor

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.350 
after fashion but again caveat emptor
and<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.830> that's<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.549> fisheye<00:02:52.060> lens

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and the wide angle and macro lens works

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.050 
and the wide angle and macro lens works
the<00:02:55.720> same<00:02:55.750> way<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:57.400> wide<00:02:57.610> angle<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.030> macro

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
the same way the wide angle and macro

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.600 
the same way the wide angle and macro
lens<00:02:58.540> combo<00:02:59.049> retails<00:02:59.739> for<00:02:59.860> twenty<00:03:00.280> dollars
