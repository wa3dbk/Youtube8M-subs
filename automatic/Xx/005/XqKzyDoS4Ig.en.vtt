00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.340 

okay<00:00:09.920> so<00:00:10.920> I'm<00:00:11.640> glad<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.910> waited<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.110> first

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
okay so I'm glad I waited for the first

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.849 
okay so I'm glad I waited for the first
time<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.590> my<00:00:13.680> life<00:00:13.710> actually<00:00:15.470> maybe<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> first

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
time of my life actually maybe the first

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.740 
time of my life actually maybe the first
time<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> few<00:00:18.090> times<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.539> life

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
time but one of the few times in my life

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.890 
time but one of the few times in my life
I<00:00:18.869> actually<00:00:18.930> waited<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> solution<00:00:20.869> what<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
I actually waited for a solution what I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.710 
I actually waited for a solution what I
wanted<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.100> way<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.580> open<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> close<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
wanted was a way to open and close the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.000 
wanted was a way to open and close the
valves<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.220> exhaust<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.690> my<00:00:28.470> sequence

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
valves on the exhaust so my my sequence

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.049 
valves on the exhaust so my my sequence
or<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.840> steps<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> get<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.590> been<00:00:32.059> of

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
or my steps to get there have been of

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.020 
or my steps to get there have been of
course<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.359> got<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.629> car<00:00:33.930> exhaust<00:00:35.030> didn't

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
course you got the a car exhaust didn't

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.489 
course you got the a car exhaust didn't
like<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.269> opening<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.719> closing<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.289> time

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:37.499 
like it opening and closing all the time

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:39.919 
like it opening and closing all the time
so<00:00:37.979> disconnected<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.729> valves

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
so disconnected the valves

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.139 
so disconnected the valves
the<00:00:40.170> only<00:00:40.289> drawback<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.039> doing<00:00:41.339> that<00:00:41.519> is<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the only drawback to doing that is that

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.450 
the only drawback to doing that is that
the<00:00:42.749> when<00:00:43.319> you<00:00:43.440> start<00:00:43.679> the<00:00:43.920> Carlisle<00:00:44.219> cold

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the when you start the Carlisle cold

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.969 
the when you start the Carlisle cold
start<00:00:44.819> it<00:00:45.389> wakes<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> whole<00:00:46.319> neighborhood<00:00:46.800> up

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
start it wakes the whole neighborhood up

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.340 
start it wakes the whole neighborhood up
once<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> car<00:00:48.269> sort<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> cycles<00:00:49.019> through<00:00:49.170> it's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
once the car sort of cycles through it's

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.379 
once the car sort of cycles through it's
it's<00:00:49.710> warm<00:00:49.979> up<00:00:50.129> cycle<00:00:50.579> warming<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> cat's

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:51.389 
it's warm up cycle warming up the cat's

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:53.389 
it's warm up cycle warming up the cat's
then<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.319> becomes<00:00:52.559> pretty<00:00:52.769> tame<00:00:53.069> pretty

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
then it becomes pretty tame pretty

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
then it becomes pretty tame pretty
normal<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.479> a<00:00:54.659> like<00:00:55.109> there's<00:00:55.319> they're

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
normal and really a like there's they're

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.660 
normal and really a like there's they're
really<00:00:55.799> very<00:00:56.639> little<00:00:56.789> drone<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.329> any<00:00:58.429> you<00:00:59.429> with

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
really very little drone if any you with

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.369 
really very little drone if any you with
the<00:00:59.789> Acker<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.179> disconnected<00:01:00.839> it's<00:01:01.139> really

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the Acker I disconnected it's really

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.319 
the Acker I disconnected it's really
pretty<00:01:01.559> perfect<00:01:02.039> gets<00:01:02.639> rid<00:01:02.819> of<00:01:02.909> any<00:01:03.030> kind<00:01:03.179> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
pretty perfect gets rid of any kind of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.850 
pretty perfect gets rid of any kind of
rattling<00:01:03.749> or<00:01:03.869> anything<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> I

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
rattling or anything like that so I

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.890 
rattling or anything like that so I
assumed<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.070> would<00:01:08.160> get<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:09.270> wrong<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
assumed that I would get the all wrong a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.800 
assumed that I would get the all wrong a
wron<00:01:10.530> gauge<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.880> goes<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.300> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> -<00:01:13.460> they

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
wron gauge that goes here in the - they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
wron gauge that goes here in the - they
solution<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.870> think<00:01:16.050> is<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.320> 1500<00:01:16.950> bucks

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
solution I think is about 1500 bucks

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
solution I think is about 1500 bucks
it's<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.670> cool<00:01:17.910> looking<00:01:18.440> in<00:01:19.440> Florida<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it's really cool looking in Florida I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
it's really cool looking in Florida I
probably<00:01:20.160> shouldn't<00:01:20.550> lose<00:01:21.000> any<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.510> vents

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
probably shouldn't lose any of my vents

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
probably shouldn't lose any of my vents
but<00:01:22.260> if<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.950> rid<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:23.700> I'm<00:01:23.790> sure

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
but if you get rid of one and I'm sure

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.100 
but if you get rid of one and I'm sure
the<00:01:24.120> other<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.420> blows<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.720> little<00:01:24.960> more

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the other one just blows a little more

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.650 
the other one just blows a little more
air<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.190> gonna<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> saw

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
air so it's gonna do that and then I saw

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.900 
air so it's gonna do that and then I saw
match<00:01:27.900> now<00:01:28.230> come<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.620> with<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.010> obd2<00:01:29.760> port

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
match now come out with the obd2 port

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.770 
match now come out with the obd2 port

who's who and who's what and who's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.959 
who's who and who's what and who's
making<00:02:09.690> I'm<00:02:10.409> sure<00:02:10.649> all<00:02:10.830> day<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.099> 54<00:02:11.519> guys<00:02:11.700> know

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:11.969 
making I'm sure all day and 54 guys know

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.640 
making I'm sure all day and 54 guys know
because<00:02:12.120> they<00:02:12.389> sort<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.659> grew<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:12.900> with<00:02:13.079> with

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
because they sort of grew up with with

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.030 
because they sort of grew up with with
Mike<00:02:13.859> and<00:02:14.099> his<00:02:14.219> crew<00:02:14.249> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
Mike and his crew and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.789 
Mike and his crew and
the<00:02:15.159> team<00:02:15.400> there<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.790> makes<00:02:15.939> the<00:02:16.060> stuff<00:02:16.799> so

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
the team there that makes the stuff so

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.860 
the team there that makes the stuff so
anyway<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:18.370> one<00:02:18.700> suggestion<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.480> those<00:02:19.659> guys

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
anyway my one suggestion to those guys

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.089 
anyway my one suggestion to those guys
would<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.549> maybe<00:02:21.549> explain<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.359> us<00:02:22.480> new<00:02:22.689> guys

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
would be maybe explain to us new guys

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.490 
would be maybe explain to us new guys
who<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.280> are<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.760> what's<00:02:25.030> your<00:02:25.180> affiliation

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
who you are and what's your affiliation

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.119 
who you are and what's your affiliation
whose<00:02:26.500> BMS<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.730> whose<00:02:28.000> jb4<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.230> who's<00:02:29.439> in<00:02:29.650> 54

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
whose BMS and whose jb4 and who's in 54

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.949 
whose BMS and whose jb4 and who's in 54
tuning<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.760> what's<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.510> what's<00:02:31.870> the

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
tuning and what's the what's the

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.449 
tuning and what's the what's the
hierarchy<00:02:32.560> there<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.829> mean<00:02:33.010> maybe<00:02:33.159> it<00:02:33.310> doesn't

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
hierarchy there I mean maybe it doesn't

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.660 
hierarchy there I mean maybe it doesn't
really<00:02:33.700> matter<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:35.560> got<00:02:36.010> my<00:02:36.310> can<00:02:37.209> flap<00:02:38.670> in

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
really matter so I got my can flap in

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.210 
really matter so I got my can flap in
the<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.599> mail<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:41.109> screwed<00:02:41.470> up<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.859> sent<00:02:42.159> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
the in the mail I screwed up and sent to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.550 
the in the mail I screwed up and sent to
the<00:02:42.340> wrong<00:02:42.459> address<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.120> ran<00:02:43.329> down<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.599> about

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
the wrong address so I ran down to about

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.050 
the wrong address so I ran down to about
an<00:02:44.709> hour<00:02:44.859> away<00:02:45.010> where<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.340> used<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.639> live<00:02:45.819> to

an hour away where I used to live to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.789 
an hour away where I used to live to
pick<00:02:46.239> up<00:02:46.389> the<00:02:46.689> picked<00:02:47.109> up<00:02:47.260> thing<00:02:47.560> from<00:02:47.709> the

trunk there so obd2 port plugged it in

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.409 
trunk there so obd2 port plugged it in
there's<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.370> little<00:03:09.639> hole<00:03:09.849> there's<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.209> little

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
there's a little hole there's a little

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.740 
there's a little hole there's a little
circle<00:03:10.720> just<00:03:11.169> shove<00:03:11.439> the<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.389> control<00:03:13.389> unit

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
circle just shove the the control unit

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.509 
circle just shove the the control unit
and<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.959> wire<00:03:14.139> up<00:03:14.379> in<00:03:14.560> there<00:03:14.799> if<00:03:15.129> it<00:03:15.340> vibrates

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
and the wire up in there if it vibrates

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.220 
and the wire up in there if it vibrates
or<00:03:15.970> something<00:03:16.180> I'll<00:03:16.269> probably<00:03:16.299> do<00:03:16.810> take<00:03:17.139> the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
or something I'll probably do take the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.219 
or something I'll probably do take the
panel<00:03:17.439> off<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.739> wire<00:03:18.459> tie<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.760> up<00:03:18.879> but<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.090> just

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229 
panel off and wire tie it up but I just

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.119 
panel off and wire tie it up but I just
shoved<00:03:20.229> it<00:03:20.319> up<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.590> there<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.829> there's

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
shoved it up in there and there's

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.740 
shoved it up in there and there's
nothing<00:03:21.340> moving<00:03:21.549> under<00:03:21.879> there<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.090> would

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
nothing moving under there that would

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.569 
nothing moving under there that would
really<00:03:22.900> matter<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:24.220> I'll<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.489> it

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
really matter so I'll have it

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.509 
really matter so I'll have it
permanently<00:03:24.760> plugged<00:03:25.269> in<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.479> obd2<00:03:25.659> port<00:03:26.519> and

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
permanently plugged in the obd2 port and

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.689 
permanently plugged in the obd2 port and
then<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.120> went<00:03:28.449> proceeded<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.199> sort<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.530> test<00:03:29.799> to

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:30.699 
then I went proceeded to sort of test to

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.240 
then I went proceeded to sort of test to
see<00:03:30.970> how<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.599> works<00:03:32.199> and<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.650> does<00:03:32.799> work<00:03:32.979> really

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
see how it works and it does work really

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.379 
see how it works and it does work really
well<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:35.590> one<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.519> disadvantages<00:03:37.180> you

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
well the one of the disadvantages you

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.710 
well the one of the disadvantages you
have<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.629> watch<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.930> videos<00:03:38.229> online<00:03:39.720> Mike

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
have to watch the videos online Mike

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.569 
have to watch the videos online Mike
doesn't<00:03:40.930> have<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.560> instructions<00:03:42.400> up

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
doesn't have the the instructions up

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.920 
doesn't have the the instructions up
online<00:03:42.909> yet<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.680> support<00:03:45.069> area<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:46.269> and

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
online yet on the support area so and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.479 
online yet on the support area so and
there's<00:03:47.109> no<00:03:47.199> instruction<00:03:47.739> included<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.340> guess

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
there's no instruction included I guess

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.899 
there's no instruction included I guess
you<00:03:49.150> really<00:03:49.239> don't<00:03:49.419> need<00:03:49.629> instructions<00:03:50.909> the

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
you really don't need instructions the

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.550 
you really don't need instructions the
other<00:03:52.030> thing<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.269> noticed<00:03:52.329> is<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.139> active

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
other thing I noticed is that the active

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.680 
other thing I noticed is that the active
sound<00:03:53.799> I<00:03:54.159> got<00:03:54.310> probably<00:03:54.909> the<00:03:55.000> beta<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.479> first

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
sound I got probably the beta the first

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.180 
sound I got probably the beta the first
version<00:03:56.109> of<00:03:56.169> this<00:03:56.290> thing<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.680> ordered<00:03:56.949> it<00:03:57.069> the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
version of this thing I ordered it the

couple<00:04:36.169> hundred<00:04:36.290> bucks<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:36.830> guess<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:39.020> be

couple hundred bucks I guess to to be
able<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.530> control<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.700> valves<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:42.020> let<00:04:42.320> me

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
able to control the the valves so let me

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.020 
able to control the the valves so let me
only<00:04:42.860> close<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.310> trunk<00:04:43.520> here<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.000> doesn't

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
only close the trunk here so it doesn't

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.700 
only close the trunk here so it doesn't
sound<00:04:44.450> weird<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.840> car<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.080> completely<00:04:45.200> cold

just like the factory exhaust there's a

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.679 
just like the factory exhaust there's a
little<00:06:02.560> bit<00:06:02.650> of<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.800> rattle<00:06:03.250> and<00:06:03.280> things<00:06:03.640> cold
