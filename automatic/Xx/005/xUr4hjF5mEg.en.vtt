 before a noticeably excited audience 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.740
 for reliving a decade that marked their 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.839
 days through themes that have endured 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.370
 to date the seibo nor me before 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.840
 france showed that they still have 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.700
 energy and charisma that always 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.080
 has characterized as background the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.549

 cruise terminal singing their 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.580
 best hits in a concert that lasted 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.580
 approximately two hours 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.949
 we are happy of all that reception 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.680
 that we had because we proposed 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.489
 sing in some places and it turns out that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.469
 they have invited us to so many and it has been the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.369
 such an exciting response for us 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.799
 that makes us vibrate on stage and 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:58.170
 rejoice and the energy triples 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.460
 thanks to all that love and attention 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.460
 of you and the public 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.860

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.280

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.260
 Y 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.719
 the singers series I also consider 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.129
 an interview to the media 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.599
 communication where they talked about their 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.040
 next plans as a group and for 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.299
 apart from the benefit that has 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.129
 brought to the use of social networks in 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.829
 this new stage of his career makes a 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.750
 so cute response so warm that no 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.599
 we have more than more to thank 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.760
 deeply and enjoy this process 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.799
 there are plans we have had invitations 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.230
 to do new things and we do not put on 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.760
 time limit nor do we get going to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.310
 last one year we will last for days 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.349
 hours and how do you live people if you 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.030
 continue to applaud we will continue 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.819
 singing then that's the rich thing not 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.819
 you tell us how we are the process that 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.519
 we are living right now the el rollo 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.659
 staff that we have also the support 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.849
 we have part of our 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.620
 families and the freedom that he gives us 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.109
 also our office that we are very 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.459
 intimately so now that 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.049
 agreeing outside of Mérida 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.910
 cove and plans as if nothing 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.980
 this 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.350
 the truth has been a very rich process 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.700
 very rich and we have no time limit 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.380
 this race 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.820
 two weeks later because I think that 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.780
 you many of you had not 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:31.310
 born neither you neither and neither do we 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.760
 that this now give us we gave ourselves to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.490
 meet through social networks 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.900
 of friendships from me tell me in 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.790
 twitter and on facebook on facebook and the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.540
 truth is that we are surprised as 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.050
 a career can get to learn from 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.130
 new helped by is a technology 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.890
 totally new to us and that 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.600
 Well, yes they are very effective and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.940
 we say thank you very much why then 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.820
 because we are also a little bit 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.070
 for that reason here again very grateful 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.410
 this is definitely better by 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.470
 many reasons what the 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.720
 Güerita that this from social networks 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.540
 there is already a direct penetration that before 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.100
 we did not have their before if a fan wanted 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.479
 tell you something sends you a letter and 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.400
 just I do not know where came not 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.740
 received the time and is today the product 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.720
 contact is direct then let's go 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.240
 moving a bit to what the same 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.100
 people are vibrating and on the other hand 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.390
 we are a little bit more in 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.470
 consciousness at that moment when 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.290
 we started I had 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.170
 of years then what I was had 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:45.350
 given to eat well had just moved 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:47.990
 exact this then for today is a 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.790
 different consciousness is how it said 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.710
 My colleagues deeply thank 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.880
 that maybe in that because it's not that 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.070
 we would not appreciate it but what 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.920
 we will enjoy many villas 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.210
 we had another kind of rolls that 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.800
 Obviously adolescence is a 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.100
 disease that is removed over the years and 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.280
 thanks to which it is and today 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.140
 it is much more aware and curiously 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.180
 that the question that the partner asked 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.760
 long ago of how they walk of energy 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.040
 Tina Turner has just been on the cover of 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.100
 the bruc in his seventy years 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.520
 age is a number and I think it's a 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.590
 Attitude issue is a matter of will and 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.630
 it's a good food good topic 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.419
 plastic surgeons and good husbands who 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.460
 they accompany you to one and support it not the wta 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.080
 we are I believe that at the best moment 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.190
 and we are enjoying it more than ever 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.190
 really more than ever 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.360
 today 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.550
 already 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.990
 good 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.990
 I love you 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.830
 no no 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.560
 look 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.560
 all right 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.040
 10 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.550
 my family 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.570
 and 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.130
 with information that would generate images 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.580
 from the moment suárez to fronterense 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.580
 nothing public
