is a much improved charger team they

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.040 
is a much improved charger team they
could<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:42.000> off<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> field<00:00:42.510> last<00:00:42.840> year

the<00:00:43.950> Chargers<00:00:44.460> big<00:00:44.730> problem<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.300> year<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the Chargers big problem this year is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
the Chargers big problem this year is
offensive<00:00:46.350> line<00:00:46.680> injuries<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.610> it's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
offensive line injuries and it's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.959 
offensive line injuries and it's
affected<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.840> whole<00:00:49.370> chemistry<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
affected that whole chemistry of the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.880 
affected that whole chemistry of the
offense<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> sudden<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> have

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
offense and now of a sudden you have

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.970 
offense and now of a sudden you have
rivers<00:00:53.340> running<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.390> his<00:00:54.480> life<00:00:54.510> making<00:00:55.500> poor

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
rivers running for his life making poor

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.200 
rivers running for his life making poor
decisions<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.989> snow<00:00:58.320> balled<00:00:58.649> I

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
decisions and it just snow balled I

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
decisions and it just snow balled I
think<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> Chargers<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:01.170> live<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> game

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
think the Chargers are live in this game

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.090 
think the Chargers are live in this game
I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.809> they<00:01:03.809> played<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> mistake<00:01:04.589> free<00:01:04.860> game

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
I think they played a mistake free game

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.429 
I think they played a mistake free game
against<00:01:05.549> Pittsburgh<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.360> believe<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.409> were

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
against Pittsburgh I believe they were

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.340 
against Pittsburgh I believe they were
something<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.890> 12<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.549> 22<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.270> third<00:01:09.540> down

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
something like 12 for 22 on third down

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
something like 12 for 22 on third down
conversions<00:01:11.130> no<00:01:11.970> turnover<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.750> played<00:01:13.320> field

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
conversions no turnover is played field

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
conversions no turnover is played field
position<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> Chargers<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:15.600> alive

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
position I think the Chargers are alive

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.300 
position I think the Chargers are alive
yeah<00:01:16.200> field<00:01:16.470> position<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.920> big<00:01:17.130> because

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
yeah field position was big because

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
yeah field position was big because
ordinarily<00:01:18.150> their<00:01:18.479> special<00:01:19.080> teams<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.500> been

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
ordinarily their special teams have been

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
ordinarily their special teams have been
atrocious<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.610> last<00:01:20.850> couple<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> years

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
atrocious the last couple of years

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
atrocious the last couple of years
special<00:01:21.689> teams<00:01:21.869> played<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.140> well<00:01:22.500> last<00:01:22.680> week

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920

and<00:01:54.780> i<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:55.710> stems<00:01:56.009> back<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and i think it all stems back to the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.370 
and i think it all stems back to the
coaching<00:01:56.969> staff<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.420> all<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
coaching staff we all know that and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.260 
coaching staff we all know that and
what's<00:01:59.130> interesting<00:01:59.280> about<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.909> game<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
what's interesting about this game and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
what's interesting about this game and
here's<00:02:00.450> why<00:02:00.600> Eileen<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> Carolina<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> little

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
here's why Eileen the Carolina a little

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.300 
here's why Eileen the Carolina a little
bit<00:02:02.420> we're<00:02:03.420> looking<00:02:03.719> at<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> head<00:02:04.560> coaches<00:02:05.159> that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
bit we're looking at a head coaches that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.399 
bit we're looking at a head coaches that
know<00:02:05.549> each<00:02:05.579> other<00:02:05.939> Carolina's<00:02:06.899> coach<00:02:07.110> rivera

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
know each other Carolina's coach rivera

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.730 
know each other Carolina's coach rivera
was

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
was

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.740 
was
their<00:02:09.070> defensive<00:02:09.790> coordinator<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.510> four

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
their defensive coordinator for four

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.890 
their defensive coordinator for four
years<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:12.370> think<00:02:12.940> he's<00:02:13.150> gonna<00:02:13.360> know<00:02:13.630> Norv

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
years so I think he's gonna know Norv

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.270 
years so I think he's gonna know Norv
Turner<00:02:13.960> extreme<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:14.890> well<00:02:15.040> North

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
Turner extreme really well North

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.410 
Turner extreme really well North
Turner's<00:02:15.580> going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.880> him<00:02:16.090> extremely

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
Turner's going to know him extremely

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.600 
Turner's going to know him extremely
well<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.870> give<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.290> defensive<00:02:17.980> side<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.460> it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
well but I give the defensive side of it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.690 
well but I give the defensive side of it
a<00:02:18.790> little<00:02:19.360> bit<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.720> advantage<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.700> coupled

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
a little bit of advantage and coupled

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.210 
a little bit of advantage and coupled
that<00:02:21.880> with<00:02:21.940> three<00:02:22.600> backup<00:02:23.170> offensive<00:02:23.380> lineman

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
that with three backup offensive lineman

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.660 
that with three backup offensive lineman
for<00:02:24.400> San<00:02:24.640> Diego<00:02:25.150> listen<00:02:26.020> I've<00:02:26.380> been<00:02:26.710> saying

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
for San Diego listen I've been saying

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.110 
for San Diego listen I've been saying
that<00:02:28.350> Carolina's<00:02:29.350> under<00:02:29.890> over<00:02:30.370> rated<00:02:30.880> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
that Carolina's under over rated the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.110 
that Carolina's under over rated the
whole<00:02:31.270> year<00:02:31.570> before<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.680> season<00:02:32.980> started<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.580> I

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
whole year before the season started I I

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.170 
whole year before the season started I I
said<00:02:34.750> under<00:02:35.230> four<00:02:35.440> season<00:02:35.860> wins<00:02:36.070> I<00:02:36.370> thought

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
said under four season wins I thought

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.030 
said under four season wins I thought
there<00:02:37.330> was<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.600> too<00:02:37.750> much<00:02:37.780> hype<00:02:38.200> because<00:02:38.920> of

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
there was just too much hype because of

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.090 
there was just too much hype because of
what<00:02:39.070> they<00:02:39.400> did<00:02:39.610> last<00:02:39.640> year<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.980> know<00:02:42.070> I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
what they did last year and you know I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.830 
what they did last year and you know I
was<00:02:42.400> not<00:02:42.580> surprised<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.240> kept<00:02:43.450> hearing<00:02:43.600> near

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
was not surprised I kept hearing near

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.480 
was not surprised I kept hearing near
the<00:02:43.960> best<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.530> 16<00:02:44.950> they're<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> best<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
the best to and 16 they're the best to

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.850 
the best to and 16 they're the best to
and<00:02:45.640> 17<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.600> best<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.050> an<00:02:47.170> ATM<00:02:47.560> right<00:02:47.620> now

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
and 17 the best to an ATM right now

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.190 
and 17 the best to an ATM right now
about<00:02:48.070> 49<00:02:48.790> they're<00:02:49.330> probably<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.780> best<00:02:49.930> born

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
about 49 they're probably the best born

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.910 
about 49 they're probably the best born
probably<00:02:50.920> ok<00:02:51.460> but<00:02:51.490> still<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.810> I'm<00:02:53.020> not<00:02:53.410> falling

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
probably ok but still so I'm not falling

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.760 
probably ok but still so I'm not falling
for<00:02:54.070> that<00:02:54.100> hype<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.790> i<00:02:54.820> just<00:02:55.120> think<00:02:55.350> san<00:02:56.350> diego

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
for that hype but i just think san diego

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.750 
for that hype but i just think san diego
i<00:02:56.950> added<00:02:57.550> just<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.560> season<00:03:00.070> coming<00:03:00.550> into

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
i added just the the season coming into

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.830 
i added just the the season coming into
this<00:03:00.850> season<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.360> isn't<00:03:01.630> where<00:03:01.720> they

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
this season this isn't where they

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.070 
this season this isn't where they
expected<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.320> be<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> five<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.040> eight<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:04.080> I

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
expected to be a five and eight and I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.950 
expected to be a five and eight and I
just<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:06.130> can't<00:03:06.670> lay<00:03:06.910> points<00:03:07.300> with<00:03:07.420> them<00:03:07.570> even

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
just I can't lay points with them even

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.530 
just I can't lay points with them even
at<00:03:08.080> home<00:03:08.200> where's<00:03:08.830> Ryan<00:03:09.130> Matthews<00:03:09.700> been<00:03:09.940> you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
at home where's Ryan Matthews been you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.290 
at home where's Ryan Matthews been you
know<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:11.080> he<00:03:11.290> he's<00:03:12.160> still<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:12.970> squad<00:03:13.270> I

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
know is he he's still on the squad I

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.000 
know is he he's still on the squad I
think<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.840> was<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.080> combination<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.740> being

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
think it was a combination of being

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.250 
think it was a combination of being
injured<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.850> he<00:03:15.970> was<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.150> fun<00:03:16.450> blur<00:03:16.660> yeah<00:03:16.990> and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
injured and he was a fun blur yeah and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.830 
injured and he was a fun blur yeah and
he<00:03:17.440> had<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.650> like<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> stretch<00:03:18.640> where<00:03:18.880> he<00:03:18.940> had<00:03:19.210> two

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
he had a like a stretch where he had two

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.440 
he had a like a stretch where he had two
lost<00:03:20.260> fumbles<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.040> three-game<00:03:21.520> stretch<00:03:22.060> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
lost fumbles in a three-game stretch and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.890 
lost fumbles in a three-game stretch and
they<00:03:22.840> buried<00:03:23.200> him<00:03:24.000> they<00:03:25.000> they're<00:03:25.480> averaging

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
they buried him they they're averaging

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.810 
they buried him they they're averaging
three<00:03:26.200> point<00:03:26.410> seven<00:03:26.590> yards<00:03:27.010> per<00:03:27.250> carry<00:03:27.460> which

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
three point seven yards per carry which

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.470 
three point seven yards per carry which
is<00:03:28.000> awful<00:03:28.860> 95<00:03:29.860> yards<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.340> game<00:03:30.370> which<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.120> just

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
is awful 95 yards a game which is just

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.780 
is awful 95 yards a game which is just
as<00:03:31.690> awful<00:03:32.080> what<00:03:32.530> saving<00:03:32.950> them<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.610> the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
as awful what saving them is on the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.490 
as awful what saving them is on the
defensive<00:03:34.180> side<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.630> ball<00:03:34.690> it's<00:03:35.320> almost

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
defensive side of the ball it's almost

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.420 
defensive side of the ball it's almost
those<00:03:35.800> exact<00:03:36.280> same<00:03:36.870> averages<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.010> defense

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
those exact same averages so the defense

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.570 
those exact same averages so the defense
like<00:03:40.240> you<00:03:40.420> said<00:03:40.690> has<00:03:41.050> stepped<00:03:41.920> up<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.280> little

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
like you said has stepped up a little

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.470 
like you said has stepped up a little
bit<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:42.850> year<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.090> not<00:03:43.210> like<00:03:43.330> they're

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
bit this year it's not like they're

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.570 
bit this year it's not like they're
dominating<00:03:43.780> defense<00:03:44.500> but<00:03:44.710> I<00:03:44.950> don't<00:03:45.370> always

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
dominating defense but I don't always

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.860
