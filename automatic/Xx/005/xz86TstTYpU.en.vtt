00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.760
 what 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.760
 you see 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.160
 a little minute here with martÃ­nez with 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.230
 steers from capturing tutorials like 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.330
 some have not asked how they 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.390
 I do to record audio while with the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.950
 applications with display recorder only 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.739
 it is report that they agree agreement is not 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.600
 can record audio in while things in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 the applications 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.690
 this is download with cydia really 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.690
 free 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.720
 when using right now you can record 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.630
 audio and video while you go in the 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.200
 Applications 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.910
 This is downloaded by 25 pp as 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:00.870
 25 pp scale I said this in a video on 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.700
 my channel look for it and this is the index 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.420
 that we're going to go in so they can see how 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.420
 download it 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.660
 and if I have downloaded the 25 percentage points 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.660
 he in search 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.659
 I looked for it and remembered 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.650
 but it is not guided either 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.039
 michelle and mexico 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.350
 you look 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.380
 I remembered looking for cuts like right now 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.430
 this one does not look for it in display it was coordinated 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.430
 they go down 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.600
 they look for the icon that is equal to that here 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.600
 is record record of giving him a little arrow 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.720
 and here they give the first option 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.520
 and it starts to download and this I what 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.520
 I'm going to eliminate because 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.380
 and I put it well this is my taste is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.200
 the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.940
 the terminal of this tutorial those that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.940
 they sell the idea is to go back
