transmission problems there's a lot of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.090 
transmission problems there's a lot of
different<00:00:38.540> areas<00:00:38.690> that<00:00:38.960> fit<00:00:39.170> on<00:00:39.350> these<00:00:39.559> but

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
different areas that fit on these but

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.759 
different areas that fit on these but
the<00:00:40.190> most<00:00:40.370> common<00:00:40.970> is<00:00:41.180> a<00:00:41.239> servo<00:00:41.780> bores<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.470> wear

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
the most common is a servo bores to wear

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.910 
the most common is a servo bores to wear
out<00:00:43.339> on<00:00:43.699> these<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.269> case<00:00:44.540> is<00:00:44.750> aluminum<00:00:45.350> just

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
out on these the case is aluminum just

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.820 
out on these the case is aluminum just
as<00:00:46.040> an<00:00:46.159> ER<00:00:46.280> transmission<00:00:47.000> case<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.320> servo

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
as an ER transmission case and the servo

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.660 
as an ER transmission case and the servo
rod<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.699> super<00:00:50.300> hardened<00:00:50.750> steel<00:00:51.559> la<00:00:52.070> rod<00:00:52.400> on

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
rod is a super hardened steel la rod on

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.399 
rod is a super hardened steel la rod on
here<00:00:52.909> that<00:00:52.940> actually<00:00:53.300> goes<00:00:53.659> in<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.050> out<00:00:54.170> and

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
here that actually goes in and out and

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.009 
here that actually goes in and out and
guess<00:00:55.309> who's<00:00:55.519> going<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.820> win<00:00:56.000> in<00:00:56.330> that<00:00:56.659> fight

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
guess who's going to win in that fight

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.350 
guess who's going to win in that fight
definitely<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:57.979> steel<00:00:58.250> rod<00:00:58.519> over<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:59.000> loom

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
definitely the steel rod over a loom

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.869 
definitely the steel rod over a loom
case<00:00:59.629> what<00:01:00.440> happens<00:01:00.979> well<00:01:01.339> what<00:01:01.519> happens

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
case what happens well what happens

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.600 
case what happens well what happens
after<00:01:02.059> that<00:01:02.089> is<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:02.720> pressure<00:01:03.049> loss<00:01:03.610> passes

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
after that is this pressure loss passes

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.969 
after that is this pressure loss passes
area<00:01:05.059> when<00:01:05.690> there<00:01:05.870> shouldn't<00:01:06.229> be<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:06.620> rod

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
area when there shouldn't be this rod

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.610 
area when there shouldn't be this rod
and<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.790> bore<00:01:08.120> inside<00:01:08.659> of<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.930> transmission

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
and the bore inside of the transmission

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.370 
and the bore inside of the transmission
is<00:01:09.770> machine<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.940> very<00:01:11.240> strict<00:01:11.630> tolerances<00:01:11.990> so

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
is machine to very strict tolerances so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.069 
is machine to very strict tolerances so
the<00:01:13.189> melted<00:01:14.060> metal<00:01:14.180> contact<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.869> there

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
the melted metal contact on there

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.679 
the melted metal contact on there
actually<00:01:15.229> is<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.770> ceiling<00:01:16.310> for<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.090> bore

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
actually is the ceiling for the bore

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.749 
actually is the ceiling for the bore
there's<00:01:17.990> no<00:01:18.229> o-rings<00:01:18.740> there's<00:01:19.039> no<00:01:19.159> gaskets

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
there's no o-rings there's no gaskets

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.330 
there's no o-rings there's no gaskets
there's<00:01:20.000> nothing<00:01:20.270> like<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.719> on<00:01:20.930> there<00:01:21.340> so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
there's nothing like that on there so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.859 
there's nothing like that on there so
what's<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.610> big<00:01:22.759> deal<00:01:23.030> well<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.390> big<00:01:23.570> deal<00:01:23.810> is

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
what's the big deal well the big deal is

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.260 
what's the big deal well the big deal is
in<00:01:24.469> order<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.100> fix<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.609> what<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:25.939> have<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.119> do

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
in order to fix that what you have to do

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.999 
in order to fix that what you have to do
is<00:01:26.509> pull<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.780> transmission<00:01:27.469> out<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
is pull the transmission out of the

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.639 
is pull the transmission out of the
vehicle<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.670> then<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.750> assemble<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
vehicle and then this is assemble the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.069 
vehicle and then this is assemble the
whole<00:01:30.680> transmission<00:01:31.579> okay<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.359> then<00:01:32.930> we're

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
whole transmission okay and then we're

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.590 
whole transmission okay and then we're
going<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.289> use<00:01:33.530> sleeves<00:01:34.039> and<00:01:34.549> we're<00:01:35.329> going<00:01:35.509> to

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
going to use sleeves and we're going to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.810 
going to use sleeves and we're going to
bore<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.140> case<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.680> stick<00:01:37.219> these<00:01:37.369> sleeves

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
bore up the case and stick these sleeves

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.880 
bore up the case and stick these sleeves
in<00:01:38.000> there<00:01:38.119> these<00:01:38.240> brass<00:01:38.570> sleeves<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.380> then

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
in there these brass sleeves and then

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.069 
in there these brass sleeves and then
rebuild<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.429> whole<00:01:40.579> transmission<00:01:41.450> the

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
rebuild the whole transmission the

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.870 
rebuild the whole transmission the
problem<00:01:42.500> with<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.340> costs<00:01:43.700> just

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
problem with that is that it costs just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.419 
problem with that is that it costs just
about<00:01:44.119> as<00:01:44.270> much<00:01:44.479> as<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:45.049> remand<00:01:45.590> transmission

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
about as much as a remand transmission

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.660 
about as much as a remand transmission
and<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:47.390> other<00:01:47.539> factor<00:01:48.079> that<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.500> those<00:01:49.280> brass

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
and the other factor that is those brass

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.370 
and the other factor that is those brass
sleeves<00:01:50.119> they're<00:01:50.539> not<00:01:50.689> lasting<00:01:51.140> too<00:01:51.259> much

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
sleeves they're not lasting too much

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.529 
sleeves they're not lasting too much
longer<00:01:51.710> than<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.249> aluminum<00:01:52.549> case<00:01:53.030> on<00:01:53.329> the

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
longer than the aluminum case on the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.179 
longer than the aluminum case on the
transmission<00:01:54.109> so<00:01:54.380> you're<00:01:54.530> back<00:01:54.770> where<00:01:55.159> you

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
transmission so you're back where you

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:55.959 
transmission so you're back where you
started

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
started

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.239 
started
now<00:01:56.810> with<00:01:57.079> these<00:01:57.259> press<00:01:57.560> pieces<00:01:57.979> I'm<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.100> to

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
now with these press pieces I'm going to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.910 
now with these press pieces I'm going to
try<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:58.460> illustrate<00:01:58.840> what<00:01:59.840> happens<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.530> why

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
try to illustrate what happens and why

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.169 
try to illustrate what happens and why
it<00:02:00.979> happens<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.579> course<00:02:01.609> this<00:02:01.909> can<00:02:02.149> be

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
it happens of course this can be

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.630 
it happens of course this can be
exaggerated<00:02:02.990> for<00:02:03.170> video<00:02:03.439> purposes<00:02:03.640> but

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
exaggerated for video purposes but

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.809 
exaggerated for video purposes but
basically<00:02:04.999> this<00:02:05.299> is<00:02:05.569> your<00:02:06.170> servo<00:02:06.499> rod<00:02:06.829> ok<00:02:07.700> it

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
basically this is your servo rod ok it

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.910 
basically this is your servo rod ok it
sticks<00:02:08.119> into<00:02:08.330> there<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.780> what<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.410> does<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.770> it

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
sticks into there and what it does is it

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.030 
sticks into there and what it does is it
attaches<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.940> strut<00:02:11.630> anchor<00:02:12.020> on<00:02:12.200> your<00:02:12.740> band

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
attaches to a strut anchor on your band

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.590 
attaches to a strut anchor on your band
and<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.370> applies<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.940> band<00:02:14.150> inside<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
and it applies the band inside the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.460 
and it applies the band inside the
transmission<00:02:15.170> for<00:02:15.350> transmission<00:02:15.980> gear

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
transmission for transmission gear

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.100 
transmission for transmission gear
deduction<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.850> course<00:02:18.090> from<00:02:18.870> there<00:02:19.020> you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
deduction and of course from there you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.990 
deduction and of course from there you
going<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.530> different<00:02:19.980> gears<00:02:20.280> throughout

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
going to get different gears throughout

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.760 
going to get different gears throughout
the<00:02:21.150> transmission<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.590> here's<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.950> bore<00:02:23.220> okay

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
the transmission so here's the bore okay

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.080 
the transmission so here's the bore okay
we're<00:02:25.770> sticking<00:02:25.920> into<00:02:26.160> there<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.790> thing

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
we're sticking into there this thing

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.210 
we're sticking into there this thing
barely<00:02:27.360> fits<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:27.960> very<00:02:28.230> well<00:02:28.500> machined<00:02:28.950> and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
barely fits it's very well machined and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.610 
barely fits it's very well machined and
it<00:02:29.610> fits<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:30.150> perfectly<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.260> goes<00:02:31.410> in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
it fits in there perfectly so it goes in

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.070 
it fits in there perfectly so it goes in
and<00:02:31.770> out<00:02:31.860> okay<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.820> after<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.570> while<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.840> does

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
and out okay and after a while it does

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.620 
and out okay and after a while it does
anything<00:02:34.620> else<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.370> gets<00:02:35.490> sloppy<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.300> worn

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
anything else it gets sloppy and worn

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.290 
anything else it gets sloppy and worn
out<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:37.020> there<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:37.890> after<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:39.180> have

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
out in there then after that we have

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.370 
out in there then after that we have
something<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.900> again<00:02:40.260> it's

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
something like this again it's

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.290 
something like this again it's
exaggerated<00:02:40.980> but<00:02:41.610> we're<00:02:41.760> trying<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> go<00:02:42.150> in

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
exaggerated but we're trying to go in

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.150 
exaggerated but we're trying to go in
and<00:02:42.480> out<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.660> it's<00:02:42.990> just<00:02:43.080> flopping<00:02:43.740> around<00:02:43.860> in

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
and out and it's just flopping around in

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.300 
and out and it's just flopping around in
there<00:02:44.420> now<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.960> can<00:02:46.140> cause<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.010> ear

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
there now what this can cause is the ear

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.480 
there now what this can cause is the ear
your<00:02:47.610> overdrive<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.390> intermediate<00:02:49.020> drive

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
your overdrive or intermediate drive

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.710 
your overdrive or intermediate drive
band<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:50.820> burnt<00:02:51.060> up<00:02:51.270> out<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.570> there

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
band to get burnt up out of there

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.870 
band to get burnt up out of there
because<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.290> waiting<00:02:52.650> forever<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.520> drum

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
because it's waiting forever the drum

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.790 
because it's waiting forever the drum
can<00:02:54.060> actually<00:02:54.300> spin<00:02:54.570> up<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.870> around<00:02:55.080> 10,000

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
can actually spin up to around 10,000

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.310 
can actually spin up to around 10,000
rpm<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.280> believe<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.820> then<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> BAM<00:02:57.750> may<00:02:58.020> all

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
rpm I believe and then the BAM may all

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.620 
rpm I believe and then the BAM may all
sudden<00:02:58.800> apply<00:02:59.220> when<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.120> thing<00:03:00.420> gets

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
sudden apply when this thing gets

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.810 
sudden apply when this thing gets
unstuck<00:03:01.230> or<00:03:01.470> enough<00:03:01.650> pressure<00:03:01.920> behind<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
unstuck or enough pressure behind it and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.690 
unstuck or enough pressure behind it and
then<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> breaks<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.140> band<00:03:04.410> or<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.520> just

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
then it breaks the band or you can just

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.210 
then it breaks the band or you can just
sit<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.360> only<00:03:07.140> apply<00:03:07.410> light<00:03:08.010> pressure

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
sit there and only apply light pressure

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.660 
sit there and only apply light pressure
because<00:03:08.760> most<00:03:09.000> what's<00:03:09.150> getting<00:03:09.390> lost<00:03:09.660> through

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
because most what's getting lost through

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.570 
because most what's getting lost through
the<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.910> pin<00:03:12.120> on<00:03:12.300> here<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.080> case<00:03:13.580> you'll

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
the the pin on here in the case you'll

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.850 
the the pin on here in the case you'll
have<00:03:14.640> light<00:03:15.090> pressure<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:16.230> band<00:03:16.560> and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
have light pressure on that band and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.100 
have light pressure on that band and
it'll<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.310> sit<00:03:17.520> there<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.880> burn<00:03:18.180> up<00:03:18.209> either

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
it'll just sit there and burn up either

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.110 
it'll just sit there and burn up either
way<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.709> don't<00:03:20.310> want<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.640> go<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.910> route

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
way you don't want to go that route

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.580 
way you don't want to go that route
because<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:21.630> you're<00:03:21.810> definitely<00:03:22.110> pulling

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
because then you're definitely pulling

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.890 
because then you're definitely pulling

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
DTC's you may experience when the servo

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.860 
DTC's you may experience when the servo
bores<00:03:49.410> are<00:03:49.650> worn<00:03:49.950> out<00:03:50.390> now<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.570> problem

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
bores are worn out now this problem

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.289 
bores are worn out now this problem
typically<00:03:52.320> occurs<00:03:52.709> after<00:03:53.280> about<00:03:53.430> 50,000

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
typically occurs after about 50,000

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.970 
typically occurs after about 50,000
miles<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.780> board<00:03:55.019> start<00:03:55.380> getting<00:03:55.590> worn<00:03:55.830> out

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
miles the board start getting worn out

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.370 
miles the board start getting worn out
and<00:03:56.220> when<00:03:56.940> you'll<00:03:57.120> typically<00:03:57.510> experience<00:03:58.140> it

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
and when you'll typically experience it

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.229 
and when you'll typically experience it
is<00:03:58.530> when<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.890> fluid<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.459> transmission<00:04:00.030> flu

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
is when the fluid the transmission flu

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.420 
is when the fluid the transmission flu
is<00:04:00.390> warm<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.959> therefore<00:04:01.799> thinner<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.340> is

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
is warm and therefore thinner and is

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.220 
is warm and therefore thinner and is
going<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.580> get<00:04:02.730> past<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.299> wear<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> bore

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
going to get past the wear and the bore

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.350 
going to get past the wear and the bore
and<00:04:04.380> they're<00:04:04.560> much<00:04:04.799> easier<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.549> cause<00:04:06.090> this

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
and they're much easier and cause this

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.870 
and they're much easier and cause this
pressure<00:04:06.600> loss<00:04:06.959> issue<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:08.190> what<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.459> common

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
pressure loss issue so what the common

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.979 
pressure loss issue so what the common
codes<00:04:09.180> are<00:04:09.420> with<00:04:09.630> this<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.049> Pio<00:04:10.290> 7:32<00:04:11.269> po7<00:04:12.269> 33

Pio 735 and the most common is a Pio 775
now<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.140> typical<00:04:19.380> symptoms<00:04:20.040> associated<00:04:20.310> with

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
now the typical symptoms associated with

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.540 
now the typical symptoms associated with
worn<00:04:21.030> servo<00:04:21.540> bores<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.140> shift<00:04:22.800> flare<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
worn servo bores is a shift flare and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.260 
worn servo bores is a shift flare and
the<00:04:23.940> reason<00:04:24.270> being<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.690> when<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.990> goes

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
the reason being is when it goes

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.360 
the reason being is when it goes
that<00:04:25.509> next<00:04:25.780> gear<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.710> band<00:04:26.979> is<00:04:27.129> not

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
that next gear and the band is not

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.999 
that next gear and the band is not
applying<00:04:27.879> the<00:04:28.569> drone<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.169> going<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.470> spin<00:04:29.860> in

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
applying the drone just going to spin in

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:30.330 
applying the drone just going to spin in
there

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
there

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.010 
there
the<00:04:30.580> way<00:04:30.729> it<00:04:30.879> works<00:04:31.180> is<00:04:31.389> that<00:04:31.419> there's<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.720> band

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
the way it works is that there's a band

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.860 
the way it works is that there's a band
around<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.560> drum<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.069> then<00:04:33.490> there's<00:04:33.699> a<00:04:33.870> on

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
around the drum and then there's a on

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.629 
around the drum and then there's a on
this<00:04:34.990> side<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.560> there's<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.800> servo<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.430> this

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
this side and there's a servo on this

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.760 
this side and there's a servo on this
side<00:04:36.909> what<00:04:37.180> does<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.690> pinches<00:04:38.199> that<00:04:38.440> band

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
side what does it pinches that band

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.460 
side what does it pinches that band
around<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.789> drum<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.240> holds<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.930> drum<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.349> get

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
around the drum it holds the drum to get

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.830 
around the drum it holds the drum to get
the<00:04:41.620> gear<00:04:41.860> reduction<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.490> there<00:04:42.759> this<00:04:43.240> servo

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
the gear reduction on there this servo

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.990 
the gear reduction on there this servo
is<00:04:43.900> over<00:04:44.139> here<00:04:44.319> in<00:04:44.409> limbo<00:04:44.710> or<00:04:45.129> else<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.550> cannot

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
is over here in limbo or else it cannot

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.059 
is over here in limbo or else it cannot
even<00:04:46.780> apply<00:04:47.080> enough<00:04:47.349> pressure<00:04:47.379> therefore

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
even apply enough pressure therefore

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.460 
even apply enough pressure therefore
burning<00:04:48.639> up<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:48.849> band<00:04:49.120> or<00:04:49.659> not<00:04:49.930> applying<00:04:50.289> the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
burning up the band or not applying the

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.080 
burning up the band or not applying the
band<00:04:50.710> all<00:04:50.949> together<00:04:51.340> therefore<00:04:51.699> you<00:04:52.000> don't

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
band all together therefore you don't

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.790 
band all together therefore you don't
get<00:04:52.240> your<00:04:52.360> gear<00:04:52.569> reduction<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.530> get<00:04:53.710> your

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
get your gear reduction and you get your

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.559 
get your gear reduction and you get your
shift<00:04:54.099> lair<00:04:54.460> now<00:04:54.669> when<00:04:55.210> you're<00:04:55.330> gonna<00:04:55.419> get<00:04:55.509> a

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
shift lair now when you're gonna get a

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.839 
shift lair now when you're gonna get a
shift<00:04:55.870> flair<00:04:56.199> is<00:04:56.440> on<00:04:56.620> a<00:04:56.650> one<00:04:56.979> two<00:04:57.190> shift<00:04:57.550> that's

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
shift flair is on a one two shift that's

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.629 
shift flair is on a one two shift that's
when<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.360> overdrive<00:04:59.349> servo<00:04:59.919> comes<00:05:00.159> on<00:05:00.370> and

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
when the overdrive servo comes on and

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.790 
when the overdrive servo comes on and
the<00:05:01.120> two<00:05:01.360> three<00:05:01.690> shift<00:05:02.050> is<00:05:02.380> when<00:05:02.620> the

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
the two three shift is when the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.670 
the two three shift is when the
intermediate<00:05:03.610> servo<00:05:04.000> comes<00:05:04.270> on<00:05:04.560> third<00:05:05.560> to

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
intermediate servo comes on third to

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.490 
intermediate servo comes on third to
fourth<00:05:05.949> geranyl<00:05:06.550> problems<00:05:07.000> because<00:05:07.270> the

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
fourth geranyl problems because the

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.629 
fourth geranyl problems because the
direct<00:05:08.500> clutch<00:05:08.710> comes<00:05:08.979> out<00:05:09.130> at<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.400> point

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
direct clutch comes out at that point

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.510 
direct clutch comes out at that point
but<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.360> fourth<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.990> fifth<00:05:11.020> gear<00:05:11.740> you'll<00:05:12.340> have

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
but the fourth to fifth gear you'll have

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.890 
but the fourth to fifth gear you'll have
the<00:05:12.639> problem<00:05:13.060> again<00:05:13.300> because<00:05:13.569> that's<00:05:13.750> when

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
the problem again because that's when

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.540 
the problem again because that's when
the<00:05:13.960> overdrive<00:05:14.470> servo<00:05:15.009> is<00:05:15.099> supposed<00:05:15.340> to<00:05:15.400> come

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
the overdrive servo is supposed to come

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.089 
the overdrive servo is supposed to come
on<00:05:15.699> once<00:05:16.300> again<00:05:16.509> and<00:05:17.080> it's<00:05:17.319> not<00:05:17.380> working<00:05:17.740> it's

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
on once again and it's not working it's

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.950 
on once again and it's not working it's
just<00:05:18.310> going<00:05:18.430> to<00:05:18.490> flare<00:05:18.789> up<00:05:18.819> like<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.389> now

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
just going to flare up like that now

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.809 
just going to flare up like that now
what<00:05:20.139> you<00:05:20.289> may<00:05:20.500> notice<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.190> if<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.550> let

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
what you may notice is that if you let

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.459 
what you may notice is that if you let
off<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.120> throttle<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.569> little<00:05:22.599> bit<00:05:22.990> it'll

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
off the throttle a little bit it'll

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:27.119 
off the throttle a little bit it'll
finally<00:05:23.919> grab<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.849> it'll<00:05:24.969> go<00:05:25.090> in<00:05:25.650> but<00:05:26.650> many

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
finally grab and it'll go in but many

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.459 
finally grab and it'll go in but many
times<00:05:27.370> it's<00:05:27.699> just<00:05:27.759> a<00:05:27.969> shift<00:05:28.240> flare<00:05:28.569> or<00:05:28.840> a<00:05:28.990> total

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
times it's just a shift flare or a total

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.890 
times it's just a shift flare or a total
loss<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:30.009> the<00:05:30.159> gear<00:05:30.430> altogether<00:05:31.090> that's<00:05:31.690> why<00:05:31.870> I

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
loss of the gear altogether that's why I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.800 
loss of the gear altogether that's why I

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.089 
kit and what I want to show you on it is
exactly<00:05:42.069> what<00:05:42.340> they<00:05:42.460> do<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:43.419> modify<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:44.169> to<00:05:44.529> fix

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
exactly what they do to modify it to fix

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.399 
exactly what they do to modify it to fix
this<00:05:45.400> problem<00:05:45.789> what<00:05:46.690> they<00:05:46.810> do<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.199> take<00:05:47.319> a

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
this problem what they do is it take a

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.909 
this problem what they do is it take a
genuine<00:05:47.949> brand<00:05:48.460> new<00:05:48.699> ford<00:05:49.240> OEM<00:05:49.650> servo<00:05:50.650> both

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
genuine brand new ford OEM servo both

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.159 
genuine brand new ford OEM servo both
intermediate<00:05:51.580> and<00:05:51.729> overdrive<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:52.690> they

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
intermediate and overdrive and they

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.649 
intermediate and overdrive and they
modify<00:05:53.770> by<00:05:53.979> machining<00:05:54.490> grooves<00:05:54.849> here<00:05:55.449> and

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
modify by machining grooves here and

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.290 
modify by machining grooves here and
here<00:05:56.440> on<00:05:56.590> either<00:05:56.770> side<00:05:57.159> of<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.669> pressure<00:05:57.909> feed

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
here on either side of the pressure feed

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.990 
here on either side of the pressure feed
hole<00:05:58.539> therefore<00:05:59.529> it<00:05:59.620> allows<00:05:59.710> it<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.400> pin<00:06:00.699> to

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
hole therefore it allows it the pin to

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.300 
hole therefore it allows it the pin to
seal<00:06:01.330> in<00:06:01.599> the<00:06:01.630> servo<00:06:02.020> bore<00:06:02.500> in<00:06:02.919> the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
seal in the servo bore in the

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.339 
seal in the servo bore in the
transmission<00:06:03.880> case<00:06:04.060> it's<00:06:04.240> worn<00:06:04.479> out<00:06:04.630> once

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
transmission case it's worn out once

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:05.850 
transmission case it's worn out once
again

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
again

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.010 
again
therefore<00:06:06.789> allowing<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.360> pressure<00:06:07.630> feed

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
therefore allowing the pressure feed

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.350 
therefore allowing the pressure feed
from<00:06:08.199> the<00:06:08.349> case<00:06:08.590> to<00:06:08.889> come<00:06:09.039> up<00:06:09.250> go<00:06:09.819> into<00:06:10.060> the

piste the the servo pin and actually

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.570 
piste the the servo pin and actually
feed<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.509> backside<00:06:14.050> of<00:06:14.080> it<00:06:14.319> fill<00:06:14.889> the<00:06:15.069> cavity

feed the backside of it fill the cavity

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.230 
feed the backside of it fill the cavity
and<00:06:16.139> apply<00:06:17.139> the<00:06:17.800> servo<00:06:18.400> that's<00:06:18.909> the<00:06:19.090> whole

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
and apply the servo that's the whole

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.089 
and apply the servo that's the whole
point<00:06:19.509> of<00:06:19.659> it<00:06:19.840> for<00:06:20.229> losing<00:06:20.560> all<00:06:20.650> that<00:06:20.740> pressure

from<00:06:21.430> worn<00:06:21.699> out<00:06:21.849> bore<00:06:22.210> you<00:06:22.779> can<00:06:22.930> see<00:06:23.289> how<00:06:23.469> this

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
from worn out bore you can see how this

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.129 
from worn out bore you can see how this
thing<00:06:23.680> just<00:06:24.250> isn't<00:06:24.490> going<00:06:24.759> to<00:06:24.819> work<00:06:25.139> now

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
thing just isn't going to work now

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.959 
thing just isn't going to work now
probably<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:26.740> nicest<00:06:26.919> feature<00:06:27.400> on<00:06:27.639> here<00:06:27.880> is

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
probably the nicest feature on here is

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:29.640 
probably the nicest feature on here is
the<00:06:28.090> fact<00:06:28.360> that<00:06:28.449> you<00:06:28.599> can<00:06:28.750> do<00:06:28.900> it<00:06:28.960> yourself<00:06:29.020> and

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
the fact that you can do it yourself and

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.740 
the fact that you can do it yourself and
there's<00:06:30.130> no<00:06:30.490> need<00:06:31.029> to<00:06:31.240> remove<00:06:31.569> the

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
there's no need to remove the

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.719 
there's no need to remove the
transmission<00:06:32.169> so<00:06:33.009> but<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.190> can<00:06:33.310> do<00:06:33.490> it<00:06:33.610> right

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
transmission so but you can do it right

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.100 
transmission so but you can do it right
in<00:06:33.820> your<00:06:33.909> driveway<00:06:34.180> you<00:06:34.449> do<00:06:34.719> it<00:06:34.779> right<00:06:34.960> in<00:06:35.050> your

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
in your driveway you do it right in your

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.719 
in your driveway you do it right in your
garage<00:06:35.320> three<00:06:36.009> four<00:06:36.250> hours<00:06:36.520> later<00:06:36.759> and<00:06:37.089> your

mission is fixed you save thousands of

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.239 
mission is fixed you save thousands of
dollars<00:06:40.389> this<00:06:41.389> this<00:06:42.020> fixes<00:06:42.680> permanent<00:06:43.159> a

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:43.249 
dollars this this fixes permanent a

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.519 
dollars this this fixes permanent a
permanent<00:06:43.699> fix<00:06:44.029> so<00:06:44.330> it's<00:06:44.599> not<00:06:44.960> like<00:06:45.139> adding

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:45.529 
permanent fix so it's not like adding

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:47.290 
permanent fix so it's not like adding
some<00:06:45.740> additive<00:06:46.279> into<00:06:46.729> there<00:06:46.969> it's<00:06:47.150> going<00:06:47.240> to

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
some additive into there it's going to

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.360 
some additive into there it's going to
swell<00:06:47.509> some<00:06:47.749> seals<00:06:48.110> and<00:06:48.409> fix<00:06:48.710> it<00:06:48.889> temporarily

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
swell some seals and fix it temporarily

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.700 
swell some seals and fix it temporarily
so<00:06:49.939> you<00:06:50.029> can<00:06:50.150> sell<00:06:50.449> the<00:06:50.599> vehicle<00:06:50.839> this<00:06:51.469> is<00:06:51.680> a

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
so you can sell the vehicle this is a

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.399 
so you can sell the vehicle this is a
permanent<00:06:52.249> fix<00:06:52.490> will<00:06:52.699> last<00:06:52.999> just<00:06:53.719> as<00:06:53.930> long<00:06:54.139> as

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.409 
permanent fix will last just as long as

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:56.469 
permanent fix will last just as long as
the<00:06:54.589> original<00:06:54.680> servo<00:06:55.370> boards<00:06:55.729> did<00:06:55.909> and<00:06:56.180> the

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 
the original servo boards did and the

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:57.969 
the original servo boards did and the
transmission<00:06:57.080> that<00:06:57.110> we're<00:06:57.409> out<00:06:57.529> in<00:06:57.650> the<00:06:57.710> first

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
transmission that we're out in the first

00:06:57.979 --> 00:06:58.510 
transmission that we're out in the first
place

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 
place

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.909 
place
and<00:06:58.610> just<00:06:59.599> like<00:06:59.719> the<00:06:59.839> brass<00:07:00.080> inserts<00:07:00.680> if<00:07:00.830> the

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
and just like the brass inserts if the

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:02.260 
and just like the brass inserts if the
Ford<00:07:01.219> dealer<00:07:01.430> is<00:07:01.550> putting<00:07:01.879> in<00:07:01.999> and<00:07:02.210> they

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
Ford dealer is putting in and they

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.239 
Ford dealer is putting in and they
sleeve<00:07:02.599> the<00:07:02.779> case<00:07:02.990> on<00:07:03.289> there<00:07:03.499> so<00:07:04.009> it<00:07:04.129> only

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:04.249 
sleeve the case on there so it only

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:05.619 
sleeve the case on there so it only
makes<00:07:04.520> sense<00:07:04.639> to<00:07:04.969> go<00:07:05.089> with<00:07:05.180> the<00:07:05.270> cheapest

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:05.629 
makes sense to go with the cheapest

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:06.820 
makes sense to go with the cheapest
solution<00:07:06.080> that's<00:07:06.229> going<00:07:06.349> to<00:07:06.409> last<00:07:06.650> the

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
solution that's going to last the

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.309 
solution that's going to last the
longest<00:07:07.309> and<00:07:07.580> that's<00:07:08.120> this<00:07:08.389> kit<00:07:08.749> so<00:07:09.050> I'll<00:07:09.169> put

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 
longest and that's this kit so I'll put
