00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
is on my pointer finger and you can see

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.630 
is on my pointer finger and you can see
a<00:03:51.210> couple<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.750> those<00:03:51.960> diamonds<00:03:52.710> holographic

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
a couple of those diamonds holographic

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.470 
a couple of those diamonds holographic
colors<00:03:54.570> in<00:03:54.780> there<00:03:54.990> I<00:03:55.670> really<00:03:56.670> like<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.030> one<00:03:57.210> I

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
colorful glitter in it so here's moon

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.429 
colorful glitter in it so here's moon
dance<00:04:50.819> compared<00:04:51.449> to<00:04:51.689> blue<00:04:53.330> satin<00:04:54.439> they're

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
dance compared to blue satin they're

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:01.459 
dance compared to blue satin they're
similar<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:56.159> different<00:05:00.020> it's<00:05:01.020> very<00:05:01.199> very
