00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.329
 but today what is unprepared now 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.910
 becoming a joke 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.960
 today we have prepared a liqueur 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.809
 we thought again about starting 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 I have tasted to be divided as it means 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.579
 the Ligurian is not called orange cream 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.120
 organic orange milk aykol ingredients 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.510
 food with 95 grams of vanilla sugar 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.340
 let's start our recipe together 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.600
 we washed the oranges well and then 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.270
 we peeled them with a potato peeler 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.580
 removing only the orange part 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.100
 we added lay here is giorgia 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.820
 then we start by peeling won 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.259
 roots only the orange part and that me 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 it also explains the choice of 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.560
 take them organic for those who don't have to 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.350
 absolutely have no kind of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.979
 exact right adjective then have been 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 a preferable choice in the life of 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.310
 eating fruit every day 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.810

 I did n't think about lemons but didn't know 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.480
 from lemons I could not understand why 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.400
 he did not know from his limonio dogs the age of oranges 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.540
 therefore being or being wrong is a 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.190
 serene beggar who is not confused 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.470

 After this time we did 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.019
 boil the vanillin sugar and the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.120
