00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 hi to all I am always nick and today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.310
 as you have seen I am here for the side 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.050
 against sweet magi so we'll go as to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.770
 usually to do a little analysis first 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.539
 of the dec 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.699
 and then in the end I'll do it because it has all 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.810
 the useful cards in my opinion 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.939
 contrabreak so let's go to like 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.669
 he told you the analysis of the dec 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.070
 it is a deck that special vocation ne 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.510
 does a throttle maybe we say that I am 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.950
 also the key point of this technician 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 facts it was possible to block the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.040
 special skills maybe with vanity 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.129
 in fact this quality among the cards from 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.520
 said you are very advantaged something 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.559
 maybe he will do but very little then he is a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.079
 deck that more or less numbers of monsters 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.660
 trap spells are the standard ones ie 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.360
 20 monsters 10 and the tearing spells 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.250
 standard more or less in the sweet but there 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.829
 are 20 monsters but a little less are 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600
 around 15 16 now comes to me 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 then exactly depends on the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.369
 versions and otherwise the magic cards 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.159
 trap are balanced 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.689
 we say that there are also many papers 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.240
 which is a nuisance because where it is magi 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.549
 very often in the hands of shit then 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.390
 play cards to annoy 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.750
 the opponent for example mirror roar 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.360
 typhoon nye nice bit of cards that note 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.979
 they bother me they are with 32 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.590
 obviously be careful 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.520
 especially to the former track is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.829
 very dangerous especially when the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 rolex armo blade file at the polls for 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.240
 that I put a card against 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.670
 that and above all the clear that the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.350
 card that fucks you the most so look for it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.149
 not to make it local if you are not a bit 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.630
 in the poo unless you have it 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.570
 something below like you hope too much 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.119
 so now I will show you just the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.689
 cards I have chosen say for 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.000
 this against this gap and nothing seen 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.390
 all here maybe leave a like here 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.520
 below commented as well to let me know 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.909
 complete and nothing enjoy the cards e 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.909
