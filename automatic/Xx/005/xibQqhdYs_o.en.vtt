00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
probably my most favorite part about the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
probably my most favorite part about the
game<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.950> see<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.610> new

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
game is to just see what kind of new

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.049 
game is to just see what kind of new
stuff<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.540> at<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:59.460> first<00:00:59.790> when<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
first upgrade and that's mainly because

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.170 
first upgrade and that's mainly because
it<00:01:02.220> takes<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> short<00:01:02.700> amount<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.970> time<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180

prioritize a couple other things that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.719 
prioritize a couple other things that
are<00:01:50.810> basically<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.259> free<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.889> what<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.549> also

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
builders on here because it just takes a

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.389 
builders on here because it just takes a
minute<00:01:57.209> Tubb<00:01:57.689> great<00:01:57.929> those<00:01:58.139> guys<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.009> once

those are all kind of taken out of the

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.230 
those are all kind of taken out of the
way<00:02:01.109> I'm<00:02:01.529> gonna<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.740> those<00:02:01.919> walls<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.759> have

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
way I'm gonna get those walls I have

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.909 
way I'm gonna get those walls I have
that<00:02:03.419> wizard<00:02:03.869> tower<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.349> mortar<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.859> I

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:04.919 
that wizard tower and the mortar that I

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:06.769 
that wizard tower and the mortar that I
have<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.130> keep<00:02:05.279> in<00:02:05.490> mind<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:05.880> first<00:02:06.240> let's

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:06.779 
have to keep in mind but first let's

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.480 
have to keep in mind but first let's
just<00:02:06.959> get<00:02:07.049> these<00:02:07.229> walls<00:02:07.560> going

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
just get these walls going

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.860 
just get these walls going
and<00:02:08.580> I'll<00:02:08.700> explain<00:02:09.000> why<00:02:09.240> I'm<00:02:09.300> upgrading<00:02:09.510> these

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:09.870 
and I'll explain why I'm upgrading these

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.280 
and I'll explain why I'm upgrading these
or<00:02:10.380> building<00:02:10.800> these<00:02:10.890> walls<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.580> little<00:02:11.850> bit

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
or building these walls in a little bit

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.640 
or building these walls in a little bit
all<00:02:13.290> right

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
all right

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.820 
all right
so<00:02:14.100> let's<00:02:14.370> get<00:02:14.550> these<00:02:14.760> guys<00:02:15.030> all<00:02:15.680> situated<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
so let's get these guys all situated and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.530 
so let's get these guys all situated and
I'll<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.100> ahead<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.340> upgrade<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.000> make<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
I'll go ahead and upgrade and make a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.450 
I'll go ahead and upgrade and make a
layout<00:02:18.900> maybe<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.470> another<00:02:19.680> video<00:02:20.010> all<00:02:20.400> right

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
layout maybe in another video all right

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.130 
layout maybe in another video all right
so<00:02:20.820> some<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.690> things<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.930> want<00:02:22.080> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
so some of the things you want to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.290 
so some of the things you want to
prioritize<00:02:22.350> when<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.610> higher

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
prioritize when you get to the higher

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.270 
prioritize when you get to the higher
townhall<00:02:24.870> levels<00:02:25.230> let's<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.070> talk<00:02:26.250> about

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
townhall levels let's just talk about

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.400 
townhall levels let's just talk about
townhall<00:02:26.910> 6<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:27.480> right<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.200> want

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
townhall 6 right now right now you want

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.560 
townhall 6 right now right now you want
to<00:02:28.440> prioritize<00:02:28.800> your<00:02:28.980> laboratory<00:02:29.550> because<00:02:30.030> if

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
to prioritize your laboratory because if

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.780 
to prioritize your laboratory because if
you<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.170> extra<00:02:31.710> elixir<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.400> dump<00:02:32.610> that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you have extra elixir you can dump that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.720 
you have extra elixir you can dump that
into<00:02:33.450> your<00:02:33.570> laboratory<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.470> know<00:02:34.620> takes<00:02:35.610> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
into your laboratory as you know takes a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.490 
into your laboratory as you know takes a
lot<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.910> elixir<00:02:36.450> or<00:02:36.630> sometimes<00:02:36.990> dark<00:02:37.290> elixir

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
lot of elixir or sometimes dark elixir

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
lot of elixir or sometimes dark elixir
to<00:02:37.710> upgrade<00:02:38.040> your<00:02:38.220> troops<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:39.090> if<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.330> have

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
to upgrade your troops so if you have

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.090 
to upgrade your troops so if you have
extra<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.470> kind<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.680> funnel<00:02:40.980> it

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
extra then you can kind of funnel it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.550 
extra then you can kind of funnel it
there<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.520> if<00:02:42.360> your<00:02:42.510> builders<00:02:42.900> are<00:02:43.050> busy<00:02:43.380> and

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
there and if your builders are busy and

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.070 
there and if your builders are busy and
you<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.430> build<00:02:44.670> anything<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.300> costs<00:02:45.510> elixir

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
you can build anything that costs elixir

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.690 
you can build anything that costs elixir
to<00:02:46.290> get<00:02:46.590> rid<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.800> your<00:02:46.980> elixir<00:02:47.220> then<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.580> can

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
to get rid of your elixir then you can

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.310 
to get rid of your elixir then you can
put<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.120> laboratory<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:49.140> that's

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
put that in the laboratory it's that's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.200 
put that in the laboratory it's that's
one<00:02:49.500> thing<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.710> can<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.790> other<00:02:50.910> thing

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
one thing you can do the other thing

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.150 
one thing you can do the other thing
work<00:02:51.840> on<00:02:51.960> your<00:02:52.110> walls<00:02:52.350> because<00:02:52.710> now<00:02:52.950> those

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
work on your walls because now those

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.150 
work on your walls because now those
walls<00:02:53.430> are<00:02:53.610> sort<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.880> like<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.320> gold<00:02:55.320> sink<00:02:55.650> so

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
walls are sort of like a gold sink so

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.890 
walls are sort of like a gold sink so
you<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.370> basically<00:02:56.520> use<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.330> lot<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.630> gold

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
you can basically use a lot of gold

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.230 
you can basically use a lot of gold
there<00:02:58.530> if<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.010> lot<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.250> extra<00:02:59.700> again

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
there if you have a lot of extra again

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.540 
there if you have a lot of extra again
if<00:03:00.390> you're<00:03:00.860> if<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.070> lot<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.310> gold<00:03:02.490> to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
if you're if you have a lot of gold to

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.040 
if you're if you have a lot of gold to
burn<00:03:02.850> all<00:03:03.360> right<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.600> next<00:03:03.720> thing<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.930> want

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
burn all right the next thing you want

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.210 
burn all right the next thing you want
to<00:03:04.080> worry<00:03:04.200> about<00:03:04.380> is<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:04.920> clan<00:03:05.190> castle

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
to worry about is your clan castle

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.840 
to worry about is your clan castle
because<00:03:06.150> right<00:03:06.540> now<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:07.020> can<00:03:07.980> old<00:03:08.130> 15<00:03:08.550> troops

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
because right now I can old 15 troops

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.060 
because right now I can old 15 troops
and<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.750> upgrade<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.230> clan<00:03:10.500> castle<00:03:10.950> right

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
and if I upgrade that clan castle right

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.400 
and if I upgrade that clan castle right
now<00:03:11.130> if<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.030> have<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> gold<00:03:12.330> for<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.630> rather<00:03:12.780> then

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
now if I have a gold for it rather then

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.140 
now if I have a gold for it rather then
I<00:03:13.440> can<00:03:13.770> hold<00:03:13.980> five<00:03:14.310> more<00:03:14.550> troops<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.030> then

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
I can hold five more troops and then

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.600 
I can hold five more troops and then
hold<00:03:15.390> 20<00:03:15.870> housing<00:03:16.500> space<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.070> that's<00:03:17.370> enough

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
hold 20 housing space and that's enough

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.760 
hold 20 housing space and that's enough
for<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.790> dragon<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.660> again<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.500> know<00:03:19.590> at

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
for a dragon so again you know at

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.760 
for a dragon so again you know at
townhall<00:03:20.100> six<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.880> level<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.720> lot<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.290> air

townhall six that level a lot of air
raids<00:03:22.950> are<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.670> bit<00:03:23.820> uncommon<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.810> being

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
raids are a little bit uncommon so being

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.810 
raids are a little bit uncommon so being
able<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.590> hold<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:26.010> dragon<00:03:26.400> when<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.610> couldn't

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
able to hold a dragon when you couldn't

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.180 
able to hold a dragon when you couldn't
have<00:03:27.000> held<00:03:27.420> one<00:03:27.480> before<00:03:28.040> gives<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.130> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
have held one before gives you a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.560 
have held one before gives you a
significant<00:03:29.760> advantage<00:03:30.060> when<00:03:30.300> you're<00:03:30.390> doing

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
significant advantage when you're doing

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.910 
significant advantage when you're doing
raiding<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.290> that's<00:03:31.440> another<00:03:31.620> thing<00:03:31.710> you<00:03:31.830> want

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
raiding so that's another thing you want

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.980 
raiding so that's another thing you want
to<00:03:32.040> prioritize<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:33.180> next<00:03:33.600> things<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> want

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
to prioritize the next things you want

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.490 
to prioritize the next things you want
to<00:03:34.050> prioritize

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
to prioritize

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.160 
to prioritize
I<00:03:34.650> actually<00:03:34.860> recommend<00:03:35.190> maybe<00:03:35.610> doing<00:03:35.910> this

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
I actually recommend maybe doing this

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.350 
I actually recommend maybe doing this
pretty<00:03:37.170> quickly<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:38.150> looking<00:03:39.150> at<00:03:39.240> your

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
pretty quickly is looking at your

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.810 
pretty quickly is looking at your
storages<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:39.960> getting<00:03:40.170> those<00:03:40.380> upgraded<00:03:40.950> main

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
storages and getting those upgraded main

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.820 
storages and getting those upgraded main
thing<00:03:42.030> with<00:03:42.180> clash<00:03:42.360> of<00:03:42.510> clans<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:43.320> want<00:03:43.620> to

thing with clash of clans is you want to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.100 
thing with clash of clans is you want to
basically<00:03:44.820> take<00:03:45.210> advantage<00:03:45.390> if<00:03:45.990> you're

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
basically take advantage if you're

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.530 
basically take advantage if you're
playing<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:46.560> game<00:03:46.770> non-stop<00:03:47.130> which<00:03:47.820> back<00:03:48.360> in

to<00:04:22.109> me<00:04:22.199> recommend<00:04:22.440> getting<00:04:23.190> those<00:04:23.340> storages

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
to me recommend getting those storages

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.670 
to me recommend getting those storages
up<00:04:23.970> as<00:04:24.150> quickly<00:04:24.629> as<00:04:24.960> possible<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.650> know

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
up as quickly as possible and you know

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.770 
up as quickly as possible and you know
what<00:04:25.889> I'm<00:04:26.639> actually<00:04:26.849> going<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.270> go<00:04:27.419> ahead<00:04:27.599> and

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
what I'm actually going to go ahead and

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.260 
what I'm actually going to go ahead and
upgrade<00:04:28.530> an<00:04:28.800> elixir<00:04:29.069> storage<00:04:29.460> right<00:04:29.610> now<00:04:29.789> just

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
upgrade an elixir storage right now just

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.730 
upgrade an elixir storage right now just
go<00:04:30.419> ahead<00:04:30.449> and<00:04:30.629> get<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.750> going<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:31.349> then

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
go ahead and get that going and then

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.200 
go ahead and get that going and then
also<00:04:31.979> since<00:04:32.340> I'm<00:04:32.490> going<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.639> be<00:04:32.729> playing<00:04:32.940> for<00:04:33.150> a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
also since I'm going to be playing for a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.540 
also since I'm going to be playing for a
little<00:04:33.449> bit<00:04:33.569> I'm<00:04:34.349> gonna<00:04:34.470> get<00:04:34.650> those<00:04:34.830> gold

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
little bit I'm gonna get those gold

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.830 
little bit I'm gonna get those gold
mines<00:04:35.759> up<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.060> little<00:04:36.240> bit<00:04:36.330> more<00:04:36.509> because<00:04:36.599> it

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
mines up a little bit more because it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.990 
mines up a little bit more because it
takes<00:04:37.110> like<00:04:37.259> 15<00:04:37.379> minutes<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.009> that's<00:04:38.759> kind<00:04:38.970> of

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
takes like 15 minutes and that's kind of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.420 
takes like 15 minutes and that's kind of
like<00:04:39.120> passive<00:04:39.599> income<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.259> can<00:04:40.530> use

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
like passive income that you can use

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.040 
like passive income that you can use
later<00:04:41.699> on<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.509> get<00:04:42.629> some<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:42.990> those

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
later on so you get some of those

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.930 
later on so you get some of those
collectors<00:04:43.470> going<00:04:43.740> but<00:04:43.979> once<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.310> sort<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:44.699> get

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
collectors going but once I sort of get

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.559 
collectors going but once I sort of get
a<00:04:45.449> lot<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.080> my<00:04:46.169> new<00:04:46.379> stuff<00:04:46.680> built<00:04:47.009> such<00:04:47.699> as<00:04:47.909> this

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
a lot of my new stuff built such as this

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.930 
a lot of my new stuff built such as this
mortar<00:04:49.050> which<00:04:49.169> is<00:04:49.289> really<00:04:49.530> important<00:04:49.979> as<00:04:50.669> well

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
mortar which is really important as well

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.850

out to get another mortar and another
wizard<00:04:58.110> tower<00:04:58.289> what<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.620> want<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.949> do<00:04:59.039> is

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
wizard tower what I want to do is

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.490 
wizard tower what I want to do is
probably<00:04:59.940> upgrade<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.479> new<00:05:00.630> stuff<00:05:00.930> up<00:05:01.139> to<00:05:01.380> the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
probably upgrade the new stuff up to the

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.439 
probably upgrade the new stuff up to the
level<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.919> my<00:05:02.099> old<00:05:02.280> stuffs<00:05:02.639> once<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:02.970> get<00:05:03.150> my<00:05:03.270> new

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
level of my old stuffs once I get my new

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.960 
level of my old stuffs once I get my new
mortar<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.930> level<00:05:04.169> 3<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.620> my<00:05:05.490> new<00:05:05.610> wizard

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
mortar to level 3 and my new wizard

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.600 
mortar to level 3 and my new wizard
tower<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.330> level<00:05:06.659> level<00:05:07.560> 2<00:05:07.770> then<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.340> can<00:05:08.490> go

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
tower to level level 2 then I can go

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.089 
tower to level level 2 then I can go
ahead<00:05:08.699> and<00:05:08.909> upgrade<00:05:09.120> this<00:05:09.479> guy<00:05:09.690> to<00:05:10.319> the<00:05:10.830> next

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
ahead and upgrade this guy to the next

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.279 
ahead and upgrade this guy to the next
level<00:05:11.370> because<00:05:11.520> then<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.810> know<00:05:12.840> they're<00:05:13.110> sort

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
level because then you know they're sort

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.200 
level because then you know they're sort
of<00:05:13.380> equalized<00:05:14.069> there's<00:05:14.550> no<00:05:14.699> sort<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:14.969> weak

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
of equalized there's no sort of weak

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.020 
of equalized there's no sort of weak
weaker<00:05:16.199> defense<00:05:16.620> if<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:17.009> get<00:05:17.250> my<00:05:17.400> wizard<00:05:17.759> towers

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
weaker defense if I get my wizard towers

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.240 
weaker defense if I get my wizard towers
up<00:05:18.180> a<00:05:18.240> little<00:05:18.389> bit<00:05:18.539> equally<00:05:18.990> so<00:05:19.800> hopefully

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
up a little bit equally so hopefully

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.159 
up a little bit equally so hopefully
that<00:05:20.400> makes<00:05:20.430> sense<00:05:20.789> and<00:05:21.030> then<00:05:21.569> the<00:05:21.810> next<00:05:22.050> thing

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
that makes sense and then the next thing

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.260 
that makes sense and then the next thing
you<00:05:22.259> want<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.440> probably<00:05:22.770> prioritize<00:05:23.430> is<00:05:23.699> your

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
you want to probably prioritize is your

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.420 
you want to probably prioritize is your
army<00:05:24.690> camps<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.199> your<00:05:25.650> barracks<00:05:26.009> you<00:05:26.219> know

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
army camps and your barracks you know

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.830 
army camps and your barracks you know
right<00:05:26.610> now<00:05:26.729> if<00:05:26.819> you<00:05:26.909> upgrade<00:05:27.210> your<00:05:27.240> army<00:05:27.539> camps

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
right now if you upgrade your army camps

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.890 
right now if you upgrade your army camps
you<00:05:27.870> only<00:05:28.050> get<00:05:28.199> +5<00:05:28.909> army<00:05:29.909> space<00:05:30.210> additional<00:05:30.539> or

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
you only get +5 army space additional or

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.230 
you only get +5 army space additional or
+5<00:05:31.349> housing<00:05:31.800> space<00:05:32.009> additional<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:32.729> that

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
+5 housing space additional and that

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.230 
+5 housing space additional and that
does<00:05:33.389> help<00:05:33.630> but<00:05:34.199> it's<00:05:34.740> not<00:05:34.889> as<00:05:35.430> necessary<00:05:35.759> as

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
does help but it's not as necessary as

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.959 
does help but it's not as necessary as
like<00:05:36.539> your<00:05:36.690> storages<00:05:37.199> and<00:05:37.469> your<00:05:37.620> new<00:05:37.770> stuff<00:05:38.099> so

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
like your storages and your new stuff so

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:40.640 
like your storages and your new stuff so
you<00:05:39.029> want<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.210> go<00:05:39.300> ahead<00:05:39.389> and<00:05:39.659> put<00:05:40.199> those<00:05:40.319> army

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
you want to go ahead and put those army

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.589 
you want to go ahead and put those army
camps<00:05:40.949> in<00:05:41.039> those<00:05:41.159> barracks<00:05:41.520> sort<00:05:42.270> of<00:05:42.330> on<00:05:42.479> the

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
camps in those barracks sort of on the

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.529 
camps in those barracks sort of on the
lower<00:05:42.840> priority<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:44.639> other<00:05:45.000> thing<00:05:45.300> about

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
lower priority and the other thing about

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.749 
lower priority and the other thing about
upgrading<00:05:46.500> your<00:05:46.590> barracks<00:05:46.979> if<00:05:47.039> you<00:05:47.490> raid

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
upgrading your barracks if you raid

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.269 
upgrading your barracks if you raid
non-stop<00:05:48.449> like<00:05:48.630> I<00:05:48.750> said<00:05:49.020> you<00:05:49.800> might<00:05:49.979> just<00:05:50.069> want

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
non-stop like I said you might just want

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.189 
non-stop like I said you might just want
to<00:05:50.340> upgrade<00:05:50.460> one<00:05:51.120> barracks<00:05:51.659> because<00:05:51.840> if<00:05:52.110> you

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
to upgrade one barracks because if you

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.040 
to upgrade one barracks because if you
take<00:05:52.560> more<00:05:52.830> barracks<00:05:53.219> offline<00:05:53.699> it<00:05:53.909> will<00:05:54.810> take

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
take more barracks offline it will take

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.920 
take more barracks offline it will take
you<00:05:55.319> a<00:05:56.130> lot<00:05:56.639> longer<00:05:56.699> to<00:05:57.060> produce<00:05:57.210> troops<00:05:57.719> and

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
you a lot longer to produce troops and

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.230 
you a lot longer to produce troops and
then<00:05:58.080> as<00:05:58.319> a<00:05:58.380> result<00:05:59.039> as<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.490> consequence<00:06:00.029> he'll

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
then as a result as a consequence he'll

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.480 
then as a result as a consequence he'll
take<00:06:00.389> you<00:06:00.539> on<00:06:00.750> longer<00:06:01.199> to<00:06:01.349> raid<00:06:01.590> back<00:06:02.159> and<00:06:02.370> back

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
take you on longer to raid back and back

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.490 
take you on longer to raid back and back
to<00:06:02.639> back<00:06:02.789> I<00:06:03.090> would<00:06:03.719> recommend<00:06:04.139> though<00:06:04.199> taking

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
to back I would recommend though taking

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.230 
to back I would recommend though taking
one<00:06:04.650> barracks<00:06:04.949> upgrading<00:06:05.699> that<00:06:05.729> to<00:06:06.120> the

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
one barracks upgrading that to the

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.719 
one barracks upgrading that to the
healer<00:06:06.599> because<00:06:07.229> that<00:06:07.830> that<00:06:08.219> barracks<00:06:08.610> can

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
healer because that that barracks can

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.850 
healer because that that barracks can
basically<00:06:09.210> be<00:06:09.569> your<00:06:09.690> dedicated<00:06:10.409> healer

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
basically be your dedicated healer

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.610 
basically be your dedicated healer
barracks<00:06:11.279> and<00:06:11.430> I<00:06:12.240> can<00:06:13.110> go<00:06:13.199> ahead<00:06:13.229> and<00:06:13.440> show<00:06:13.560> you

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
barracks and I can go ahead and show you

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.019 
barracks and I can go ahead and show you
some<00:06:13.770> giant<00:06:14.099> human<00:06:14.340> raids<00:06:14.490> in<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.669> next

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
some giant human raids in the next

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.540 
some giant human raids in the next
episode<00:06:15.449> but<00:06:16.050> right<00:06:16.650> now<00:06:16.770> we<00:06:16.830> can't<00:06:17.190> really<00:06:17.400> do

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
episode but right now we can't really do

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.089 
episode but right now we can't really do
that<00:06:17.580> because<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.150> got<00:06:18.539> a<00:06:18.569> lot<00:06:18.750> of<00:06:18.810> stuff<00:06:19.169> going

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
that because I got a lot of stuff going

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.769 
that because I got a lot of stuff going
on<00:06:20.159> in<00:06:20.340> terms<00:06:20.490> of<00:06:20.639> upgrades<00:06:21.090> but<00:06:21.479> hopefully

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779 
on in terms of upgrades but hopefully

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.870 
on in terms of upgrades but hopefully
that<00:06:21.900> makes<00:06:22.080> sense<00:06:22.289> just<00:06:22.409> to<00:06:22.800> recap<00:06:23.159> in<00:06:23.400> terms

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
that makes sense just to recap in terms

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.309 
that makes sense just to recap in terms
of<00:06:24.029> what<00:06:24.180> we<00:06:24.270> kind<00:06:24.449> of<00:06:24.539> covered<00:06:24.900> in<00:06:24.990> terms<00:06:25.139> of

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
of what we kind of covered in terms of

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.320 
of what we kind of covered in terms of
upgrades<00:06:25.770> you<00:06:26.159> want<00:06:26.310> to<00:06:26.370> prioritize<00:06:26.550> your<00:06:27.090> lab
