00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.109
 the small fixed hour for cartons 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.019
 Japanese is among my favorites 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.210
 there were the five samurai and I never say never 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.340
 I would have expected one day to be able 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 wear the mythical white armor la 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.630
 more powerful than all and above all that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.279
 it was excellent branded and get on board 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.689
 of the new honda civic type r is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.029
 exactly how to wear 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.570
 that armor because it is striking but so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.949
 it must be 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.560
 and when you mind you don't put it through 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.810
 go to a wedding but have fun 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.120
 driving with front-wheel drive that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 he turned harding in 7 minutes and 50 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.079
 seconds and 63 cents 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 a record for the category when a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.050
 geneva interviews the project leader 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.360
 of the type r 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 in his Japanese composure he made me 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 understand in a flash how excited he was 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 in having equipped the type r of the engine 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.750
 more extreme than the history of the civic 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 or a four-cylinder 2-liter turbo 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.399
 310 horsepower mutek at 6,500 rpm and one 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.609
 pair of 400 meters at 2,500 rpm and the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.369
 all as I can translate it to 57 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.260
 seconds in the 0 100 270 kilometers per hour 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.119
 of maximum speed make the idea of 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.689
 what drives this honda and despite 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.020
 whether full optional the weight stops 1386 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.570
 kg nurburgring but also on luca and notch 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.790
 on the honda circuit it has passed 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.560
 from cfd computer models a 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.659
 endurance tests on the track to avoid 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.189
 turbulence and guarantee the efficient one 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.880
 aerodynamics that one needs 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.890
 sports from 270 km oral but it derives 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.900
 from a production car then with 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.430
 normal shapes and volumes 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.090
 and then the 19 inch wheels are welcome 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.290
 inch and 350 mm perforated disc 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.820
 with brembo pliers 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.189
 but when it goes well beyond speed 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 code serves all possible grip 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.880
 including the one that can give weight 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.220
 air thanks to the speakers that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.960
 cracks behind the front wheels are 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.119
 there by chance they serve to ventilate and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.600
 cool because this civic is one 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600
 real couple 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.369
 you can be passionate about traction 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.789
 rear off-road camels coins 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.650
 ancient 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.650
 what you want but in terms of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.349
 front sports waves know the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.840
 made them and I believe that each set of 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.970
 all ahead I have one in my heart 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.269
 personally I have always had a weakness 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.380
 for the integra type r and for the civic e 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.870
 g6 the one in 94 95 up to the last type 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.420
 r that is, the one before this everything is 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.709
 always went smooth and smooth 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.569
 I mean aspirated 160 190 200 horses that 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.340
 they turned very high this was the 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.560
 trend to which the Hondists are 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.560
 accustomed over the years and now comes to her 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.180
 with 310 horsepower motor and equipped with force 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.500
 dreams technology a little 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.790
 advanced turbocharger that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.250
 represents a great revolution 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.680
 necessary to keep up with the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.569
 several megane rs leon cupra that for a long time 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.569
 have exceeded 250 horses 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.720
 it pulls up to 6,500 rpm and without that 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.360
 annoying building case maybe typical of 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.760
 turbo that in the guide however fluid a little 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.570
 it annoys us to put a little 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.610
 in view of a minimum delay to the low that 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.620
 however it compensates with a progression 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.500
 really phenomenal up to the red zone 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.500
 a small flaw then perhaps the sound that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.980
 it's not as addictive as one 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.170
 might think looking at the back 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.470
 with that beautiful Latvian four terminals 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.470
 of discharge 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.000
 thought you had forgotten but how 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.269
 you can forget about a change like this 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.069
 This six-speed manual is mechanical 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.459
 really sporty and reminds me closely 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.110
 that of the s2000 is a real must always 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.060
 in the passenger compartment the air you breathe is 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.560
 very race with bucket seats and 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.480
 visible red stitching 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.700
 besides the system to the mid that makes everything 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.230
 more exciting thanks to the accelerometer 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.209
 brake pressure indicator e 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.730
 accelerator even if the real gem is 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.769
 the mode r most selectable from the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.329
 special button creating the steering more 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.910
 rigid the most ready engine and the 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.620
 suspension 30 % tougher e 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.410
 what better place to try the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.160
 most r mode here at the slovakia ring 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.080
 la civic is a paradise from the bars in this one 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.580
 configuration turns into a real one 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.740
 track animal 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.720
 in fact, just a few turns are enough 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.910
 understand that this suit is ahead and much 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.130
 specialist and refined the front is 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.289
 ever plant and there is no way to 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.180
 break it down the back it looks like 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.010
 dancer but this is exactly the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.169
 setting wanted by the honda to do it 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.570
 turn into a curve and exit even more 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.400
 strong and understeer what little 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.349
 enough to remember that it is a 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.060
 front but thanks to the auto blocker 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.099
 mechanical all the euphoria of the 2 liters 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.380
 is discharged to the ground and when yes 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:55.840
 exaggerates the brakes always put a party 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.550
 the tireless, the most powerful, I would have you 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.650
 could talk about the back skill 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.660
 of the versatility of this space 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.460
 civic type r yes but I didn't 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.200
 instead I wanted to put myself in a 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.180
 passionate about driving willing to 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.130
 spend 37 thousand euros for what it is 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.080
 front wheel drive to beat in the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.400
 segment of compact sports cars and that 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.250
 cares if when he goes shopping 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.979
 it is striking because it knows that for 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.479
 fight between the curbs of a track 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.479
 this is the armor you need
