to these that made them a whole lot
smoother<00:00:17.610> you<00:00:17.850> know<00:00:17.970> I'm<00:00:18.120> sure<00:00:18.330> just<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:19.140> by

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
smoother you know I'm sure just just by

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.410 
smoother you know I'm sure just just by
using<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:19.950> gonna<00:00:20.130> wear<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
using them you're gonna wear them in a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.120 
using them you're gonna wear them in a
little<00:00:21.750> bit<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.050> there's<00:00:22.230> things<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.949> do

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
before you even put them into the in

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.279 
before you even put them into the in
service<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.449> that's<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> help<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
service that that's going to help you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
service that that's going to help you

out make it easier to set them and make
them<00:00:30.839> a<00:00:31.050> little<00:00:31.259> more<00:00:32.420> sensitive<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.160> might

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
them a little more sensitive and might

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.830 
them a little more sensitive and might
increase<00:00:35.460> your<00:00:35.520> catches<00:00:35.970> I'm<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.270> sure<00:00:36.480> but

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
increase your catches I'm not sure but

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.820 
increase your catches I'm not sure but
anyway<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:40.070> these<00:00:41.070> two<00:00:41.250> bars<00:00:41.490> here<00:00:42.830> they're

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
anyway this these two bars here they're

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.490 
anyway this these two bars here they're
dipped<00:00:44.540> to<00:00:46.370> slow<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.230> corrosion<00:00:49.230> I'm

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
dipped to slow down the corrosion I'm

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.760 
dipped to slow down the corrosion I'm
sure<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:51.360> tops<00:00:51.630> of<00:00:51.780> these<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.380> dip<00:00:52.590> on

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
sure the tops of these have that dip on

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.570 
sure the tops of these have that dip on
there<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.130> this<00:00:53.220> rod<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:56.720> slides<00:00:57.720> back<00:00:58.580> on

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
there and this rod that slides back on

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.200 
there and this rod that slides back on
there<00:01:00.710> County<00:01:01.710> gets<00:01:01.890> stuck<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> little<00:01:02.400> bit<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
there County gets stuck a little bit you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.710 
there County gets stuck a little bit you
can<00:01:03.330> see<00:01:03.390> maybe<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.909> dip<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.299> worn<00:01:06.570> off

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
can see maybe where the dip is worn off

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.090 
can see maybe where the dip is worn off
the<00:01:06.840> top<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.260> bar<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:08.899> right<00:01:09.899> here

here<00:02:09.840> there's<00:02:10.769> a<00:02:11.420> little<00:02:12.420> tab<00:02:12.959> here<00:02:14.030> over<00:02:15.030> here

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
here there's a little tab here over here

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.710 
here there's a little tab here over here
on<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:16.220> don't<00:02:17.220> know<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.489> times<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.120> Jim

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
on the I don't know the times that Jim

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.949 
on the I don't know the times that Jim
uses<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.250> gonna<00:02:20.400> butcher<00:02:21.329> this<00:02:21.660> stuff

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
uses so I'm not gonna butcher this stuff

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.610 
uses so I'm not gonna butcher this stuff
here<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
here that this is the this is the the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.210 
here that this is the this is the the
actual<00:02:27.290> mechanism<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.410> sets<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.739> trap<00:02:28.980> off

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
actual mechanism that sets the trap off

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.569 
actual mechanism that sets the trap off
there's<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> moving<00:02:30.329> part<00:02:30.569> here<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:34.739> goes<00:02:34.950> it

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
there's a moving part here it goes it

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.009 
there's a moving part here it goes it
goes<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.970> top<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.510> can't<00:02:36.780> do<00:02:36.900> this

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
goes on top of that I can't do this

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.670 
goes on top of that I can't do this
one-handed<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.630> yeah<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> can<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.260> can<00:02:40.530> do<00:02:40.620> it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
one-handed but yeah I can I can do it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.920 
one-handed but yeah I can I can do it
the<00:02:40.769> way<00:02:40.799> Jim<00:02:41.069> showed<00:02:41.400> me<00:02:41.549> there<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.120> okay

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the way Jim showed me there we go okay

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.809 
the way Jim showed me there we go okay
these<00:02:43.470> two<00:02:43.530> parts<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.160> they<00:02:44.340> move<00:02:44.489> against

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
these two parts here they move against

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.270 
these two parts here they move against
each<00:02:44.940> other<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.660> animal<00:02:46.200> walks<00:02:46.680> through<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
each other the animal walks through the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.640 
each other the animal walks through the
trout<00:02:47.700> net<00:02:48.090> falls<00:02:48.329> that<00:02:48.840> closes<00:02:49.200> book<00:02:49.380> doors

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
trout net falls that closes book doors

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.860 
trout net falls that closes book doors
yeah<00:02:50.400> anything<00:02:50.700> moves<00:02:51.090> I'll<00:02:51.420> lubricate<00:02:51.840> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
yeah anything moves I'll lubricate it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.390 
yeah anything moves I'll lubricate it
just<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.139> little<00:02:52.260> bit<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.530> may<00:02:52.799> not<00:02:53.010> do<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.280> in

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
just a little bit I may not do that in

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.520 
just a little bit I may not do that in
future<00:02:53.519> but<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:53.910> now<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.450> helped<00:02:54.630> me<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.380> wear

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
future but for now it helped me to wear

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.140 
future but for now it helped me to wear
things<00:02:55.829> in<00:02:56.010> another<00:02:56.280> thing<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.639> this<00:02:56.819> little

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
things in another thing is this little

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.000 
things in another thing is this little
this<00:02:58.019> little<00:02:58.079> catch<00:02:59.299> right<00:03:00.299> here<00:03:00.540> was<00:03:01.019> code

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
this little catch right here was code

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
this little catch right here was code
coated<00:03:02.730> pretty<00:03:03.000> heavy<00:03:03.180> with<00:03:03.600> dip<00:03:04.579> I<00:03:05.579> put<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
coated pretty heavy with dip I put a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.340 
coated pretty heavy with dip I put a
little<00:03:06.150> bit<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.359> Vaseline<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.049> part<00:03:07.290> and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
little bit of Vaseline on that part and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.620 
little bit of Vaseline on that part and
just<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.739> work<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.040> back<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.280> forth<00:03:08.630> you

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
just kind of work it back and forth you

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.849 
just kind of work it back and forth you
can<00:03:09.660> take<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> knife<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.230> scrape<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.650> off

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
can take a knife and scrape it off

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.259 
can take a knife and scrape it off
whatever<00:03:11.069> I'm<00:03:11.519> sure<00:03:11.819> that's<00:03:11.970> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.180> get

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
whatever I'm sure that's going to get

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.640 
whatever I'm sure that's going to get
corroded<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.750> little<00:03:12.959> bit<00:03:13.109> but<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> little<00:03:13.530> bit

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
corroded a little bit but a little bit

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.809 
corroded a little bit but a little bit
of<00:03:13.739> Vaseline<00:03:13.889> might<00:03:14.370> keep<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.549> from

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
of Vaseline might keep that from

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.539 
of Vaseline might keep that from
happening<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:16.560> works<00:03:16.859> a<00:03:17.069> whole<00:03:17.099> lot

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
happening and it works a whole lot

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.879 
happening and it works a whole lot
smoother<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.329> a<00:03:18.420> fast<00:03:18.720> fast<00:03:19.139> trap<00:03:19.590> I

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
smoother now it's a fast fast trap I

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.289 
smoother now it's a fast fast trap I
can't<00:03:20.099> wait<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.370> get<00:03:20.489> in<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.670> field<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.150> catch

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
can't wait to get in the field and catch

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.440 
can't wait to get in the field and catch
some<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.569> those<00:03:21.630> armadillos<00:03:22.230> there
