remove all the slight marks and and
really<00:02:22.800> make<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.100> look<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.610> good<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> day<00:02:24.240> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
really make it look as good as the day I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.430 
really make it look as good as the day I
was<00:02:24.540> new<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.110> I'm<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.770> directional<00:02:26.430> brush<00:02:27.440> so

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
was new and I'm the directional brush so

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.890 
was new and I'm the directional brush so
we<00:02:28.470> take<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:28.980> 14<00:02:29.460> gauge<00:02:29.670> material<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.540> we

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
we take this 14 gauge material and we

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.590 
we take this 14 gauge material and we
bond<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> substrate<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:33.210> water

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
bond it to a substrate it's water

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.760 
bond it to a substrate it's water
resistant<00:02:34.170> fiber<00:02:34.380> core<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:36.150> bonded<00:02:36.660> 100%<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
resistant fiber core it's bonded 100% so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.260 
resistant fiber core it's bonded 100% so
it's<00:02:37.920> got<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> solid<00:02:38.430> feel

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's got a solid feel

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.570 
it's got a solid feel
we<00:02:39.960> put<00:02:40.200> soundproofing<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> backs<00:02:41.400> of
