contact<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.120> barrier<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.750> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
contact with that barrier but it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710 
contact with that barrier but it's
spawned<00:01:04.260> around<00:01:04.530> anyway<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:06.030> are<00:01:06.270> down<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720

eighth place and we have a bit of a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
eighth place and we have a bit of a
challenge<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.960> how<00:01:10.110> many<00:01:10.290> places<00:01:10.650> we

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
challenge now to see how many places we

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.030 
challenge now to see how many places we
can<00:01:11.189> gain<00:01:11.659> my<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.590> hand<00:01:13.710> corner<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the car is completely ended but that is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.170 
the car is completely ended but that is
pretty<00:01:16.830> much<00:01:17.009> standard<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.729> Top<00:01:17.909> Gear<00:01:18.150> test

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
for no reason I think he saw me there
maybe<00:01:57.329> he's<00:01:57.540> using<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.899> cockpit<00:01:58.380> view<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
maybe he's using the cockpit view can

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.790 
maybe he's using the cockpit view can
quite<00:01:59.250> see<00:01:59.280> me<00:01:59.700> then<00:02:00.240> his<00:02:00.360> blind<00:02:00.659> spot

Mercedes<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.640> miles<00:03:05.790> ahead<00:03:06.020> hopefully

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
Mercedes and miles ahead hopefully

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.690 
Mercedes and miles ahead hopefully
Ferrari<00:03:07.380> or<00:03:07.620> someone<00:03:08.070> can<00:03:08.220> catch<00:03:08.400> up<00:03:08.580> with

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
Ferrari or someone can catch up with

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.320 
Ferrari or someone can catch up with
them<00:03:08.820> by<00:03:08.940> doubt<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:11.940> helped<00:03:12.120> run

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
them by doubt it and so you helped run

is<00:03:12.510> very<00:03:12.750> easy<00:03:12.930> battle<00:03:13.350> between<00:03:13.650> hamilton<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
is very easy battle between hamilton and

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.729 
is very easy battle between hamilton and
Rosberg<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.570> think<00:03:15.989> Hamilton<00:03:16.230> had<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.590> covered

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
Rosberg I think Hamilton had it covered

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.000 
Rosberg I think Hamilton had it covered
really<00:03:18.110> McCarron<00:03:19.110> miles<00:03:19.320> behind<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.830> don't

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
really McCarron miles behind I don't

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.250 
really McCarron miles behind I don't
think<00:03:20.160> they'll<00:03:20.280> catch<00:03:20.489> up<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:20.970> year<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.570> mean

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
think they'll catch up this year I mean

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.720 
think they'll catch up this year I mean
Oh<00:03:22.410> long<00:03:22.560> as<00:03:22.680> they<00:03:22.770> must<00:03:22.920> be<00:03:23.070> trying<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.700> not

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
Oh long as they must be trying I'm not

he's he just doesn't want to race

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.290 
he's he just doesn't want to race
