then his third skills attacks enemy
moving<00:00:30.269> next<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.810> damage<00:00:31.109> increased<00:00:31.619> by<00:00:31.910> 50%

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
moving next the damage increased by 50%

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
moving next the damage increased by 50%
if<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> target<00:00:34.860> HP<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.760> below<00:00:36.059> 50%<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.739> he<00:00:38.129> has

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
if the target HP is below 50% so he has

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.600 
if the target HP is below 50% so he has
increased<00:00:38.730> critical<00:00:39.000> rate<00:00:39.300> by<00:00:39.510> 15%<00:00:40.550> so<00:00:41.550> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
increased critical rate by 15% so you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.260 
increased critical rate by 15% so you
can<00:00:41.879> bill<00:00:42.030> him<00:00:42.739> critical<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.940> eager<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
critical rate bill because his third

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
critical rate bill because his third
skills<00:00:53.850> conditional<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> he<00:00:56.160> does<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> lot

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
skills conditional and he does a lot

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.720 
skills conditional and he does a lot
more<00:00:56.579> damage<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:57.660> his<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.010> target<00:00:59.340> HP<00:00:59.670> is

more damage when his the target HP is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.869 
more damage when his the target HP is
below<00:00:59.969> 50%<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.949> I'm<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.129> sure<00:01:02.340> about<00:01:02.460> rage

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
below 50% so I'm not sure about rage

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.170 
below 50% so I'm not sure about rage
bull<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.830> rage<00:01:04.830> place<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.189> viable<00:01:05.369> bill<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.060> then

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
bull a rage place a viable bill but then

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.270 
bull a rage place a viable bill but then
you<00:01:06.299> would<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:07.380> wouldn't<00:01:07.650> lend<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:07.920> D<00:01:08.070> buffs

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you would you wouldn't lend your D buffs

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.100 
you would you wouldn't lend your D buffs
as<00:01:08.430> much<00:01:08.670> because<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.420> accuracy

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
as much because you don't have accuracy

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.980 
as much because you don't have accuracy
so<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> either<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.240> rageblade

so if you can either do rageblade

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.490 
so if you can either do rageblade
or<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.950> could<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.369> fatal<00:01:15.270> focus<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
or you could do fatal focus and then you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.770 
or you could do fatal focus and then you
focus<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.070> lending<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.670> D<00:01:17.880> buffs<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
conditional so it might not be the best

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.800 
conditional so it might not be the best
and<00:01:48.780> we're<00:01:48.869> gonna<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> water<00:01:49.590> one

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and we're gonna look at the water one

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.710 
and we're gonna look at the water one
as<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.590> water<00:01:52.799> wine

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.679 

the<00:02:00.230> water<00:02:00.470> one<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:03.700> somewhere

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.600 

alright<00:02:08.349> so<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.709> water<00:02:08.920> one<00:02:09.099> can<00:02:09.340> steal

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
alright so the water one can steal

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.720 
alright so the water one can steal
beneficial<00:02:10.330> effects<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.899> second<00:02:11.260> skill

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
beneficial effects so the second skill

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.300 
beneficial effects so the second skill
increases<00:02:12.730> his<00:02:13.120> attack<00:02:13.480> age<00:02:13.690> by<00:02:13.959> 50%<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.830> his

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
third skill attacks twice and then can

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.839 
third skill attacks twice and then can
steal<00:02:19.090> one<00:02:19.480> beneficial<00:02:20.110> effect<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.849> 75%

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
steal one beneficial effect of a 75%

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.759 
steal one beneficial effect of a 75%
chance<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.569> believe<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.290> max<00:02:23.530> out<00:02:23.709> his

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
chance I believe in you max out his

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.250 
chance I believe in you max out his
skill<00:02:24.280> it's<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.819> hundred<00:02:25.060> percent<00:02:25.209> chance<00:02:25.660> so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
effects if you have a lot of accuracy so

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.280 
effects if you have a lot of accuracy so
he's<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.680> great<00:02:32.980> counter<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.580> Chloe<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.629> if<00:02:35.080> you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
he's a great counter to Chloe and if you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.110 
he's a great counter to Chloe and if you
get<00:02:35.470> him<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.890> would<00:02:36.160> suggest<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.700> use<00:02:36.760> him

have as much accuracy as you can and

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.600 
have as much accuracy as you can and
then<00:02:50.079> you<00:02:50.110> can<00:02:50.230> go<00:02:50.319> offensive<00:02:50.920> slot<00:02:51.129> to<00:02:51.370> you

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
then you can go offensive slot to you

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.789 
then you can go offensive slot to you
want<00:02:51.790> attack<00:02:52.090> percent<00:02:52.450> slot<00:02:53.230> forward<00:02:53.680> you

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
want attack percent slot forward you

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.520 
want attack percent slot forward you
wanna<00:02:53.980> tech<00:02:54.220> percent<00:02:54.579> as<00:02:54.700> well<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.450> then<00:02:56.230> slow

wanna tech percent as well and then slow

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.220 
wanna tech percent as well and then slow
sex<00:02:56.769> you<00:02:56.829> want<00:02:56.920> accuracy<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.690> he<00:02:58.810> does<00:02:58.989> have<00:02:59.200> a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
sex you want accuracy so he does have a

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.530 
sex you want accuracy so he does have a
building<00:02:59.799> accuracy<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.459> 25<00:03:00.579> percent<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.480> you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
building accuracy of 25 percent so you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.009 
building accuracy of 25 percent so you
can<00:03:01.870> forego<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:03.430> focus<00:03:04.000> rune<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.629> fatal

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
can forego the focus rune and go fatal

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.800 
can forego the focus rune and go fatal
blade<00:03:06.569> or<00:03:07.569> even<00:03:07.959> reach<00:03:08.140> blade<00:03:08.470> if<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.739> want<00:03:09.010> to

blade or even reach blade if you want to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.750 
blade or even reach blade if you want to
but<00:03:10.810> fatal<00:03:11.049> blade<00:03:11.349> is<00:03:11.650> another<00:03:12.160> viable<00:03:12.370> bill

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
but fatal blade is another viable bill

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.539 
but fatal blade is another viable bill
and<00:03:13.000> then<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.930> want<00:03:14.109> accuracy<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.680> slot<00:03:14.920> 6<00:03:15.250> if

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
and then you want accuracy on slot 6 if

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.819 
and then you want accuracy on slot 6 if
you<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.790> go<00:03:15.940> fatal<00:03:16.299> blade<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.590> we're<00:03:17.709> gonna

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
you do go fatal blade and we're gonna

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.199 
you do go fatal blade and we're gonna
look<00:03:17.950> at<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.190> win<00:03:18.340> one<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:19.569> win<00:03:19.840> one<00:03:20.200> is

his third skill I reviewed him a while

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.470 
his third skill I reviewed him a while
ago<00:03:28.260> alright<00:03:29.260> so<00:03:29.410> he<00:03:29.530> has<00:03:29.620> continues<00:03:30.010> damage

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
of the HP is consumed but the critical

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.559 
of the HP is consumed but the critical
rate<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.870> increased<00:03:41.650> by<00:03:41.859> hundred<00:03:42.790> percent<00:03:43.090> so

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
rate is increased by hundred percent so

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:44.520 
rate is increased by hundred percent so
technically<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.989> don't<00:03:44.169> need<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.349> build

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
technically you don't need to build

critical rate on him he has a he has
resistance<00:03:48.099> as<00:03:48.340> his<00:03:48.519> increased<00:03:49.000> ability<00:03:49.480> so

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
resistance as his increased ability so

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.190 
resistance as his increased ability so
you<00:03:50.440> can<00:03:50.799> go<00:03:50.919> reach<00:03:51.160> focus<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.970> rage<00:03:52.810> focus

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
you can go reach focus and rage focus

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.409 
you can go reach focus and rage focus
will<00:03:53.410> mean<00:03:53.590> he's<00:03:54.040> history<00:03:54.579> skill<00:03:54.819> does<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> lot

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
will mean he's history skill does a lot

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.839 
will mean he's history skill does a lot
of<00:03:55.480> damage<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.220> onslaught<00:03:57.220> too<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.669> can

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
of damage and onslaught too you can

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.520 
of damage and onslaught too you can
either<00:03:57.970> go<00:03:59.400> speed<00:04:00.400> or<00:04:00.700> attack<00:04:01.540> percent<00:04:01.959> and

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
either go speed or attack percent and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.610 
either go speed or attack percent and
then<00:04:03.069> slot<00:04:03.370> 4<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:04.090> can<00:04:04.269> go<00:04:04.510> attack<00:04:05.200> percent

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
then slot 4 you can go attack percent

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.580 
then slot 4 you can go attack percent
and<00:04:05.799> then<00:04:05.950> saw<00:04:06.190> six<00:04:06.459> accuracy<00:04:07.120> percent

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.140 

actually<00:04:10.590> no<00:04:10.769> actually<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.670> want<00:04:11.879> speed

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
actually no actually you you want speed

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.149 
actually no actually you you want speed
on<00:04:12.269> your<00:04:12.299> slot<00:04:12.810> too<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.260> he<00:04:13.409> attacks<00:04:13.739> more

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
on your slot too so he attacks more

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.029 
on your slot too so he attacks more
often<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:15.049> then<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.620> reduce<00:04:16.889> the

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
often and then you can reduce the

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.819 
often and then you can reduce the
cooldown<00:04:17.280> for<00:04:17.459> his<00:04:17.850> resentment<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.620> rate

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
cooldown for his resentment so rate

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.340 
cooldown for his resentment so rate
focus<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.789> my<00:04:21.269> ideal<00:04:21.630> choice<00:04:21.840> that's<00:04:22.199> how<00:04:22.320> I

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
focus is is my ideal choice that's how I

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.650 
focus is is my ideal choice that's how I
will<00:04:22.710> build<00:04:22.889> him<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:24.120> there's<00:04:24.270> also<00:04:24.479> other

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
will build him but there's also other

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.150 
will build him but there's also other
bills<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.229> know<00:04:25.320> rageblade<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:26.039> you

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
bills like you know rageblade if you

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.210 
bills like you know rageblade if you
want<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.570> but<00:04:27.570> I<00:04:28.020> think<00:04:28.080> reach<00:04:28.410> focus<00:04:28.770> is<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:28.949> lot

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
want to but I think reach focus is a lot

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.460 
want to but I think reach focus is a lot
better<00:04:29.750> alright<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:30.900> let's<00:04:31.110> look<00:04:31.229> at<00:04:31.380> the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.150 
better alright so let's look at the
light<00:04:31.650> one<00:04:32.509> the<00:04:33.509> light<00:04:33.750> one<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:37.160> here

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
light one the light one is here

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.820 
light one the light one is here
somewhere<00:04:38.789> I<00:04:39.590> gotta<00:04:40.590> find<00:04:40.800> him

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.189 

all<00:04:47.370> right<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:47.729> he<00:04:48.240> has<00:04:48.360> Ruffalo<00:04:48.750> attack<00:04:49.020> as

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
all right so he has Ruffalo attack as

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.710 
all right so he has Ruffalo attack as
well<00:04:49.500> his<00:04:49.770> third<00:04:49.949> skill<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.250> attacks<00:04:51.150> enemy<00:04:51.479> to

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
well his third skill is attacks enemy to

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.980 
well his third skill is attacks enemy to
make<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.110> enemy<00:04:52.379> attack<00:04:52.770> h0<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.520> stuns<00:04:54.479> enemy

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
make the enemy attack h0 and stuns enemy

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.969 
make the enemy attack h0 and stuns enemy
for<00:04:55.289> one<00:04:55.470> turn

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
for one turn

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.249 
for one turn
okay<00:04:56.669> so<00:04:56.729> fatal<00:04:57.090> focus<00:04:57.509> is<00:04:57.780> definitely

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
okay so fatal focus is definitely

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.980 
okay so fatal focus is definitely
something<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.949> want<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.780> then<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:00.960> can

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
something you want and then you can

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.159 
something you want and then you can
either<00:05:01.349> go<00:05:01.560> speed<00:05:02.039> onslaught<00:05:02.639> too<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.180> then

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
either go speed onslaught too and then

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.960 
either go speed onslaught too and then
attack<00:05:04.470> percent<00:05:04.770> slot<00:05:04.979> for<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.430> accuracy

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
attack percent slot for and accuracy

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.330 
attack percent slot for and accuracy
percent<00:05:06.330> slot<00:05:06.629> six<00:05:07.050> he<00:05:07.889> has<00:05:07.979> increased

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
percent slot six he has increased

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.600 
percent slot six he has increased
critical<00:05:08.639> rate<00:05:08.909> by<00:05:09.090> 15%<00:05:10.250> he<00:05:11.250> doesn't<00:05:11.520> have

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
critical rate by 15% he doesn't have

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.969 
critical rate by 15% he doesn't have
very<00:05:11.639> high<00:05:11.940> base<00:05:12.270> attack<00:05:12.629> power<00:05:12.810> so<00:05:13.470> I<00:05:13.770> don't

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
very high base attack power so I don't

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.249 
very high base attack power so I don't
know<00:05:14.069> Rach<00:05:14.370> Rach<00:05:14.729> but<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:15.120> still<00:05:15.300> viable<00:05:15.479> but

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
know Rach Rach but it's still viable but

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.330 
know Rach Rach but it's still viable but
I<00:05:16.319> think<00:05:16.530> failed<00:05:16.740> blade<00:05:17.009> there's<00:05:17.190> also

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
I think failed blade there's also

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.520 
I think failed blade there's also
something<00:05:17.639> you<00:05:17.789> might<00:05:17.970> want<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.150> check<00:05:18.300> out

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
something you might want to check out

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.020 
something you might want to check out
and<00:05:19.530> if<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:19.740> do<00:05:19.860> fatal<00:05:20.190> blade<00:05:20.400> then<00:05:20.639> you<00:05:20.789> want

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
and if you do fatal blade then you want

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.600 
and if you do fatal blade then you want
or<00:05:21.449> H<00:05:22.050> play<00:05:22.259> then<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.500> want<00:05:22.650> 10%<00:05:22.860> slot<00:05:23.370> to

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
or H play then you want 10% slot to

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.450 
or H play then you want 10% slot to
create<00:05:24.569> damage<00:05:25.110> percent<00:05:25.620> slot<00:05:25.830> for<00:05:26.129> and<00:05:26.340> then

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
create damage percent slot for and then

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.399 
create damage percent slot for and then
a<00:05:26.580> patek<00:05:26.940> percent<00:05:27.240> slot<00:05:27.449> 6<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:27.900> want<00:05:28.080> as<00:05:28.199> much

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
a patek percent slot 6 you want as much

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.770 
a patek percent slot 6 you want as much
a<00:05:28.469> quick<00:05:29.009> critical<00:05:29.940> rate<00:05:30.090> as<00:05:30.210> much<00:05:30.419> as<00:05:30.539> you<00:05:30.599> can

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
a quick critical rate as much as you can

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.350 
a quick critical rate as much as you can
from<00:05:30.930> sub-steps<00:05:31.610> his<00:05:32.610> third<00:05:32.849> skill<00:05:33.120> that<00:05:33.270> was

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
from sub-steps his third skill that was

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.680 
from sub-steps his third skill that was
really<00:05:33.629> good<00:05:33.810> so<00:05:34.169> meaning<00:05:34.469> it<00:05:34.590> disables

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
really good so meaning it disables

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.959 
really good so meaning it disables
somebody<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:37.520> they<00:05:38.520> won't<00:05:38.699> be<00:05:38.759> able<00:05:38.909> to

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
somebody and they won't be able to

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.469 
somebody and they won't be able to
attack<00:05:39.180> at<00:05:39.330> least<00:05:39.539> for<00:05:39.750> one<00:05:40.050> or<00:05:40.349> two<00:05:40.409> turns

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
attack at least for one or two turns

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.180 
attack at least for one or two turns
alright<00:05:42.479> so<00:05:42.719> we're<00:05:43.500> going<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.740> look<00:05:43.889> at<00:05:44.069> the

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
alright so we're going to look at the

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.999 
alright so we're going to look at the
last<00:05:44.370> one<00:05:44.639> which<00:05:44.789> is<00:05:44.819> the<00:05:44.969> dark<00:05:45.569> one<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:46.110> dark

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
last one which is the dark one the dark

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.370 
last one which is the dark one the dark
one<00:05:47.310> is<00:05:50.330> let's<00:05:51.330> look<00:05:51.449> at<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.659> second<00:05:52.050> skill<00:05:52.259> okay

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
one is let's look at a second skill okay

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.120 
one is let's look at a second skill okay
so<00:05:52.560> he<00:05:52.860> has<00:05:52.889> ax<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.490> punishment<00:05:54.229> so<00:05:55.229> he<00:05:55.979> can

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
so he has ax of punishment so he can

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.879 
so he has ax of punishment so he can
stun<00:05:56.430> everyone<00:05:56.599> everyone<00:05:57.599> and<00:05:58.080> then<00:05:58.800> he

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
stun everyone everyone and then he

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.529 
stun everyone everyone and then he
starts<00:05:59.130> get<00:05:59.310> frenzied<00:05:59.729> attack<00:05:59.819> semi<00:06:00.330> with

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
starts get frenzied attack semi with

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.689 
starts get frenzied attack semi with
rage<00:06:00.779> the<00:06:01.380> cool<00:06:01.590> time<00:06:01.740> resets<00:06:02.039> and<00:06:02.190> games<00:06:02.430> to

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
rage the cool time resets and games to

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.469 
rage the cool time resets and games to
turn<00:06:02.880> with<00:06:03.150> the<00:06:03.270> 25%<00:06:04.020> chance<00:06:04.940> so<00:06:05.940> cool<00:06:06.270> time

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
turn with the 25% chance so cool time

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.899 
turn with the 25% chance so cool time
resets<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.169> gains<00:06:07.409> attorney<00:06:07.710> okay<00:06:07.889> so<00:06:08.069> it's

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
resets and gains attorney okay so it's

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.269 
resets and gains attorney okay so it's
kind<00:06:09.090> of<00:06:09.120> like<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.270> reset<00:06:09.719> but<00:06:10.080> it's<00:06:10.199> only<00:06:10.319> a<00:06:10.440> 25%

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
kind of like a reset but it's only a 25%

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.980 
kind of like a reset but it's only a 25%
chance

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
chance

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.740 
chance
so<00:06:12.990> violin<00:06:13.789> violin<00:06:14.789> focus<00:06:15.240> might<00:06:15.599> be

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
so violin violin focus might be

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.839 
so violin violin focus might be
something<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.169> want<00:06:16.319> to<00:06:16.379> check<00:06:16.560> out<00:06:16.849> vital

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
something you want to check out vital

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.420 
something you want to check out vital
focus<00:06:18.389> with<00:06:18.690> focus<00:06:19.199> and<00:06:19.560> then<00:06:19.710> you<00:06:19.830> go<00:06:19.979> speed

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
focus with focus and then you go speed

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.029 
focus with focus and then you go speed
on<00:06:20.550> slot<00:06:20.819> 2<00:06:21.090> latech<00:06:21.960> percent<00:06:22.289> slot<00:06:22.469> 4<00:06:22.740> and<00:06:22.949> an

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
on slot 2 latech percent slot 4 and an

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.990 
on slot 2 latech percent slot 4 and an
accuracy<00:06:23.460> percent<00:06:23.969> slot<00:06:24.180> 6<00:06:25.639> that's<00:06:26.639> something

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
accuracy percent slot 6 that's something

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.930 
accuracy percent slot 6 that's something
that's<00:06:27.569> how<00:06:27.659> I<00:06:27.690> would<00:06:27.900> build<00:06:28.139> him<00:06:28.349> and

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
that's how I would build him and

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.180 
that's how I would build him and
rageblade<00:06:29.940> is<00:06:30.180> also<00:06:30.479> viable<00:06:31.229> but<00:06:31.469> I<00:06:31.740> take

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
rageblade is also viable but I take

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.950 
rageblade is also viable but I take
sweet<00:06:32.699> focus<00:06:33.090> or<00:06:33.240> buying<00:06:33.419> a<00:06:33.509> focus<00:06:33.840> is

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
sweet focus or buying a focus is

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.830 
sweet focus or buying a focus is
definitely<00:06:34.259> a<00:06:34.289> better<00:06:34.500> choice<00:06:35.210> and<00:06:36.210> that's

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
definitely a better choice and that's

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.869 
definitely a better choice and that's
pretty<00:06:37.080> much<00:06:37.199> it<00:06:37.379> for<00:06:37.680> the<00:06:37.860> review<00:06:37.889> for<00:06:38.550> all

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:38.879 
pretty much it for the review for all

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250
