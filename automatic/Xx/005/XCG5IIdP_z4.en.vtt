00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
exhaust system and you'll hear right

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
exhaust system and you'll hear right
from<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> start<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.899> thing<00:00:49.140> has<00:00:49.410> some

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770

serious<00:00:50.070> muscle<00:00:51.020> and<00:00:52.039> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:54.379> what's

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
serious muscle and I think that what's

can
you<00:00:59.390> can<00:00:59.570> use<00:00:59.810> it<00:01:00.020> every<00:01:00.290> day<00:01:00.320> but<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.830> also

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
you can use it every day but it also

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.930 
you can use it every day but it also
kind<00:01:01.490> of<00:01:01.580> evokes<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.300> bug<00:01:02.990> I<00:01:03.140> racing<00:01:03.620> history

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the bug eyes just don't have enough home

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.059 
the bug eyes just don't have enough home
to<00:03:32.920> do<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.610> this<00:03:33.820> one

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
to do that and this one

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.950 
to do that and this one
really<00:03:35.489> hot<00:03:35.700> car<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.420> a

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
really hot car and a

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.730 
really hot car and a
asked<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.320> drive

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
asked to drive

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.740 
asked to drive
is<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.040> reminder<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.610> car<00:03:39.850> has<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> two-shot

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
is a reminder this car has a two-shot

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.980 
is a reminder this car has a two-shot
conversion<00:03:41.440> all<00:03:41.560> around

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
conversion all around

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.559 
conversion all around
anti-roll<00:03:43.990> bar<00:03:44.260> front<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.740> rear

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
anti-roll bar front and rear

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.660 
anti-roll bar front and rear
so<00:03:45.840> there's<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.140> zero<00:03:46.439> body<00:03:46.799> roll<00:03:47.099> which<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
so there's a zero body roll which you
