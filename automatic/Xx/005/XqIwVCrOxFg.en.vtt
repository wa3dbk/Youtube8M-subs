bucket<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.370> water<00:00:38.610> alright<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.809> he's<00:00:39.960> gonna<00:00:40.079> go

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
bucket of water alright so he's gonna go

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.080 
bucket of water alright so he's gonna go
into<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> turtle<00:00:40.949> put<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> bucket<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.850> water

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
into the turtle put the bucket of water

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
into the turtle put the bucket of water
into<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> pool<00:00:42.960> spa<00:00:43.289> and<00:00:43.559> then<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.890> time<00:00:44.039> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
into the pool spa and then just time to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
into the pool spa and then just time to
refuel<00:00:44.699> all<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> turtle<00:00:47.520> freaks<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.300> right

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
refuel all the turtle freaks out right

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.830 
refuel all the turtle freaks out right
and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.320> copies<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.160> these<00:00:50.850> buckets<00:00:51.300> I'll

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and then copies all these buckets I'll

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
and then copies all these buckets I'll
break<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.399> all<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:53.820> buckets

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
break that so you have all these buckets

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
break that so you have all these buckets
now<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.739> well<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
now we can do this in this one as well I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.009 
now we can do this in this one as well I
haven't<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.640> tried<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.570> any<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
haven't actually tried it in any of

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.830 
haven't actually tried it in any of
these<00:00:58.379> yet<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.190> it<00:01:00.000> does<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.269> same<00:01:00.449> thing<00:01:00.719> on

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
these yet but it does the same thing on

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.400 
these yet but it does the same thing on
that<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.199> okay<00:01:06.110> alright<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.230> probably

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
that one okay alright you're probably

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.410 
that one okay alright you're probably
thinking<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.890> okay<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.150> ton<00:01:09.390> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
thinking like okay I have a ton of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.410 
thinking like okay I have a ton of
buckets<00:01:09.870> well<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.500> FTB<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.270> actually

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
buckets well and FTB you can actually

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.810 
buckets well and FTB you can actually
smelt<00:01:13.140> buckets<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.040> let's<00:01:14.910> copy<00:01:15.480> all<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.110> these

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
smelt buckets so let's copy all of these

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.710 
smelt buckets so let's copy all of these
by<00:01:17.820> copy<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.390> but

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.320 

okay<00:01:23.710> well<00:01:23.980> anyway<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:24.400> what<00:01:24.760> you<00:01:24.910> would<00:01:25.000> do<00:01:25.180> is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
okay well anyway so what you would do is

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.790 
okay well anyway so what you would do is
you<00:01:25.480> would<00:01:25.510> just<00:01:25.690> smelt<00:01:26.020> these<00:01:26.200> buckets<00:01:26.650> so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
you would just smelt these buckets so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.020 
you would just smelt these buckets so
what<00:01:27.070> you<00:01:27.220> can<00:01:27.370> do<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.730> can<00:01:27.820> come<00:01:28.000> over

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
what you can do is you can come over

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:38.730 
what you can do is you can come over
here<00:01:33.660> there<00:01:34.660> we<00:01:34.750> go<00:01:36.480> there<00:01:37.480> we<00:01:37.750> go<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.350> what<00:01:38.620> you

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
here there we go there we go so what you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.470 
here there we go there we go so what you
did<00:01:38.920> was<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:39.190> just<00:01:39.550> put<00:01:39.730> the<00:01:39.820> bucket<00:01:40.150> in<00:01:40.300> there

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
did was you just put the bucket in there

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.560 
did was you just put the bucket in there
all<00:01:41.050> you<00:01:41.260> do<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.530> refuel<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.040> all<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.580> I<00:01:43.510> mean

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
all you do is refuel it all and I mean

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.090 
all you do is refuel it all and I mean
three<00:01:44.200> like<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.700> bucket<00:01:46.180> goes<00:01:46.510> for<00:01:47.100> sixteen

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
three like one bucket goes for sixteen

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.280 
three like one bucket goes for sixteen
buckets<00:01:48.400> which<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:49.150> goes<00:01:49.390> for<00:01:49.720> three<00:01:49.990> iron

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
buckets which then goes for three iron

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.320 
buckets which then goes for three iron
times<00:01:50.620> sixteen<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.370> that's<00:01:51.550> a<00:01:51.670> lot<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:52.120> iron

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
times sixteen so that's a lot of iron

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.790 
times sixteen so that's a lot of iron
that<00:01:52.630> you're<00:01:52.810> getting<00:01:53.110> per<00:01:53.260> three<00:01:53.500> iron

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
that you're getting per three iron

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.130 
that you're getting per three iron
really<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.270> can<00:01:55.390> just<00:01:55.570> keep<00:01:55.720> doing<00:01:55.750> it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
really and you can just keep doing it

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.050 
really and you can just keep doing it
over<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.410> over<00:01:56.620> again<00:01:56.890> it's<00:01:57.250> really<00:01:57.790> really

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
over and over again it's really really

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.990 
over and over again it's really really
simple<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.540> do<00:01:58.740> let's<00:01:59.740> take<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.430> there's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
simple to do let's take that and there's

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.220 
simple to do let's take that and there's
got<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.210> be<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.300> crafting<00:02:01.660> square<00:02:01.960> here

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
got to be a crafting square here

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:09.030 
got to be a crafting square here
somewhere<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.590> can<00:02:02.830> use<00:02:03.010> that<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.530> how<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.679> show

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
somewhere I can use that and how to show

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.020 
somewhere I can use that and how to show
you<00:02:09.100> this<00:02:09.340> one<00:02:09.790> more<00:02:10.540> time<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:12.520> I<00:02:12.640> said<00:02:12.910> if

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
you this one more time like I said if
