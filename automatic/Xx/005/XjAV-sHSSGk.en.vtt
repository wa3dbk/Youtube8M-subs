00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.400
 Hello, let's look at 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.369
 characteristic mistakes of the first lesson of the course 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.609
 colors aerial perspective if you are 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.060
 working in grisaille technique for the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.680
 the base must be taken brown 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.730
 add to it 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.690
 bright ear and whitewash to lighten and 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.399
 black paint to black out 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.059
 grisaille is performed to 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.480
 the student understood the tone relations well 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.870
 in kale in the picture of the light we are not yet 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.370
 so we touch the use of yellow and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.020
 blue in this lesson in this lesson 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 not allowed now using the program 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.850
 photoshop 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.020
 I'm modifying the shadow part 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.710
 of the work shadow I do more 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.530
 compelling you must understand well and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 feel like the light part of the crown 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.830
 hanging over the shadow creating a volume tree 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.330
 volume of the volume of the crown of the tree which 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.270
 we perform 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.350
 I also noticed that the crown of this tree 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.850
 cut off 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 you year not to fence a tree 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.990
 average plan but also the pomp is lost 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 I consider it necessary to add this 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.320
 the pomp of the crown 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.700
 slightly edit the composition 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.570
 this picture such decisions 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.770
 maybe worth taking more based on 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.770
 pencil sketch 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.340
 Careful use of the white color is not 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.770
 knew how to use it leads to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.140
 that the picture seems to be covered with snow 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.680
 now I corrected 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.990
 light on the trees of the average plan and you 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.890
 see how this light part is hanging 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.990
 over the shadow 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:32.590
 and created crown volume 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.840
 average plan corrected slightly scanty 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.620
 bush 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:47.730
 foreground add shadows here 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:50.580
 foliage average price group like this 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.940
 small improvements 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.840
 make the picture more convincing well 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.680
 readable to the viewer now I supplement 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.450
 the work of the shadows that lay on 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.830
 horizontal surface 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:14.489
 if we have the lighting on the top left then 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.770
 objects that are on 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.500
 horizontal surfaces will throw off their 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.940
 the shadows but those are not this not such 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:31.540
 dense like a deep shadow in the crown of a tree 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:36.690
 and softer and lighter using the whole 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:41.980
 range of our connoisseur palette i 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:46.120
 darkened tree trunks and you see that 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:52.030
 they became more contrasted more 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:56.190
 clear to the viewer losing 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:01.030
 these moments you do your work 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.290
 unfinished which is a pity though 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:10.049
 what many do pretty 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.659
 good pictorial successes your hand 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:18.430
 approaching action by professionals 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:22.740
 but not the ability to see these little ones 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.110
 nuances do not allow to withdraw work on 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:32.340
 professional level for that I and 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:36.090
 I do this small lesson those who have not yet 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.509
 mastered the free course 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.720
 landscape light aerial perspective 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:49.900
 please subscribe to the link that you 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.530
 see below this video and be included in 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.479
 the team 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:05:01.590
 art school artist alexander zilyaeva 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:04.300
 i keep working and small details 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.130
 helps to completely fix the work 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:14.650
 which we had before is not clear 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:19.000
 from where the illumination of the cropped tree crown 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:23.970
 almost no shadows in the foreground 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.860
 and here is the work that we have done 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.320
 sure that photoshop is not 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:35.409
 lets make it also picturesque 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.800
 like a brush but i think the result is all 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.099
 equally 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.729
 convinced you to pay 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:48.479
 attention to these details i thank you 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.479
 Thank you for your attention until the next lesson
