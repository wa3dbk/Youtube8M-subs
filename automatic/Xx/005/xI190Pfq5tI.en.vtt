so it's April 21st this van has been

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.129 
so it's April 21st this van has been
sitting<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:07.680> since<00:00:08.069> last<00:00:08.970> fall<00:00:09.330> we<00:00:09.719> started

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
sitting here since last fall we started

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.990 
sitting here since last fall we started
it<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.380> February<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> very<00:00:11.309> cold<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.700> snowy

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
it in February on a very cold and snowy

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.160 
it in February on a very cold and snowy
day<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.900> my<00:00:13.969> diesel<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.660> converted

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
day this is my diesel that I converted

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.679 
day this is my diesel that I converted
with<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> Jetta<00:00:18.080> still<00:00:19.080> got<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> flat<00:00:19.500> tire<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
with the Jetta still got a flat tire I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.160 
with the Jetta still got a flat tire I
just<00:00:21.689> threw<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.930> battery<00:00:22.320> into<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:23.990> let's<00:00:24.990> see

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
just threw a battery into it let's see

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.460 
just threw a battery into it let's see
how<00:00:25.260> good<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.740> starts<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.869> only<00:00:28.109> disadvantage

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
how good it starts the only disadvantage

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.460 
how good it starts the only disadvantage
is<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:30.060> injector<00:00:30.480> pump<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.019> starting<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> get

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
is the injector pump is starting to get

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.990 
is the injector pump is starting to get
a<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.890> bit<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> corrosion<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.700> leak<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
a little bit of corrosion and leak a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.479 
a little bit of corrosion and leak a
tiny<00:00:33.210> bit<00:00:33.450> which<00:00:33.630> means<00:00:33.870> fuel<00:00:34.800> bleeds<00:00:35.100> back<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
tiny bit which means fuel bleeds back to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.950 
tiny bit which means fuel bleeds back to
the<00:00:35.579> tank<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.300> air<00:00:36.450> space<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
the tank so there's an air space in the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.450 
the tank so there's an air space in the
ejector<00:00:37.380> pump<00:00:37.559> every<00:00:37.829> time<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
ejector pump every time it's it's a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
ejector pump every time it's it's a
while<00:00:38.750> so<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> doesn't<00:00:40.200> fire<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.620> away

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
while so it doesn't fire up right away

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.280 
while so it doesn't fire up right away
like<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> used<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
like it used to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.560 
like it used to
anyways<00:00:43.290> cold<00:00:43.710> start<00:00:43.980> leaver<00:00:44.160> down<00:00:44.570> collects

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
anyways cold start leaver down collects

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.310 
anyways cold start leaver down collects
depressed<00:00:48.530> here's<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.739> stick<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:51.930> see

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
depressed here's my stick you can see

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.310 
depressed here's my stick you can see
it's<00:00:52.500> got<00:00:52.710> lots<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.340> kilometers<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:57.320> this

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it's got lots of kilometers on it this

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.609 
it's got lots of kilometers on it this
is<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.620> glow<00:00:59.520> plug<00:00:59.760> button<00:01:00.890> here<00:01:01.890> click<00:01:03.619> so

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
is the glow plug button here click so

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.910 
is the glow plug button here click so
I'll<00:01:04.860> give<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.250> 10<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.700> 15<00:01:05.820> seconds<00:01:12.920> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
I'll give it about 10 or 15 seconds and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.270 
I'll give it about 10 or 15 seconds and
here<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.430> go<00:01:16.520> almost

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.030 

it's<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.090> sucking<00:01:21.480> that<00:01:21.630> fuel<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.170> ran

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's just sucking that fuel that's ran

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:34.429 
it's just sucking that fuel that's ran
away

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.090 

started<00:01:35.439> better<00:01:35.619> than<00:01:35.799> that<00:01:35.890> in<00:01:36.009> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
started better than that in the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:54.679 
started better than that in the
wintertime<00:01:36.340> try<00:01:37.090> again

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.490 

my<00:01:55.689> mom<00:01:55.899> baby

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.570 

never<00:02:02.500> taking<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:02.979> long

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.020 

let<00:02:07.510> me<00:02:07.600> go<00:02:07.750> okay<00:02:08.080> take<00:02:08.710> two<00:02:09.040> I<00:02:09.250> have<00:02:09.610> primed

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
let me go okay take two I have primed

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.720 
let me go okay take two I have primed
the<00:02:10.180> injector<00:02:10.690> pump<00:02:10.930> I<00:02:14.340> did<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.550> by

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the injector pump I did that by

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.610 
the injector pump I did that by
unhooking<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.270> fuel<00:02:16.600> line<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:16.900> using<00:02:17.560> a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
unhooking the fuel line and using a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.130 
unhooking the fuel line and using a
squeezy<00:02:17.920> bottle<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.660> squeezing<00:02:19.660> and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
squeezy bottle and squeezing and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.080 
squeezy bottle and squeezing and
pressurized<00:02:20.800> diesel<00:02:21.340> into<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.670> injector

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
pressurized diesel into the injector

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.140 
pressurized diesel into the injector
pump<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:23.620> did<00:02:23.860> seem<00:02:24.070> empty<00:02:29.880> huh

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
pump it did seem empty huh

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.040 
pump it did seem empty huh
simple<00:02:31.840> as<00:02:31.960> that<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:33.330> knew<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.360> could<00:02:34.600> depend<00:02:34.690> on

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
simple as that I knew I could depend on

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.870 
simple as that I knew I could depend on
this<00:02:35.260> thing

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
this thing

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.100 
this thing
driven<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.120> eight<00:02:37.240> years<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.690> know<00:02:37.810> put<00:02:38.050> a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
driven it for eight years you know put a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:47.339 
driven it for eight years you know put a
lot<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.350> kilometers<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:42.960> perfect

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:54.070

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.800 

that<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:54.890> got<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.430> only<00:02:55.790> one<00:02:55.940> in<00:02:56.090> North<00:02:56.270> America

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
that I got the only one in North America

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.110 
that I got the only one in North America
like<00:02:56.960> this<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:58.070> most<00:02:58.250> fuel-efficient<00:02:59.000> at

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
like this and the most fuel-efficient at

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.230 
like this and the most fuel-efficient at
57<00:02:59.810> miles<00:03:00.050> per<00:03:00.380> inferior<00:03:00.910> certain<00:03:01.910> cereal

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
gallon on the highway now I just got to

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.420 
gallon on the highway now I just got to
refill<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> back<00:03:07.940> tire<00:03:11.770> so<00:03:12.770> now<00:03:12.980> I'll<00:03:13.190> show

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
refill the back tire so now I'll show

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.970 
refill the back tire so now I'll show
you<00:03:13.490> how<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.060> primed<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.660> diesel<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.260> was

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
you how I primed a diesel that was

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.760 
you how I primed a diesel that was
lacking<00:03:16.220> fuel<00:03:16.730> in<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.970> system<00:03:17.470> let<00:03:18.470> me<00:03:18.590> turn

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
lacking fuel in the system let me turn

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.310 
lacking fuel in the system let me turn
it<00:03:18.830> off<00:03:19.010> first<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:22.480> here's<00:03:23.480> how<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.690> do<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.170> if

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
it off first so here's how you do it if

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.840 
it off first so here's how you do it if
you<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:24.530> an<00:03:24.650> old<00:03:24.800> fashioned<00:03:25.250> mechanical

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
you have an old fashioned mechanical

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.570 
you have an old fashioned mechanical
injected<00:03:26.620> diesel<00:03:27.620> engine<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.310> want<00:03:28.490> to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
injected diesel engine and you want to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.950
