00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.960
 so I would like to start with 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 fragment from the play 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.510

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.530

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.370
 citizens 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:34.660
 there have always been weak people here 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.660
 evidence I myself 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.900
 I spoke just nowadays 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.000

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.899
 public evil I said that we 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.509
 awakens 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:07.320
 consciousness of one's flaws and in consciousness 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:09.380
 there is hope for a better future I spoke 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.350
 what we are starting to create 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.100
 public opinion that in boys 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:22.370
 a sense of justice is brought up 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:25.640
 sense of duty and it grows growing and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.640
 bears fruit 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 we will not see 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.780
