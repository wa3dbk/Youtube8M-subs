00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.099 

one<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> problems<00:00:06.540> when<00:00:06.629> it<00:00:06.750> comes<00:00:06.779> to

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
one of the problems when it comes to

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.310 
one of the problems when it comes to
photographic<00:00:07.770> exposure<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.480> camera

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
photographic exposure is that the camera

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.360 
photographic exposure is that the camera
sees<00:00:11.219> not<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.269> much<00:00:12.480> as<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.290> human<00:00:13.590> eye<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
sees not as much as the human eye the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.880 
sees not as much as the human eye the
roughly<00:00:15.000> 16<00:00:15.540> stop<00:00:15.870> range<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.470> human<00:00:16.770> eye

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
roughly 16 stop range of the human eye

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
roughly 16 stop range of the human eye
the<00:00:17.640> closest<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.180> camera<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.630> come<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> about

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
the closest the camera can come is about

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.769 
the closest the camera can come is about
seven<00:00:19.560> thoughts<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> result<00:00:20.760> when<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.390> look

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
seven thoughts as a result when you look

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
seven thoughts as a result when you look
through<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> camera<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
through the camera and you see in the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.450 
through the camera and you see in the
vast<00:00:24.630> exposure<00:00:25.199> range<00:00:25.500> before<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.279> we're

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
vast exposure range before you as we're

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.250 
vast exposure range before you as we're
about<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> find<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.779> fact<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> matter

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
about to find out the fact of the matter

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.679 
about to find out the fact of the matter
is<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.830> camera<00:00:29.220> cannot<00:00:29.490> record<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.420> vast

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
is the camera cannot record that vast

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.540 
is the camera cannot record that vast
exposure<00:00:31.199> range<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.009> what's<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> solution

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
exposure range so what's the solution

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.720 
exposure range so what's the solution
you<00:00:33.540> must<00:00:33.840> decide<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.980> high<00:00:35.190> light<00:00:35.460> or

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you must decide if it's high light or

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.889 
you must decide if it's high light or
the<00:00:35.820> shadows<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> want<00:00:36.750> exposed<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.500> it

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
lot of machinery going on here in this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.830 
lot of machinery going on here in this
generator<00:01:18.100> parts<00:01:18.580> little<00:01:19.479> building

generator parts little building

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.469 
generator parts little building
therefore<00:01:20.619> I'm<00:01:21.190> gonna<00:01:21.400> get<00:01:21.610> confused<00:01:22.210> really

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
therefore I'm gonna get confused really

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.480 
therefore I'm gonna get confused really
quick<00:01:22.840> if<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.380> think<00:01:23.440> that's<00:01:23.860> going<00:01:24.160> to<00:01:24.250> show<00:01:24.460> up

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
quick if I think that's going to show up

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.490 
quick if I think that's going to show up
in<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.850> shot<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.660> fact<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.080> matter<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.350> I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
in the shot the fact of the matter is I

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.310 
in the shot the fact of the matter is I
set<00:01:26.890> my<00:01:27.040> exposure<00:01:27.509> exclusively<00:01:28.509> for<00:01:28.780> him<00:01:29.050> out

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
set my exposure exclusively for him out

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.290 
set my exposure exclusively for him out
here<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.130> what<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.399> mean<00:01:30.580> by<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.790> is<00:01:31.149> simply

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
here and what I mean by that is simply

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.930 
here and what I mean by that is simply
this<00:01:31.720> I'm<00:01:32.200> going<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.530> just<00:01:32.680> zoom<00:01:32.950> in<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.670> set

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
this I'm going to just zoom in and set

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.270 
this I'm going to just zoom in and set
my<00:01:34.060> exposure<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:34.869> case<00:01:35.110> five<00:01:35.740> point<00:01:36.040> six

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
my exposure in this case five point six

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.190 
my exposure in this case five point six
at<00:01:36.490> one<00:01:36.610> hundredths<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.119> second<00:01:37.600> manual

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
at one hundredths of a second manual

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.469 
at one hundredths of a second manual
exposure<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.890> this<00:01:39.009> is<00:01:39.160> with<00:01:39.310> an<00:01:39.430> ISO<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.850> 400

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
exposure and this is with an ISO of 400

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.200 
exposure and this is with an ISO of 400
so<00:01:40.960> with<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.619> in<00:01:41.800> mind<00:01:41.830> since<00:01:42.490> I'm<00:01:42.670> in<00:01:42.820> manual

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
so with that in mind since I'm in manual

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.350 
so with that in mind since I'm in manual
exposure<00:01:43.570> I'm<00:01:44.259> simply<00:01:44.710> going<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.210> frame<00:01:46.210> them

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
exposure I'm simply going to frame them

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.359 
exposure I'm simply going to frame them
up<00:01:46.479> like<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:46.780> bring<00:01:47.560> your<00:01:47.649> chin<00:01:47.890> down<00:01:48.040> just<00:01:48.100> a

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
up like so bring your chin down just a

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.180 
up like so bring your chin down just a
little<00:01:48.399> bit<00:01:48.729> bring<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.600> head<00:01:49.750> forward<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.409> I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
little bit bring a head forward and I

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.500 
little bit bring a head forward and I
have<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.490> pose<00:01:51.670> them<00:01:51.850> here<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.090> little<00:01:52.240> bit<00:01:52.390> and

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
have to pose them here a little bit and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.640 
have to pose them here a little bit and
help<00:01:52.570> them<00:01:52.750> out<00:01:52.840> we<00:01:52.960> don't<00:01:53.110> speak<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.500> same
