00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.600
 to 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.600
 hello everyone finally fucked this guide the 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.300
 list item has cost me a lot 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.520
 finish it because good theory of change 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.110
 of the computer and several moved layers of 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.730
 the espe I'm using now in the 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.720
 last video to afp 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.220
 5 you see that I have long undead 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.309
 apart from that it gives me hardness and damage 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.500
 condition also passes me 5% of my 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.940
 hardness condition damage that is very 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.550
 important here you see that I have the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.320
 Stamps of the condition year is book and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.300
 go up five by five as I have the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.070
 because me up every ten also 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.079
 is very good the omÃ¡n 100 stop for 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.809
 try here we have the amulet of 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.070
 shaman with July the scavenger that good 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.179
 I put the life of what I require for 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.999
 climb a peak the life the life that I have 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:02.420
 so here you can see that I have 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:04.730
 a lot of hardness on land I still have 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.650
 plus two thousand and a hundred and something that's very 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.720
 well because it reduces my damage by 50% 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.730
 direct that I hurt a condition 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.590
 I have a lot of healing power and many 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.590
 whereupon my cures are important 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.890
 well let's see the traits here as 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.979
 you can see I have 30 on land 2020 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.590
 close a little extra noise and here 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.350
 we have ground armor with the 1 a 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.860
 little long but it's quite useful this me 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.720
 like is an incapacitation in area what 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.430
 that we have this one gets a 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.500
 immobilization of three seconds lasts two 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.170
 sometimes it breaks a bit the enemy is fine 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.630
 and this stamp 12 is the basis of my 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.300
 guild though I pull my water series 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.820
 I still have passive action for every 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.340
 spel degenerate where it is synchronized 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.869
 this is very good is an action region 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.080
 passive that I have to be always active 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.570
 a little clean remove conditions 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.430
 then it is with is very important when 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.130
 I pass water that is usually every 10 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.229
 seconds a rope of two houses and the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 spells 20% less discounting and it was 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.770
 a lovely short 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.810
 then create a shield of Arcanum was 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.270
 very well hold a little more this is 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.550
 very basic persistent elements then 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.530
 I explain why and in tune with the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.120
 good elements this is going very well 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.830
 also by different groups about 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.930
 everything also the water you hold a 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.580
 little more and this here I go with this one 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.950
 spell but I could also say 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.300
 advice now they made a change that did not 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.550
 you can punish him from behind and I do not 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.230
 I liked it so much if you go with that maybe 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.810
 its worth more to go with the seal 2 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.180
 it's worth 20% of with down 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.040
 for one against one against two goes very 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.290
 well in the elementary but if you have to 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.830
 play tournaments and defend points you can 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.810
 use the tornado that also goes very well 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.390
 well let's see a rotation here 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.190
 we put a little burn this would be 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.620
 the ideal endowment that is not always 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.360
 can sorin is 5 this is very 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.430
 important in fillets we export what 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.590
 we do other bleeding games we had 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.260
 we change air we go back to study 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 then we study so that the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.770
 maximum time studied with about 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.840
 bled and burn here very 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.180
 important what we said from 15 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.100
 arkano that lengthens the time of the 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.570
 tunes then here it lengthens to the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.940
 to be in air still in water I 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.490
 lengthens the snow the calming one and I have it 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.610
 always active and I go back to 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.959
 water and I renew the fog again 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.180
 active therefore I have this out 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.510
 passive of a hundred and little always active 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.459
 in area that is luxury 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.530
 We're going to the bonfire 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.560
 a little bit of damage and we'll see when I 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.590
 step to water I cured two cans if you 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.450
 you fix well 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.700
 that is also very important my person 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.390
 there's no I have 226 feedback and the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.310
 fog 118 that's what pim pam let's see 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.290
 what are the allies for example I 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.420
 Something was happening two faces on 5 of water 2 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.640
 capsule not even with the 2 still you 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.540
 He cures a little more and I put my 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.540
 two other liabilities 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.600
 well let's see a few tricks and 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.300
 advice we are also we have seen a 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.550
 mirror and how it goes 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.560
 this map is not just a tournament 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.390
 but good the idea is that we see the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.760
 mobility that mentalists have and 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.620
 with 4 we can go anywhere 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.780
 here medium transport metro and now 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.150
 I could go to the other base or here 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.950
 I like the poles of the canyon and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.540
 Between transporting I came directly 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.240
 another guide you want to go to from successful to 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.430
 teleport and good here already 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.440
 we can have directly 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.960
 important the stones with mick way to 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.910
 that we do not stop the stop first starts 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.110
 the animation and then the stand here is 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.380
 it hits us very hard although we are 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.900
 studying if we change air and 3 and it 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.790
 are studied to make the king the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.010
 lightning in 4 one combat 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.950
 melee you have to remove this 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.930
 auto white auto targeting option 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.490
 if we do not, we'll stay there 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.560
 melee because it selects us 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.600
 automatically to that goal 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.220
 in this way removing this option we 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.280
 we go for the body and the truth is that 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.260
 It is very good 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.630
 a couple more things that are very good 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.080
 it is also the announcement the goal against 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.720
 the goal in tournaments and group fights 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.970
 is another basic that also goes very well 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.860
 is closest enemy especially if 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.010
 we are melÃ©s we are doing very well to be able 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.540
 to bargain well and then also I 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.400
 he also advised putting the look back 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.670
 that goes very well especially when you're 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.390
 fleeing to see who follow you 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.200
 I hope you like the video comment on a 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.200
 I like it if you liked it
