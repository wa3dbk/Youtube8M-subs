00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
bring the video over just to give you is
definitely<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.860> little<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> lake<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
definitely a little bit of a lake you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.450 
definitely a little bit of a lake you
know<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> network<00:01:39.390> connection<00:01:39.750> um<00:01:40.460> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
know this is a network connection um you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.920 
know this is a network connection um you
know<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.790> gives<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.329> good<00:01:42.479> idea<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
know but it gives you a good idea it's a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.120 
know but it gives you a good idea it's a
little<00:01:43.200> choppy<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.860> not<00:01:43.979> as

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
little choppy you know it's not as

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.410 
little choppy you know it's not as
smooth<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.579> would<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.270> computer

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
smooth as it would be on the computer

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
smooth as it would be on the computer
display<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.649> you'll<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.040> give<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.430> idea

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
display but you'll just give you an idea

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.310 
display but you'll just give you an idea
of<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.270> expect<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.259> be

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
of what to expect so this would be

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.410 
of what to expect so this would be
pretty<00:01:49.530> cool<00:01:49.740> solution<00:01:50.520> let's<00:01:50.909> say<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.119> know

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
pretty cool solution let's say you know

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.990 
pretty cool solution let's say you know
you<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:52.200> Twitter<00:01:53.009> client<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:53.850> up

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you have your Twitter client you know up

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
you have your Twitter client you know up
and<00:01:54.149> running<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> could<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and running you know I could just you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.499 
and running you know I could just you
know<00:01:55.890> leave<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.250> right<00:01:56.460> over<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
know leave this right over here and I

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.700 
know leave this right over here and I
could<00:01:57.659> monitor<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.439> throughout

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
could monitor that you know throughout

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.200 
could monitor that you know throughout
the<00:01:58.890> day<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.460> watch<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the day and just watch it go you know so

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
the day and just watch it go you know so
it's<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> cool<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.600> idea<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> all

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
it's a cool little idea for that all

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.459 
it's a cool little idea for that all
right<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.460> let's<00:02:03.119> take<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> look<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:04.020> thing

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
right so let's take a look at one thing

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.119 
right so let's take a look at one thing
here<00:02:04.829> let's<00:02:05.009> get<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.670> -<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.979> do

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
here let's get this over to - to do

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.710 
here let's get this over to - to do
video<00:02:08.459> mirroring<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.360> I'll<00:02:09.450> turn<00:02:09.690> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
video mirroring so I'll turn on

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.780 
video mirroring so I'll turn on
mirroring<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.340> takes<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.610> moment

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
mirroring right it just takes a moment

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.130 
mirroring right it just takes a moment
and<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.480> go<00:02:12.569> actually<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.930> switched

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and there we go actually it's switched

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.710 
and there we go actually it's switched
pretty<00:02:13.440> quick

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
pretty quick

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.050 
pretty quick
so<00:02:13.810> now<00:02:13.960> whatever<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.650> see<00:02:14.860> over<00:02:15.100> here<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.610> know

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
so now whatever I see over here you know

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.420 
so now whatever I see over here you know
I'm<00:02:16.210> also<00:02:16.420> seeing<00:02:17.020> over<00:02:17.290> there<00:02:17.410> just<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.190> slight

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
I'm also seeing over there just a slight

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.860 
I'm also seeing over there just a slight
little<00:02:18.640> leg<00:02:18.880> all<00:02:19.060> right<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.540> that's<00:02:19.600> how<00:02:19.750> it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
little leg all right so that's how it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.030 
little leg all right so that's how it
works<00:02:19.990> with<00:02:20.170> mirroring<00:02:20.530> let<00:02:20.680> me<00:02:20.770> just<00:02:20.920> show

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
works with mirroring let me just show

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.770 
works with mirroring let me just show
you<00:02:21.130> one<00:02:21.370> other<00:02:21.520> little<00:02:21.700> thing<00:02:21.850> here<00:02:22.270> again

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
move the MacBook over and so it works

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.430 
move the MacBook over and so it works
both<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:27.670> portrait<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.210> landscape<00:02:28.570> something

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
both in portrait and landscape something

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.930

I<00:02:29.530> found<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.950> little<00:02:30.220> strange<00:02:30.460> is<00:02:30.580> when<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.730> turn

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
I found a little strange is when I turn

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.510 
I found a little strange is when I turn
on<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.270> video<00:02:31.780> mirroring<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.430> know

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
on the video mirroring you know

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.280 
on the video mirroring you know
something<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.210> doesn't<00:02:34.480> quite<00:02:34.720> work

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
something it just doesn't quite work

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.780 
something it just doesn't quite work
like<00:02:35.350> you'd<00:02:35.800> expect<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.670> see

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
like you'd expect it and you can see

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.570 
like you'd expect it and you can see
takes<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.060> minute<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.330> refresh<00:02:37.870> itself<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:39.160> cuts

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
takes a minute to refresh itself it cuts

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.880 
takes a minute to refresh itself it cuts
it<00:02:39.700> off<00:02:39.760> right<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.420> actually<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:41.020> can't

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
it off right here and actually I can't

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.860 
landscape mode here I'll take it a
minute<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.660> switch<00:02:58.930> over<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.890> let's<00:03:00.280> throw

minute to switch over and let's throw

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.870 
minute to switch over and let's throw
this<00:03:01.870> window<00:03:02.410> back<00:03:02.950> over<00:03:03.280> here<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:03.640> there<00:03:03.760> we

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
this window back over here so there we

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.820 
this window back over here so there we
go<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.090> got<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.360> window<00:03:04.660> up<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.320> running<00:03:05.650> so

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
go we got this window up and running so

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.560 
go we got this window up and running so
you<00:03:06.010> know<00:03:06.310> what's<00:03:06.460> really<00:03:06.610> cool<00:03:06.820> here<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.150> ok

you know what's really cool here is ok
great<00:03:07.780> we<00:03:07.870> got<00:03:08.020> this<00:03:08.140> as<00:03:08.320> an<00:03:08.440> external<00:03:08.710> display

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
great we got this as an external display

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.500 
great we got this as an external display
okay<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.520> demonstrated<00:03:10.030> all<00:03:10.150> that<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:10.450> you

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
okay so I demonstrated all that but you

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.580 
okay so I demonstrated all that but you
know<00:03:10.540> what<00:03:10.630> else<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.080> do<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:11.410> is

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
know what else you can do with this is

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.740 
know what else you can do with this is
you<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.070> actually<00:03:12.400> enter<00:03:12.670> in<00:03:12.850> interface<00:03:13.540> with

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
you can actually enter in interface with

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.930 
you can actually enter in interface with
it<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.230> touch<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.860> if<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.040> click<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.460> there

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
it with a touch so if I click it there

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.970 
it with a touch so if I click it there
goes<00:03:16.180> its<00:03:16.360> opening<00:03:16.630> up<00:03:16.720> another<00:03:16.810> one<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.320> could

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
goes its opening up another one I could

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.210 
goes its opening up another one I could
grab<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.430> scroll<00:03:18.970> bar<00:03:19.180> right<00:03:19.750> here<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:21.070> can

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
grab the scroll bar right here and I can

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.340 
grab the scroll bar right here and I can
move<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.520> around<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:23.020> you<00:03:23.110> know<00:03:23.170> take

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
move it around I can you know take

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.500 
move it around I can you know take
basically<00:03:24.040> take<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.520> whole<00:03:24.670> say<00:03:25.270> if<00:03:25.330> we<00:03:25.420> hit

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
basically take the whole say if we hit

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.690 
basically take the whole say if we hit
the<00:03:25.600> home<00:03:25.750> button<00:03:25.780> right<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:27.280> there<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.459> go<00:03:27.580> it

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
the home button right so there you go it

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.310 
the home button right so there you go it
brings<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.000> up<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.239> isn't<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.810> that's<00:03:29.140> pretty

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
brings it up so isn't it that's pretty

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.690 
brings it up so isn't it that's pretty
cool<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:29.680> it's<00:03:29.800> not<00:03:29.890> only<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.250> display<00:03:30.459> it's

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
cool so it's not only a display it's

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.370 
cool so it's not only a display it's
actually<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> touch<00:03:31.300> display<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.350> can

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
actually a touch display that you can

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.840 
actually a touch display that you can
interact<00:03:32.920> with<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.250> basically<00:03:33.310> wherever<00:03:33.760> you

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
interact with and basically wherever you

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.000 
interact with and basically wherever you
move<00:03:34.000> your<00:03:34.180> your<00:03:34.480> your<00:03:34.930> finger<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.470> where<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
move your your your finger is where the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.860 
move your your your finger is where the
cursor<00:03:36.340> goes<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:37.180> know<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.450> then<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.690> can

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
cursor goes you know and then you can

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.020 
cursor goes you know and then you can
basically<00:03:38.380> click<00:03:38.800> you<00:03:39.130> know<00:03:39.160> any<00:03:39.400> link<00:03:39.760> that

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
basically click you know any link that

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.970 
basically click you know any link that
you<00:03:40.180> might<00:03:40.360> want<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.660> go<00:03:40.780> into<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.739> scroll

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
you might want to go into the scroll

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.350 
you might want to go into the scroll
bars<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.190> little<00:03:42.370> tough<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.550> gotta<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:42.940> just

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
bars a little tough you gotta just just

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.570 
bars a little tough you gotta just just
grab<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.600> just<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:45.489> basically

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
grab it just right to to basically

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.210 
grab it just right to to basically
select<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.720> know<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.019> little<00:03:47.320> it's<00:03:48.190> a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
select it you know it's a little it's a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.009 
select it you know it's a little it's a
little<00:03:48.430> tricky<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.760> guess<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.239> grab<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.660> hold<00:03:49.930> of

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
little tricky I guess to grab a hold of

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.259 
little tricky I guess to grab a hold of
it<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:50.320> pretty<00:03:51.280> cool<00:03:51.459> couple<00:03:51.730> little<00:03:52.000> weird

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
it so pretty cool couple little weird

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.330 
it so pretty cool couple little weird
things<00:03:52.510> about<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.709> know<00:03:53.769> like<00:03:53.860> I<00:03:53.950> said<00:03:54.010> in

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
things about it you know like I said in

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.160 
things about it you know like I said in
the<00:03:54.459> in<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.700> mirroring<00:03:55.000> mode<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.630> whatever

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
the in the mirroring mode it whatever

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.630 
the in the mirroring mode it whatever
and<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.470> a<00:03:56.500> rougher<00:03:56.860> on<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.070> edges<00:03:57.310> maybe<00:03:57.489> on

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
and so a rougher on the edges maybe on

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.500 
and so a rougher on the edges maybe on
the<00:03:57.730> speed<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.030> don't<00:03:58.209> know<00:03:58.269> if<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:58.420> could

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
the speed I don't know if that could

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.000 
the speed I don't know if that could
really<00:03:58.660> be<00:03:58.810> improved<00:03:59.110> or<00:03:59.200> not<00:03:59.380> if<00:03:59.830> you<00:03:59.890> have<00:03:59.980> a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
really be improved or not if you have a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.350 
really be improved or not if you have a
good<00:04:00.160> Wi-Fi<00:04:00.519> connection<00:04:00.970> there's<00:04:01.120> probably

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
good Wi-Fi connection there's probably

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.970 
good Wi-Fi connection there's probably
no<00:04:01.480> reason<00:04:01.510> why<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.080> couldn't<00:04:02.440> go<00:04:02.800> a<00:04:02.830> little

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
no reason why it couldn't go a little

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.949 
no reason why it couldn't go a little
bit<00:04:03.130> quicker<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.940> but<00:04:04.120> overall<00:04:04.330> it's<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.750> pretty

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
bit quicker so but overall it's a pretty

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.170 
bit quicker so but overall it's a pretty
nifty<00:04:05.590> little<00:04:05.920> app<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.970> know<00:04:07.060> what's

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
nifty little app and you know what's

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.520 
nifty little app and you know what's
cool<00:04:07.330> about<00:04:07.360> this<00:04:07.660> is<00:04:07.720> again<00:04:08.170> it's<00:04:08.320> sort<00:04:08.470> of

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
cool about this is again it's sort of

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.900 
cool about this is again it's sort of
like<00:04:08.620> remote<00:04:08.920> desktop<00:04:09.310> so<00:04:09.430> if<00:04:09.519> I<00:04:09.550> want<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.790> just

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
like remote desktop so if I want to just

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.910 
like remote desktop so if I want to just

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
take this you know I could you know go

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.979 
take this you know I could you know go
away<00:04:12.340> from<00:04:12.489> my<00:04:12.610> desk<00:04:12.670> go<00:04:13.060> upstairs<00:04:13.450> downstairs

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
away from my desk go upstairs downstairs

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.690 
away from my desk go upstairs downstairs
and<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.950> know<00:04:15.010> taking<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.370> case<00:04:15.489> still

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
and you know taking the case still

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.610 
and you know taking the case still
control<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.630> know<00:04:16.720> my<00:04:16.870> computer<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.530> know

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
control you know my computer you know

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.870 
control you know my computer you know
through<00:04:17.830> this<00:04:17.980> so<00:04:18.250> again<00:04:18.310> it's<00:04:18.549> sort<00:04:18.700> of<00:04:18.730> like
