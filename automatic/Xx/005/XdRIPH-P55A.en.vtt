huge yeah i thought egg fleet was a
great<00:02:48.629> idea<00:02:48.660> for<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.230> level<00:02:49.620> there<00:02:50.459> was<00:02:50.670> very

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
great idea for a level there was very

great idea for a level there was very
effort<00:02:51.950> but<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.129> i'd<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.550> even<00:02:53.910> though

effort but then i'd like even though
that<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.450> level<00:02:54.840> was<00:02:54.959> mostly<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.739> glum

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
that that level was mostly just glum

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.790 
that that level was mostly just glum
riding<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.599> stuff<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.020> work<00:02:58.200> well<00:02:58.379> with<00:02:58.620> to
