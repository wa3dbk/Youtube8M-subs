cards so what I like to do here is I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.370 
cards so what I like to do here is I
like<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.560> sort<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:08.060> push<00:01:09.060> off<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:09.900> six

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
like to sort of push off the first six

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
like to sort of push off the first six
cards<00:01:12.200> okay<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.460> clump<00:01:15.030> them

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
cards okay and kind of clump them

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.990 
cards okay and kind of clump them
together<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.860> when<00:01:17.070> continue<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
together so that way when continue to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
together so that way when continue to
rib<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> spread<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.780> almost<00:01:19.229> looks<00:01:19.500> like

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
rib and spread it almost looks like

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
rib and spread it almost looks like
you're<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.920> ribbons<00:01:20.640> running<00:01:21.000> show<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you're just ribbons running show that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.899 
you're just ribbons running show that
it's<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.720> similar<00:01:22.229> deck<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> little<00:01:23.790> messy

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it's a similar deck it's a little messy

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
it's a similar deck it's a little messy
but<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:25.020> you're<00:01:25.140> putting<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.619> cards

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
but when you're putting the cards

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
but when you're putting the cards
together<00:01:26.450> when<00:01:27.450> you're<00:01:27.570> putting<00:01:27.750> them<00:01:27.900> back

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
together when you're putting them back

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.270 
together when you're putting them back
together<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.590> spread<00:01:28.799> them<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.070> out

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
together you can spread them back out

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.010 
together you can spread them back out
but<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.240> pinkie<00:01:30.780> break

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
but then get your pinkie break

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.370 
but then get your pinkie break
underneath<00:01:31.860> them<00:01:32.780> so<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
underneath them so we now you have a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
underneath them so we now you have a
pinkie<00:01:34.770> break<00:01:35.040> under<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.460> six<00:01:35.700> cars<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
you're ready to go you can do it any

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
you're ready to go you can do it any
different<00:01:39.270> way<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.200> long<00:01:40.229> as

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
different way you like just as long as
