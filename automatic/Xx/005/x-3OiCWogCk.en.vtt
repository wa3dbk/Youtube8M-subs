be the opportunities that Hawaii

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
be the opportunities that Hawaii
provides<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> local<00:01:20.790> area<00:01:21.090> that

pararescuemen or PJ's have to be

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.790 
pararescuemen or PJ's have to be
prepared<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.550> land<00:01:36.030> water<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> jungle

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
prepared for land water and jungle

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.520 
prepared for land water and jungle
scenarios<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:39.270> day<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> beach<00:01:40.020> landing

I<00:01:43.170> think<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> training<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.220> preparing<00:01:44.640> PJ's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
I think this training is preparing PJ's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.340 
I think this training is preparing PJ's
for<00:01:46.170> future<00:01:46.470> deployments<00:01:47.009> by<00:01:47.160> helping<00:01:47.670> us<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
for future deployments by helping us to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.900 
for future deployments by helping us to
integrate<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.530> other<00:01:49.710> units<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> area

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
integrate with other units in the area

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.880 
integrate with other units in the area
this<00:01:51.300> kind<00:01:51.569> of<00:01:51.690> focused<00:01:52.140> operational

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
this kind of focused operational

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.889 
this kind of focused operational
training<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.340> something<00:01:53.550> only<00:01:53.789> we<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.300> get<00:01:54.479> at

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
training is something only we can get at

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
training is something only we can get at
places<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.399> simulate<00:01:56.670> stuff

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
places like this you can simulate stuff

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.449 
places like this you can simulate stuff
but<00:01:57.780> until<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.440> get<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.830> environments<00:01:59.369> like

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
but until you get to environments like

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.090 
but until you get to environments like
this<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.000> work<00:02:00.179> with<00:02:00.420> other<00:02:00.750> assets<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.979> are

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this and work with other assets that are

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.219 
this and work with other assets that are
over<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.209> quite<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> same<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
over here it's not quite the same the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.900 
over here it's not quite the same the
training<00:02:04.679> can<00:02:05.069> get<00:02:05.250> very<00:02:05.459> physically

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
training can get very physically

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.620 
training can get very physically
demanding<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.509> PJ's<00:02:07.100> there<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.209> much<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
demanding for PJ's there is so much to

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.290 
demanding for PJ's there is so much to
know<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.770> much<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.100> stay<00:02:11.310> current<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
know and so much to stay current on you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.930 
know and so much to stay current on you
need<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.600> able<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.110> do<00:02:13.260> everything<00:02:14.040> fairly

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
need to be able to do everything fairly

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.850 
need to be able to do everything fairly
well<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:15.959> requires<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.440> lot<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> time

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
well so it just requires a lot of time

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.680 
well so it just requires a lot of time
and<00:02:17.069> effort<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.310> motivation<00:02:17.940> behind<00:02:18.330> the

and effort and motivation behind the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.960 
and effort and motivation behind the
scenes<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.350> takes<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.860> team<00:02:20.069> effort<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.610> ensure

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
