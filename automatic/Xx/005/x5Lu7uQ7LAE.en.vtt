all of Tony's motivations can be drawn

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.540 
all of Tony's motivations can be drawn
back<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.840> his<00:01:51.140> relationship<00:01:51.440> with<00:01:51.830> pepper<00:01:52.340> and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
back to his relationship with pepper and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.730 
back to his relationship with pepper and
wanting<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.360> protect<00:01:53.539> her<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.170> spend<00:01:54.470> time

wanting to protect her and spend time
with<00:01:54.800> her<00:01:55.220> seems<00:01:56.030> like<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.479> theme<00:01:56.720> that<00:01:57.020> was

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
with her seems like the theme that was

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.499 
with her seems like the theme that was
explored<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.860> Iron<00:01:58.100> Man<00:01:58.190> 3<00:01:58.340> will<00:01:58.880> result<00:01:59.330> in

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
explored in Iron Man 3 will result in

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.570 
explored in Iron Man 3 will result in
Tony<00:01:59.720> pushing<00:02:00.200> even<00:02:00.380> harder<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.070> protect<00:02:01.399> his

Tony pushing even harder to protect his
home<00:02:01.759> life<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.750> also<00:02:02.929> seems<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:03.409> Tony's

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
home life and it also seems like Tony's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.430 
home life and it also seems like Tony's
