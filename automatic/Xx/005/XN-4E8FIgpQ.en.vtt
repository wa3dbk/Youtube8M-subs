difference there it's about yeah let's

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.059 
difference there it's about yeah let's
say<00:04:57.289> it's<00:04:57.439> about<00:04:59.319> two-thirds<00:05:00.319> of<00:05:00.439> the<00:05:00.529> size<00:05:00.710> of

just a cheap knockoff sound quality is
terrible<00:05:19.550> and<00:05:19.990> i<00:05:20.990> just<00:05:21.139> realized<00:05:21.439> the<00:05:21.560> plastic

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
terrible and i just realized the plastic

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:23.469 
terrible and i just realized the plastic
wasn't<00:05:22.370> really<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.729> kind<00:05:22.849> of<00:05:22.969> plastic<00:05:23.180> that

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
wasn't really the kind of plastic that

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.179 
wasn't really the kind of plastic that
the<00:05:23.900> normal<00:05:24.199> ones<00:05:24.379> would<00:05:24.499> have<00:05:24.680> it's<00:05:24.889> a<00:05:24.949> really

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
the normal ones would have it's a really

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.450 
the normal ones would have it's a really
hard<00:05:25.279> cruddy<00:05:26.210> pal<00:05:26.479> has<00:05:26.719> to<00:05:26.990> him<00:05:27.139> and<00:05:27.529> if<00:05:28.370> you

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
hard cruddy pal has to him and if you

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.610 
hard cruddy pal has to him and if you
look<00:05:28.669> it's<00:05:29.449> all<00:05:29.569> see-through<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.229> little

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
look it's all see-through the little

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.339 
look it's all see-through the little
mesh<00:05:30.889> area<00:05:31.659> so<00:05:32.659> i'll<00:05:32.719> see<00:05:32.900> through<00:05:33.110> so

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
mesh area so i'll see through so

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.110 
mesh area so i'll see through so
obviously<00:05:33.830> they're<00:05:34.069> not<00:05:34.099> the<00:05:34.399> real<00:05:34.550> ipod

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
obviously they're not the real ipod

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.070 
obviously they're not the real ipod
headphones<00:05:35.240> because<00:05:35.569> they<00:05:35.719> have<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:35.839> really

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
headphones because they have a really

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.480 
headphones because they have a really
thick<00:05:36.469> mesh<00:05:36.740> area<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:39.649> it's<00:05:40.129> really<00:05:40.370> not

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
thick mesh area and this it's really not

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.570 
thick mesh area and this it's really not
well<00:05:40.669> put<00:05:40.849> together<00:05:42.129> obviously<00:05:43.129> it's<00:05:43.250> not<00:05:43.310> the

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
well put together obviously it's not the

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.619 
well put together obviously it's not the
real<00:05:43.699> one<00:05:43.759> because<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.180> doesn't<00:05:44.419> have<00:05:44.509> an

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629
