Tegra<00:00:57.420> 4<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.190> know<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.789> WCDMA<00:01:00.570> version

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
Tegra 4 as we all know the WCDMA version

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
Tegra 4 as we all know the WCDMA version
is<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.350> snapdragon<00:01:01.980> variant<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
is the snapdragon variant so it is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.810 
is the snapdragon variant so it is
pretty<00:01:03.930> much<00:01:04.019> obvious<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> fake
