00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
certain quality

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.960 
certain quality
I<00:01:27.020> mean<00:01:27.290> quality<00:01:28.070> comes<00:01:28.250> with<00:01:28.400> time<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.850> mean

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
I mean quality comes with time I mean

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.580 
I mean quality comes with time I mean
I'm<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:29.090> gonna<00:01:29.330> get<00:01:29.480> better<00:01:29.630> by<00:01:30.140> doing<00:01:30.170> it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
I'm just gonna get better by doing it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.800 
I'm just gonna get better by doing it
but<00:01:30.830> really<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.450> simplest

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
but really that that is the simplest

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.490 
but really that that is the simplest
advice<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:34.070> just<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.180> many<00:01:35.270> people

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
advice is to just do it so many people

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.390 
advice is to just do it so many people
don't<00:01:36.500> get<00:01:36.710> these<00:01:36.890> things<00:01:37.040> off<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.370> ground

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.730 
don't get these things off the ground
for<00:01:38.060> another<00:01:38.240> reason<00:01:38.479> then<00:01:38.870> they<00:01:39.410> just<00:01:39.620> not

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
for another reason then they just not

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.380 
for another reason then they just not
dedicated<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.520> they're<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:40.790> motivated<00:01:40.910> to

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
dedicated to it they're not motivated to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.570
