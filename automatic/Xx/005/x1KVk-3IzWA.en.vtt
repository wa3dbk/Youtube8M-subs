 [Music] 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.429
 hello my sweet because I'm back with 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.410
 the weather is the third of february 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.180
 and on the third of february it's not like that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.010
 a great day so personally 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.100
 already in the goose bumps and that is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.109
 the day the music died and why 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.970
 In 1959, three great musicians are present 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.420
 A plane crash killed 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.469
 including buddy holly or ritchie 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.579
 valens yes that 's such a serious topic 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.980
 I do not know how I do that to you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 to bring over 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.110
 we 'd rather watch this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.340
 Germany weather 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.870
 and how shall not see so well 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.450
 fantastic from the temperature never 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 make really bad mood minus 4 and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.379
 minus twelve degrees somehow distributed and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 whole Germany 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.469
 but there is a mix of sun 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.270
 and clouds only north 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.010
 it can be regional every now and then 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.449
 Although cut only in the morning 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.989
 but god oh so yes we have - 4 in 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.760
 hamburg in berlin - seven years and below 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.470
 to something around minus ten degrees 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.650
 I'm a bit out of this 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.640
 concept to do so 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.120
 to lose 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.560
 [Music] 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.900
 our night stays just as cold 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.150
 remaining days minus 11 to minus 16 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.160
 grad and that's never in the north east 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:31.920
 and the south is currently moving 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:33.970
 [Music] 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.560
 Incidentally, this misfortune was then 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.570
 filmed in 1984 the biggest hit of buddy 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.590
 holly at briggs peggy sue maybe 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.300
 you can change now 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.070
 So I'll see if I watch the movie 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.170
 Somewhere you get interested now 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.650
 So we have to see each other 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.900
 there orania 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.900
