 health unfortunately understood in some 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.200
 periods of having tired eyelids 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.310

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.310

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.680
 starting from age to end with stress 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.270
 which one of the most common factors then 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.420
 we just have to go and discover the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 causes 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.370
 the causes are many but most 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.020
 common are due to stress and the 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.670
 fatigue for those who work and are 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.430
 a lot of real pc or for the 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.570
 students who can hours on the books 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.210
 insomnia because he can't sleep 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.660
 at night or for those who sleep little so if 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 you can sleep at least seven hours a night 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.110
 For Allergies 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.960
 the continuous strikers of eyes or for 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 the sun so let's see immediately 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 what are the remedies to drink a lot of water 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.920
 definitely do well to our skin 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 to keep the skin hydrated ed 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 elastic be careful of exposure 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.660
 in the sun and always take shelter with glasses 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 dark and protective trains because even though 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.180
 you are tanned in the long run 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.480
 eye bags 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.190
 swell to sleep enough 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.290
 and also sleep with a pillow a 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.050
 a little higher helps the eyes to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.820
 appear less swollen at this point 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.030
 let's discover our remedies 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.240
 housewives and here comes to our aid the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.119
 Our much-loved green tea that helps 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.720
 reactivate the circulation and has effects 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.720
 antiinflammatory 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.140
 take a cotton pad the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.700
 divide money and we envy it over time 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.650
 then we put it of the freezer a 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.180
 couple of hours and we support it ours 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.280
 eyes for at least a couple of minutes 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.549
 pausing when the 10 seconds 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.100
 because the eye area is very delicate and 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.960
 this is a valid remedy to reduce and 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.960
 attenuate bags and dark circles 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.740
 among the natural remedies there are real e 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.439
 own exercises to do with the eyes 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.470
 this serves to exercise the eyelids 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.259
 lower and practically held 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.209
 fingers alles 30 of the eyes open and 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.709
 they close their eyes for at least ten 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.750
 times 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.510
 and now let's move on to make up a good one 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.569
 trick if it doesn't solve the problem how much 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.850
 the less it covers it to hide bags 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.120
 dark circles are generally used 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.790
 two correctors 1 orange to cover 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.260
 the darker area and one very much 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.260
 light that illuminates the lower area 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.860
 to get a good result I go to 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.810
 also illuminate my eyelid 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.810
 superior by correcting all the dyschromia 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.710
 and here is the result on my eyes not 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.060
 it is very visible for both light and light 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.130
 because anyway I don't have dark circles 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.080
 very marked 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.080
 but here the difference is quite evident 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.330
 and to complete the trick you do n't stay 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.910
 than putting a coat of VIPs on and then though 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.280
 to avoid 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.530
 of too dusty figures because they tend 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.060
 to highlight the fine lines so they are 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.660
 gone with a very light thread of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.470
 transparent powder and this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.510
 the result 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.920
 I hope the video was useful 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.340
 I send you a kiss 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.340
 to the next
