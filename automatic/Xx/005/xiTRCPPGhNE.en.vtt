00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.929 

well<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:01.829> had<00:00:02.070> somebody<00:00:02.220> asked<00:00:02.610> about<00:00:02.639> the

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
well I had somebody asked about the

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.690 
well I had somebody asked about the
shift<00:00:03.659> pattern<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.319> thing<00:00:04.560> because<00:00:05.490> it's

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
shift pattern in this thing because it's

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
shift pattern in this thing because it's
a<00:00:05.850> three<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> tree

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
a three on the tree

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.560 
a three on the tree
hey<00:00:07.109> there's<00:00:07.319> my<00:00:07.470> air<00:00:07.589> tank<00:00:08.240> it's<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.300> three<00:00:09.480> on

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
hey there's my air tank it's a three on

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.120 
hey there's my air tank it's a three on
the<00:00:09.630> tree<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.139> little<00:00:10.320> different<00:00:10.800> than

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
the tree it's a little different than

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.999 
the tree it's a little different than
the<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:11.880> modern<00:00:12.120> cars<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> I'll<00:00:13.830> just

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the you know modern cars so I'll just

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.420 
the you know modern cars so I'll just
show<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:15.089> shift<00:00:15.330> pattern<00:00:15.690> basically<00:00:16.430> you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
show you the shift pattern basically you

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.980 
show you the shift pattern basically you
pull<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.760> towards<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:20.119> go<00:00:21.119> up<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> that's

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
pull it towards you and go up and that's

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.950 
pull it towards you and go up and that's
reverse<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.150> then<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.269> pull<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.510> towards<00:00:24.840> you

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
reverse and then you pull it towards you

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.700 
reverse and then you pull it towards you
all<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.769> way<00:00:25.830> down<00:00:26.070> that's<00:00:26.760> first<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.960> you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
all the way down that's first and you

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
all the way down that's first and you
push<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.220> into<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.849> middle<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.240> then<00:00:30.660> you

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
push it up into the middle and then you

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.260 
push it up into the middle and then you
push<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> back<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:32.369> second<00:00:32.969> which

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
push it back and that's second which

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.880 
push it back and that's second which
makes<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.719> first<00:00:33.899> second<00:00:34.320> shift<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.800> of

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
makes the first second shift kind of

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.240 
makes the first second shift kind of
kind<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> tricky<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:37.170> back<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
kind of tricky and then back and all the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.940 
kind of tricky and then back and all the
way<00:00:38.309> down<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.850> third<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.379> pretty<00:00:40.829> much

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
way down is third and that's pretty much

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.000 
way down is third and that's pretty much
all<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
all there is to it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.490 
all there is to it
you<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.629> there's<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> story<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> whole

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you know there's a story about a whole

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.520 
you know there's a story about a whole
old<00:00:47.219> hot<00:00:47.730> rodders<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.239> take<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.170> they

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
old hot rodders they take this and they

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.340 
old hot rodders they take this and they
move<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.100> side<00:00:51.140> for<00:00:52.140> two

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
move it to the other side for two

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
move it to the other side for two
different<00:00:52.500> theories<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:54.239> when

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
different theories on that one is when

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
different theories on that one is when
they<00:00:54.570> flip<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.870> over<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.199> changes<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> pattern

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
they flip it over it changes the pattern

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
they flip it over it changes the pattern
a<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.149> someone<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.629> shift

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a little bit then make someone to shift

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.590 
a little bit then make someone to shift
easier<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:59.219> my<00:00:59.640> personal<00:01:00.059> favorite<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.449> they

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
easier but my personal favorite is they

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.740 
easier but my personal favorite is they
put<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.840> over<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.430> so<00:01:02.430> they've<00:01:02.609> got<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.539> left

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
put it over here so they've got the left

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.390 
put it over here so they've got the left
hand<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.350> shift<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.799> drive<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
hand here they can shift and drive and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.980 
hand here they can shift and drive and
then<00:01:05.489> their<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.790> hand<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.780> around

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
then their right hand they got around

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.789 
then their right hand they got around
their<00:01:07.200> woman<00:01:08.240> but<00:01:09.240> how<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.229> basically

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
their woman but how that is basically

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.730 
their woman but how that is basically
three<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> tree<00:01:11.460> pretty<00:01:12.060> simple<00:01:12.479> stuff

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
three on the tree pretty simple stuff

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.920 
three on the tree pretty simple stuff
obviously<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:14.220> no<00:01:14.450> markings<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
obviously there's no markings on it to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.920 
obviously there's no markings on it to
tell<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> what's<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.810> figured<00:01:18.810> I'd

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
tell you what's what but I figured I'd

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.010 
tell you what's what but I figured I'd
also<00:01:20.030> talk<00:01:21.030> about<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> problems

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
also talk about some of the problems

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
also talk about some of the problems
with<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.320> car<00:01:23.840> obviously<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.860> look

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
with this car obviously if you look

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.310 
with this car obviously if you look
around<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.909> interior<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.600> pretty<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:28.020> good

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
around the interior is pretty much good

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.850 
around the interior is pretty much good
and<00:01:28.530> pretty<00:01:28.890> much<00:01:28.979> trashed<00:01:30.770> everything<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and pretty much trashed everything is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.130 
and pretty much trashed everything is
gone<00:01:32.040> things<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.909> rusty<00:01:35.240> if<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.360> step<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.840> here

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
gone things are rusty if I step out here

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.310 
gone things are rusty if I step out here
I<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.680> show<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.189> big<00:01:38.939> huge<00:01:39.210> well<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
I can show you the big huge well you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
I can show you the big huge well you
can't<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> huge<00:01:41.040> hole<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.880> there's<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
can't see the huge hole but there's a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
can't see the huge hole but there's a
big<00:01:42.329> hole<00:01:42.509> right<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.350> floor<00:01:43.680> pan

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
big hole right in here this floor pan

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.980 
big hole right in here this floor pan
which<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.399> sitting<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.780> that's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
which is just sitting in here so that's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
which is just sitting in here so that's
all<00:01:46.170> rusted<00:01:46.530> away<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:47.130> sides<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> same<00:01:47.820> way

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
all rusted away that sides the same way

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.020 
all rusted away that sides the same way
there's<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.140> bit<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> back<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
there's a little bit in the back the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.389 
there's a little bit in the back the
body<00:01:51.210> itself<00:01:51.600> has<00:01:51.930> probably<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.740> bondo<00:01:53.220> than

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
body itself has probably more bondo than

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.389 
body itself has probably more bondo than
steel<00:01:53.759> at<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.720> point<00:01:55.020> even<00:01:55.740> though<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.159> looks

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
steel at this point even though it looks

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
steel at this point even though it looks
fairly<00:01:56.939> straight<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:58.020> lot<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> lot<00:01:58.860> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
fairly straight it's a lot a lot of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.859 
fairly straight it's a lot a lot of
bondo<00:01:59.719> rough<00:02:00.719> starting<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:01.500> over<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> place

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
bondo rough starting all over the place

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.350 
bondo rough starting all over the place
if<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.259> here<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.850> guy<00:02:05.969> who<00:02:06.030> owned<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
if you can see here the guy who owned it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.479 
if you can see here the guy who owned it
before<00:02:06.689> me<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.560> rusted<00:02:07.920> out<00:02:08.099> he<00:02:08.310> put

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
before me this was all rusted out he put

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.580 
before me this was all rusted out he put
bondo<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.929> covered<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.319> hole<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
bondo in here and covered the hole of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.010 
bondo in here and covered the hole of
bondo<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.430> guess<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.540> kind<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.810> gives<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
bondo so I guess that kind of gives you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.699 
bondo so I guess that kind of gives you
a<00:02:13.050> little

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
a little

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.490 
a little
idea<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:16.439> shape<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:18.200> there's<00:02:19.200> rust

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
idea of the shape it's in there's rust

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.100 
idea of the shape it's in there's rust
back<00:02:19.739> here<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:21.329> leaf<00:02:21.510> springs<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.079> back

back here the leaf springs in the back

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.580 
back here the leaf springs in the back

all fou barred up there's a ton of bondo

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.429 
all fou barred up there's a ton of bondo

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
as you can see there's holes pretty much

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.849 
as you can see there's holes pretty much
everywhere<00:02:44.040> uh-huh<00:02:44.879> so<00:02:45.870> there's<00:02:46.079> there's<00:02:46.709> not

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
everywhere uh-huh so there's there's not

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.759 
everywhere uh-huh so there's there's not
much<00:02:47.040> left<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.489> body

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
much left to the body

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.890 
much left to the body
engine<00:02:49.769> smokes<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.250> little<00:02:50.340> bit<00:02:50.959> clutch<00:02:51.959> slips

engine smokes a little bit clutch slips
suspensions<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.049> wore<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.409> in<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> front

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
suspensions all wore out in the front

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.089 
suspensions all wore out in the front
you<00:02:56.129> know<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.720> think<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.739> ever<00:02:58.920> did

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
you know so I think if I ever did

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.879 
you know so I think if I ever did
anything<00:02:59.189> with<00:02:59.609> this<00:02:59.790> car<00:03:00.470> she'd<00:03:01.470> get<00:03:01.650> a

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
anything with this car she'd get a

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.849 
anything with this car she'd get a
beefier<00:03:02.400> engine<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.290> I'd<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.500> replace

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
beefier engine and I'd have to replace

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.899 
beefier engine and I'd have to replace
the<00:03:05.010> entire<00:03:05.239> back<00:03:06.239> end<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.720> car<00:03:06.959> basically

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
the entire back end of the car basically

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.460 
the entire back end of the car basically
so<00:03:08.909> probably<00:03:09.599> set<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.079> with<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> better

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
so probably set it up with a better

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.220 
so probably set it up with a better
setup<00:03:10.739> than<00:03:10.859> one<00:03:11.129> you<00:03:11.549> know<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.569> leaf<00:03:12.930> springs

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
setup than one you know the leaf springs

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.890 
setup than one you know the leaf springs
way<00:03:13.409> ahead<00:03:13.879> this<00:03:14.879> isn't<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.269> original<00:03:15.659> engine

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
way ahead this isn't the original engine

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.699 
way ahead this isn't the original engine
that's<00:03:16.590> been<00:03:16.829> replaced<00:03:17.129> at<00:03:17.430> some<00:03:17.459> point<00:03:18.709> it

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
that's been replaced at some point it

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.189 
that's been replaced at some point it
does<00:03:19.859> run<00:03:20.069> pretty<00:03:20.310> good<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:20.959> with<00:03:21.959> everything

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
does run pretty good but with everything

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.750 
does run pretty good but with everything
else<00:03:22.410> wrong<00:03:22.620> with<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:22.889> car<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.310> especially

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
else wrong with this car and especially

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.659 
else wrong with this car and especially
the<00:03:24.000> rust<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:25.069> really<00:03:26.069> not<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.250> car<00:03:26.489> worth

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
the rust it's really not a car worth

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.199 
the rust it's really not a car worth
restoring<00:03:27.090> but<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.079> would<00:03:28.260> like<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> put<00:03:28.709> a

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
restoring but I would like to put a

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.059 
restoring but I would like to put a
bigger<00:03:30.209> engine<00:03:30.419> in<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.169> know<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.769> drag

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
bigger engine in it you know not a drag

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.909 
bigger engine in it you know not a drag
engine<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:32.970> something<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.959> go<00:03:34.409> quick<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.799> the

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
engine but something to go quick on the

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.129 
engine but something to go quick on the
street<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.699> then<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.569> course<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.870> different

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
street and then of course a different

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.309 
street and then of course a different
transmission<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.629> beefed<00:03:39.629> up<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.959> rear<00:03:40.109> end

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
transmission and beefed up the rear end

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.520 
transmission and beefed up the rear end
quite<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.530> bit<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:41.040> don't<00:03:41.819> think<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.530> get

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
quite a bit I don't think I can get

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.550 
quite a bit I don't think I can get
under<00:03:43.769> here<00:03:43.919> to<00:03:44.069> show<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:44.870> it's<00:03:45.870> bad<00:03:46.169> it

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
under here to show you but it's bad it

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.729 
under here to show you but it's bad it
needs<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.940> needs<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.359> lot<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.690> work<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.169> it's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
needs it needs a lot of work and it's

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.780 
needs it needs a lot of work and it's
not<00:03:50.040> really<00:03:50.430> worth<00:03:50.639> a<00:03:50.909> full<00:03:51.150> restoration<00:03:51.900> but

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
not really worth a full restoration but

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.860 
not really worth a full restoration but
that's<00:03:53.790> pretty<00:03:53.940> much<00:03:54.150> all<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.389> problems<00:03:54.720> I'm

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
that's pretty much all the problems I'm

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.479 
that's pretty much all the problems I'm
sure<00:03:55.019> there's<00:03:55.199> more<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:55.769> can't<00:03:56.099> think<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.370> at

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
sure there's more I I can't think of at

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.000 
sure there's more I I can't think of at
the<00:03:56.579> moment<00:03:56.760> but<00:03:57.470> that's<00:03:58.470> pretty<00:03:58.709> much<00:03:58.859> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
the moment but that's pretty much the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.390 
the moment but that's pretty much the
Falcon<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.699> suppose<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.449> should<00:04:00.629> show<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
Falcon I suppose I should show you the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.050 
Falcon I suppose I should show you the
other<00:04:02.400> side

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
other side

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.610 
other side
where<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.500> where<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.680> back<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:07.159> I<00:04:08.620> started

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
where the where the back is I started
