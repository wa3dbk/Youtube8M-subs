 at first glance 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.049
 the games are very similar visually to the very beginning 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.020

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.459
 there is a trial and critical stabs in the back and 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.340
 head after killing an enemy you get 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.680
 invaluable bits of experience worth noting 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.709

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.750
 you will see your characterâ€™s feet so far 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.790

 spell among which 8 secret on 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.140
 throughout the game you find me with 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.420
 depicting the helm of all such run about 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.190
 20 pieces to create

 spell you need to draw on 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.200
 screen a certain combination of run were in 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.940
 the game and scrolls spells also

 the ability to wear magic rings 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.530
 it soon turns out that our main character 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.740
 this guard who was sent to this world 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.690
 deal with a certain demon akbar here 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.959
 only demon is not our only 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.430
 the opponent he has his admirers 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.890
 if not small army 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.600
 the farther you went in the order 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.290

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.989
 solve 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.120
 In general, the solution of problems both complex and 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.660
 not very much the main source 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.340
 experience the atmosphere of the game is sticky and gloomy 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.040
 sometimes it is not a journey 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.739
 somewhere in the lower levels are constant 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.500

 next to the fireplace will connect 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.540
 interesting fact 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:18.380

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:20.420

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.900
 number of parts as well 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.360
 interaction with most gaming 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.190
 items donated to the chicken dog 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.890

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.140
 fried fish 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.990
 but if you killed a zombie, then you must 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.780
 an aspen stake is required to complete it 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.120

 underground levels is large 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.090
 the number of secrets and caches that 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.370
 concerns your inventory then 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.800
 you could use almost any 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.900
 object for example finding a mortar and pestle 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.660

 to spell the hapless sorcerer as well 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:40.260
 much more is in the game and not

 know that all their merchants keep good 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.020
 in chests 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.460
 there is a trade in the game 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.530
 primitive of course put in the chest 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.530
 merchants item and instantly get 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.980
 money but despite all the good in the game 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.710
 were 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.600
 and cons example draw magic runes 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.700
 it was a real challenge 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.100
 especially enraged when you tried 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.950
 draw one rune but the game thought that 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.920
 you draw another control was also 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.930
 not the most successful our character felt 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.610
 wooden and slow it 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.950
 affected spells that 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.540
 miss it was time to spit in general 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.390
 real hardcore 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.880
 despite the fact that arx fatalis was 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.870
 interesting and quite modern game 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.500
 for its time 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.870
 due recognition she did not receive and with 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.970
 the above minuses could 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.470
 quite easy to handle in the following 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.690
 parts 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.060
 arks fatalis is undoubtedly that game 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.050
 who admire such games 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.990
 like fallout 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.990
 gothic the elder scrolls and other

 representatives of the classic lpg genre 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.180
 least miss this hybrid of 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.920
 action rpg and adventure are definitely not worth it 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.970

 the game is completely duplicated in Russian 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.050

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.640
 try something new who knows 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.860
