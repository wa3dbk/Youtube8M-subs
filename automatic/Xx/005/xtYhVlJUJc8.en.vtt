print<00:00:34.620> story<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> store<00:00:36.210> my

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
print story but this is how I store my

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
print story but this is how I store my
prints<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.910> size<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.570> six<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.820> what<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
prints for this size in a six and what I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.810 
prints for this size in a six and what I
have<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.260> basically<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.980> six<00:00:44.610> by<00:00:44.760> four

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
have is it's basically a six by four

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.930 
have is it's basically a six by four
inch<00:00:45.239> photo<00:00:45.809> box<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.520> actually

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
inch photo box and this was actually

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.810 
inch photo box and this was actually
surprisingly<00:00:48.719> hard<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> find<00:00:49.820> that's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
surprisingly hard to find that's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.930 
surprisingly hard to find that's
obviously<00:00:51.180> speaking<00:00:51.600> from<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.860> British<00:00:53.640> point

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
obviously speaking from a British point

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.680 
obviously speaking from a British point
of<00:00:54.120> view<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.829> assume<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:57.030> guys<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.480> North

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
of view I assume that you guys in North

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
of view I assume that you guys in North
America<00:00:58.140> or<00:00:58.320> maybe<00:00:58.890> Australia<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.489> anyone

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
America or maybe Australia or anyone

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.069 
America or maybe Australia or anyone
like<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.149> might<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.420> able<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> find<00:01:00.899> them<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like that might be able to find them a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
like that might be able to find them a
bit<00:01:01.199> easier<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.280> don't<00:01:02.370> know<00:01:02.579> maybe<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
bit easier and I don't know maybe I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.050 
bit easier and I don't know maybe I
don't<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.449> why<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.559> can't<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> know

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
don't know why really we can't you know

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.520 
don't know why really we can't you know
get<00:01:06.390> hold<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.810> quite<00:01:07.020> easily<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.409> at

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
get hold of these quite easily but at

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
get hold of these quite easily but at
the<00:01:07.619> time<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.189> buying<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.909> could

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the time that I was buying this I could

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
the time that I was buying this I could
not<00:01:09.869> find<00:01:10.170> an<00:01:10.380> alternative<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.040> why

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
not find an alternative so that's why

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.359 
not find an alternative so that's why
it's<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.490> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:13.220> boring<00:01:14.220> ish

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
like if I could pick a different colour

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.840 
like if I could pick a different colour
probably<00:01:18.570> pick<00:01:18.840> something<00:01:19.500> else<00:01:19.619> yeah<00:01:20.430> they

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
probably pick something else yeah they

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
probably pick something else yeah they
are<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.210> photo<00:01:21.390> storage<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.710> weren't

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
are for photo storage and they weren't

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
are for photo storage and they weren't
cheap<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:24.119> they're<00:01:24.270> about<00:01:24.390> 7<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.259> 8

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
cheap I think they're about 7 to 8

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.770 
cheap I think they're about 7 to 8
pounds<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.920> box<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:27.180> came<00:01:27.360> with<00:01:27.570> these

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
pounds of box and they came with these

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.539 
pounds of box and they came with these
dividers<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:29.060> match<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.360> actual<00:01:30.479> box<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
dividers to match the actual box and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.469 
dividers to match the actual box and
they<00:01:32.549> came<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:32.970> stickers<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.360> could

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
they came with little stickers you could

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
they came with little stickers you could
put<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.750> top<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.380> prints<00:01:34.650> change

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
put on top but because my prints change

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.910 
put on top but because my prints change
so<00:01:35.670> often<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.030> didn't<00:01:36.240> want<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so often I didn't want to do that but I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
so often I didn't want to do that but I
also<00:01:38.189> bought<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.549> cardboard<00:01:39.270> ones<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
also bought some cardboard ones and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.469 
also bought some cardboard ones and
they're<00:01:40.259> actually<00:01:40.590> yeah<00:01:40.829> index<00:01:41.280> cards<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
they're actually yeah index cards if I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.679 
they're actually yeah index cards if I
turn<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.869> around<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:45.540> there's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
turn them around so so actually there's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.389 
turn them around so so actually there's
kind<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> does<00:01:46.140> need<00:01:46.290> sorting<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:47.159> I

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
kind of does need sorting out because I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
kind of does need sorting out because I

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
lot of spare dividers because like I

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.020 
lot of spare dividers because like I
said<00:02:36.360> I've<00:02:37.100> just<00:02:38.100> continued<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> lot<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.820> prints

said I've just continued a lot of prints

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
said I've just continued a lot of prints
and<00:02:39.270> then<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.470> goes<00:02:40.650> from<00:02:40.680> s<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:42.510> read<00:02:43.280> here

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and then it goes from s to read here

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.870 
and then it goes from s to read here
then<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.330> could<00:02:45.510> probably<00:02:46.080> fit<00:02:46.920> best<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.670> here

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
then I could probably fit best in here

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.790 
then I could probably fit best in here
