00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 Hello everyone, we found good talk today 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.240
 a technology integrated by citizens 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.609
 born a cooling solution of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 high end but that is always being done 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.880
 more appreciated also in systems since 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 lower cost 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.039
 and it is precisely in this direction that now 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.320
 palermo a stars and one 100 tv that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.270
 we will analyze the packaging of the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 if it is certainly not the most 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.780
 exciting in the point of view 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 aesthetic but this is without a shadow of 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.020
 doubt a product that focuses on everything 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 performance and price 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.730
 the fan supplied is a munster applet 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.190
 120 mm with a blade design 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 rather particular to maximize 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 the flow to vary the pressure 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.190
 static without a doubt therefore an excellent one 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 fan to match a surface 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.140
 radiant this and true heat sink e 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.699
 just consists of two elements a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.799
 radiator for cooling 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.140
 water circle is a group 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.330
 main inside which is integrated both 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.390
 the water block that the pump for wines 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 fluid circle the pipes and fittings 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
 they are the same ones used on the whole 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.330
 range of heat sinks said on 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.680
 so from this point of view one does not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.470
 they can sleep quiet dreams 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.619
 about the reliability of six hundred networks 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.900
 a complete set of adapters and DVDs 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.380
 ensures compatibility with all 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.560
 gpu 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.329
 currently trade before 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.500
 proceed to the assembly we go to see 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.860
 the accessories 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 in the package a nice single flat for 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.710
 socket amd and intel except 2011 that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.260
 we're going to mount on the back of the card 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.190
 mother to provide an installation more 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.580
 sure to our main group two 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.390
 mounting adapters for screws and bolts 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.250
 for mounting the same adapters 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.500
 and of the realm lines the assembly of the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 radiator fan unit to our crisis 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 we prepare the betclic for assembly 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.270
 in our case the main group 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.950
 they are the cpi 57 50 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.620
 so let's use screws 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 therefore chromed in the holes prepared for 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.860
 intel socket 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.420
 the snap-on fasteners for 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.500
 ensure life in the right way 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.739
 position 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.060
 in this way when you are finished here's the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.040
 our beyblade ready for assembly 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.380
 then we go on fixing the fan so 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.680
 to push his predator with the new 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.100
 master cooler in plain sight the tubes that 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.390
 they come out from the front 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.019
 let's see then to use the screws 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.459
 black for fixing the fan ai 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.860
 four corners 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.590
 the first step will be to ensure 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.510
 the radiator the housing on which 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.870
 installing it will depend on the possibility 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.640
 of your caze us on our No. 600 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:03.239
 we're going to install on a bulkhead 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:05.670
 right once the backflip is inserted 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.120
 enough to reassure the main group 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.150
 to our software with the use of 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.050
 bolts supplied the sign 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.720
 minus 120 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.100
 it is an excellent cooling solution 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.710
 both for the climate and for the 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.710
 professional search for difficulties since 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.400
 an armature in the socket area 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.590
 despite the very aggressive price 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.350
 however it does not fail to offer solutions 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.000
 effective techniques that translate into 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.860
 excellent performance and a good one 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.930
 provision in terms of noise 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.240
 we conclude this ours too 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.130
 appointment also thanked roma sky 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.430
 italy for the ball set object of this 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.430
 video
