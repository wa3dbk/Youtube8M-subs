00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
Holy Grail and this is now become a Holy

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.529 
Holy Grail and this is now become a Holy
Grail<00:05:23.529> I<00:05:23.800> used<00:05:24.249> to<00:05:24.400> use<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.669> L'Oreal<00:05:25.089> micellar

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
Grail I used to use the L'Oreal micellar

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.200 
Grail I used to use the L'Oreal micellar
water<00:05:25.839> as<00:05:26.169> I<00:05:26.789> do<00:05:27.789> this<00:05:28.889> then<00:05:29.889> use<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.669> micellar

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
water as I do this then use the micellar

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.059 
water as I do this then use the micellar
water<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:32.020> kind<00:05:32.229> of<00:05:32.319> take<00:05:32.500> off<00:05:32.680> any<00:05:32.919> residue

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
water to kind of take off any residue

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.559 
water to kind of take off any residue
because<00:05:33.490> this<00:05:33.610> has<00:05:33.759> got<00:05:33.789> a<00:05:33.969> little<00:05:34.210> bit<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.389> oil

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
because this has got a little bit of oil

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.040 
because this has got a little bit of oil
in<00:05:34.719> it

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
in it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.719 
in it
taking<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.589> residue<00:05:35.860> off<00:05:35.949> my<00:05:36.069> face<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.550> eyes

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
taking the residue off my face and eyes

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.089 
taking the residue off my face and eyes
and<00:05:37.089> then<00:05:37.599> finish<00:05:37.930> with<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.229> on<00:05:38.409> my<00:05:38.560> face<00:05:38.830> but

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
and then finish with this on my face but

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.579 
and then finish with this on my face but
this<00:05:39.250> is<00:05:39.399> too<00:05:39.610> strong<00:05:39.969> for<00:05:40.149> my<00:05:40.240> eyes<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:41.229> I<00:05:41.259> need

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:41.589 
this is too strong for my eyes so I need

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.050 
this is too strong for my eyes so I need
something<00:05:42.069> that's<00:05:42.279> kind<00:05:42.370> of<00:05:42.580> a<00:05:42.669> bit<00:05:42.849> milder

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
something that's kind of a bit milder

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.269 
something that's kind of a bit milder
and<00:05:43.539> it<00:05:43.689> was<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.169> L'Oreal<00:05:44.560> one<00:05:44.770> but<00:05:44.949> this<00:05:45.099> one

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
and it was the L'Oreal one but this one

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.329 
and it was the L'Oreal one but this one
is<00:05:45.370> much<00:05:45.550> better<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:46.240> actually<00:05:46.899> I<00:05:47.339> can

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339 
is much better and actually I can

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.490 
is much better and actually I can
sometimes<00:05:48.669> skip<00:05:49.240> this<00:05:49.419> step<00:05:49.779> if<00:05:49.960> I've<00:05:50.169> not<00:05:50.319> got

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
sometimes skip this step if I've not got

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.260 
sometimes skip this step if I've not got
a<00:05:50.529> lot<00:05:50.560> of<00:05:50.800> makeup<00:05:51.009> on<00:05:51.370> which<00:05:51.969> isn't<00:05:52.120> very

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
a lot of makeup on which isn't very

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.749 
a lot of makeup on which isn't very
often<00:05:52.569> I<00:05:52.990> could<00:05:53.649> use<00:05:53.830> this<00:05:54.009> to<00:05:54.219> take<00:05:54.370> off<00:05:54.520> all

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
often I could use this to take off all

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.230 
often I could use this to take off all
my<00:05:54.909> makeup<00:05:55.089> and<00:05:56.339> this<00:05:57.339> just<00:05:57.639> could<00:05:57.879> wipe<00:05:58.060> away

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
my makeup and this just could wipe away

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.119 
my makeup and this just could wipe away
all<00:05:58.330> of<00:05:58.569> my<00:05:58.750> eye<00:05:59.259> makeup<00:05:59.710> where<00:05:59.919> it's<00:06:00.009> the

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
all of my eye makeup where it's the

all of my eye makeup where it's the
L'Oreal<00:06:00.520> worn<00:06:00.819> it<00:06:00.939> wasn't<00:06:01.210> as<00:06:01.300> strong<00:06:01.569> and<00:06:01.689> it

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
L'Oreal worn it wasn't as strong and it

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.629 
L'Oreal worn it wasn't as strong and it
didn't<00:06:02.020> take<00:06:02.139> those<00:06:02.379> last<00:06:02.680> remnants<00:06:03.310> of<00:06:03.430> kind

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
didn't take those last remnants of kind

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.610 
didn't take those last remnants of kind
of<00:06:03.729> mascara<00:06:04.149> and<00:06:04.479> eyeliner<00:06:04.569> off<00:06:05.050> whereas<00:06:05.529> I
