00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:08.860
 From here on we will explain the colloidal solution 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.910
 First of all, I would like to explain what a colloidal solution is. 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.799
 Though I think 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:20.320
 It's a colloid solution, so that is what the Western room is this well particle 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:21.140
 It seems that the thing called in the style of colloidal particles melts, so it's a colloid 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.669
 Solution and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.449
 Say say this colloid solution it's a reason to say to the wind and say Datte do such'm this 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.980
 is not it 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.489
 The amount is a matter of size, that is, the colloid particles are roughly 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:39.050
 Ne 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:41.130
 This and about -5 Article cm of size of particles in the -7 Article in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.850
 Depending on the Fu say that colloidal particles 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.870
 This is actually a Western room of ordinary solution 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.790
 Or ordinary Western-style said Toka Toka ion molecules that are dissolved in the Western region 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 This is because roughly say that I'm larger than this is 2 so-called plain of the Western region of the state 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:01.120
 -7 Article centimeters I'm a below Well I am just colloidal particles in this now in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.979
 From -7 Article 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.509
 Because I was referred to as the negative factory centimeter of the medium was in the smallest value in the - 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:14.110
 Seven rows of centimeters, which is the smallest here, but even smaller than that 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:19.240
 It's normal but usually smaller 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:24.520
 It says a little larger than the ion Toka molecules that are dissolved in the ordinary solution because it is a Well 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.200
 This is a colloidal particle, and if it gets bigger than this, this is 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.770
 It becomes precipitating particles 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.700
 In other words , it 's more than -5 centimeters inside , which means it 's too big 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.860
 Precipitates 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.230
 Well or if it is 8 times that of water, for example, if it is smaller than the density of water, it will attract you 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.280
 small 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:47.000
 It will float, but what sink will it sink 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:52.370
 There is also a case of floating or 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.570
 Well like that, it melts in the solution because it floats or sinks 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.460
 It is not to say that there is also size minus 50cm or more of When this size 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.220
 It happens when I'm not able to dissolve anymore 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.740
 Because 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.160
 Only the size that can be melted This can be understood in the manner of colloidal particles 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.600
 is 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:15.710
 Well, it 's bigger than so-called ordinary Western-style Western rooms, so variously. 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.120
 It is a colloidal solution in which this colloidal particle is dissolved compared to a normal solution 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.780
 The voice quality is different. Well, I will learn about that here. 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.970
 But 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:31.460
 The first difference is here as a low sheet then a semipermeable membrane this is 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.590
 a well but is shown here and want to confirm for the ease of this currency 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.620
 Or 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.670
 It is both Roche and peninsula work 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.840
 It is a Nagai store , but I can not see beans, but small holes are open. 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.450
 In the first place, filter paper is used in the case of filtering well . 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.470
 Say what was what operation of use and I aging 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.580
 Separates dissolved and undissolved in solution 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.030
 In the western region is not melted 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.950
 I can't make Roche's hole go on, right? 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:05.050
 What corresponds to whether it sinks or floats in the solution as before ? 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:09.940
 That undissolved particles This means -5-cho centimeters or more of Specifically 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.230
 Can not or make a hole in the Roh Mr. thing of such size is that the size of about 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.600
 It is too big 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.140
 2 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.290
 It made especially to say that can not what this is not short melted 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.219
 It is equivalent to being separated at Loja 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.909
 Because the colloidal particles are melting at the last minute 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:29.230
 You can pass by Mr. Liu You can pass by Mr. Liu 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:34.690
 It is different from this unmelted particle 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:38.019
 However, there is something with a smaller hole and this is a semi-permeable membrane, so this peninsula back 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:43.269
 Although For has emerged even at the osmotic pressure 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:47.049
 Handbag I've been vacant more small of the fact than Roh says to this I to this semi-permeable membrane 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.220
 This well particle can not pass through 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.460
 The hole in the handbag is smaller 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.930
 Its this thread particles you can not pass through 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:03.380
 By the way, this so-called ordinary solution is a Western-style room that is pocked in an ordinary solution 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:06.890
 It's what Toka in the case of less than minus 75cm of Well usually in case noise Toka molecule also Seitsume 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.210
 You can pass through this semipermeable membrane hole 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.760
 If you ask this way, this is the penetration 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:20.010
 When the explanation of high pressure is no or the explanation of osmotic pressure, the molecule of water is a semipermeable membrane . 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:24.420
 It is possible to pass through, but what is dissolved there is said that the western room can not pass through the hole of the semipermeable membrane 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:29.230
 I think it seems like I think it 's a good question though 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:33.280
 In fact, here is a subtle but anti-gaming that ions and molecules pass 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.750
 In fact it has different it is depending on the type that is 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.470
 The size of a small child , such as sodium ion or chloride ion 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:46.000
 If this is true, it is actually possible to do currency 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.490
 However, the size of the hole changes with the kind of semipermeable membrane, so that kind of thing 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.729
 Is also related but if it is small 2 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:57.220
 It is, for example, to some extent large but I will say that it is 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:05:02.199
 Atsushi Sato Well, if the islands melt in that, the documents of the islands become somewhat large 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:08.229
 When it comes, it means that it can not easily pass through the semipermeable membrane, actually 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:08.480
 It is the size of the hole of the semipermeable membrane and its melting 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.920
 Are 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:17.750
 Anything biting or that you can not pass Taurus anything and everything but I was the size of a trade-off 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.320
 Not the fact that it can pass through , but the type of semi-permeable membrane actually 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.580
 And the kind of this ion or molecule, that is, its size. 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.500
 It will be decided by the balance so it is around that 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:34.260
 It's a bit confusing with the news report pressure 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:37.140
 It is what its now but leave the pussy supplement so easy it is or rather misunderstanding confusion 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.190
 Back to talk about colloid particles 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.700
 Colloidal particles 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:47.590
 Also but anyway hole of the semi-permeable membrane can not pass through 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:53.160
 If Roche's hole is large enough to pass through, that's why that's why 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.160
 First of all, please understand that it is this well solution that is dissolved
