it accidentally ingests the flea we know

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.639 
it accidentally ingests the flea we know
that<00:01:47.640> our<00:01:47.670> cats<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.570> hunt<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:49.020> well<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
that our cats like to hunt as well and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.929 
that our cats like to hunt as well and
so<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.100> infect<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> infected

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
so they can infect the infected

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.899 
so they can infect the infected
themselves<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.170> immature<00:01:53.070> forms<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.729> these

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
themselves with immature forms of these

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.450 
themselves with immature forms of these
intestinal<00:01:54.750> parasites<00:01:55.320> by<00:01:55.710> ingestion<00:01:56.159> of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
intestinal parasites by ingestion of

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.410 
intestinal parasites by ingestion of
tissues<00:01:56.939> from<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.450> host<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.259> were

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
tissues from the host that they were

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.020 
tissues from the host that they were
they<00:02:00.420> hunted<00:02:00.750> down<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.170> caught<00:02:01.490> kitties<00:02:02.490> roll

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
they hunted down and caught kitties roll

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.670 
they hunted down and caught kitties roll
around<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.509> dirt<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.350> could<00:02:04.560> get

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
around in the dirt and they could get

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
around in the dirt and they could get
soil<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.280> their<00:02:05.490> hair<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.299> talked<00:02:06.540> about

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
soil on their hair and we talked about

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.499 
soil on their hair and we talked about
environmental<00:02:07.409> contamination<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.910> problem

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
environmental contamination as a problem

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.340 
environmental contamination as a problem
and<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.410> come<00:02:11.129> inside<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.879> groom<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
and so if they come inside and groom the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.110 
and so if they come inside and groom the
off<00:02:12.620> their<00:02:12.830> hair<00:02:13.040> coat<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.550> accidentally

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
off their hair coat and accidentally

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.450 
off their hair coat and accidentally
ingest<00:02:14.510> an<00:02:14.690> infective<00:02:15.200> egg<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:16.280> little

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
ingest an infective egg and then little

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.250 
ingest an infective egg and then little
kitties<00:02:16.820> like<00:02:17.000> Josh<00:02:17.270> here<00:02:17.570> can<00:02:17.780> get<00:02:17.930> infected

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
kitties like Josh here can get infected

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.380 
kitties like Josh here can get infected
from<00:02:18.650> their<00:02:18.980> mother<00:02:19.220> when<00:02:19.430> they<00:02:19.550> nurse<00:02:19.970> now

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
from their mother when they nurse now

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.180 
from their mother when they nurse now
how<00:02:20.600> do<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.750> know<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.110> your<00:02:21.260> your<00:02:21.770> cats<00:02:22.010> at

cat<00:02:23.600> well<00:02:24.500> indoor<00:02:24.800> cats<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.370> get<00:02:25.490> fleas<00:02:25.760> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
cat well indoor cats can get fleas and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.540 
cat well indoor cats can get fleas and
fleas<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.260> already<00:02:27.470> said<00:02:27.680> are<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.370> most

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
fleas we have already said are the most

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.970 
fleas we have already said are the most
common<00:02:28.940> source<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.270> tapeworms<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.860> know

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
common source of tapeworms and you know

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.410 
common source of tapeworms and you know
in<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.130> fall<00:02:31.400> when<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.760> temperature<00:02:32.240> outside

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
in the fall when the temperature outside

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.840 
in the fall when the temperature outside
starts<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.200> go<00:02:33.350> down<00:02:33.590> little<00:02:34.160> rodents<00:02:34.520> come<00:02:34.700> in

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
starts to go down little rodents come in

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.990 
starts to go down little rodents come in
the<00:02:34.940> house<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.510> try<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.350> stay<00:02:36.650> warm<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.310> cats

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
the house and try to stay warm and cats

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.150 
the house and try to stay warm and cats
catch<00:02:38.360> rodents<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:39.560> also<00:02:39.740> know<00:02:40.130> that

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
catch rodents we also know that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.090 
catch rodents we also know that
cockroaches<00:02:41.150> can<00:02:41.720> be<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> source<00:02:42.530> of<00:02:42.740> infection

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
cockroaches can be a source of infection

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.070 
cockroaches can be a source of infection
and<00:02:43.490> we've<00:02:43.640> seen<00:02:43.940> kitties<00:02:44.300> eat<00:02:44.480> bugs<00:02:44.720> before

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
and we've seen kitties eat bugs before

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.670 
and we've seen kitties eat bugs before
so<00:02:46.070> indoor<00:02:46.790> cats<00:02:47.060> certainly<00:02:47.600> are<00:02:47.900> not<00:02:47.960> immune

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
so indoor cats certainly are not immune

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.160 
so indoor cats certainly are not immune
to<00:02:48.710> infection<00:02:49.490> we<00:02:49.910> have<00:02:50.090> dogs<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.660> lot<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.870> times

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
to infection we have dogs a lot of times

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.350 
to infection we have dogs a lot of times
and<00:02:51.410> cats<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:52.190> our<00:02:52.280> dogs<00:02:52.520> go<00:02:52.730> outside<00:02:53.060> they

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
and cats and if our dogs go outside they

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.790 
and cats and if our dogs go outside they
bring<00:02:53.600> parasites<00:02:54.050> back<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:54.590> them<00:02:54.710> when

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
bring parasites back in with them when

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.110 
bring parasites back in with them when
they<00:02:54.920> come<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.370> what<00:02:55.550> can<00:02:55.610> these<00:02:55.730> parasites

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
they come now what can these parasites

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.720 
they come now what can these parasites
actually<00:02:56.450> do<00:02:56.630> well<00:02:57.440> they<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:57.800> cause<00:02:58.010> very

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
actually do well they can cause very

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.820 
actually do well they can cause very
severe<00:02:59.150> clinical<00:02:59.360> disease<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.140> kitties<00:03:00.470> that

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
severe clinical disease and kitties that

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.500 
severe clinical disease and kitties that
can<00:03:01.100> range<00:03:01.250> anywhere<00:03:01.490> from<00:03:01.760> clinical<00:03:02.330> signs

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
can range anywhere from clinical signs

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.670 
can range anywhere from clinical signs
such<00:03:02.840> as<00:03:02.870> vomiting<00:03:03.670> diarrhea<00:03:04.990> severe<00:03:05.990> anemia

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
such as vomiting diarrhea severe anemia

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.760 
such as vomiting diarrhea severe anemia
and<00:03:07.010> severe<00:03:07.970> infestations<00:03:08.780> cats<00:03:09.140> can<00:03:09.410> suffer

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
and severe infestations cats can suffer

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.770 
and severe infestations cats can suffer
intestinal<00:03:10.310> obstruction<00:03:10.940> or<00:03:11.060> even<00:03:11.300> death<00:03:11.480> Wow

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
intestinal obstruction or even death Wow

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.840 
intestinal obstruction or even death Wow
so<00:03:12.110> if<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.160> know<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> cat<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.730> we're

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
so if we have you know a cat and we're

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.520 
so if we have you know a cat and we're
really<00:03:13.970> concerned<00:03:14.270> about<00:03:14.660> making<00:03:15.080> sure<00:03:15.260> that

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
really concerned about making sure that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.680 
really concerned about making sure that
they<00:03:15.620> stay<00:03:15.680> healthy<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.520> there<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> solution<00:03:17.240> to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
they stay healthy is there a solution to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.940 
they stay healthy is there a solution to
this<00:03:17.780> problem<00:03:17.960> is<00:03:18.230> there<00:03:18.410> something<00:03:18.740> that<00:03:18.830> we

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
this problem is there something that we

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.820 
this problem is there something that we
can<00:03:19.130> do<00:03:19.280> certainly<00:03:20.110> profunda<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> topical
