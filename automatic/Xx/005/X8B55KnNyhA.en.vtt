00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
bases there'd be about three or four

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200 
bases there'd be about three or four
people<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> bombers<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.430> everyone<00:01:27.030> else

it's not my favorite map it's like I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.480 
it's not my favorite map it's like I
said<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.940> don't<00:02:17.240> really<00:02:17.330> enjoy<00:02:18.490> the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
said it's I don't really enjoy the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.700 
said it's I don't really enjoy the
really<00:02:19.760> slow-paced<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.630> Matt<00:02:21.050> brings<00:02:21.440> and

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
really slow-paced that Matt brings and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.230 
really slow-paced that Matt brings and
also<00:02:22.280> I'm<00:02:22.400> kind<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> more<00:02:22.850> partial<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
also I'm kind of more partial to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.410 
also I'm kind of more partial to
infantry<00:02:23.690> combat<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.880> that's<00:02:26.030> kind<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.240> my

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
infantry combat so that's kind of my

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.750 
infantry combat so that's kind of my
opinion<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.020> large<00:02:27.770> maps<00:02:28.070> in<00:02:28.310> battlefield<00:02:28.670> bad

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
opinion on large maps in battlefield bad

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.940 
opinion on large maps in battlefield bad
company<00:02:28.850> two<00:02:29.200> large<00:02:30.200> maps<00:02:30.410> in<00:02:30.560> battlefield

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
company two large maps in battlefield

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.100 
company two large maps in battlefield
two<00:02:31.940> we're<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> little<00:02:32.510> different<00:02:32.900> especially

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
two we're a little different especially

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.540 
two we're a little different especially
for<00:02:33.470> Wake<00:02:33.590> Island<00:02:33.770> but<00:02:34.010> I'll<00:02:34.070> get<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.370> later

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
for Wake Island but I'll get that later

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.580 
for Wake Island but I'll get that later
so<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.209> wouldn't<00:02:35.360> ask<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.810> question<00:02:36.140> what<00:02:36.380> kind

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
so I wouldn't ask the question what kind

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.110 
so I wouldn't ask the question what kind
of<00:02:36.709> map<00:02:36.890> size<00:02:37.130> are<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.400> really<00:02:37.580> interested<00:02:37.850> in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
of map size are you really interested in

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.760 
of map size are you really interested in
are<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.630> interested<00:02:39.080> in<00:02:39.170> more<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.470> call<00:02:39.650> of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
are you interested in more of a call of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.890 
are you interested in more of a call of
duty<00:02:39.980> small<00:02:40.280> map<00:02:40.550> or<00:02:40.940> it's<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:41.150> kind<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
duty small map or it's just kind of a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.250 
duty small map or it's just kind of a
set<00:02:42.170> small<00:02:42.800> location<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:44.660> my<00:02:44.810> opinion<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.230> don't

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
set small location in my opinion I don't

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.240 
set small location in my opinion I don't
think<00:02:45.410> they<00:02:45.590> should<00:02:45.620> go<00:02:45.800> down<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.070> route

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
think they should go down this route

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.680 
think they should go down this route
especially<00:02:46.730> since<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.030> PC<00:02:47.360> they're<00:02:47.510> going<00:02:47.630> to

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
especially since on PC they're going to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.850 
especially since on PC they're going to
have<00:02:47.780> 64<00:02:48.320> people<00:02:48.530> on<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.920> server<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:50.860> really

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
have 64 people on a server I really

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.780 
have 64 people on a server I really
don't<00:02:51.950> think<00:02:52.070> they<00:02:52.220> should<00:02:52.250> go<00:02:52.459> for<00:02:52.610> anything

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
don't think they should go for anything

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.120 
don't think they should go for anything
small<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:53.930> more<00:02:54.230> partial<00:02:54.440> for<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.860> medium

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
small I'm more partial for the medium

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.260 
small I'm more partial for the medium
type<00:02:55.340> maps<00:02:55.580> where<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.000> going<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> be

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
type maps where it's going to be

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.610 
type maps where it's going to be
something<00:02:56.480> more<00:02:56.690> like<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.900> rush<00:02:57.170> game<00:02:57.410> mode

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
something more like a rush game mode

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.800 
something more like a rush game mode
where<00:02:57.910> especially<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.030> Valparaiso<00:02:59.510> that's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
where especially like Valparaiso that's

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.780 
where especially like Valparaiso that's
a<00:02:59.930> good<00:03:00.050> example<00:03:00.140> where<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.860> know<00:03:01.040> it's<00:03:01.280> you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
a good example where you know it's you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.280 
a good example where you know it's you
have<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> lot<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.209> ways<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.660> maneuver<00:03:03.140> around

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
have a lot of ways to maneuver around

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.500 
have a lot of ways to maneuver around
and<00:03:03.860> get<00:03:04.160> two<00:03:04.250> different<00:03:04.340> objectives<00:03:04.940> but<00:03:05.209> I

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
and get two different objectives but I

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.110 
and get two different objectives but I
it's<00:03:06.350> you're<00:03:06.890> gonna<00:03:06.980> move<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.520> mat<00:03:07.700> gets<00:03:07.940> it

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
it's you're gonna move the mat gets it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.729 
it's you're gonna move the mat gets it

you know extends larger and larger as

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.810 
you know extends larger and larger as
you<00:03:09.890> progress<00:03:11.560> or<00:03:12.560> are<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.100> more<00:03:13.250> partial<00:03:13.459> for

expecting<00:03:28.400> from<00:03:28.489> battlefield<00:03:28.940> 3<00:03:29.209> as<00:03:30.140> i

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
expecting from battlefield 3 as i

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.440 
expecting from battlefield 3 as i
mentioned<00:03:30.739> before<00:03:30.799> wake<00:03:31.549> island<00:03:31.760> i<00:03:32.120> think<00:03:32.360> it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
mentioned before wake island i think it

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.270 
mentioned before wake island i think it
was<00:03:32.540> different<00:03:32.780> from<00:03:33.230> any<00:03:33.500> other<00:03:33.590> map<00:03:33.950> just

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
was different from any other map just

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.770 
was different from any other map just
for<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.459> fact<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.970> was<00:03:35.060> very<00:03:35.330> large<00:03:35.600> and

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
for the fact that it was very large and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.420 
for the fact that it was very large and
you<00:03:35.989> could<00:03:36.110> have<00:03:36.320> aircrafts<00:03:36.980> flying<00:03:37.190> around

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
you could have aircrafts flying around

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.259 
you could have aircrafts flying around
there<00:03:37.940> were<00:03:38.090> tanks<00:03:38.360> but<00:03:39.200> infantry<00:03:39.650> also<00:03:39.950> had<00:03:40.100> a

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
there were tanks but infantry also had a

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.990 
there were tanks but infantry also had a
very<00:03:41.269> large<00:03:41.510> role<00:03:41.750> in<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:41.959> map<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:43.250> the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
very large role in that map because the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.300 
very large role in that map because the
way<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.269> was<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:45.170> was<00:03:45.290> laid<00:03:45.530> out<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.950> was<00:03:46.070> very

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
way it was it was laid out it was very

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.650 
way it was it was laid out it was very
narrow<00:03:46.850> there<00:03:47.120> were<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.209> lot<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.390> chokepoints

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
narrow there were a lot of chokepoints

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.660 
narrow there were a lot of chokepoints
and<00:03:48.170> it<00:03:48.620> just<00:03:48.769> made<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.190> if<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:49.579> were

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
and it just made it so that if you were

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.340 
and it just made it so that if you were
an<00:03:49.760> infantry<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.329> could<00:03:50.510> find<00:03:50.750> action<00:03:51.170> and

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
an infantry you could find action and

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.840 
an infantry you could find action and
you<00:03:51.380> could<00:03:51.560> have<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.709> lot<00:03:51.890> of<00:03:51.920> GIMP<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.340> lot<00:03:52.730> of

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
you could have a lot of GIMP a lot of

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.420 
you could have a lot of GIMP a lot of
gunfights<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.890> overall<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:54.980> was<00:03:55.070> just<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.280> very

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
gunfights and overall it was just a very

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.569 
gunfights and overall it was just a very
fun<00:03:55.640> map<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.870> kind<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.260> was<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.739> battlefield<00:03:58.250> 3

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
fun map it kind of was the battlefield 3

when<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.660> was<00:04:08.810> younger<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:10.190> speaking<00:04:10.549> of<00:04:10.730> the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
when I was younger so speaking of the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.460 
when I was younger so speaking of the
actual<00:04:11.180> gameplay<00:04:11.450> right<00:04:11.810> now<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:11.959> think<00:04:12.200> my

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
actual gameplay right now I think my

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.560 
actual gameplay right now I think my
actually<00:04:13.280> my<00:04:13.430> team<00:04:13.610> goes<00:04:13.790> on<00:04:13.970> to<00:04:14.150> lose<00:04:14.299> this

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
actually my team goes on to lose this

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.710 
actually my team goes on to lose this
match<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:15.320> was<00:04:15.440> kind<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.950> depressing<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.880> wasn't

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
match it was kind of depressing I wasn't

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.449 
match it was kind of depressing I wasn't
doing<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.019> whole<00:04:18.169> lot<00:04:18.350> I<00:04:18.530> actually<00:04:18.739> i<00:04:18.890> was<00:04:19.070> i<00:04:19.280> was

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
doing a whole lot I actually i was i was

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.949 
doing a whole lot I actually i was i was
doing<00:04:19.669> my<00:04:19.700> best<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.120> stay<00:04:20.209> on<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.540> front<00:04:20.780> lines

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
doing my best to stay on the front lines

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.529 
doing my best to stay on the front lines
and<00:04:21.200> push<00:04:21.530> up<00:04:21.709> with<00:04:21.890> my<00:04:22.070> team<00:04:22.310> but<00:04:22.940> i<00:04:23.180> had<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.360> lot

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
and push up with my team but i had a lot

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.779 
and push up with my team but i had a lot
of<00:04:23.570> passive<00:04:24.080> players<00:04:24.349> and<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:25.250> really<00:04:25.610> probably

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
of passive players and I really probably

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:26.950 
of passive players and I really probably
shouldn't<00:04:26.210> have<00:04:26.240> been<00:04:26.419> pushing<00:04:26.690> up<00:04:26.780> on<00:04:26.840> the

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
shouldn't have been pushing up on the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.379 
shouldn't have been pushing up on the
right<00:04:27.110> side

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
right side

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.610 
right side
especially<00:04:27.780> since<00:04:27.900> we<00:04:28.080> already<00:04:28.199> had<00:04:28.379> that<00:04:28.409> M

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
especially since we already had that M

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.219 
especially since we already had that M
comm<00:04:28.800> station<00:04:29.039> but<00:04:29.759> I<00:04:30.060> feel<00:04:30.479> like<00:04:30.509> if<00:04:30.840> my<00:04:31.020> team

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
comm station but I feel like if my team

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.770 
comm station but I feel like if my team
was<00:04:31.379> actually<00:04:31.800> trying<00:04:32.219> they<00:04:32.969> may<00:04:33.509> have<00:04:33.689> been

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
was actually trying they may have been

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.209 
was actually trying they may have been
able<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.990> actually<00:04:34.139> do<00:04:34.409> it<00:04:34.439> but<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.099> most

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
able to actually do it but for the most

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.679 
able to actually do it but for the most
part<00:04:35.340> people<00:04:35.580> were<00:04:35.789> kind<00:04:35.999> of<00:04:36.060> stain<00:04:36.389> and

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
part people were kind of stain and

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.269 
part people were kind of stain and
sitting<00:04:36.990> back<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.349> just<00:04:37.409> letting<00:04:38.129> the

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:38.279 
sitting back and just letting the

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.029 
sitting back and just letting the
enemies<00:04:38.669> just<00:04:38.909> kind<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.620> spot<00:04:40.620> but

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
enemies just kind of a spot but

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.059 
enemies just kind of a spot but
valparaiso<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.699> very<00:04:41.909> difficult<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.539> actually

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
valparaiso is very difficult to actually

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.320 
valparaiso is very difficult to actually
take<00:04:44.069> this<00:04:44.219> first<00:04:44.430> base<00:04:44.669> just<00:04:44.999> for<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.210> fact

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
take this first base just for the fact

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.769 
take this first base just for the fact
that<00:04:45.479> there<00:04:45.719> are<00:04:45.749> so<00:04:46.050> many<00:04:46.139> players<00:04:46.409> on<00:04:46.740> PC<00:04:47.550> and

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:47.779 
that there are so many players on PC and

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.119 
that there are so many players on PC and
they're<00:04:48.779> constantly<00:04:49.199> spawning<00:04:49.529> right<00:04:49.800> behind

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
they're constantly spawning right behind

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.800 
they're constantly spawning right behind
the<00:04:50.370> am<00:04:50.460> comm<00:04:50.639> station<00:04:50.849> so<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.330> actually<00:04:51.629> be

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
the am comm station so I can actually be

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.170 
the am comm station so I can actually be
kind<00:04:52.020> of<00:04:52.080> difficult<00:04:52.639> but<00:04:53.639> this<00:04:53.759> is<00:04:53.849> about<00:04:53.969> reps

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
kind of difficult but this is about reps

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.279
