00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
I don't think we are silent running when

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.810 
I don't think we are silent running when
we're<00:00:23.849> on<00:00:23.880> top<00:00:24.210> side<00:00:25.039> just<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.789> if

we're on top side just going to see if

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.960 
we're on top side just going to see if
that<00:00:27.000> does<00:00:27.180> anything<00:00:27.210> yes<00:00:28.279> rape<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.550> silent

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that does anything yes rape for silent

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.920 
that does anything yes rape for silent
running

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.570 

I<00:00:33.050> don't<00:00:33.650> want<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.860> rig<00:00:33.980> for<00:00:34.220> silent<00:00:34.340> running

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
I don't want to rig for silent running

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.060 
I don't want to rig for silent running
oh<00:00:36.310> well<00:00:37.390> well<00:00:38.390> there<00:00:38.690> is<00:00:38.840> that<00:00:38.870> thing<00:00:39.560> about

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
oh well well there is that thing about

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.640 
oh well well there is that thing about
the<00:00:40.400> American<00:00:41.090> submarines<00:00:41.660> that<00:00:41.840> some<00:00:42.500> at

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
the American submarines that some at

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.900 
the American submarines that some at
least<00:00:42.970> that's<00:00:43.970> really<00:00:44.210> nice<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:44.690> guess

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
least that's really nice I guess

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.520 
least that's really nice I guess
basically<00:00:46.910> only<00:00:47.090> had<00:00:47.420> silent<00:00:48.080> running<00:00:48.290> there

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
basically only had silent running there

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.470 
basically only had silent running there
was<00:00:48.650> no<00:00:48.800> difference<00:00:49.190> because<00:00:49.309> what<00:00:50.030> they<00:00:50.180> did

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
was no difference because what they did

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.970 
was no difference because what they did
single<00:00:51.230> contact<00:00:51.650> what<00:00:52.100> bearing<00:00:53.320> 286<00:00:54.320> long

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
single contact what bearing 286 long

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.060 
single contact what bearing 286 long

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
that's that plane again I do not want

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.050 
that's that plane again I do not want
that<00:01:24.979> plane<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.670> notice<00:01:26.030> me<00:01:27.820> thank<00:01:28.820> you<00:01:29.030> very

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
that plane to notice me thank you very

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.580 
that plane to notice me thank you very
much<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:30.490> plane<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.670> looking<00:01:32.000> for<00:01:32.240> us

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
much a plane is looking for us

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.030 
much a plane is looking for us
ok

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.010 

hopefully<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.340> won't<00:01:41.549> notice<00:01:41.880> us<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.930> I'm

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
hopefully it won't notice us I think I'm

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870 
hopefully it won't notice us I think I'm
just<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> go<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.830> my<00:01:43.979> next<00:01:44.159> Waypoint<00:01:44.700> on

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
just going to go for my next Waypoint on

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.190 
just going to go for my next Waypoint on
the<00:01:45.060> water<00:01:46.820> very<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:50.330> I<00:01:51.330> had<00:01:51.689> standard

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the water very good I had standard

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:03.420 
the water very good I had standard
actual<00:01:54.440> thank<00:01:55.440> you<00:01:56.570> okay<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.630> apparently

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.030 

I<00:02:03.580> can<00:02:04.090> turn<00:02:04.240> sign<00:02:05.110> up<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.320> running<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:05.710> or<00:02:05.920> off

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
I can turn sign up and running on or off

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
I can turn sign up and running on or off
think<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.610> will<00:02:07.350> resign<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.560> running<00:02:08.970> there<00:02:09.970> we

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
think I will resign it running there we

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.900 
think I will resign it running there we
go<00:02:10.210> we're<00:02:10.479> running<00:02:10.630> silently<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
go we're running silently not that it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.390 
go we're running silently not that it
would<00:02:13.030> matter<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> does<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.160> some

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
would matter but if it does have some

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.820 
would matter but if it does have some
sort<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.959> listening<00:02:19.959> equipment<00:02:20.200> which<00:02:20.680> I

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
sort of listening equipment which I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.270 
sort of listening equipment which I
doubt<00:02:21.130> you'd<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.240> in<00:02:22.390> trouble<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:24.070> we<00:02:24.190> don't

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
doubt you'd be in trouble and we don't

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.110 
doubt you'd be in trouble and we don't
want<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:28.860> we're<00:02:29.860> going<00:02:30.100> very<00:02:30.340> slow<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:30.880> we<00:02:31.000> do

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
want that we're going very slow if we do

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.070 
want that we're going very slow if we do
this

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.250 

and<00:02:39.950> I'm<00:02:40.040> seriously<00:02:40.460> wondering

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.390 

is<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:47.129> plane<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.819> real<00:02:48.390> threat

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.309 

then<00:02:54.000> again<00:02:54.120> if<00:02:54.360> you're<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.659> a<00:02:54.750> plane<00:02:54.989> in

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
then again if you're in a plane in

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.640 
then again if you're in a plane in
1940's<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.370> probably<00:02:56.909> not<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.409> that<00:02:58.409> kind

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
1940's you probably not have that kind

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.119 
1940's you probably not have that kind
of<00:02:58.709> equipment<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.459> there<00:03:00.120> might<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:02.060> want<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
of equipment so there might I want to

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.869 
of equipment so there might I want to
get<00:03:05.129> going<00:03:05.610> quickly<00:03:07.370> I'm<00:03:08.370> sure<00:03:08.579> we're<00:03:08.730> going

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
get going quickly I'm sure we're going

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.880 
get going quickly I'm sure we're going
to<00:03:08.939> leave<00:03:09.090> bubble<00:03:09.480> trail<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:09.989> well<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.470> don't

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
to leave bubble trail but well I don't

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.289 
to leave bubble trail but well I don't
care<00:03:12.739> all<00:03:13.739> right<00:03:13.859> that<00:03:14.069> plane<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.790> was

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
care all right that plane is just was

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.259 
care all right that plane is just was
just<00:03:15.569> way<00:03:15.750> too<00:03:15.810> close<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:16.500> going<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:17.060> move<00:03:18.060> up

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
just way too close I'm going to move up

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.030 
just way too close I'm going to move up
a<00:03:18.390> little<00:03:18.480> bit<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:19.079> we<00:03:19.200> are<00:03:20.030> speed<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:22.040> time

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
a little bit there we are speed up time

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.949 
a little bit there we are speed up time
compression<00:03:23.430> until<00:03:24.359> we<00:03:24.450> have<00:03:24.569> our<00:03:24.599> next

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
compression until we have our next

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.009 
compression until we have our next
waypoints<00:03:25.819> which<00:03:26.819> would<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.239> in<00:03:27.480> game<00:03:27.750> time

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
waypoints which would be in game time

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.160 
waypoints which would be in game time
would<00:03:28.349> be<00:03:28.379> an<00:03:28.650> hour<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.670> 50<00:03:30.060> minutes<00:03:30.090> ok<00:03:31.019> and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
would be an hour and 50 minutes ok and
