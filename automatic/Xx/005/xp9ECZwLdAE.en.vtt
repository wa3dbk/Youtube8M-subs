him we try different things we try

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.580 
him we try different things we try
different<00:02:13.209> tools<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.989> then<00:02:14.200> when<00:02:14.319> we<00:02:14.410> just

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
different tools and then when we just

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.650 
different tools and then when we just
like<00:02:14.980> couger<00:02:15.370> direct<00:02:15.730> what<00:02:16.060> works<00:02:16.300> best<00:02:16.569> for

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
like couger direct what works best for

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.490 
like couger direct what works best for
him<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.230> what<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.549> best<00:02:18.730> fit<00:02:18.940> for<00:02:18.970> him
