00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
manizer and also the NARS albatross I

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
manizer and also the NARS albatross I
tried<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.570> albatross<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.739> nice<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
tried the albatross it was nice but I

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
tried the albatross it was nice but I
couldn't<00:01:02.820> justify<00:01:03.149> spending<00:01:03.840> thirty<00:01:04.769> dollars

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
couldn't justify spending thirty dollars

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.539 
couldn't justify spending thirty dollars
on<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.650> well<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.770> first<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.100> bought<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> but

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
on it so well at first I bought it but

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.039 
on it so well at first I bought it but
then<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.820> brought<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> back<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> returned<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
then I brought it back and I returned it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.660 
then I brought it back and I returned it
and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.280> ten

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and then I got this because it was ten

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.120 
and then I got this because it was ten
dollars<00:01:12.000> cheaper<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.409> looked<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> there

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
dollars cheaper and it looked like there

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.990 
dollars cheaper and it looked like there
was<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.610> which<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.360> probably<00:01:15.770> wasn't<00:01:17.000> but

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
was more which there probably wasn't but

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.399 
was more which there probably wasn't but
it's<00:01:18.210> bigger<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:19.189> it's<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.490> twenty<00:01:20.820> dollars

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
it's bigger in it's only twenty dollars

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.010 
it's bigger in it's only twenty dollars
so<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:23.340> what<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> looks<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.869> what

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
so just what it looks like this is what

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.630 
so just what it looks like this is what
I<00:01:25.049> comes<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:27.030> am<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.840> demonstrate
