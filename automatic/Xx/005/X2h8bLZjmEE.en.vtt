brush<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.250> find<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.910> little<00:01:34.510> bit<00:01:34.630> easier

brush I find it is a little bit easier

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.440 
brush I find it is a little bit easier
for<00:01:35.260> me<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.410> control<00:01:35.950> because<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.760> is<00:01:36.790> longer

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
for me to control because it is longer

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.720 
for me to control because it is longer
and<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:38.050> takes<00:01:38.260> less<00:01:38.590> swipes<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.490> get<00:01:39.640> it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
and it takes less swipes to get it

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.830 
and it takes less swipes to get it
across<00:01:39.970> your<00:01:40.270> entire<00:01:40.360> eye<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:42.510> one<00:01:43.510> and<00:01:43.750> two

across your entire eye like one and two
like<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.530> you're<00:01:44.680> done<00:01:44.950> like<00:01:45.430> two<00:01:45.610> swipes<00:01:45.940> and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
like and you're done like two swipes and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.720 
like and you're done like two swipes and
you're<00:01:46.360> done<00:01:46.540> with<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.900> brush<00:01:47.730> the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
you're done with this brush the

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.280 
you're done with this brush the
maybelline<00:01:49.330> one<00:01:49.630> brush<00:01:50.230> looks<00:01:50.590> like<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.520> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
maybelline one brush looks like this and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.490 
maybelline one brush looks like this and
it<00:01:53.640> has<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> shorter<00:01:55.210> handle<00:01:55.480> and<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.020> brush<00:01:56.260> is

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
it has a shorter handle and the brush is

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.790 
it has a shorter handle and the brush is
so<00:01:56.530> tiny<00:01:57.870> which<00:01:58.870> some<00:01:59.140> people<00:01:59.260> probably<00:01:59.590> like

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
so tiny which some people probably like

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.870 
so tiny which some people probably like
because<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:00.550> may<00:02:00.760> have<00:02:00.790> more<00:02:01.180> control<00:02:01.690> it'll

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
because you may have more control it'll

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.380 
because you may have more control it'll
make<00:02:03.880> maybe<00:02:04.410> sometimes<00:02:05.410> for<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.620> more<00:02:05.830> precise

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
make maybe sometimes for a more precise

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.160 
make maybe sometimes for a more precise
winged<00:02:07.390> eyeliner<00:02:07.600> but<00:02:08.140> for<00:02:08.979> me<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.660> much<00:02:10.929> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
winged eyeliner but for me not so much I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.020 
winged eyeliner but for me not so much I
guess<00:02:11.320> I'm<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:11.860> used<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.280> using

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
guess I'm just so used to using

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.020 
guess I'm just so used to using
colors<00:02:13.360> really<00:02:13.690> long<00:02:13.990> brush<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.340> find<00:02:15.790> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
colors really long brush that I find it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.790 
colors really long brush that I find it
comes<00:02:16.330> out<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> little<00:02:16.720> messy<00:02:17.319> with<00:02:17.350> the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
comes out a little messy with the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800 
comes out a little messy with the
Maybelline<00:02:18.310> one<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:18.880> that's<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.240> personal

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
Maybelline one but that's just personal

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.960 
Maybelline one but that's just personal
preference<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.590> would<00:02:21.340> say<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.760> if<00:02:21.880> you're

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
preference I would say that if you're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.880 
preference I would say that if you're
starting<00:02:22.270> out<00:02:22.450> using<00:02:22.959> liquid<00:02:23.290> eyeliner<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
starting out using liquid eyeliner the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.350 
starting out using liquid eyeliner the
maybelline<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.610> would<00:02:24.790> probably<00:02:25.150> really

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
maybelline one would probably really

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.000 
maybelline one would probably really
good<00:02:25.480> choice<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:27.300> lighter<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:29.010> not

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
good choice because it's lighter and not

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.270 
good choice because it's lighter and not
to<00:02:30.160> mention<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.989> would<00:02:32.319> have<00:02:33.040> more

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
to mention that you would have more

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.280 
to mention that you would have more
control<00:02:33.640> because<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.420> brush<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.959> stuff<00:02:35.140> is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
control because the brush and stuff is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.949 
control because the brush and stuff is
smaller<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:37.209> would<00:02:37.360> probably<00:02:37.510> want<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
smaller and you would probably want to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.320 
smaller and you would probably want to
do<00:02:38.170> small<00:02:38.410> strokes<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.489> get<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.790> across<00:02:40.000> your

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
do small strokes to get it across your

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330 
do small strokes to get it across your
line<00:02:40.510> instead<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:40.959> one<00:02:41.230> solid<00:02:41.739> swipe<00:02:42.010> if

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
line instead of one solid swipe if

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.520 
line instead of one solid swipe if
you're<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.940> used<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.330> using<00:02:43.569> liquid<00:02:44.110> eyeliner

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
you're not used to using liquid eyeliner

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.259 
you're not used to using liquid eyeliner
and<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:48.070> all<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.459> all<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.640> would<00:02:48.850> say<00:02:49.030> that

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
and but all in all I would say that

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.900 
and but all in all I would say that
they're<00:02:49.989> both<00:02:50.410> really<00:02:50.890> worth<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.370> money<00:02:51.610> but

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
they're both really worth the money but

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.790 
they're both really worth the money but
the<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:53.019> would<00:02:54.060> repurchase<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.780> le<00:02:55.989> colors<00:02:56.440> one
