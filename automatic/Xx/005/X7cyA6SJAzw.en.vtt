note<00:02:42.019> all<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.380> these<00:02:42.530> linkages<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> top

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
note all of these linkages on the top

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.070 
note all of these linkages on the top
and<00:02:43.790> they<00:02:43.880> serve<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> couple<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.630> functions

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
and they serve a couple of functions

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.240 
and they serve a couple of functions
that<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:46.040> notice<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:47.330> piston<00:02:47.980> only<00:02:48.980> moves

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that you notice the piston only moves

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.460 
that you notice the piston only moves
this<00:02:49.940> depth<00:02:50.860> which<00:02:51.860> is<00:02:51.890> about<00:02:52.489> an<00:02:52.700> inch<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.140> in

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
this depth which is about an inch so in

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.819 
this depth which is about an inch so in
order<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.680> have<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.730> lever<00:02:56.060> that's<00:02:56.360> long<00:02:56.630> enough

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
order to have a lever that's long enough

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.220 
order to have a lever that's long enough
to<00:02:57.829> establish<00:02:58.220> such<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.000> short<00:02:59.450> movement<00:03:00.049> of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
to establish such a short movement of

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.650 
to establish such a short movement of
the<00:03:00.440> piston<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:02.030> that's<00:03:02.209> part<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.569> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the piston is that that's part of the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.020 
the piston is that that's part of the
function<00:03:03.079> of<00:03:03.170> all<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:03.500> these<00:03:03.700> linkages<00:03:04.700> up<00:03:04.880> on

function of all of these linkages up on
the<00:03:05.150> top<00:03:05.360> when<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.290> pull<00:03:06.470> this<00:03:06.560> down<00:03:07.989> note<00:03:08.989> how

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
the top when you pull this down note how

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.630 
the top when you pull this down note how
it<00:03:09.319> works<00:03:09.549> this<00:03:10.840> Center<00:03:11.840> piston<00:03:12.709> rod<00:03:12.890> goes

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
it works this Center piston rod goes

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.030 
it works this Center piston rod goes
straight<00:03:14.209> up<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.540> down<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:15.500> doesn't<00:03:15.829> wobble

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
straight up and down it doesn't wobble

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.069 
straight up and down it doesn't wobble
from<00:03:16.370> side<00:03:16.609> to<00:03:16.640> side<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.269> there's<00:03:17.450> nowhere<00:03:17.630> in

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
from side to side so there's nowhere in

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.710 
from side to side so there's nowhere in
that<00:03:18.109> issue<00:03:18.530> as<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.579> goes<00:03:19.760> down<00:03:19.970> further<00:03:20.269> you

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
that issue as it goes down further you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.780 
that issue as it goes down further you
can<00:03:20.840> see<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.440> now<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:21.920> reached<00:03:22.190> its<00:03:22.430> top

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
can see that now it's reached its top

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.840 
can see that now it's reached its top
it's<00:03:23.690> not<00:03:23.870> going<00:03:24.079> any<00:03:24.200> higher<00:03:24.579> but<00:03:25.579> it<00:03:25.700> has

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
it's not going any higher but it has

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.270 
it's not going any higher but it has
only<00:03:26.180> moved<00:03:26.450> an<00:03:26.810> inch<00:03:28.630> okay<00:03:29.630> now<00:03:30.620> what's<00:03:31.130> going

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
only moved an inch okay now what's going

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.270 
only moved an inch okay now what's going
to<00:03:31.310> happen<00:03:31.639> is<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:31.940> going<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.269> walk<00:03:32.450> off

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
to happen is this is going to walk off

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.080 
to happen is this is going to walk off
as<00:03:34.280> we<00:03:34.459> go<00:03:34.609> up

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.080 

go<00:03:38.090> ahead<00:03:38.269> and<00:03:38.390> pull<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:38.629> out<00:03:39.459> say<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.909> is

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
go ahead and pull this out say this is

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.559 
go ahead and pull this out say this is
the<00:03:41.209> part<00:03:41.480> here<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.819> fits<00:03:43.819> in<00:03:45.280> there<00:03:46.299> so<00:03:47.299> when

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
the part here that fits in there so when

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.199 
the part here that fits in there so when
you're<00:03:47.689> making<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:48.079> shot<00:03:48.319> this<00:03:48.829> is<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.819> only

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
you're making a shot this is the only

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.209 
you're making a shot this is the only
volume<00:03:50.450> that's<00:03:50.810> down<00:03:51.019> here<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.469> it's<00:03:52.010> all

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
volume that's down here and it's all

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.809 
volume that's down here and it's all
encased<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:52.939> a<00:03:53.030> massive<00:03:53.540> piece<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.989> brass<00:03:54.260> and

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
encased in a massive piece of brass and

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.030 
encased in a massive piece of brass and
this<00:03:55.819> is<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.030> solid<00:03:56.480> piece<00:03:56.659> down<00:03:56.959> here<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.889> it's

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
this is a solid piece down here so it's

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.220 
this is a solid piece down here so it's
got<00:03:58.189> very<00:03:58.430> good<00:03:58.489> heat<00:03:58.760> retention<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.959> is

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
got very good heat retention this is

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
got very good heat retention this is
here<00:04:00.670> serves<00:04:01.670> simply<00:04:02.239> as<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:03.290> guide<00:04:03.650> piece<00:04:03.950> in

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
here serves simply as a guide piece in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.440 
here serves simply as a guide piece in
assembly<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.480> then<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.620> cylinder<00:04:07.450> itself

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
assembly and then the cylinder itself

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.210 
assembly and then the cylinder itself
this<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.019> where<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.409> seals<00:04:09.650> right

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
this is where the seals right
