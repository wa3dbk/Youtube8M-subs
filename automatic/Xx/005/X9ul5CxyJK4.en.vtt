 for emerald to have stayed for 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.540
 almost three years in a prison still being 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.100
 innocent who changed life also the 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.080

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.660
 human beings who made a mistake 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.070

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.110
 torture centers which have 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.300

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.750
 access to have a doctor torture me 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.739

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.739
 moving away in my family 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.039
 Colombian prisons have a 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.800
 capacity for 75,000 inmates without 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.730
 But at the moment there are 115 thousand 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.399
 overcrowding that has generated 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.940
 innumerable murders and suicides of 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.940
 inmates 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:25.690

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.399

 by the state to maintain the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.780
 Inmate staff has generated us a 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.190
 serious problem 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.060
