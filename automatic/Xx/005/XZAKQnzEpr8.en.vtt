anything like that the hints and hunches

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.380 
anything like that the hints and hunches
that<00:00:35.250> will<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.460> talking<00:00:35.820> about<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.210> today

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that will be talking about here today

may in fact be enough for you guys to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
may in fact be enough for you guys to
test<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.390> yourself<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.079> hopefully

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

as the title may have backed suggests

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.410 
as the title may have backed suggests
here<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.129> advanced<00:00:59.550> warfare<00:01:00.059> that's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
here in advanced warfare that's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
here in advanced warfare that's
something<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> nobody<00:01:01.590> knows<00:01:01.770> how<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:01.980> do

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
something that nobody knows how to do

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.640 
something that nobody knows how to do
really<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.180> algorithm<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.930> how<00:01:04.080> drops

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
really and the algorithm for how drops

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.380 
really and the algorithm for how drops
and<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.430> stuff<00:01:05.489> work<00:01:05.939> have

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and all that kind of stuff work have

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
and all that kind of stuff work have
never<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.900> been<00:01:07.020> understood<00:01:07.830> same<00:01:08.159> with

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
never really been understood same with

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
never really been understood same with
any<00:01:08.490> game<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.240> random<00:01:09.750> drops<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.320> this

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
any game with random drops like this

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.460 
any game with random drops like this
like<00:01:10.860> fifa<00:01:11.240> counter-strike<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> games<00:01:12.930> alike

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
like fifa counter-strike and games alike

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.870 
like fifa counter-strike and games alike
that<00:01:13.920> stuff<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.340> never<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.760> been

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that stuff has never really been

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
that stuff has never really been
understood<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:15.869> completely<00:01:16.350> random<00:01:16.979> or

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
understood it's all completely random or

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.130 
understood it's all completely random or
so<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.939> may<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> recent

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so we may think with the recent

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.050 
so we may think with the recent
additions<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> advance<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> plot<00:01:20.580> drops<00:01:20.939> in

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
additions to advance the plot drops in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
additions to advance the plot drops in
advanced<00:01:21.450> warfare<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> people<00:01:22.380> are

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
advanced warfare a lot of people are

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
advanced warfare a lot of people are
just<00:01:23.220> jumping<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> bandwagon<00:01:24.299> and

dropping eight son of money now

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
dropping eight son of money now
obviously<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.450> isn't<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.810> problem<00:01:28.080> or

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739

the algorithm for which what is dropped

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.159

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
nothing is confirmed but hey it's worth

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.920 
nothing is confirmed but hey it's worth
a<00:04:28.310> shot<00:04:28.340> if<00:04:28.699> you<00:04:28.850> have<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.030> time<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.449> grind<00:04:29.690> out

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
a shot if you have the time to grind out
