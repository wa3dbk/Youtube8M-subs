00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
because obviously that would be bad with

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.690 
because obviously that would be bad with

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
all the lava flowing around here so why

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340 
all the lava flowing around here so why
did<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.030> pick<00:01:24.060> beam<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.080> wall

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
did I pick beam because of that wall

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
did I pick beam because of that wall
over<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.920> need<00:01:26.070> an<00:01:26.159> attack<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.460> goes

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
over there you need an attack that goes

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.660 
over there you need an attack that goes
overhead<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.930> still<00:01:28.650> activates<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> air

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
overhead and still activates in the air

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.450 
overhead and still activates in the air
I<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> fighter<00:01:31.290> or<00:01:31.530> uppercut<00:01:32.070> could

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I think the fighter or uppercut could

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
I think the fighter or uppercut could
work<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.150> i<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.210> about<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.689> again<00:01:33.840> but
