have been caught and we get to the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.789 
have been caught and we get to the
interesting<00:01:41.250> part<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.200> set<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.560> what

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
interesting part this is set up for what

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
interesting part this is set up for what
they<00:01:43.829> call<00:01:44.070> flat<00:01:44.340> track<00:01:44.640> racing<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> all

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
they call flat track racing to you all

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.920 
they call flat track racing to you all
you<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.140> motocross<00:01:46.649> fans<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.930> it's

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you big motocross fans it's a it's

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
you big motocross fans it's a it's
basically<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> reason<00:01:49.979> why<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
basically that's the reason why it's so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.770 
basically that's the reason why it's so
low<00:01:52.250> what<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.520> instead<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.210> having<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
low what they do is instead of having a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.350 
low what they do is instead of having a
power<00:01:55.020> port<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.399> got<00:01:56.670> what<00:01:57.149> they

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
power port in there it's got what they

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870 
power port in there it's got what they
call<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.590> they<00:01:58.710> call<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.579> block

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
call like do what they call they block

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.840 
call like do what they call they block
off<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> ports<00:02:00.540> basically<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.610> base

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
off the ports basically and that base

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.990 
off the ports basically and that base
gives<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.600> low<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.560> mid-range<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.460> not

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
gives you more low and mid-range and not

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.600 
gives you more low and mid-range and not
so<00:02:06.210> much<00:02:06.240> top-end<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.200> eight<00:02:07.610> carries

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
so much top-end it just eight carries

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.270 
so much top-end it just eight carries
the<00:02:08.759> cycle<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.300> longer<00:02:09.810> makes<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.470> Rev<00:02:10.649> longer

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the cycle out longer makes it Rev longer

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.470 
the cycle out longer makes it Rev longer
basically

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
basically

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.619 
basically
James<00:02:13.080> them<00:02:13.290> down<00:02:13.500> whatever<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:15.209> that's<00:02:15.360> why

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
James them down whatever and that's why

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.899 
James them down whatever and that's why
I<00:02:15.659> got<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.440> diamond<00:02:17.069> plate<00:02:17.280> cover<00:02:17.700> on

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
I got this little diamond plate cover on

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.990 
I got this little diamond plate cover on
it<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.510> somebody<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:18.989> made<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.819> that's<00:02:20.819> not

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it and somebody just made it that's not

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.410 
it and somebody just made it that's not
that<00:02:21.120> bad<00:02:21.330> looks<00:02:21.540> pretty<00:02:21.750> cool<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.110> guess<00:02:23.420> so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
that bad looks pretty cool I guess so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.059 
that bad looks pretty cool I guess so
listening<00:02:24.959> does<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> power<00:02:25.769> but

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
listening does not have a power but
