version<00:06:03.970> of<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.330> click<00:06:04.540> because<00:06:05.170> how<00:06:05.350> I'm

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
version of the click because how I'm

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.840 
version of the click because how I'm
seeing<00:06:05.680> it<00:06:05.770> right<00:06:05.800> now<00:06:06.070> like<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.610> difference

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
seeing it right now like the difference

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.790 
seeing it right now like the difference
between<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.510> two<00:06:07.750> is<00:06:07.780> really<00:06:08.380> the<00:06:08.500> unique

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
between the two is really the unique

between the two is really the unique
form<00:06:09.220> factor<00:06:09.640> hmm<00:06:10.060> so<00:06:10.870> what<00:06:11.020> you<00:06:11.110> have<00:06:11.140> again

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
form factor hmm so what you have again

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.380 
form factor hmm so what you have again
is<00:06:11.950> on<00:06:12.130> this<00:06:12.310> device<00:06:12.580> you've<00:06:13.030> got<00:06:13.270> that

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.930 
is on this device you've got that
reverse<00:06:13.810> flip<00:06:14.200> you've<00:06:14.830> got<00:06:15.070> the<00:06:15.280> touch<00:06:15.520> pad<00:06:15.790> on

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
reverse flip you've got the touch pad on

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.600 
reverse flip you've got the touch pad on
the<00:06:16.030> back<00:06:16.180> for<00:06:16.990> navigation<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:17.860> you<00:06:18.280> have<00:06:18.460> the
