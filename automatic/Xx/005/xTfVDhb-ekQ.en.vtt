 to sing it very many 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.210
 how 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.789
 go to the guardian ofac what we come 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.070
 to play exactly and do a little 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.129
 part of the parties but even Beatrice 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.430
 score some critics on the mode 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.010
 play 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.900
 and among the pros but have played the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.400
 card by magar to put hands 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.030
 above 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.890

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.890
 the grenade

 he took too much it's good here and the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:01.170
 left bobo left have really nothing 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.540
 it's nothing they wanted us brushing 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.740
 bakchich it's very dirty we're going to 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.810
 explain a little bit about the game mode 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.910
 you do it's huge match with two 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.980
 teams there we were two products in good 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.330
 there were points to capture 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.990
 points to capture but it's mostly the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.030
 move in it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.640
 here are the garages and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.470
 armories plus his forearm capture 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.130
 instead of blogs trees that's for 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.440
 cars 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.710
 here we have been able to test a lot of not bad 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.050
 of inconvenience that a banshee 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.640
 Attempt at the stars tfh to didon and 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.690
 of course we will turn in more and the boom 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.600
 millions of boots yeah a moment 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.100
 so we were denounce although 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.000
 spawn just our mouths and we had 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.220
 entrusted in two seconds 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.760
 moral tale never end up in 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.730
 the squad attachment even makes some 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.170
 good balloons and the first luggage there 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.340
 was fine with her would like the game 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.600
 went well for me we can 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.160
 say and the good parts of orient 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.850
 putallaz it must be someone who 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.800
 encompasses the release of squeeze the cyprian 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.660
 but we expect the gold and demonstrated 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.040
 a fairly huge cohesion waiting n going 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.570
 that hump dent in the enemy base 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.760
 locates the lembeye lease subscribers 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.330
 some teams could get that 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.220
 has been seeking the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.750
 we just arrived here the greens have 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.660
 given both vehicles 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.030
 we found you know that's exactly 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.500
 a guy who arrived we can give a 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.800
 punch in the ground of the very 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.840
 violent 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.820
 it told me that I was totally 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 thanks thanks vehicle and after 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.930
 clings to his customers like that and 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.190
 put right like that I'm nice 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.300
 the more we progressed 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.430
 in the capture the boys are back and 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.290
 of course in the orchards the weapons 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.270
 yeah you sniper it and launch rockets 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.270
 and kneeling but there I see there 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:50.790
 decidedly between seeing her fear style 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.980
 and overpowered replaced he regretted the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.980
 come to the terrace I love that we pay 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.260
 I liked the dynamics it's 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.660
 when you arrive in particular in this 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.660
 mode there you are invaded by millions 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.090
 from me 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.310
 remembering still sees the enemies you 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.890
 first you fight armband and boots at 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.540
 beginning by all and even before the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.010
 quickdraw stuck in quotation marks the time 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.550
 reaching first daycare full of 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.170
 good parts 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.930
 they really make them put balls 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.880
 in the body frankly it's a big 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.500
 brothel that's awesome the little dash have 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.630
 however at the neck I always enjoy 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.510
 and full as soon as there are guys in 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.400
 December 2 iron man of the future I think 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.750
 land to take this is another 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.390
 vehicle and go do the boss and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.740
 half to two yes I love the modes of 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.420
 game of which little thick than it was 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.280
 really there is a point that would 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.020
 caught either you like them stop you 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.760

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.240
 of enemies knows where they are between 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.680
 walls 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.860
 we will play in it and we can do it 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.300
 to invade in of bourem in fact it is that 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.250
 the irak groupies 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.620
 there is an enemy of the base you seek 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.210
 the time you are looking for one to four no 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.800
 I really liked the dynamism 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.360
 pretty funny new game so that that 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.160
 the battle is present and especially the 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.600
 to be in trouble with that with 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.920
 old weapons and a blur the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.880
 more and more blocks and the end you have the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.200
 sniper know too much crate 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.000
