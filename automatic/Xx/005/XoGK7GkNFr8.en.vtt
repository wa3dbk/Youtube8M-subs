00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.670
 the staff welcome to another class of 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.170
 genetics and today we will try to 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.480
 understand how it is done to 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.910
 determine the sex of different 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.860
 individuals of different species 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.350
 I'm sure you should already have 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.380
 heard in the x and y system, which is the 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.810
 our system of sexual determination 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.640
 in fact this system is based on 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.680
 chromosomes we call people 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.480
 sex chromosomes that will be 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.940
 different from the girls and three boys, right? 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.390
 Forever the woman being a woman she has 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.300
 that give a pair of sex chromosomes 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.030
 that we call the xx and pro 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.620
 female girls it is two chromosomes 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.659
 different sexual 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.239
 it inherits a chromosome x that is equal to 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.420
 and is of a chromosome that is 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.389
 exclusive to men that is the chromosome and 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.679
 of the promotion as it has no format 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:05.019
 but he is younger, he has a 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.920
 a personal region that has not stopped 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.230
 chromosome region x 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.720
 that is, there are regions of the chromosome and 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.200
 who share a genius like x mas 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.180
 a region does not exist the way a region 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.060
 whose space filled up by preventing 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.420
 genes unique to men is an example 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.130
 of them is the gene sry which is a gene 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.300
 responsible for the processes of 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.040
 masculinisation is to other regions 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.720
 people call the regions homologous to us 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.120
 shares common genes 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.110
 But this is subject to our next 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.050
 class 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.340
 It's good that we're in the x- and-y system. 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.850
 do not forget that so for example 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.080
 for our species we have about 46 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.690
 chromosomes 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.760
 these 46 chromosomes are organized in 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.950
 23 chromosome pairs that is to 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.960
 choose resolutions that have 23 came from 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.090
 father 23 came from the mother 23 in kindness 46 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.710
 this paternal and maternal chromosome they 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.420
 combine in paris 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.340
 these couples we call pairs of 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 homologous chromosomes 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.560
 of these 23 pairs we have 22 pairs 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.330
 what we call promotion in the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.140
 autosomal sus and has a park is the pair 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.260
 of sex chromosomes that is precisely 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.330
 these guys we're studying 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.580
 here to be a girl, the father has to be 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.570
 identical to be a boy, the father has to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.810
 be different 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.650
 Okay, well, we have a good record. 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.490
 is not unique we also have the system x 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.000
 0 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.980
 In this case, here we have a personal 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.050
 certain peculiarity 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.270
 we also have organisms that are 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.550
 dipóides is now 2 on 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.430
 as well as our minds are both in the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.440
 our chromosomes organized in paris 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.730
 here we also have how we are organized 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.880
 in paris only with the exception of the sexual pair 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.850
 in the case of the sexual para for males they 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.650
 have as I am only one xe chromosome 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.340
 but nothing that's why we say that 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.110
 they are x 0 and in the case of females 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.930
 We have females who are xx, but they are 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.100
 always blogs when the subject is 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.470
 chromosomes other buses are the 2 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.340
 means to say that I have two 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.890
 sets of chromosomes autosomal good 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.320
 cw personal system is a very 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.010
 common in birds for example 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.459
 and here is the opposite of what 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.670
 happens in the system xx for example in the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.770
 cw system case females are of the type 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.300
 z w 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.370
 the males are of the type say it in the 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.970
 if it was being forbidden to see who has 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.890
 how we are equal are males not to 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.240
 Sometimes it 's very interesting, people. 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.810
 analyzing what changes here has a lot of 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:15.410
 used in biology which is as follows 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.410
 straight and gothic sex 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.040
 and gothic romance sex 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.560
 and you know what it means 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.520
 different and you know what it means 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.860
 that is the same 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.949
 business is the following personal when 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.960
 this female who is best to do eleven 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.850
 to produce their eggs 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.850
 it will produce in order to produce 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.760
 two types of glasses an album that contains 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.290
 z chromosome containing an ovum 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.729
 chromosome w 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.290
 and this causes it to produce 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.660
 different types of payment and therefore 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.449
 in this case it is a case of systems w 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.460
 the scenes are sex straight because 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.090
 they can produce different types of 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.870
 gametes and in the case of male systems and 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.240
 w 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.979
 when he went to do 6 11 he just goes 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.520
 able to make a single type of 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.930
 sperm that carries the chromosome 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.040
 z because that's all he can 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.440
 to present 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.200
 so in this case here we will have a 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.490
 male as being our gender or 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.650
 museological us you if you 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.080
 make a parallel with the x and y system 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.090
 which is ours will be the opposite in the 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.520
 our female case xx 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.240
 so the only kind of work that the daughter 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:43.720
 can produce ova x then in case a 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:47.800
 xey system is the most gothic and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:51.760
 in the case of the display systems for 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.760
 male males of the x and y system 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.789
 Do you know that marcio braz image is xy? 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.370
 and then it will produce the gamete x or 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:04.599
 kite and different sexes 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:09.580
 so for x and yé sex straight gothic 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:11.760
 is the male to zw sex to 0 and gothic 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.460
 it's the female 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.010
 but an important personal detail about 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:24.370
 so here it is the following not all 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:26.050
 types of animals will have their sex 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.410
 determined only by chromosomes 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.919
 sexual as the system sac other sound 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.560
 animals will have their sex determined 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.550
 or by nest temperature or by 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.900
 day 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.699
 females of male pods after 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.900
 This is our next video subject. 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:44.900
 Kissing and see you next time.
