comes in a spray form as well but I like
the<00:01:52.979> lotion<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> feel<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the lotion just because I feel like I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
the lotion just because I feel like I
have<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.750> control<00:01:54.810> over<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.770> feel<00:01:56.009> like

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
have more control over it I feel like

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.179 
have more control over it I feel like
it's<00:01:56.939> easier<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.299> me<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> feel<00:01:58.439> where<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> have

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
it's easier for me to feel where I have

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.840 
it's easier for me to feel where I have
the<00:01:59.340> lotion<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.899> I'm<00:02:00.899> less<00:02:01.619> likely<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:02.100> skip

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the lotion and I'm less likely to skip

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.810 
the lotion and I'm less likely to skip
an<00:02:03.030> area<00:02:03.409> whereas<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> spray<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.640> think

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
an area whereas the spray I don't think

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.139 
an area whereas the spray I don't think
I'll<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.060> able<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> tell<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.780> much<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.580> picked

the natural it doesn't look orange E it
just<00:02:44.020> looks<00:02:44.410> like<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:46.680> natural<00:02:47.680> tan<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.250> you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
just looks like a natural tan that you

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.080 
just looks like a natural tan that you
would<00:02:48.490> get<00:02:48.760> maybe<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.660> little<00:02:50.110> bit<00:02:50.440> more

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090

bronzed

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
bronzed

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.900 
bronzed
but<00:02:52.570> for<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.290> most<00:02:53.470> part<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.430> really<00:02:54.730> good

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
but for the most part it's a really good

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.020 
but for the most part it's a really good
looking<00:02:55.720> tan<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:57.130> lasts<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.580> pretty<00:02:57.790> long

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
looking tan and it lasts a pretty long

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.540 
looking tan and it lasts a pretty long
time<00:02:58.270> I<00:02:58.600> would<00:02:58.780> say<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.170> at<00:02:59.290> last<00:02:59.470> maybe<00:03:00.250> a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
time I would say that at last maybe a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.210 
time I would say that at last maybe a
week<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.450> three<00:03:01.960> days<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.740> then<00:03:02.860> I'll<00:03:02.980> start

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
week and three days and then I'll start

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.120 
week and three days and then I'll start
to<00:03:03.400> fade<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:05.020> has<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> nice<00:03:05.560> fade<00:03:05.980> it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
to fade and it has a nice fade it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.130 
to fade and it has a nice fade it
doesn't<00:03:06.430> fade<00:03:06.880> blotchy<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.660> kind<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.930> just

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
doesn't fade blotchy it kind of just

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.220 
doesn't fade blotchy it kind of just
fades<00:03:08.440> naturally<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> natural<00:03:09.940> fade<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
fades naturally like a natural fade and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.010 
fades naturally like a natural fade and
just<00:03:11.500> starts<00:03:11.770> to<00:03:11.980> look<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.940> little<00:03:13.060> bit<00:03:13.300> dull

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
just starts to look a little bit dull

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.300 
just starts to look a little bit dull
but<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.680> doesn't<00:03:15.390> fade<00:03:16.390> patchy<00:03:16.750> it's<00:03:17.590> easy<00:03:17.980> to

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
but it doesn't fade patchy it's easy to

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.880 
but it doesn't fade patchy it's easy to
apply<00:03:18.610> it's<00:03:19.090> not<00:03:19.570> greasy<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.620> really

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
apply it's not greasy and it really

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.550 
apply it's not greasy and it really
absorbs<00:03:21.100> into<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.670> skin<00:03:21.760> very<00:03:22.210> well<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:23.170> dries

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
absorbs into the skin very well it dries

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.130 
absorbs into the skin very well it dries
quickly<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.880> doesn't<00:03:24.910> transfer<00:03:25.630> onto

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140
