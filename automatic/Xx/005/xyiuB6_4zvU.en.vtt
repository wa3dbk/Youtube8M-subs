 I bought a say I wonder if it was normal, but 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.630
 If you say you didn't like it so much and you didn't like it the most 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.080
 Also I tethering I was written that Chau I can 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.710
 Actually that 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.580
 That'm going to try to use the Toka this 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.200
 the iij people of mvno 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.060

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.240
 Docomo contract 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.470
 Wind that can not be tethered unless I somehow say mode 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.890
 why 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.970
 I bought that second hand 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:57.620
 From 70 million yen to for the smartphone that is called katakana 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:05.240
 If you have various investigated as Dekirukana also Zazie and you were Sim Free Well then you have angry 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.280
 This previous article is cool and cool in less than 20,000 yen in a certain blog, and it says that it is exceptionally functional 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.610
 Because 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.760
 Kedomo is that Well personal imports that 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.930
 bought 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.050
 If you say that your frank opinion is 8 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.580
 After all it is this form that I liked most 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 This person who has that android 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.830
 I often see it by train, but the screen is really big compared to this iphone 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.150
 In is Somehow this doing is part members of the 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.319
 It was drowning, but after buying this 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.799
 Even if you walk in town 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.799
 that 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.200
 It looks like this is the coolest in design 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.069
 think 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.250
 From this thinness 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:56.060
 8 this 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.710
 Yet at all was like strong to Toka something quite scratches screen is I screen 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.560
 that 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.460
 Kedomo I case Toka not even use 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.420
 In this case also the Fu that Do I think we do not need anymore 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.530
 That's just what I think 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.430
 I like something cool, so let's take a look at the screen 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.990
 Screen first by pressing a button on the heart next to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.730

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.510

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:51.669
