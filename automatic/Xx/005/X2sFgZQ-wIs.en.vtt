witcher nexus - which i will put link in
the<00:00:30.450> description<00:00:30.930> so<00:00:31.740> basically<00:00:32.870> witcher<00:00:33.870> 2

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the description so basically witcher 2

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.010 
the description so basically witcher 2
isn't<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.310> most<00:00:36.180> other<00:00:36.360> games<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.930> have

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
isn't like most other games that have

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.430 
isn't like most other games that have
been<00:00:38.000> designed<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.090> councils<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.750> mind<00:00:39.960> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
been designed with councils in mind it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.430 
been designed with councils in mind it's
been<00:00:40.739> basically<00:00:41.490> originally<00:00:42.480> made<00:00:42.870> only<00:00:43.230> for

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
been basically originally made only for

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.980 
been basically originally made only for
PC<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.130> only<00:00:44.340> after<00:00:44.580> a<00:00:44.730> year<00:00:45.210> has<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.900> been

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
PC on only after a year has it been

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.690 
PC on only after a year has it been
released<00:00:47.240> on<00:00:48.240> a<00:00:48.300> console<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.020> me<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.430> means

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
released on a console that me that means

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.270 
released on a console that me that means
that<00:00:50.940> basically<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.480> game<00:00:51.630> looks

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
that basically the game looks

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.460 
that basically the game looks
outstanding

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
outstanding

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.560 
outstanding
normally<00:00:55.470> at<00:00:56.010> its<00:00:56.280> max<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.790> capabilities

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
normally at its max to have capabilities

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.860 
normally at its max to have capabilities
and<00:00:58.220> you<00:00:59.220> would<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.520> needed<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.330> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and you would have needed a really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.429 
and you would have needed a really
powerful<00:01:01.440> PC<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:03.150> run<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> maxed<00:01:03.720> out<00:01:03.840> anyway

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
powerful PC to run it maxed out anyway

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.910 
powerful PC to run it maxed out anyway
now<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:06.330> being<00:01:06.540> said<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.990> texture<00:01:07.380> pack<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
now this being said the texture pack is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.050 
now this being said the texture pack is
about<00:01:08.220> 1<00:01:08.820> gigabyte<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
about 1 gigabyte so you can see here the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.520 
about 1 gigabyte so you can see here the
wood<00:01:12.409> looks<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.619> better<00:01:14.130> there's<00:01:14.789> a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
wood looks a bit better there's a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.959 
wood looks a bit better there's a
generally<00:01:16.530> higher<00:01:16.740> resolution<00:01:17.340> texture<00:01:17.700> for

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
generally higher resolution texture for

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.520 
generally higher resolution texture for
wood<00:01:18.719> floor<00:01:20.240> some<00:01:21.240> sealing<00:01:21.780> stuff<00:01:22.079> like<00:01:22.289> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
wood floor some sealing stuff like that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.840 
wood floor some sealing stuff like that
and<00:01:22.799> there's<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:23.880> higher<00:01:24.390> resolution<00:01:24.719> for

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
and there's a higher resolution for

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
and there's a higher resolution for
weapons<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:26.999> well<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:31.670> said<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.140> having<00:01:34.140> said

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
weapons as well so said that having said

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:43.219 
weapons as well so said that having said
that<00:01:34.380> basically<00:01:36.289> I<00:01:39.229> having<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:41.299> well<00:01:42.299> 24

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that basically I having about well 24

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.080 
that basically I having about well 24
was<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.219> lowest<00:01:44.630> FPS<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.869> had<00:01:46.670> but<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.939> was

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
was the lowest FPS I had but that was

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
was the lowest FPS I had but that was
only<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.689> split<00:01:48.929> second<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.729> normally

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
only for a split second and normally

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.969 
only for a split second and normally
it's<00:01:50.999> at<00:01:51.210> about<00:01:52.009> 30<00:01:53.009> 40<00:01:53.509> going<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:54.899> 70<00:01:55.560> when

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it's at about 30 40 going up to 70 when

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.010 
it's at about 30 40 going up to 70 when
you're<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.369> standing<00:01:57.329> still<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.959> just

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you're just standing still and just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.770 
you're just standing still and just
looking<00:01:58.439> at<00:02:00.439> you<00:02:01.439> know<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.829> ground<00:02:02.780> there's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
looking at you know the ground there's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.900 
looking at you know the ground there's
being<00:02:03.959> said<00:02:05.179> turn<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:07.250> actual<00:02:08.250> over<00:02:08.580> sampling

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
being said turn and actual over sampling

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.440 
being said turn and actual over sampling
off<00:02:09.679> sets<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:12.780> minimum<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:13.560> about<00:02:13.890> 40<00:02:14.520> 45<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
off sets the minimum at about 40 45 and

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.420 
off sets the minimum at about 40 45 and
the<00:02:16.260> general<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:18.000> about<00:02:18.439> between<00:02:19.439> 50<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:19.920> 60

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the general at about between 50 and 60

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.820 
the general at about between 50 and 60
going<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.150> 80<00:02:21.689> 90

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
going up to like 80 90

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.820 
going up to like 80 90
so<00:02:22.950> uber<00:02:23.190> sampling<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.820> still<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.560> extremely

time<00:03:22.170> because<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.130> mean<00:03:23.310> well<00:03:23.520> Crysis<00:03:24.000> 3<00:03:24.530> seems

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
time because I mean well Crysis 3 seems

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.160 
time because I mean well Crysis 3 seems
to<00:03:25.740> have<00:03:25.920> slightly<00:03:26.459> higher<00:03:27.290> requirements<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
to have slightly higher requirements and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.710 
to have slightly higher requirements and
everything<00:03:31.170> maxed<00:03:31.380> out<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.830> Crysis<00:03:32.250> free<00:03:32.720> has

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
everything maxed out in Crysis free has

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.949 
everything maxed out in Crysis free has
actually<00:03:34.500> caused<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.950> bit<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.400> lag<00:03:37.730> with<00:03:38.959> 16

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
actually caused a bit of a lag with 16

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.390 
actually caused a bit of a lag with 16
times<00:03:40.260> 4<00:03:41.010> times<00:03:41.610> whatever<00:03:42.110> filter<00:03:43.250> type<00:03:44.250> of

thing<00:03:45.440> but<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:47.100> pretty<00:03:47.519> close<00:03:47.790> I'm<00:03:47.970> given

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
thing but this is pretty close I'm given

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.220 
thing but this is pretty close I'm given
the<00:03:48.239> fact<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.780> game<00:03:48.930> has<00:03:49.110> been

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the fact that the game has been

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.150 
the fact that the game has been
originally<00:03:49.800> released<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.310> think<00:03:50.550> in<00:03:50.670> 2011<00:03:52.160> it's

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
originally released I think in 2011 it's
