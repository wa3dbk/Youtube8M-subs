00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
now as many as you can before moving on

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:20.779 
now as many as you can before moving on
to<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.340> next<00:00:02.639> set<00:00:02.820> of<00:00:02.850> stairs<00:00:19.609> when<00:00:20.609> you're

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
to the next set of stairs when you're

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.670 
to the next set of stairs when you're
here<00:00:20.970> take<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> upper<00:00:21.810> path<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.590> it's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
here take the upper path as I think it's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.410 
here take the upper path as I think it's
over<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> little<00:00:23.220> bit<00:00:23.369> easier<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> deal<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.090> in

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
over a little bit easier to deal with in

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.200 
over a little bit easier to deal with in
the<00:00:24.510> bottom<00:00:24.779> pass<00:00:25.430> the<00:00:26.430> only<00:00:26.640> problem<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.029> this

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the bottom pass the only problem is this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730 
the bottom pass the only problem is this
pink<00:00:27.480> dinosaur<00:00:27.900> can<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> little<00:00:28.439> bit<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
pink dinosaur can get a little bit of a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.470 
pink dinosaur can get a little bit of a
pain<00:00:28.949> cuz<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> seem<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> jump<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:30.060> close

be able to get enough fire off into them
the<00:00:34.320> kill<00:00:34.500> oh

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.440 

when<00:00:48.280> you're<00:00:48.400> here<00:00:48.580> jump<00:00:48.940> up<00:00:49.090> in<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.210> air<00:00:49.330> and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
when you're here jump up in the air and

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.910 
when you're here jump up in the air and
I'll<00:00:49.720> cause<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.050> blue<00:00:50.230> dinosaur<00:00:50.470> to<00:00:50.770> back

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
I'll cause the blue dinosaur to back

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.410 
I'll cause the blue dinosaur to back
away<00:00:51.100> from<00:00:51.280> you<00:00:51.550> and<00:00:51.640> just<00:00:51.820> fall<00:00:52.000> right<00:00:52.030> into

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
away from you and just fall right into

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.710 
away from you and just fall right into
the<00:00:52.600> hole<00:00:52.750> so<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.990> can<00:00:53.140> get<00:00:53.230> past<00:00:53.410> it<00:00:53.710> on<00:00:54.720> the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
the hole so you can get past it on the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.150 
the hole so you can get past it on the
writing<00:00:56.020> cloud<00:00:56.260> once<00:00:56.500> again<00:00:56.740> just<00:00:56.920> duck<00:00:57.130> down

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
writing cloud once again just duck down

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.800 
writing cloud once again just duck down
and<00:00:57.370> all<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.790> enemies<00:00:57.910> will<00:00:58.270> miss<00:00:58.480> you<00:00:58.660> as

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
and all the enemies will miss you as

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:07.920 
and all the enemies will miss you as
you're<00:00:58.990> traveling<00:00:59.200> along

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.100 

at<00:01:09.120> this<00:01:10.120> portion<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.690> would<00:01:10.810> recommend

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
at this portion I would recommend

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.050 
at this portion I would recommend
usually<00:01:11.620> going<00:01:11.770> down<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.160> bottom<00:01:12.550> path<00:01:12.760> as<00:01:12.970> I

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
usually going down the bottom path as I

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.730 
usually going down the bottom path as I
think<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.420> past<00:01:13.720> a<00:01:13.840> little<00:01:14.140> bit<00:01:14.230> easier<00:01:14.380> than

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
think that past a little bit easier than

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:36.280 
think that past a little bit easier than
taking<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.070> upper<00:01:15.340> one<00:01:15.490> here

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.260 

once<00:01:36.980> again<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.490> like<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.730> previous<00:01:37.880> stage

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
once again just like the previous stage

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.700 
once again just like the previous stage
when<00:01:38.510> it<00:01:38.600> opens<00:01:38.900> up<00:01:39.080> there's<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.380> few<00:01:39.620> more

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
when it opens up there's a few more

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.890 
when it opens up there's a few more
enemies<00:01:40.100> transforming<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.910> mega<00:01:41.120> gone<00:01:41.360> and

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
enemies transforming the mega gone and

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.200 
enemies transforming the mega gone and
walk<00:01:42.140> over<00:01:42.290> to<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.650> giant<00:01:42.980> snake<00:01:43.220> jump<00:01:44.120> up

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
walk over to the giant snake jump up

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.820 
walk over to the giant snake jump up
twice<00:01:44.510> and<00:01:44.840> use<00:01:44.960> your<00:01:45.110> big<00:01:45.260> blasts<00:01:45.590> on<00:01:45.800> the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
twice and use your big blasts on the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.290 
twice and use your big blasts on the
horn<00:01:46.160> at<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.370> top<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.580> his<00:01:46.790> head<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:47.180> only

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
horn at the top of his head it only

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.240 
horn at the top of his head it only
takes<00:01:47.570> two<00:01:47.780> shots<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.620> defeat<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:48.950> ball

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
takes two shots and you defeat the ball

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.790 
takes two shots and you defeat the ball
so<00:01:49.430> move<00:01:49.610> on<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:49.910> zone<00:01:50.120> 6<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.930> final<00:01:51.410> zone<00:01:51.650> of

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
so move on to zone 6 the final zone of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:05.060 
so move on to zone 6 the final zone of
the<00:01:51.860> game

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.930 

though<00:02:06.030> six<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> huge<00:02:07.350> pain<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.100> butt<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940

though six is a huge pain in the butt so
as<00:02:09.090> soon<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:09.929> mega<00:02:10.170> gone<00:02:10.440> just

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
as soon as you get mega gone just

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.980 
as soon as you get mega gone just
transform<00:02:11.610> into<00:02:11.820> them<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.660> should<00:02:12.870> have

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
transform into them you should have

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.510 
transform into them you should have
plenty<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.440> health<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.920> you'll<00:02:14.070> have<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> pretty

high score by this point the enemy's
mainly<00:02:17.459> those<00:02:17.610> blue<00:02:17.910> robots<00:02:18.420> are<00:02:18.660> such<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.230> pain

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
mainly those blue robots are such a pain

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.260 
mainly those blue robots are such a pain
to<00:02:19.740> take<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> lot<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.220> shots<00:02:20.580> they<00:02:21.120> can

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
to take a lot of shots they can

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.750 
to take a lot of shots they can
disappear<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.020> reappear<00:02:22.050> as<00:02:22.800> well<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.610> they

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
disappear and reappear as well as they

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
disappear and reappear as well as they
will<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> gang<00:02:24.420> up<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.870> when<00:02:25.410> you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
will like the gang up on you when you

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.110 
will like the gang up on you when you
get<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.830> between<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.580> them<00:02:26.670> another<00:02:26.910> one

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
get in between one of them another one

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
get in between one of them another one
I'll<00:02:27.240> appear<00:02:27.480> from<00:02:27.630> behind<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.980> ends

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
I'll appear from behind you so it ends

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.860 
I'll appear from behind you so it ends
up<00:02:29.280> being<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.760> heck<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.150> lot<00:02:30.180> safer<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
up being just a heck of a lot safer and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.930 
up being just a heck of a lot safer and
easier<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.740> transforming<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.490> mega<00:02:32.700> gun

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
easier this is transforming the mega gun

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.250 
easier this is transforming the mega gun
and<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.180> should<00:02:33.390> be<00:02:33.420> able<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.750> survive<00:02:34.020> for

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and you should be able to survive for

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.290 
and you should be able to survive for
most<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.650> level<00:02:34.980> especially<00:02:35.520> considering

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:58.969 
to turn from your normal form into that
big<00:06:57.240> muscular<00:06:57.629> form<00:06:58.050> gives<00:06:58.649> the<00:06:58.800> game<00:06:58.919> a

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
big muscular form gives the game a

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.219 
big muscular form gives the game a
little<00:06:59.099> bit<00:06:59.369> of<00:06:59.520> depth<00:06:59.729> and<00:06:59.879> with<00:07:00.809> that<00:07:00.990> that's

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229
