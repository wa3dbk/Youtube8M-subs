00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everybody and if you see it is destined to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.140
 teachers at the beginning was a beautiful 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.630
 league goal for you how to start from 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 correct way in this hobby to achieve 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.240
 The very document I committed is the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.430
 acrobatic model of the f3a empire or its 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.150
 acrobatic model is a very 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.890
 fast from low to medium or 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.279
 practically impossible for a beginner 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 pilot this model mainly in the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.130
 my case that does not count on the help of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 instructors 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.750
 so he decided to leave it quiet and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.940
 What do you have in order to get a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.059
 this here 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 was a fragile model, however easy to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.379
 being restored with you can observe 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.969
 has a lot of damage suffered adhesive 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.730
 14 users 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:03.210
 however it is resisting employee 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.200
 himself you can observe a lot 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.610
 of restorations tapes 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.420
 here I chose to delete the command from 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.950
 rudder 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.659
 because as this is the model was model and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.290
 I am docile and have no money whatsoever. 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.509
 leaning on the wings 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.060
 the rudder can be dispensed without further 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.890
 problems 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.240
 and it is much easier for the beginner 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.430
 start because I - a command to get 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.170
 to worry 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.750
 here if you can observe has a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.299
 This box is a used box. 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.750
 generally civil construction 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.100
 usually sockets and switches you 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.490
 can find your house and any 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.320
 building matter because you think 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.890
 because just stop providing the model is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.590
 very fragile the cd pro middle of the first 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.540
 You have this part of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.090
 it will hold up and it's a very difficult part 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.180
 to restore 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.019
 Because it can get crooked, you can stay 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.459
 inclined unip nation that is not correct 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:30.349
 then that box that captures perfectly 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:33.709
 in it you think you do not have much weight 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.879
 the weight it has does not affect the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.629
 world was model 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:42.069
 here in front you put the engine 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.069
 to directly accuse the cashier 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.739
 The tip these folks hope 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.920

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.880
 this is the model was all in 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.329
 vinyl 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:15.560
 other houses with a scourge of up to r 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.920
 car finally notebooks use it 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.739
 a slang on it so that it fixes 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.609
 surface strengthens much older 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.980
 model 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.400
