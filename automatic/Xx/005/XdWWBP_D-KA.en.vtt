triathlon<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.290> lot<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.860> suffering<00:02:28.850> in<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
triathlon is a lot like suffering in a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.990 
triathlon is a lot like suffering in a
race<00:02:29.240> car<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.290> mental<00:02:31.190> space<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.640> dealing

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
race car the mental space of dealing

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.330 
race car the mental space of dealing
with<00:02:32.150> your<00:02:32.360> own<00:02:32.440> struggles<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.860> something

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
with your own struggles is something

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:49.240 
with your own struggles is something
that<00:02:34.520> is<00:02:34.700> very<00:02:34.850> common<00:02:35.240> between<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.630> two<00:02:48.250> when

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that is very common between the two when

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.550 
that is very common between the two when
I<00:02:49.340> first<00:02:49.640> met<00:02:49.850> him<00:02:50.060> he<00:02:50.360> could<00:02:50.540> pretty<00:02:51.110> much<00:02:51.200> go

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
I first met him he could pretty much go

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.990 
I first met him he could pretty much go
out<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:51.920> run<00:02:52.040> four<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.520> five<00:02:52.700> miles

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
out and run four to five miles

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.200 
out and run four to five miles
comfortably<00:02:53.800> right<00:02:54.800> now<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.310> think<00:02:55.940> he<00:02:56.030> has

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
comfortably right now I think he has

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.339 
comfortably right now I think he has
marathon<00:02:57.110> out<00:02:57.260> there<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.560> his<00:02:57.650> future

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.949 

in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.400> pool<00:03:02.640> most<00:03:03.060> workouts<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:03.659> can<00:03:03.810> be

in the pool most workouts we can be

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.860 
in the pool most workouts we can be

Jimmy on the bike this is where he gets

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.199 
Jimmy on the bike this is where he gets
a<00:03:12.150> lot<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.569> his<00:03:12.840> parallels<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:13.950> racing<00:03:14.549> when

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
a lot of his parallels to racing when

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.360 
a lot of his parallels to racing when
he's<00:03:15.420> hurting<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.260> bad<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.920> his<00:03:17.069> heart<00:03:17.310> rate
