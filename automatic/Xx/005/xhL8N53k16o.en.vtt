same thing I did in the tower video I
put<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> link<00:02:33.470> right<00:02:33.770> here<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.690> here<00:02:35.840> we<00:02:36.080> have

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
put the link right here so here we have

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.870 
put the link right here so here we have
the<00:02:36.290> quick-release<00:02:36.520> adaption<00:02:37.520> part<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:37.790> this

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
the quick-release adaption part so this

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.360 
the quick-release adaption part so this
was<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.150> here<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.680> make<00:02:39.890> sure<00:02:40.070> it's<00:02:40.190> centered

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
was on here and make sure it's centered

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.820 
was on here and make sure it's centered
with<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.900> adapter<00:02:42.260> piece<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:42.560> goes<00:02:42.680> on

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
with the the adapter piece that goes on

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.930 
with the the adapter piece that goes on
the<00:02:42.920> street<00:02:43.070> well<00:02:43.310> she's<00:02:44.209> right<00:02:44.330> here<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.760> make

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
the street well she's right here so make

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.470 
the street well she's right here so make
sure<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.420> these<00:02:48.380> parts<00:02:48.739> set<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.489> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
sure that these parts set it out the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.780 
sure that these parts set it out the
three<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:50.870> straight<00:02:51.170> which<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.530> fall

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
three will straight which is fall

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.720 
three will straight which is fall
lastly<00:02:56.689> see<00:02:57.689> right<00:02:57.840> there<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.140> straight<00:02:58.730> and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
lastly see right there it's straight and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.429 
lastly see right there it's straight and
then<00:02:59.879> computers<00:03:00.209> bolt<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.840> string<00:03:01.079> or<00:03:01.230> at

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
then computers bolt on the string or at

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:07.309 
then computers bolt on the string or at
the<00:03:01.590> end<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> for<00:03:04.739> right<00:03:04.860> now<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.870> goes<00:03:07.110> on

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
the end so for right now this goes on

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.520 
the end so for right now this goes on
first

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.640 

so<00:03:15.530> here<00:03:15.830> we<00:03:15.950> have<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:17.260> think<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.410> probably

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
so here we have the think it's probably

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.030 
so here we have the think it's probably
aluminum<00:03:19.629> aluminum<00:03:20.629> backing<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.860> gives

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
aluminum aluminum backing that gives

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.040 
aluminum aluminum backing that gives
