00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
concepts in different scenarios we did a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.540 
concepts in different scenarios we did a
lot<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> research<00:00:16.619> over<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.070> last<00:00:17.250> year

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
and need you know moving forward as

with a simulator we think is really

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.659 
with a simulator we think is really

one of the other things that we're
really<00:00:48.210> happy<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.350> move

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
really happy with is that we can move

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.350 
really happy with is that we can move
and<00:00:49.770> change<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.219> hardware<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.700> well<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:51.210> have

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and change the hardware as well we have

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
and change the hardware as well we have
a<00:00:51.719> gauge<00:00:51.989> cluster<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> an<00:00:53.100> infotainment

a gauge cluster we have an infotainment
platform<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.170> move<00:00:55.440> those

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
platform in there but we can move those

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.990 
platform in there but we can move those
things<00:00:56.010> around<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.520> can<00:00:56.670> create<00:00:56.879> new

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
things around we can create new

things around we can create new
environments<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> user<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.680> test<00:00:59.039> we

environments for the user to test we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.250 
environments for the user to test we

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
have a camera in there so we conceivably

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
have a camera in there so we conceivably
test<00:01:01.590> eye<00:01:01.739> tracking<00:01:02.219> head<00:01:02.550> tracking<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.480> can

test eye tracking head tracking we can

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
test eye tracking head tracking we can
test<00:01:03.750> gesture<00:01:04.140> tracking<00:01:04.559> there's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
test gesture tracking there's a lot of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
test gesture tracking there's a lot of
different<00:01:05.729> things<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.930> understand

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
different things we can do to understand

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.620 
different things we can do to understand
how<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.619> user<00:01:07.860> will<00:01:08.310> react<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:09.420> what

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
how the user will react or you know what

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.850 
how the user will react or you know what
they'll<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.140> they'll<00:01:10.260> dislike<00:01:10.619> or

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
different things in the car the first

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060 
different things in the car the first
scenario<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> manual<00:01:15.750> drive<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.680> user<00:01:16.710> will

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
scenario is a manual drive the user will

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
scenario is a manual drive the user will
sit<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.670> start<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> drive<00:01:18.509> along<00:01:18.750> a

country road further down the road they

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.310 
country road further down the road they
will<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.970> surprised<00:01:21.479> by<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> deer<00:01:21.930> they'll<00:01:22.170> hit

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
will be surprised by a deer they'll hit

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
will be surprised by a deer they'll hit
the<00:01:22.350> deer<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.759> demonstrate

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the deer and then we can demonstrate

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
the deer and then we can demonstrate
what<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> user<00:01:24.720> would<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.020> able<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
what the user would be able to do if the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.910 
what the user would be able to do if the
car<00:01:26.400> could<00:01:26.549> take<00:01:26.700> over<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.799> would

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
car could take over you know they would

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.069 
car could take over you know they would
actually<00:01:29.280> avoid<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> deer<00:01:29.909> upon<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> replay

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
actually avoid the deer upon a replay

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.840 
actually avoid the deer upon a replay
the<00:01:34.079> second<00:01:34.530> scenario<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> highway<00:01:35.400> driving

into<00:01:43.079> an<00:01:43.259> autopilot<00:01:44.040> lane<00:01:44.399> when<00:01:45.030> they<00:01:45.119> trigger

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
into an autopilot lane when they trigger

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.940 
into an autopilot lane when they trigger
the<00:01:45.450> autopilot<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> 10-second

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the autopilot there will be a 10-second

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.039 
the autopilot there will be a 10-second
count<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.880> point<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> car<00:01:48.780> will<00:01:48.899> take

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
count at that point the car will take

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
count at that point the car will take
over<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.979> user<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.430> steering<00:01:50.850> with<00:01:51.119> the

a place where they selected on a map the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.369 
a place where they selected on a map the
unique<00:02:18.330> thing<00:02:18.569> about<00:02:18.599> this<00:02:19.019> that<00:02:19.230> we're

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
unique thing about this that we're

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.170 
unique thing about this that we're
really<00:02:19.590> excited<00:02:19.920> about<00:02:20.129> is<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.670> ties<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.150> with

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
really excited about is it ties in with

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.089 
really excited about is it ties in with
our<00:02:21.420> connected<00:02:21.810> service<00:02:22.110> strategy<00:02:22.530> where

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
our connected service strategy where

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.089 
our connected service strategy where
user<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.879> greeted<00:02:24.360> from<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.900> friend<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.440> their

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
user is greeted from a friend and their

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.949 
user is greeted from a friend and their
path<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.459> diverted<00:02:26.879> so<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.480> friend<00:02:27.690> wants<00:02:27.900> to

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
path is diverted so the friend wants to

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.930 
path is diverted so the friend wants to
meet<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.319> dinner<00:02:28.349> they<00:02:29.040> select<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.610> place

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
meet for dinner they select a place

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.699 
meet for dinner they select a place
based<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.750> some<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.140> things<00:02:31.290> they<00:02:31.530> both

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
based on some of the things they both

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.069 
based on some of the things they both
like<00:02:32.040> at<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.700> same<00:02:32.940> distance<00:02:33.390> between<00:02:33.660> them

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
like at the same distance between them

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.479 
like at the same distance between them
so<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.560> connected<00:02:34.920> service<00:02:35.190> does<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
so the connected service does the

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.370 
so the connected service does the
calculation<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.360> cloud<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.170> given

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
calculation and the cloud and it's given

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.870 
calculation and the cloud and it's given
those<00:02:37.500> options<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.579> you<00:02:38.670> make<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
those options to you so you make the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.059 
those options to you so you make the
selection<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.450> drive<00:02:39.690> there<00:02:40.069> because

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
selection and you drive there because

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.530 
selection and you drive there because
the<00:02:41.190> user<00:02:41.370> isn't<00:02:41.579> driving<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.180> windshield

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the user isn't driving the windshield

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.870 
the user isn't driving the windshield
can<00:02:42.750> take<00:02:43.049> on<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.680> form<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.069> another<00:02:44.190> screen

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
can take on the form of another screen

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180 
can take on the form of another screen
so<00:02:45.209> there's<00:02:45.870> document<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.739> be<00:02:46.799> opened

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so there's document that can be opened

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.600 
so there's document that can be opened
you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.340> read<00:02:47.610> texts<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.599> see<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> live

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
you can read texts you can see a live

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.400 
you can read texts you can see a live
