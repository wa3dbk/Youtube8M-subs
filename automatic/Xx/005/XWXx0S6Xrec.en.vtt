00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.990
 meet pony human ae and lack the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.820
 edmundo begins its new bridge there in the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.190
 springs of the site and to 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.110
 mention this new personal enemy 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.360
 this new enemy you see in the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 screen will now be an enemy that will have 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 movement patterns for this with 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.289
 knight knight that riders use 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.539
 one pocket and a mask on his neck has 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.750
 an exposed brain because any force 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.029
 exp. it 's an expensive enemy, good to be dead 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.920
 only on certain occasions only 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 only the tram he will act so 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.149
 different the knight when he sees you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 he has to go to his side not a prima 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.559
 when he sees the ice he 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.600
 will simply throw a bone and then 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.239
 he will continue to follow his own 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.129
 way is too complicated to kill him 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.829
 because just when you stay in 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.930
 front of it for games on you then the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.809
 The easiest way for you to kill the same 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.059
 will be those shots on diagonals 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.949
 Can you remember because it 's expensive that was the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.690
 first enemy that was not drawn 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.399
 by Edmon if I'm not mistaken the guy who 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.650
 They call him, yes, he does. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.840
 Average flame I just see that on the website 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.170
 i neighborhood faithful here and this move and 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.140
 omel grandmaster in game art design 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.110
 this is a guy that is there is always searching 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.939
 It's all there, man. What I think, fuck. 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.520
 now in these last ones in these 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.450
 last two steaks edu has released 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.340
 first you can notice 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 that the game he already practically 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.640
 It would end, people are doing well. 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.770
 next what will be the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.869
 end result of the game he even commented 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.439
 in the end that next week as well 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.000
 maybe it will release new gifs with the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.880
 debate officials who completely 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.970
 finished cup in the testing phase, which is 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 a very good personal news he also 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.450
 comments that it will launch difficult with 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 larger rooms 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.860
 I came up to understand that it just goes 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 launch difficult that you will pass from 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.820
 another room I think it will be very 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 Good man, he also said that he will give 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 an improvement in brightness in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.899
 details and in the general environment that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.130
 It's fucking good and I'm very happy. 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.990
 with that kind of thing 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.450
 at the very end and the last big thing you 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.129
 ends up crowding that the Iraq enters the room 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.629
 and pick up an item that I still do not know 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.770
 So we know it's going to be a 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.270
 new item for 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.490
 the red eggplant with the string 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.770
 umbilical for habib crazy but the staff 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.510
 It's the people you're with me was asking for 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.240
 comment on these new two steaks 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.680
 So I commented that, I think it's going to 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.870
 difficult enemy because these 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.090
 enemies you have to stay the same 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.450
 line of shot of what he can 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.740
 simply hit it are the most 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.080
 difficult in my opinion for example 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.060
 those liver is connected to that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.650
 Red enemy, why China? 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.690
 only in his expensive direction is he very 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.310
 It's complicated to do something else. 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.510
 also in this first tip you finish 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.160
 noting that the ice is that it is with the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.080
 power that strongly resembles 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.060
 booking operation of the grandson to whom 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.520
 I give that flashlight that in fact a 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.860
 The little satan 's fire is you 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.170
 then loosen up a loaf of bread that looks 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.880
 one seat so that very blip 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.040
 really gives some kind of effect on the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.670
 enemy I kick that gives effect after 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.420
 the enemy is and he recharges 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.250
 the entire room that you 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.680
 Then you will have more than 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.270
 one load per room 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.040
 When you had, you got what's good. 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.900
 interesting the special was just that 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.670
 I wanted to comment with you so I guess 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.500
 that we do not have many defenders if I 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.940
 to fail to notice anything in these gifs 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.980
 please leave it here in the description 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.260
 leave in the comments that I'm going to stay 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.880
 very happy reads personal beauty is this 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.890
 then kiss a hug handshake 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.480
 be clear with god that believe in him 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.130
 please be sure to rate 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.820
 Additional commentary to know if really 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.260
 liked 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.360
 this will help the dissemination of the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.709
 video and personal beauty channel is this 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.709
