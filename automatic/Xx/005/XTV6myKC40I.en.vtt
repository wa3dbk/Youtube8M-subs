00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
you'd think you'd have problems like the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.390 
you'd think you'd have problems like the
wheels<00:02:35.390> too<00:02:35.900> wide<00:02:36.140> for<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.470> car<00:02:36.709> there's<00:02:37.250> not

wheels too wide for the car there's not

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.000 
wheels too wide for the car there's not
enough<00:02:37.640> upset<00:02:38.120> but<00:02:38.959> thing<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.800> didn't

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
enough upset but thing I really didn't

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.130 
enough upset but thing I really didn't
think<00:02:40.160> would<00:02:40.250> happen<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.150> manufacturer

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
think would happen is the manufacturer

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.840 
think would happen is the manufacturer
would<00:02:42.320> ship<00:02:42.769> wheels<00:02:43.040> with<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.310> wrong<00:02:43.550> bolt

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
would ship wheels with the wrong bolt

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.449 
would ship wheels with the wrong bolt
pattern<00:02:44.180> yeah<00:02:44.959> which<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.230> what<00:02:45.500> happened<00:02:45.890> this

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
pattern yeah which is what happened this

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.660 
pattern yeah which is what happened this
car<00:02:46.670> five<00:02:47.420> by<00:02:47.600> 100<00:02:48.140> we<00:02:48.860> measured<00:02:49.160> about<00:02:49.340> thirty

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
car five by 100 we measured about thirty

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.930 
car five by 100 we measured about thirty
five<00:02:49.850> times<00:02:50.180> those<00:02:50.540> wheels<00:02:50.780> are<00:02:50.989> like<00:02:51.640> five<00:02:52.640> by

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
five times those wheels are like five by

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.330 
five times those wheels are like five by
four<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.570> half<00:02:53.630> five<00:02:54.260> buy<00:02:54.500> more<00:02:55.010> than<00:02:55.160> four

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
four and a half five buy more than four

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.910 
four and a half five buy more than four
and<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.489> half<00:02:55.840> they<00:02:56.840> might<00:02:57.049> fit<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.320> Ford<00:02:57.650> truck

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
kids start you can make it start which

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.699 
kids start you can make it start which
is<00:03:15.319> going<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.530> be<00:03:15.709> send<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.849> Subaru<00:03:17.239> and

time to vinyl wrap the car it could use

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.839 
time to vinyl wrap the car it could use
some<00:03:27.379> color<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:27.709> vinyl<00:03:28.220> wrap<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.519> get<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.730> new
