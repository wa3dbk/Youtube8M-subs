00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.400
 Hello everyone in today's video we 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.230
 let's talk about five forgotten tanks 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.080
 worthy of much more attention 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.540
 among the players let's see through 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.620
 what reasons do these machines not use 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.470
 popular 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.989
 I present to you the first issue of the top 5 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.880
 the detachments were led by the company immediately I would like 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.550
 note that the choice benefit of one or another 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.650
 Top participants make you viewers 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.230
 and we are just based on the vote 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.720
 summarize how to influence 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.300
 on the choice of the next topic you will learn 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.059
 at the end of the video, what are the top 5 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.059
 undeservedly forgotten tanks drove 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.410
 and the fifth place is German heavy 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.240
 tank level 8 vk 4502 and in fact 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.270
 friends be my will I would definitely 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 gave him first place in this top by 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.010
 my subjective opinion alpha slippers 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 one of the most misunderstood Fri-8 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.320
 judge for yourself great for heavy 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.850
 tank dynamics gun combines well 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.280
 in itself the accuracy of penetration and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 rate of fire armor with armor 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.880
 alpha sneaker have difficulties but 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 far from all theta 8 can her 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.340
 brag so why are they vk 4502 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.729
 have as many fans as 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 let's say of 3 and t32 tank problem at all 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.290
 not that he is worse than the competition 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.509
 rather the opposite is introduced than our top he 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.400
 would not have got the case in that branch 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.009
 part of which is research 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.810
 an alpha sneaker leads to a mouse that 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.460
 current realities world of tanks 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.380
 just can't compete 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.380
 another ten 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.670
 fourth place and here we have M4 Sherman 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.790
 never one of the most naguchu of their tanks 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.420
 Level 5: what happened to the patch? 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.100
 090 it happened translation hd model like 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.980
 would be cool but in this barrel of honey is not 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.780
 did without the fly in the ointment adding sherman 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.330
 polygons developers a few 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.370
 clipped his armor and all but nothing 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.950
 fugasite for which this tank was so 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.770
 We adore the players with the cumulative nerf 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.330
 lost its former greatness and how 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.850
 the result sherman became ordinary 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.440
 middle level fifth and love 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.360
 the players to him died away 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.770
 but there are still hardcore lovers 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.050
 play on land mines 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.420
 and Sherman still gives them beautiful 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.220
 moments and fantastic vanchots 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.480
 and we got to the top three 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.480
 of our top 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.730
 bronze gets soviet st seventh 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.739
 level t-43 I have a feeling that 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.290
 this tank was never perceived 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.420
 never seriously riveted on him 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.870
 gaming community attention 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.939
 t-43 has always been and will be middling 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.519
 honest hard worker who just 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:14.220
 doing his job and for that he 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.879
 have all the necessary tools inherited 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.450
 inherited from the t-34 85 dynamics 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.790
 inherited from t-34 85 and 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.799
 armor that has become much better 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.310
 than the same 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.540
 t-34 85 so why does t-43 remain 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.879
 dark horse 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.010
 the thing is that often examining 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.109
 40 top three players are trying to quickly 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.189
 slip and and get to the desired 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.639
 t-44 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:43.409
 for a decent combination for your level 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:46.079
 Specifications not cool 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:50.450
 player relations t-43 takes 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.450
 deserved third place in our top 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.489
 on the second line of the top Ferdinand Fri-Sau 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.150
 being a classic among such cars 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.969
 like 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.890
 Ferdinand everything is fine except the dynamics 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.079
 it was the cause of his espada 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.810
 popularity or rather not even her 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.489
 the absence of Ferdinand and her presence at 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.790
 Jagdpanthers 2 which is 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.590
 alternative fri-sau on the eighth level 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.690
 the fact is that the game unfortunately passed 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.910
 that time when something decided the armor and 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.520
 the playerâ€™s choice is likely to fall on the cardboard 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.009
 on dynamic yagu 2 than on armored 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.080
 but to eerily navel Ferdinand but 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.240
 philosophizing about diminishing significance 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.400
 armor we are in some other top a 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.880
 so far we have come close to 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.880
 gold 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.879
 first place in the top 5 undeservedly 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.349
 forgotten tanks rightfully goes 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:48.469
 American t71 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.629
 favorite of many including mine but how 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:52.089
 so it happened that the players were not 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:56.059
 so true to him 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:58.490
 71 simply eclipsed the M41 Bulldog 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:01.370
 also played the factor of the presence of a high-explosive 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.789
 t49 what made there to more interesting 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.860
 than t69 and as a result more and more 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.479
 the number of players prefers to rock 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.900
 hevik through 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:14.419
 alternative branch if now 71 is not 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.949
 such a rare guest brands this 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.349
 just because not much has passed 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.370
 time since the bulldog appeared and 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.889
 t49 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.979
 but it is necessary to recognize that the future is more likely 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.229
 for sure many will want them 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.770
 find out why i haven't said a word from 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.870
 e52 apt-5 and the Chinese yes because these 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.020
 tanks, though were removed from the game 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.300
 but certainly not forgotten I remind you that as 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.229
 theme of the stamp and its participants choose 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.169
 exactly you 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.240
 and we are only summing up to take part 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.089
 will choose the next topic you can now 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.009
 in a group here's a funk contact if you 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.710

 Like and subscribe to the channel and here's a fan 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.310

 until
