electromagnetic energy you may wonder

why<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.540> only<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.380> area<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
why we only see in this area of the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.149 
why we only see in this area of the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
spectrum and not another the answer is

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.429 
spectrum and not another the answer is
because<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> part<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> spectrum

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
because this is the part of the spectrum

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.440 
because this is the part of the spectrum
where<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> Sun<00:01:14.100> releases<00:01:14.460> almost<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> its

where the Sun releases almost all of its
energy<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.580> segment<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.150> the

it gradually is doing and will take

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.840 
it gradually is doing and will take

maybe another five or ten billion years
to<00:04:43.180> do<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:43.680> then<00:04:44.680> something<00:04:45.009> else<00:04:45.130> will<00:04:45.310> happen

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
to do it then something else will happen

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.120 
to do it then something else will happen
and<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.960> will<00:04:47.080> somehow<00:04:47.320> readjusted

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
and it will somehow readjusted

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.129 
and it will somehow readjusted
structures<00:04:48.550> so<00:04:48.759> that<00:04:48.789> it<00:04:49.060> continued<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.660> stay

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
structures so that it continued to stay

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.100 
structures so that it continued to stay
hot<00:04:50.380> now<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.580> thing<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.940> might<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.330> is<00:04:52.690> it

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
hot now one thing it might do is it

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.860 
hot now one thing it might do is it
might<00:04:53.320> expand<00:04:53.889> greatly<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:55.240> outside

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
might expand greatly and the outside

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.330 
might expand greatly and the outside
surface<00:04:56.260> of<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.500> might<00:04:56.650> actually<00:04:57.010> approach

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
surface of it might actually approach

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.760 
surface of it might actually approach
the<00:04:57.520> surface<00:04:57.669> of<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.120> earth<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.229> although

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the surface of the earth so the although

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.710 
the surface of the earth so the although
the<00:05:00.039> Sun<00:05:00.460> would<00:05:00.610> then<00:05:00.760> be<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:00.970> cooler<00:05:01.389> it<00:05:01.600> would

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
the Sun would then be a cooler it would

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.490 
the Sun would then be a cooler it would
still<00:05:01.960> be<00:05:01.990> overall<00:05:02.889> producing<00:05:03.430> more<00:05:03.610> energy

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
still be overall producing more energy

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.260 
still be overall producing more energy
then<00:05:05.500> than<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.340> does<00:05:06.490> now<00:05:06.669> so<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.060> would<00:05:07.150> get

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
then than it does now so it would get

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.810 
then than it does now so it would get
awfully<00:05:07.630> hot<00:05:07.810> right<00:05:08.020> here<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:09.490> would<00:05:09.669> want

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
awfully hot right here and we would want

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.430 
awfully hot right here and we would want
to<00:05:09.880> have<00:05:09.970> space<00:05:10.270> travel<00:05:10.660> by<00:05:10.780> then<00:05:10.990> so<00:05:11.169> we<00:05:11.289> could

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
to have space travel by then so we could

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.909 
to have space travel by then so we could
go<00:05:11.560> live<00:05:11.800> someplace<00:05:12.070> else<00:05:13.620> spectacular<00:05:14.620> as<00:05:14.770> it

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
go live someplace else spectacular as it

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.730 
go live someplace else spectacular as it
sounds<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.910> red<00:05:16.150> giant<00:05:16.660> stage<00:05:16.960> is<00:05:17.289> just<00:05:17.620> the

sounds the red giant stage is just the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.300 
sounds the red giant stage is just the
