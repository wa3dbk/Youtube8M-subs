strictly knife and pistol only known

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.790 
strictly knife and pistol only known
aids<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:15.780> allow<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.199> throw<00:00:16.410> them<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.770> i

aids they allow you to throw them but i

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.439 
aids they allow you to throw them but i
think<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.220> second<00:00:17.670> kill<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.150> kicked

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
think your second kill you get kicked

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.550 
think your second kill you get kicked
for<00:00:18.750> using<00:00:19.020> them<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:20.070> overall<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:21.410> it's<00:00:22.410> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
for using them but overall it's it's a

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.189 
for using them but overall it's it's a
lot<00:00:22.769> different<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.970> battlefield<00:00:24.449> i<00:00:24.570> actually

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
lot different for battlefield i actually

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.300 
lot different for battlefield i actually
find<00:00:25.410> myself<00:00:25.619> really<00:00:26.039> enjoying<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> i

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
find myself really enjoying it this i

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.169 
find myself really enjoying it this i
think<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.429> mainly<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.060> more

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
think it's mainly because it's more

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.209 
think it's mainly because it's more
mellow<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> lot<00:00:31.260> less<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:32.130> me

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
mellow it's just a lot less for me

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.120 
mellow it's just a lot less for me
anyway<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.759> lot<00:00:32.969> less<00:00:33.410> chaos<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.710> find

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
anyway it's a lot less chaos like find

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
anyway it's a lot less chaos like find
myself<00:00:35.309> leaning<00:00:35.760> back<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.360> chair<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.690> lot

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

nothing really exciting as a matter of
fact<00:00:46.530> i<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:46.770> i<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.280> maybe<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.210> kill<00:00:48.480> in

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
fact i think i get maybe one kill in

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.660 
fact i think i get maybe one kill in
this<00:00:48.870> footage<00:00:49.079> i<00:00:49.410> didn't<00:00:50.070> record<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.489> very

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
long because my frame rates dropped

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.639 
long because my frame rates dropped
pretty<00:00:52.829> pretty<00:00:53.370> bad<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.760> i<00:00:53.850> start<00:00:54.120> recording
