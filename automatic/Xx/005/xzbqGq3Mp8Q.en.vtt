game but I chelseann a bit more of a
precarious<00:00:06.660> position<00:00:06.990> because<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.529> how<00:00:07.740> they

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
precarious position because of how they

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.589 
precarious position because of how they
handled<00:00:08.250> John<00:00:08.429> Terry<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.849> Anton<00:00:09.150> Ferdinand

handled John Terry and Anton Ferdinand

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.310 
handled John Terry and Anton Ferdinand
here<00:00:10.280> I<00:00:11.690> would<00:00:12.690> say<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.019> there<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
here I would say that there is a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.110 
here I would say that there is a
spotlight<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.950> them<00:00:14.099> because<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.000> that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
spotlight on them because of that

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 
spotlight on them because of that
Harriet<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.109> handle<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.650> wouldn't<00:00:16.920> really

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
Harriet was handle I wouldn't really

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.590 
Harriet was handle I wouldn't really
want<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> expand<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.180> piece<00:00:18.390> now

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
want to expand on it this piece now

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
want to expand on it this piece now
because<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.859> has<00:00:20.220> now<00:00:20.430> been

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
because I think that that has now been

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.429 
because I think that that has now been
dealt<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.330> way<00:00:21.510> or<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.960> way<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.289> another

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
dealt with one way or one way or another

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.390 
dealt with one way or one way or another
and<00:00:24.080> this<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.289> completely<00:00:25.859> separate

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and this is a completely separate

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
and this is a completely separate
separate<00:00:27.000> issue<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> would<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> say

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
separate issue what I would like to say

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.740 
separate issue what I would like to say
is<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.240> Chelsea

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
is that for that we know that Chelsea

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.340 
is that for that we know that Chelsea
you<00:00:31.349> know<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.420> multicultural<00:00:33.420> Club<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
you know is a a multicultural Club and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580 
you know is a a multicultural Club and
it<00:00:35.059> has<00:00:36.059> players<00:00:36.630> from<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:37.079> over<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.380> world

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it has players from all over the world

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
it has players from all over the world
and<00:00:38.090> I<00:00:39.090> don't<00:00:39.719> believe<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.160> they<00:00:41.550> can

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and I don't believe that that they can

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.100 
and I don't believe that that they can
take<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> blame<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:44.120> individuals<00:00:45.120> because

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
take the blame for individuals because

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.860 
take the blame for individuals because
no<00:00:46.320> matter<00:00:46.469> how<00:00:46.710> much<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.129> hide<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.870> know

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
no matter how much you hide it you know

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.799 
no matter how much you hide it you know
it's<00:00:49.680> still<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.360> more<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
it's still there so it's more of a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
it's still there so it's more of a
social<00:00:52.199> thing<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.520> need<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
social thing that we really need to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.139 
social thing that we really need to
eradicate<00:00:54.350> before<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.800> blame<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.430> club<00:00:56.940> or

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
eradicate before we can blame a club or

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.189 
eradicate before we can blame a club or
a<00:00:58.430> particular<00:00:59.430> situation<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.329> had<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
a particular situation because had that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.679 
a particular situation because had that
not<00:01:01.410> been<00:01:01.440> caught<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.129> camera<00:01:05.090> it's<00:01:06.090> probably

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
not been caught on camera it's probably

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.350 
not been caught on camera it's probably
something<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.909> before

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
something that was going on before

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.330 
something that was going on before
anyway<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.280> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
anyway so you know that that's not that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.990 
anyway so you know that that's not that
we<00:01:12.090> can't<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.390> looking<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> single

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
we can't be looking at that as a single

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
we can't be looking at that as a single
situation<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.780> know<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.320> happened<00:01:16.799> to
