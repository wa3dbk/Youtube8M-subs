00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
that the code masters pick up on this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.620 
that the code masters pick up on this
video<00:00:29.039> it'll<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.670> awesome<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
game actually have something that we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.139 
game actually have something that we
wanted<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> game<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.520> before<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.030> get

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
wanted in the game now before we get

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.940 
wanted in the game now before we get
into<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> video<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.230> leave<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> suggestions

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
into the video and leave the suggestions

i want to quickly say if you can leave a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.700 
i want to quickly say if you can leave a
like<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.719> video<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.140> would<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.290> really

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
like on this video that would be really

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.170 
like on this video that would be really
really<00:00:40.829> awesome<00:00:41.040> i<00:00:41.430> don't<00:00:41.610> really<00:00:41.700> ever<00:00:41.879> ask

really awesome i don't really ever ask
for<00:00:42.390> likes<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.200> code<00:00:43.410> master<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.950> notice

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
for likes but if code master can notice

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
for likes but if code master can notice
this<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.820> video<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.539> hopefully<00:00:45.840> get

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
this one video we can hopefully get

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.779 
this one video we can hopefully get
something<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.160> f1<00:00:47.399> 2013

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
something that we want in f1 2013

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.729 
something that we want in f1 2013
actually<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> game<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.379> hopefully

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
actually in the game and hopefully

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
actually in the game and hopefully
implemented<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.690> enough

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
implemented into it so that's enough

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.939 
implemented into it so that's enough
about<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.110> let's<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.590> into<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
about that let's get into the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.889 
about that let's get into the
suggestions<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> guys<00:00:53.789> left<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.570> f1

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
suggestions that you guys left for f1

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.959 
suggestions that you guys left for f1
2013<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:56.190> first<00:00:56.399> thing<00:00:56.550> i<00:00:56.640> wanted<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.879> say

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
2013 the first thing i wanted to say

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.279 
2013 the first thing i wanted to say
something<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.600> probably<00:00:57.719> already<00:00:58.020> said

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
something that probably already said

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
something that probably already said
before<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> system<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> little

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
before and let's have a system a little

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700 
before and let's have a system a little
bit<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.629> our<00:01:00.870> factor<00:01:01.350> where<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> can

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
bit like our factor where you can

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.470 
bit like our factor where you can
actually<00:01:01.829> sort<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.399> change<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> difficulties

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
actually sort of change the difficulties

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually sort of change the difficulties
to<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.690> precise<00:01:04.110> level<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.769> our<00:01:05.489> factor<00:01:05.909> if

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to your precise level and our factor if

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
to your precise level and our factor if
you<00:01:06.180> might<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.420> already<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> system

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you might know already has a system

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
you might know already has a system
where<00:01:08.159> at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> inn<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.729> eighty<00:01:08.880> percent

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
where at the inn go from eighty percent

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
where at the inn go from eighty percent
to<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.600> hundred<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.990> twenty<00:01:10.350> percent<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to one hundred and twenty percent and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740 
to one hundred and twenty percent and
through<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.549> range<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.540> get

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
through that range you can you know get

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
through that range you can you know get
to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> difficulty<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.680> precisely<00:01:14.040> what

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to the difficulty that's precisely what

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.249 
to the difficulty that's precisely what
you're<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.869> means<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.110> can

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you're at and that means you can

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
you're at and that means you can
actually<00:01:16.380> raise<00:01:16.619> competitively<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> AI

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
actually raise competitively with the AI

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
actually raise competitively with the AI
and<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.900> an<00:01:18.990> interesting<00:01:19.560> race

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and actually make it an interesting race

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
and actually make it an interesting race
and<00:01:20.009> i<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> long<00:01:21.030> shot<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.509> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and i know it's a long shot to have this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.700 
and i know it's a long shot to have this
in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> game<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.320> something<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.650> that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
in the game but if something like that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.170 
in the game but if something like that
could<00:01:22.920> ever<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.130> implemented<00:01:23.729> that'd<00:01:24.150> be

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
could ever be implemented that'd be

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
could ever be implemented that'd be
really<00:01:24.600> really<00:01:24.810> awesome<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
really really awesome and I you know I

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
really really awesome and I you know I
think<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.640> definitely<00:01:27.060> appreciate<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.720> because

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
think I definitely appreciate it because

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870 
think I definitely appreciate it because
I'm<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.590> too<00:01:28.770> slow<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.040> legend<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
I'm really a bit too slow for legend and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510 
I'm really a bit too slow for legend and
a<00:01:29.939> bit<00:01:30.150> too<00:01:30.360> fast<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.810> pro<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.920> if

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
a bit too fast to pro but you know if

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.830 
a bit too fast to pro but you know if
it's<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> game<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.180> awesome<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.720> it's

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it's in the game that's awesome if it's

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.999 
it's in the game that's awesome if it's
not<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.590> something<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> look

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
not that's just something to look

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
not that's just something to look
forward<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.549> future<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.420> hope<00:01:36.450> that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
forward to in the future and I hope that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
forward to in the future and I hope that
can<00:01:36.990> maybe<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> game<00:01:37.890> sometime

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
can maybe get that in the game sometime

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
can maybe get that in the game sometime
a<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.329> people<00:01:39.420> ask<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.960> something<00:01:40.140> really

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
a lot of people ask for something really

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
a lot of people ask for something really
really<00:01:40.590> simple<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> comment<00:01:41.579> section<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
really simple in the comment section and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.340 
really simple in the comment section and
they<00:01:42.420> asked<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.229> have

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
they asked can we just have

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.950 
they asked can we just have
customization<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> helmet<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> yeah

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
customization on the helmet and yeah

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.940 
customization on the helmet and yeah
that's<00:01:46.079> something<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:46.590> really

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that's something that's actually really

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.289 
that's something that's actually really
really<00:01:47.100> cool<00:01:47.369> because<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:47.909> us<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
really cool because they give us like I

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
really cool because they give us like I
think<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.899> 30<00:01:49.170> helmet<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.740> think<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.100> then

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
think like 30 helmet to think and then

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.800 
think like 30 helmet to think and then
we're<00:01:50.610> allowed<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> select<00:01:51.119> from<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.540> them

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
we're allowed to select from one of them

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
we're allowed to select from one of them
and<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.159> would<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.579> really

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and I think it would be really really

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
and I think it would be really really
cool<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.210> could<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.450> maybe<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> stick<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
cool we could just maybe a stick of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.260 
cool we could just maybe a stick of
redbull<00:01:55.380> sticker<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> marussia

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
redbull sticker on there or a marussia

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
redbull sticker on there or a marussia
sticker<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:58.140> Mercedes<00:01:58.799> sticker<00:01:58.979> depending<00:01:59.430> on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
sticker or Mercedes sticker depending on

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179 
sticker or Mercedes sticker depending on
what<00:01:59.579> team<00:01:59.759> were<00:01:59.880> racing<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.979> maybe<00:02:01.979> just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
what team were racing for and maybe just

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.709 
what team were racing for and maybe just
have<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.909> don't<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.060> sparco

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
have like I don't know sparco

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.630 
have like I don't know sparco
alpinestars<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.070> how<00:02:05.219> much<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:05.520> auto

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
alpinestars and then how much they auto

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
alpinestars and then how much they auto
license<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.390> sure<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.079> look<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.380> some

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
license but I'm sure if you look on some

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.869 
license but I'm sure if you look on some
of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> gloves<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.190> drivers<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:08.729> have

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
of the gloves of these drivers they have

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330 
of the gloves of these drivers they have
alpinestars<00:02:09.509> gloves<00:02:09.569> or<00:02:10.259> sparco<00:02:10.770> gloves<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
alpinestars gloves or sparco gloves and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.589 
alpinestars gloves or sparco gloves and
maybe<00:02:11.849> if<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.060> could<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
maybe if we could have that on the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.490 
maybe if we could have that on the
helmet<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.050> would<00:02:13.170> look<00:02:13.230> great

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
helmet that would look great

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.020 
helmet that would look great
really<00:02:13.740> cool<00:02:13.980> maybe<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.640> could<00:02:14.760> just<00:02:14.790> have

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
really cool maybe we could just have

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.610 
really cool maybe we could just have
some<00:02:15.210> made-up<00:02:15.420> names<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> helmets<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
some made-up names on the helmets to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.870 
some made-up names on the helmets to
make<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.830> look<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.100> bit<00:02:17.370> more<00:02:17.550> realistic

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
make it look like a bit more realistic

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.640 
make it look like a bit more realistic
I'm<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:18.690> really<00:02:18.840> too<00:02:19.020> sure<00:02:19.050> that's<00:02:19.530> something

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
I'm not really too sure that's something

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.680 
I'm not really too sure that's something
quite<00:02:20.100> cool<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:21.150> know<00:02:21.240> it's<00:02:21.330> probably<00:02:21.450> in

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
quite cool and you know it's probably in

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.090 
quite cool and you know it's probably in
like<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.960> something<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.800> they<00:02:22.950> probably

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
like a something that they probably

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.530 
like a something that they probably
could<00:02:23.400> implement<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> game<00:02:24.360> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
could implement into the game and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.480 
could implement into the game and
definitely<00:02:25.200> customization<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> big<00:02:26.250> way<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
definitely customization is a big way to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.370 
definitely customization is a big way to
go<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> lot<00:02:27.060> people<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.600> down<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> conversation

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
go a lot people in down the conversation

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.870 
go a lot people in down the conversation
and<00:02:28.470> my<00:02:28.560> videos<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:28.920> been<00:02:29.130> asking<00:02:29.490> can<00:02:29.850> we

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
and my videos have been asking can we

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.490 
and my videos have been asking can we
have<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> little<00:02:30.209> bit<00:02:30.390> more<00:02:30.510> customization<00:02:31.320> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
have a little bit more customization to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530 
have a little bit more customization to
the<00:02:31.530> team<00:02:31.980> maybe<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.400> our<00:02:32.550> name<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.240> side

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the team maybe have our name on the side

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.150 
the team maybe have our name on the side
of<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.750> car<00:02:33.930> instead<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.500> vettel<00:02:34.890> webber

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
of the car instead of like vettel webber

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.949 
of the car instead of like vettel webber
you<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.300> probably<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.930> know

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
you know that's probably you know

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.540 
you know that's probably you know
probably<00:02:37.230> possible<00:02:37.500> something<00:02:38.310> else<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.430> a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
probably possible something else that a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.860 
probably possible something else that a
lot<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.670> people<00:02:38.790> asking<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.510> whether<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.750> can

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
lot of people asking is whether we can

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
lot of people asking is whether we can
actually<00:02:40.260> feel<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.070> driver<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.640> can

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
actually feel like the driver we can

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.730 
actually feel like the driver we can
walk<00:02:42.000> around<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> pilot<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.320> drivers

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
walk around the pilot go to the drivers

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.830 
walk around the pilot go to the drivers
interviews<00:02:44.190> get<00:02:44.430> out<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.730> car<00:02:44.940> dual<00:02:45.660> that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
interviews get out the car dual that

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.910 
interviews get out the car dual that
sort<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.110> stuff<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.560> don't<00:02:46.770> know<00:02:46.830> whether

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
sort of stuff I don't know whether

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920 
sort of stuff I don't know whether
that's<00:02:47.010> really<00:02:47.400> possible<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.510> driving<00:02:48.900> game

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
that's really possible in a driving game

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.150 
that's really possible in a driving game
maybe<00:02:49.260> there's<00:02:49.500> something<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.800> look<00:02:49.950> forward

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
maybe there's something to look forward

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.280 
maybe there's something to look forward
to<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.459> future<00:02:50.550> when<00:02:51.510> they<00:02:51.540> maybe<00:02:52.020> figure

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
to in the future when they maybe figure

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.750 
to in the future when they maybe figure
out<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.560> game<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.770> bit<00:02:52.920> more<00:02:53.100> when<00:02:53.610> they<00:02:53.670> have

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
out the game a bit more when they have

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.820 
out the game a bit more when they have
more<00:02:54.000> time<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.720> about<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.350> but

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
more time to think about it but

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.410 
more time to think about it but
something<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.790> definitely<00:02:57.180> something

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
something that is definitely something

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.150 
something that is definitely something
and<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.020> really<00:02:58.410> really<00:02:58.590> enjoy<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
and I really really enjoy to have that

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160 
and I really really enjoy to have that
in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.280> game<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.610> I<00:03:00.480> know<00:03:00.600> it's<00:03:00.840> not<00:03:00.959> really

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
in the game and I know it's not really

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.449 
in the game and I know it's not really
what<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> lot<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.560> people<00:03:01.650> would<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.070> but<00:03:02.310> I

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
what a lot of people would like but I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.979 
what a lot of people would like but I
saw<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.910> conversation<00:03:03.390> about<00:03:03.420> 10<00:03:03.780> people

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
saw in a conversation about 10 people

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.390 
saw in a conversation about 10 people
say<00:03:04.320> yeah<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.830> want<00:03:05.040> something<00:03:05.280> like

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
say yeah we really want something like

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.860 
say yeah we really want something like
this<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.030> thought<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.300> always<00:03:06.450> will<00:03:06.630> put<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
this so I thought I always will put it

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.060 
this so I thought I always will put it
in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.050> video<00:03:07.170> even<00:03:07.560> if<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.709> isn't<00:03:07.830> something

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
in the video even if it isn't something

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.500 
in the video even if it isn't something
that<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.400> lot<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.580> people<00:03:08.670> would<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.390> we

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
that a lot of people would like if we

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.580 
that a lot of people would like if we
did<00:03:09.660> something<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:10.020> there<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.290> might<00:03:10.440> be

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
did something in there that might be

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.470 
did something in there that might be
interesting<00:03:11.250> for<00:03:11.280> some<00:03:11.550> people<00:03:11.910> now

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
interesting for some people now

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.550 
interesting for some people now
something<00:03:12.720> else<00:03:12.930> there's<00:03:13.140> been<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> lot<00:03:13.530> of

damage module because a lot of people

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.310 
damage module because a lot of people
have<00:03:17.430> been<00:03:17.459> criticizing<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.269> 2012<00:03:18.870> module<00:03:19.170> I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
have been criticizing the 2012 module I

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.990 
have been criticizing the 2012 module I
personally<00:03:20.040> haven't<00:03:20.190> found<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.549> really<00:03:20.820> any

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
personally haven't found it really any

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.449 
personally haven't found it really any
different<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.660> 2011's<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.160> thing<00:03:23.340> I

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
different to 2011's and the one thing I

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.940 
different to 2011's and the one thing I
did<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.150> about<00:03:24.420> 2011<00:03:25.320> was<00:03:25.560> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
did really like about 2011 was the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.850 
did really like about 2011 was the
online<00:03:26.489> play<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.720> 2012<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.350> did<00:03:28.560> really<00:03:28.769> like

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
online play but 2012 I did really like

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.039 
online play but 2012 I did really like
how<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.220> car<00:03:29.489> handled<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.360> just<00:03:30.480> how<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.750> fell

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
how the car handled and just how it fell

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.050 
how the car handled and just how it fell
with<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> lot<00:03:31.620> nicer<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:32.190> go<00:03:32.310> with<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.580> pad<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
with a lot nicer to go with the pad and

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240 
with a lot nicer to go with the pad and
I'm<00:03:34.049> sure<00:03:34.290> they<00:03:34.470> can<00:03:34.530> just<00:03:34.739> keep<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
I'm sure they can just keep that the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.130 
I'm sure they can just keep that the
same<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.030> damage<00:03:36.420> module<00:03:36.750> that's<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.959> big

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
same but the damage module that's a big

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.090 
same but the damage module that's a big
thing<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.530> people<00:03:37.739> have<00:03:37.830> been<00:03:37.950> talking

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
thing that people have been talking

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.920 
thing that people have been talking
about<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.910> think<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.330> reason<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.690> hasn't

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
about and I think the reason it hasn't

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.240 
about and I think the reason it hasn't
been<00:03:39.989> changed<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.530> much<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.100> because

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
been changed that much it's just because

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.770 
been changed that much it's just because
lots<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.610> people<00:03:41.670> don't<00:03:42.269> even<00:03:42.390> really<00:03:42.660> care

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
lots of people don't even really care

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.690 
lots of people don't even really care
about<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.620> skies<00:03:43.920> on<00:03:44.070> YouTube<00:03:44.400> probably

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
about it I skies on YouTube probably

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.250 
about it I skies on YouTube probably
only<00:03:44.790> make<00:03:44.970> up<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:45.239> naught<00:03:45.480> put<00:03:45.690> one<00:03:45.930> percent

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
the world so I think at the moment the

the world so I think at the moment the
damage<00:04:19.079> water<00:04:19.229> was<00:04:19.440> good<00:04:19.650> how<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.950> is

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
damage water was good how it is

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.800 
damage water was good how it is
obviously<00:04:20.820> some<00:04:21.090> improvements<00:04:21.599> with<00:04:21.720> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
obviously some improvements with the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.750 
obviously some improvements with the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
safety car the red flag coming out a

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.920 
safety car the red flag coming out a
little<00:04:23.880> bit<00:04:24.030> more<00:04:24.210> often<00:04:24.479> would<00:04:24.599> be<00:04:24.720> something

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
little bit more often would be something

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.050

would sort of them get them involved and
the<00:05:01.800> dirt<00:05:02.010> 3<00:05:02.220> uploader<00:05:02.490> was<00:05:02.639> really<00:05:02.970> really

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090

it<00:05:05.100> was<00:05:05.190> pretty<00:05:05.340> good<00:05:05.550> quality<00:05:05.760> as<00:05:06.090> well<00:05:06.360> and

it was pretty good quality as well and

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.600 
it was pretty good quality as well and
definitely<00:05:07.620> like<00:05:07.860> call<00:05:08.040> of<00:05:08.070> duty<00:05:08.430> with<00:05:08.580> the

the<00:05:26.790> podiums<00:05:27.240> were<00:05:27.389> tired<00:05:27.630> already<00:05:27.780> said

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
the podiums were tired already said

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.840 
the podiums were tired already said
earlier<00:05:28.620> on<00:05:28.770> in<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.040> video<00:05:29.190> lots<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.639> people

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
earlier on in the video lots of people

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.270 
earlier on in the video lots of people
really<00:05:30.270> really<00:05:30.540> wanting<00:05:30.870> them<00:05:31.020> back<00:05:31.260> I<00:05:31.530> think

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
really really wanting them back I think

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.400 
really really wanting them back I think
they<00:05:32.370> hadn't<00:05:32.580> liked<00:05:32.729> in<00:05:32.850> 2003<00:05:33.419> 2004<00:05:34.110> career

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
they hadn't liked in 2003 2004 career

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.450 
they hadn't liked in 2003 2004 career
challenge<00:05:34.740> all<00:05:34.830> that<00:05:34.950> sort<00:05:35.100> of<00:05:35.130> stuff<00:05:35.190> they

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
challenge all that sort of stuff they

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.980 
challenge all that sort of stuff they
had<00:05:35.580> them<00:05:35.729> actually<00:05:35.850> in<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.210> game<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.600> one

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
had them actually in the game and one

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.870 
had them actually in the game and one
last<00:05:37.110> thing<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.380> finish<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.950> video<00:05:38.070> was<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.610> lot

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
last thing to finish the video was a lot

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.610 
last thing to finish the video was a lot
of<00:05:38.910> people<00:05:39.180> talking<00:05:39.360> about<00:05:39.510> DLC<00:05:40.200> maybe<00:05:40.440> have

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
of people talking about DLC maybe have

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.860 
of people talking about DLC maybe have
classic<00:05:41.100> cars<00:05:41.370> in<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.640> game<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.090> I<00:05:42.690> think

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
classic cars in the game and I think

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.570 
classic cars in the game and I think
there's<00:05:43.020> speculation<00:05:43.229> in<00:05:43.710> 2011<00:05:44.400> that

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
there's speculation in 2011 that

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.860 
there's speculation in 2011 that
actually<00:05:44.820> might<00:05:44.940> have<00:05:45.060> been<00:05:45.180> DLC<00:05:45.600> in<00:05:45.690> that

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
actually might have been DLC in that

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.050 
actually might have been DLC in that
game<00:05:46.080> but<00:05:46.530> that<00:05:46.620> never<00:05:47.190> came<00:05:47.370> through<00:05:47.610> sadly

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
game but that never came through sadly

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.850 
game but that never came through sadly
and<00:05:48.240> yet<00:05:48.960> have<00:05:49.050> you<00:05:49.140> definitely<00:05:49.320> called<00:05:49.680> her

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
and yet have you definitely called her

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.279 
and yet have you definitely called her
of<00:05:49.950> classic<00:05:50.340> cars<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:50.820> game<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:51.289> yeah

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
of classic cars in the game and yeah

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.810 
of classic cars in the game and yeah
