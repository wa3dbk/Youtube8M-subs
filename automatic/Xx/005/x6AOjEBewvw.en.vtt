crafting<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.930> don't<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.440> sit<00:02:03.680> here

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
crafting so you don't have to sit here

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.620 
crafting so you don't have to sit here
and<00:02:04.160> wait<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> menu<00:02:04.970> if<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.240> don't<00:02:05.479> want

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
and wait in the menu if you don't want

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.490 
and wait in the menu if you don't want
to<00:02:05.780> make<00:02:06.530> sure<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.100> don't<00:02:07.280> run<00:02:07.580> out<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.820> fuel

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
to make sure you don't run out of fuel

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.699 
to make sure you don't run out of fuel
while<00:02:09.500> you're<00:02:09.739> crafting<00:02:10.720> because<00:02:11.720> sometimes

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
while you're crafting because sometimes

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.100 
while you're crafting because sometimes
it<00:02:13.160> glitches<00:02:13.820> if<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.120> run<00:02:14.269> out<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.450> fuel<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
it glitches if you run out of fuel and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.040 
it glitches if you run out of fuel and
you<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.190> something<00:02:16.459> crafting<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.780> can

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
you have something crafting it can

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.160 
you have something crafting it can
glitch<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:19.030> everything<00:02:20.030> disappears<00:02:20.690> it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
glitch so like everything disappears it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.900 
glitch so like everything disappears it
happened<00:02:21.560> twice<00:02:21.739> when<00:02:22.040> me<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.430> rose<00:02:22.670> were

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
happened twice when me and rose were

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.780 
happened twice when me and rose were
playing<00:02:23.180> earlier<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.160> make<00:02:25.160> sure<00:02:25.190> there's

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
playing earlier so make sure there's

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.860 
playing earlier so make sure there's
fuel<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.420> tank<00:02:27.130> there<00:02:28.130> we<00:02:28.250> go<00:02:28.450> based<00:02:29.450> order

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
fuel in the tank there we go based order

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.190 
fuel in the tank there we go based order
is<00:02:30.079> done<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.450> can<00:02:32.480> done<00:02:32.780> put<00:02:33.049> this

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
is done and then you can done put this

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.460 
is done and then you can done put this
down<00:02:34.180> wherever<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.360> want<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.959> needs<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.350> be

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
down wherever you want it needs to be

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.110 
down wherever you want it needs to be
flat<00:02:36.769> though<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.190> need<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.430> put<00:02:37.579> it<00:02:37.700> down<00:02:37.820> with

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
flat though you need to put it down with

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.990 
flat though you need to put it down with
flat<00:02:38.360> land<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:39.170> here<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.650> would<00:02:40.579> recommend

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
flat land like here I would recommend

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.080 
flat land like here I would recommend
building<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.810> water<00:02:42.049> because<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:44.060> water

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
building in the water because the water

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.720 
building in the water because the water
is<00:02:44.540> really<00:02:44.840> good<00:02:44.989> for<00:02:45.230> resources<00:02:45.799> like<00:02:46.220> oxygen

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
is really good for resources like oxygen

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.490 
is really good for resources like oxygen
and<00:02:47.180> stuff<00:02:47.329> like<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.690> but<00:02:47.959> I'm<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.260> gonna

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
and stuff like that but I'm just gonna

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.970 
and stuff like that but I'm just gonna
put<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.769> down<00:02:48.950> here<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.810> dislike<00:02:51.799> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
put this down here so dislike the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.150 
put this down here so dislike the
starter<00:02:52.370> base<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.060> then<00:02:53.560> expand<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.680> with

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
starter base you can then expand it with

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.150 
starter base you can then expand it with
building<00:02:55.610> blocks<00:02:55.640> stuff<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.799> now

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
building blocks stuff like that so now

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.039 
building blocks stuff like that so now
that<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.489> know<00:02:58.610> how<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.910> craft<00:02:59.329> I'm<00:02:59.720> going<00:02:59.959> to

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
that you know how to craft I'm going to

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.890 
that you know how to craft I'm going to
show<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.320> how<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> refuel<00:03:01.700> your<00:03:01.730> oxygen<00:03:02.329> so

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
show you how to refuel your oxygen so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.930 
show you how to refuel your oxygen so
the<00:03:03.019> first<00:03:03.260> thing<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.769> need<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.980> do<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.400> take

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
the first thing you need to do is take

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.810 
the first thing you need to do is take
these<00:03:05.120> oxygen<00:03:05.900> bottles<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.010> decree<00:03:07.640> it's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
these oxygen bottles of the decree it's

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.360 
these oxygen bottles of the decree it's
discrete<00:03:08.570> right<00:03:08.750> here<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.910> then<00:03:10.910> put<00:03:11.269> it<00:03:12.370> in

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
discrete right here and then put it in

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.460 
discrete right here and then put it in
one<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.090> these<00:03:14.209> container<00:03:14.690> doesn't<00:03:15.200> matter

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
one of these container doesn't matter

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.880 
one of these container doesn't matter
which<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.269> oh<00:03:17.269> yeah<00:03:18.019> make<00:03:18.260> sure<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> ship<00:03:18.590> is

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
which and oh yeah make sure the ship is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.110 
which and oh yeah make sure the ship is
powered<00:03:19.160> up<00:03:19.870> make<00:03:20.870> sure<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.109> has<00:03:21.260> fuel<00:03:21.640> yep<00:03:22.670> SS

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
powered up make sure it has fuel yep SS

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.960 
powered up make sure it has fuel yep SS
fuel<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.920> then<00:03:24.920> all<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.280> need<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.579> do<00:03:25.730> is

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
fuel and then all you need to do is

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.650 
fuel and then all you need to do is
stand<00:03:26.329> close<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.410> this<00:03:27.560> right<00:03:27.799> here

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
stand close to this right here

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.010 
stand close to this right here
you're<00:03:29.200> gonna<00:03:29.350> hear<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.860> pretty<00:03:30.160> creepy<00:03:30.550> sound

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
you're gonna hear a pretty creepy sound

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.260 
you're gonna hear a pretty creepy sound
it<00:03:32.020> sounds<00:03:32.380> like<00:03:32.530> an<00:03:33.100> alien<00:03:33.490> is<00:03:33.610> molesting<00:03:34.000> you

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
it sounds like an alien is molesting you

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.540 
it sounds like an alien is molesting you
but<00:03:34.630> that's<00:03:35.140> that's<00:03:35.500> completely<00:03:35.950> normal

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
but that's that's completely normal

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.670 
but that's that's completely normal
it's<00:03:36.700> supposed<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.150> happen<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:38.380> might

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
it's supposed to happen so you might

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.710 
it's supposed to happen so you might
wonder<00:03:38.890> what<00:03:39.580> if<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:39.850> run<00:03:40.090> out<00:03:40.210> of<00:03:40.240> oxygen

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
wonder what if I run out of oxygen

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.100 
wonder what if I run out of oxygen
bottles<00:03:41.230> what<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.710> do<00:03:41.830> then<00:03:42.450> well<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.780> answer

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
bottles what I do then well the answer

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.980 
bottles what I do then well the answer
to<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.410> is<00:03:44.710> you<00:03:45.070> need<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.280> put<00:03:45.580> down<00:03:45.960> one<00:03:46.960> of

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
to that is you need to put down one of

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.170 
to that is you need to put down one of
these<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:48.400> called<00:03:48.700> an<00:03:48.910> oxygen<00:03:49.600> generator<00:03:50.010> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
these is called an oxygen generator and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.970 
these is called an oxygen generator and
I<00:03:52.180> would<00:03:52.420> recommend<00:03:52.870> putting<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.320> down<00:03:53.500> in<00:03:53.770> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
I would recommend putting it down in the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.260 
I would recommend putting it down in the
water<00:03:55.050> because<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.380> think<00:03:56.800> not<00:03:57.700> entirely<00:03:58.090> sure

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
water because I think not entirely sure

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.560 
water because I think not entirely sure
but<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:58.630> think<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:59.320> get<00:03:59.580> more<00:04:00.580> oxygen<00:04:00.820> from

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
but I think you get more oxygen from

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.810 
but I think you get more oxygen from
there<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.320> I'm<00:04:02.620> going<00:04:02.800> to<00:04:02.860> go<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.460> the<00:04:03.670> water

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
there so I'm going to go to the water

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.210 
there so I'm going to go to the water
and<00:04:04.030> put<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.360> down<00:04:04.540> put<00:04:05.320> it<00:04:05.380> down<00:04:05.470> here<00:04:05.800> in<00:04:06.040> the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
and put it down put it down here in the

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.250 
and put it down put it down here in the
water<00:04:06.370> or<00:04:06.700> on<00:04:06.760> land<00:04:07.000> whichever<00:04:07.960> you<00:04:08.110> prefer

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
water or on land whichever you prefer

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.770

and<00:04:08.740> after<00:04:09.520> you've<00:04:09.850> put<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.210> down<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.630> also

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
and after you've put it down you also

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.520 
and after you've put it down you also
need<00:04:11.110> to<00:04:11.320> power<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:12.070> using<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.300> fuel<00:04:13.540> pack<00:04:13.870> and

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
need to power it using the fuel pack and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.250 
need to power it using the fuel pack and
as<00:04:14.740> you<00:04:14.860> can<00:04:14.980> see<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.610> now<00:04:15.820> on<00:04:16.260> empowered

when<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.220> next<00:04:21.520> oxygen<00:04:22.300> bottle<00:04:22.630> is<00:04:22.780> going<00:04:22.960> to

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
when the next oxygen bottle is going to

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.290 
when the next oxygen bottle is going to
be<00:04:23.170> created<00:04:23.590> oh<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.580> if<00:04:24.640> you're<00:04:24.790> running<00:04:25.000> low

be created oh and if you're running low

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.320 
be created oh and if you're running low
on<00:04:25.510> fuel<00:04:25.870> it's<00:04:26.440> really<00:04:26.890> simple<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.370> make<00:04:27.550> us<00:04:28.060> go

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
on fuel it's really simple to make us go

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.980 
on fuel it's really simple to make us go
in<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.750> constructor<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:30.240> craft<00:04:31.240> these<00:04:31.570> fuel

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
in the constructor and craft these fuel

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.260 
in the constructor and craft these fuel
packs<00:04:32.230> each<00:04:32.560> fuel<00:04:33.310> pack<00:04:33.520> takes<00:04:33.820> ten

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
packs each fuel pack takes ten

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.930 
packs each fuel pack takes ten
promethium<00:04:34.900> pellets<00:04:35.230> to<00:04:35.440> create<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.220> you

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
promethium pellets to create and you

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.980 
promethium pellets to create and you
spawn<00:04:37.510> with<00:04:38.040> 120<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.130> these<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.750> if<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.840> need

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
spawn with 120 of these and if you need

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.720 
spawn with 120 of these and if you need
more<00:04:41.260> after<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:42.100> can<00:04:42.280> go<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.490> this

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
more after that you can go to this

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.290 
more after that you can go to this
promethium<00:04:43.420> deposits<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.700> mined<00:04:45.700> them<00:04:45.910> from

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
promethium deposits and mined them from

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.910 
promethium deposits and mined them from
there<00:04:46.480> basically<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.410> can<00:04:47.560> do<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.740> same
