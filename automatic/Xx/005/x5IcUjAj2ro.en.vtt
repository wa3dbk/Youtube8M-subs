as<00:01:08.760> me<00:01:09.060> explaining<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.970> ear<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.180> ear

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
as me explaining it I just go ear to ear

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
as me explaining it I just go ear to ear
all<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:14.040> close<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.330> around<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
all the way up close in around the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
all the way up close in around the
closure<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.490> closures<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
closure and then the closures there so I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
closure and then the closures there so I
don't<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.020> anything<00:01:19.229> else<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.740> saw<00:01:20.280> my

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
don't have to do anything else I saw my

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.910 
don't have to do anything else I saw my
closure<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:21.060> first<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:22.049> me<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
closure on first because for me that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
closure on first because for me that
makes<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.310> easier<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.820> me<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> gauge<00:01:24.180> how<00:01:24.420> much

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
makes it easier for me to gauge how much

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450 
makes it easier for me to gauge how much
hair<00:01:24.840> I'm<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.229> need<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.860> plus<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
hair I'm going to need and plus I can

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.359 
hair I'm going to need and plus I can
Center<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.060> closure<00:01:27.869> exactly<00:01:28.680> where<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> wanted

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
Center my closure exactly where I wanted

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
Center my closure exactly where I wanted
and<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.329> work<00:01:30.540> around<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.170> far<00:01:31.380> as

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and then just work around it as far as

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.730 
and then just work around it as far as
the<00:01:31.890> website<00:01:32.310> concern<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.420> did<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the website concern so I did go in and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.060 
the website concern so I did go in and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
fall these are considered long layers so

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.900

what<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:22.940> do<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.980> usually<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.310> for<00:02:25.580> my<00:02:25.670> layers

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
what I do I usually like for my layers

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.930

that you're using very very sharp shears

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.980 
that you're using very very sharp shears
because<00:02:34.880> if<00:02:35.030> not<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.390> don't<00:02:35.510> want<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> hair

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
because if not you don't want the hair

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.960 
because if not you don't want the hair
to<00:02:36.020> get<00:02:36.230> frayed<00:02:36.530> at<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.709> end<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.850> how

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
to get frayed at the end but this is how

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.479 
to get frayed at the end but this is how
I<00:02:38.000> do<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:40.000> started<00:02:41.000> out<00:02:41.120> right<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
I do it I started out right here and

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.670 
I do it I started out right here and
then<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.700> cut<00:02:47.090> all<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.900> way<00:02:47.989> down<00:02:48.260> right<00:02:48.530> now

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
then I cut all the way down right now

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.960 
then I cut all the way down right now
I'm<00:02:48.800> only<00:02:48.950> showing<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.489> little<00:02:49.820> bit

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
I'm only showing you a little bit

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.199 
I'm only showing you a little bit
because<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.420> cut<00:02:50.690> most<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.200> already<00:02:51.410> and

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
because I cut most of it already and

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.030 
because I cut most of it already and
then<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.450> way<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.630> really<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.350> end<00:02:54.620> up<00:02:54.830> with

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
then that way you really do end up with

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.790 
then that way you really do end up with
some<00:02:55.250> really<00:02:55.580> pretty<00:02:56.000> long<00:02:56.360> layers<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.050> since
