00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.690
 In order to protect the climate, the automakers have different ideas, however 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.330
 To build hybrid cars or to offer this to electric vehicles 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.670
 alone Outing is too little the Ingolstadt want in this area 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.570
 That is why Audi has taken on a holistic co2-neutral role 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 Mobility written on the flags 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.100
 Sounds a little tuition first animal Klimbim 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.910
 but there are a lot of answers to previously unanswered questions 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.350
 behind it what does it bring, for example, when an electric car with electricity he drives in 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.379
 a not exactly co2 friendly coal power plant was produced 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.670
 Another possibility is the extra power needed for the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.219
 Electromobility to produce their nuclear power plants a truly bad 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.870
 alternative 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.530
 Audi is therefore the first to take a completely new but logical path 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.300
 Automobile manufacturers worldwide will be a whole chain of sustainable 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.820
 Built up energy sources 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.920
 StatPro electricity from third to buy instead of audit directly in its production 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.990
 on 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.080
 Among other things, Audi is involved in the construction of an offshore wind farm in the North Sea 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.240
 The wind turbines generate green electricity then in the public network 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.110
 The Ingolstadt wants to feed the future purely electrically 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.390
 drive Itron models but not only with green electricity 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.910
 but also produce 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.690
 But the green power generation is not all part of the wind flow should be one 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.200
 Plant to get the hydrogen that produces the electrolysis he can 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.790
 then give as an energy source for fuel cell vehicles 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.790
 It also produces methane 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.060
 This methane is also thought of as a fuel Audi calls it that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 gas produced the guest should therefore be identical to chemical tests with Gerd Cosse 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.700
 so that in 2013 AUD can drive the models called TI CNG 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.660
 the Bavarian automaker shows with its commitment of the German 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.159
 Energy industry completely new ways 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.579
 Answers to the question of how to use electricity efficiently and location independent 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.270
 The electricity giants have not yet found stores 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.600
 or the Finns want 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.150
 It is actually quite easy for us to let a lot of sea wind 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.130
 Electricity overcapacity in the classes other property in Duisburg 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.499
 available energy stores the meeting to the gas network store 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.019
 and from the gas network, the energy can, if desired at any time 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.159
 Power network recycled 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.339
 Audi is using Audi's Balanced Mobility project and the heart of Vicar 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.889
 a milestone not only for the auto industry but for the whole 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.219
 German energy industry
