00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.930

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.459
 jesus rangel business expert jesus 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.870
 you are going to tell us about this 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.240
 information that has already been disclosed 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.830
 of the model group that has sold the hundred 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.020
 percent of your shares tell us 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.339
 this transaction how are you jesus and 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.619
 especially tell us what it means 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.810
 good morning good morning to your dinner 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.050
 effectively at one in the morning with 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.060
 three minutes now mexico was made 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.909
 public this operation has to be 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.339
 do to benefit all 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.890
 large and small investors in 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.170
 hours when the market is not operating 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.699
 especially in such operations and 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.370
 because of the difference in schedules 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.850
 when it opened in europe is when it's done 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.300
 here public for that one o'clock in the morning 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.210
 well this indicates that the width of the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.030
 company has already purchased the total 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.300
 actions of the model group 100% of the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.940
 shares had a 50 share 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.789
 percent around 50 percent and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 the purchase at 9 dollars with 15 cents 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.320
 dollar per share we are talking 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.320
 operation in historical value in the stock market 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.630
 Mexican securities 20 thousand 100 million 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.180
 of dollars equivalent to 278 thousand 600 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.090
 million pesos this is what is going to 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.710
 pay and you will have full control of the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.990
 model group with changes in the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.840
 corporate structure by consequence 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.300
 and we're talking about paying a price 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.110
 and an award to all shareholders 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.860
 I encourage small and large of a 30 by 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.500
 one hundred more than the price that closed on 22 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 June 2012 we must remember that the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
 last weekend there was already the rumor 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.640
 of this possible operation 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.710
 the analysts talked about could be 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.800
 about 12 billion 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.570
 and good the surprise is that they are more than 20 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.960
 one billion dollars 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.790
 let's remember lily that an operation 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.360
 similar that drew a lot of attention 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.300
 it was when banamex was sold to citigroup 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.280
 over there we are talking about in the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.190
 time of focs 12 billion dollars 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.580
 around 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:18.050
 and a crown central element 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:22.580
 it is no longer a Mexican brand it is a brand 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.420
 now of international global flag and 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.630
 It is obviously part of what is already 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.770
 I saw in all the drinks market in 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.900
 this particular case of beers and we're 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.240
 speaking that now 50 percent 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:45.440
 happens to 100% the company is in 24 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.370
 countries and has about 150 thousand 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.370
 employees 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.500
 how to understand this operation of the sale 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.620
 of model group being one of the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.450
 most important brewers in Mexico and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.030
 in the world how to understand that I do not know 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.209
 is in Mexican hands what is the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.240
 justification for letting go the 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.850
 control of mexico 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.750
 well there was in a reality 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.320
 the central owners of the company 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.540
 evidently from Monterrey were already in 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.910
 some problems between them we are 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.240
 talking family and also some 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.040
 of the main controllers and then 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.920
 good these offers that are being 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.430
 doing are ringing monetary was 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.590
 one of the solutions that were found 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.800
 precisely to try to overcome the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.080
 internal problem even of succession 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.840
 because you have to remember that the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.420
 main controllers because they are already 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.370
 of age and in addition there is another 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.700
 reality that you also have to take in 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.500
 account the global beverage market in 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.750
 this case also includes beer 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.880
 it has some very strong movements there 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.740
 to remember for example all the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.030
 functions that the offense has done the year 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.880
 past acquired for example without his 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.390
 previous group tan tico 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.790
 and obviously the bottling plant also 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.130
 per year from the north of the country and all this 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.350
 it's restored by seeing a 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.130
 market concentration and people have to 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.560
 remember that heineken bought in 2009 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.540
 defense this part so also part 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.730
 of an international strategy now 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.070
 what happened this is good news 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.440
 bad news seeing it from the point 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.710
 of view of the Mexican economy of the 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.750
 job creation so good 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.900
 undoubtedly first you have to say is 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.370
 great news because these 20 thousand 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.890
 millions of dollars will have a 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.020
 positive impact on the type of 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.050
 change do not doubt that today when they start 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.600
 financial market operations 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.490
 we are seeing a downward adjustment a 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.620
 strengthening of the peso against the dollar 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.810
 or in other words the price of the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.700
 dollar will go down does not mean that today 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.550
 I understand 20 billion dollars but 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.730
 obviously the market is going to count 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.060
 with this money the other party does not 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:16.620
 wait for what the 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.750
 company that there is a removal of 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.110
 workers is not rather a 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.510
 concentration at the administrative level of 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.420
 better management and what they are 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.490
 doing is to take advantage of what group 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.490
 model made group model is a great 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.250
 Mexican company that is now 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.680
 foreign but a great tradition and 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.860
 positioned this brand crown level 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.430
 world like no other 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.409
 it is important and of course you have to wait 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:50.840
 what else does the new administration already say? 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.639
 because you have to also say that Carlos 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.860
 Fernández keeps the advice of 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.560
 Administration Maria Asunción 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.830
 aramburuzabala also and valentín díez 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.349
 morodo remain within the council no longer 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.909
 will be the final decision making of 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.159
 them but good for now 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.740
 will continue to hear Jesus then you would say 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:12.069
 which is a more emotional loss or 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.110
 sentimental that economic for the country 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:18.949
 not economic for the country 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.770
 uncertain will leave in the market type of 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:24.219
 change will be very favorable and 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.620
 obviously, it is a symptom of 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:29.539
 reflection in this case of foreigners 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.090
 who trust the country because the company 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.069
 and all the facilities and factories that 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.159
 he has inside the country he is not going he is staying 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:39.349
 here well well and that rangel thanks for 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.060
 give us this update and this 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.699
 information that undoubtedly as already 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.589
 you have targeted it is very important for 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.520
 mexico and for our brands thank you and 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.099
 Good Morning 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.310
 good morning to good historic dozens 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.310
