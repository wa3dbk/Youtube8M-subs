00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.629
 hello greetings to everyone today I'm going to 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.580
 explain something in case you do not know it 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.530
 people who ask me in the channel the 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.940
 most of the motherboards that come 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.099
 nowadays it has two channels, one channel and 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.860
 another channel you see that they are colored 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.040
 orange and see here that they are colored 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.490
 green the orange color that equals 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.090
 the third is equivalent to him that is to say that 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.870
 this one and this one are linked and the green 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.460
 and the other green is linked to it if 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.120
 you put a memory here in this one 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.340
 slope you can not place it in the green 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 you have to place it if you put it here 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.040
 in the orange because the motherboards 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.860
 they support two channels nowadays the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.560
 designs are made in colors for 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.130
 indicate that the modules should be 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.280
 installed in which bank is to say that the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.190
 module must be installed in certain 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.050
 bank a motherboard that has four 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.220
 slots 1 2 3 and 4 slot number 1 that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.050
 it would be this 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:14.530
 and slot number 3 2 and 3 share a 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:19.390
 channel but they also share a color and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.360
 Slots 2 and 4, that is 2 and 4 share 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.710
 another channel and of another color that's why it's 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.950
 that is orange green orange and see the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.140
 high-end motherboards can use 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.900
 three channels in which the three modules 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.720
 identical are installed in a bank is 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.660
 say if they are orange orange and orange 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.380
 they go in that module and if they are green green 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.390
 green are installed in that slot most 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.410
 of the motherboards use combination 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.530
 of black or gray red blue slots 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.310
 to color the memory slots so 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.280
 and thus identify them so you 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.440
 I say that colors these colors that 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.500
 we are seeing here are a guide for 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.490
 know that these slots use the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.430
 dual channel technology or double channel 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.890
 what does this mean will increase 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.319
 the performance of the computer and the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.500
 memory because it's going to be accessed from a 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.620
 Simultaneously to two modules at the same 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.879
 time is to say if you put an orange 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.069
 in the orange they will be reading 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.189
 access these simultaneously 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.950
 two modules however if you are not what 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.079
 we have and this we do not have it either 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.239
 be constantly reading from the 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.209
 orange that what we do we expand the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.530
 apc and we put all the modules like this 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.010
 how are we seeing the image what 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.720
 means this is constantly 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.909
 accessing simultaneously the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.000
 four modules at the same time so 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.189
 both the memory so doubling the double 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.620
 channel would be double channel here in the 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.750
 orange and orange and double channel in the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.599
 green and in the green we are 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.939
 doing dual channel in the four 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.650
 channels simultaneously I do not know if that 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.079
 it was very clear but good 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.810
 the colors are only for 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.689
 identify it and if you place a memory 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.269
 in this is what you can not place the 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.989
 next in the green you have to place 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.780
 in the orange and orange are linked and 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.700
 green is linked to green as if 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.439
 they were little brothers you can not put it 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.879
 distinctly or the green and orange 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.180
 jointly if you are going to fill the 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.720
 complete modules complete slot there 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.359
 yes we can put in slot 1 a 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.790
 memory on slope number 2 the 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.859
 next memory in lot 3 the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.970
 next memory in the in the 4 the 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.379
 next memory and so will read 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.079
 jointly the double channel and this 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.810
 will increase the performance of the computer 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.629
 of memory because it's going to be accessed from 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.060
 simultaneously to the 4 modules at 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.099
 same time that is going to be a 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.680
 true wonder the machine is going to 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.750
 go super fast if you have more doubts 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.269
 always in the manual of the motherboard 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.650
 It will come tell us how they will go 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.350
 placed each 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.509
 for example in orange equals this one and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.460
 this is equivalent to this or you do not have 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.190
 loss if you place a memory here 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.800
 you can not put it in the green has 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.300
 to be in the orange orange if you 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.940
 place a memory here and there is no 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.720
 nothing has to be in the green here 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.100
 in the third 1 2 and 3 or the other way if you 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.020
 you have it here in the green you do not 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.580
 you can have here in the orange when not 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.050
 be that you have here in the orange 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.300
 that it has to be at this moment the 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.650
 4 full all is I hope that 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.190
 this video has been enough for you 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.979
 help 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.949
 I hope I have not messed with you so much 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.750
 So much explanation if you have any doubt 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.550
 comments melo on the bottom of the 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.979
 channel and so I do you a better 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.199
 explanation of the doubts that you can 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.970
 have thank you for being there greetings very 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.660
 cordial for all the friends of the 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.660
 chau chau channel
