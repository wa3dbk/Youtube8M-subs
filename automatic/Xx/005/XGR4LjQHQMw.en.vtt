00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.689
 We will tell you immediately about the importance of water for our 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:04.570
 organism 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.840
 of the dangers of running water 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.100
 of the disadvantages of bottled water 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.529
 and which is the best alternative for those who really care 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:13.700

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.230
 as for the environment 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.659
 but we prefer to start with an appointment 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:22.039
 for a thought that sums up our philosophy 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.990
 I have never worked on an invention that did not have the purpose of serving 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.060
 the rest 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.949
 I think about what the world needs and then I start inventing 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.850
 this is the essence of osmo a cuba 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.390
 Indar services always 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 that the appointment is thomas alva edison is not free 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.570
 then we will see why 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.080
 Now yes, if we can talk a bit about water, our body is 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.070
 constituted by water in a 70% reason why their systems and functions only 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.120
 optimize with good hydration 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.540
 is essential in the digestion in the circulatory system in regulation 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.380
 of body temperature in the proper functioning of the kidneys the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.980
 clarification of kidney stones urine and respiratory infections 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.700
 and prevention the best of this movement 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.760
 so it is not difficult to realize the importance of the quality of the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.630
 water that we ingest if we are what we eat even more correctly are we what 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.000
 that we should see then that we are you 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 tap water is usually a carrier of a large amount of waste and impurities and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 harmful to our body and sometimes it even takes 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.460
 chemical pollutants like in rivers and nash 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.630

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.360
 water test

 right there our technicians prepare the result and of course without any 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.440
 type of commitment 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.190
 eder water directly from the tap without further 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.780
 it is unfortunately not the healthiest option 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.320
 the alternative seems obvious bottled water 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.090
 because it tastes better although a little bit back said but mostly because you do not 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.170
 have doubts that it is a healthier water however in addition to the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.049
 pc must communicate always be buying and carrying bottles 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.060
 keep in mind that bottled water contains chemical components 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.689
 that replaces chlorine pique is intended to prevent deterioration 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.069
 alejandro well of its supposed purity 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.450
 and as if that were not enough, it contributes to endangering the environment by 80% of the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.480
 plastic bottles 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.640
 it is not clear whether landfills or rivers are accommodated in the sea 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.150
 and since it is not biodegradable it only disappears after thousands of years 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.640
 puccini tap water in bottled water is not safety what is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.699
 the alternative 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.969

 the taps the bathtub or the toilets will be much easier to wash pine 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.240
 they were stained like any other appliance that uses water as 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.920
 washing machines irons to dishes that will have a much longer shelf life 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.090
 the support is besieged they left the skin and hair much softer 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.979

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.259
 or to install a source 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.500
 the bush sources in the same system as the purifiers 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.280
 reverse osmosis allow to get something of high quality from water 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.970
 current with the possibility of choosing between domestic hot water in 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.819
 definitive 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.789
 Completely healthy water without having to carry bottles is subject to 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.539
 costs of the distribution companies or having to waste space in their 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.150
 facilities storing plastic and in addition 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.520
 gaining as a mediator and to finish 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.689
 let's go back to the appointment with which we started and that summed up the vocation 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.269
 of service that characterizes us coop in it the great North American inventor 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:51.219
 thomas edison made us 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.969
 they think what the world needs and then I start inventing 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.060
 Monday that dissolves so far none of our products but almost in 1880 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.829
 founded the general electric company that following its philosophy applied to 

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:07.580
 world what this one needs 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.560
 We develop the latest generation products and sell them in 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.330
 Effect or smooth supplies the official distributor of the treatment products 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.869
 of domestic water 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:21.119
 of general electric and also his official technical service 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.020
 all thanks to the quality and professionalism that I have shown you 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.499
 demonstrated throughout his twelve years of experience 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:33.699
 this makes you cool which is the only provider in the country that has an offer 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:37.849
 of exclusive products and a network of specialized services are intended 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.469
 to cover all the needs that our clients may have 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:43.319
 also 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.740
 General electric products are always a safe bet because a 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.939
 law 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:53.219
 We wanted guaranteed the unwavering quality fully reliable cutting-edge 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:57.789
 and for life in addition to offering highly competitive prices 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.379
 but the tradition and dedication to service of 2004 does not end here 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.180
 which is the only company in the sector that owns the company seal 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.659
 environmentally responsible in addition 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.489
 we can therefore have adhered to the police responsible campaign although 

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:16.749
 inspired to plant 100 million trees in the Iberian Peninsula 

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:20.329
 in the framework of the united nations campaign called ford plan 

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:24.259
 plans the plant for the planet you have to try to offset emissions 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.259
 pollutants and help curb climate change 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:32.969
 why now if the reasons why the team we sell we launch a tree 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:36.259
 to enter righteous if we commit to keep them as 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:38.969
 minimum for 40 years 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:43.589
 because we know that deep down what we do to the world we know ourselves 

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:47.669
 ourselves and what we do not give to the world we take it away 

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:50.300
 remember 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.719
 I know Cuba 

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:55.090
 Water quality is quality of life 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.570
 I enjoyed the area as 

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.160
 okay
