00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.620 
smelting down or compressing down I'll
show<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.649> guys<00:01:49.799> some<00:01:50.009> examples<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:50.640> using<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
show you guys some examples now using a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.710 
show you guys some examples now using a
cold<00:01:51.899> chunk<00:01:52.860> ice<00:01:53.070> melted<00:01:53.729> well<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> compressed

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
cold chunk ice melted well I compressed

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.200 
cold chunk ice melted well I compressed
18<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:56.040> blocks<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.490> got<00:01:56.610> 18<00:01:57.000> diamonds

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
18 of these blocks and got 18 diamonds

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.179 
18 of these blocks and got 18 diamonds
and<00:01:57.740> using<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.149> coal<00:02:00.149> block<00:02:00.479> actually<00:02:01.189> compress

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and using a coal block actually compress

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.550 
and using a coal block actually compress
all<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.850> got<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.210> 64<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> can

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
go over to our compressor and see what

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.160 
go over to our compressor and see what
we<00:02:34.810> got

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
we got

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.809
