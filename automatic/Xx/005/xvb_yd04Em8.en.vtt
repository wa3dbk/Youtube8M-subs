generation iphone and that's how thick
it<00:04:08.099> is<00:04:08.190> probably<00:04:08.760> like<00:04:09.410> two<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.470> these<00:04:11.270> so<00:04:12.270> it

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
it is probably like two of these so it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.850 
it is probably like two of these so it
is<00:04:12.480> pretty<00:04:12.690> thick<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.140> definitely<00:04:13.530> has<00:04:13.680> some

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
is pretty thick it definitely has some

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.990 
is pretty thick it definitely has some
weight<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.300> but<00:04:15.300> it<00:04:15.390> does<00:04:15.569> feel<00:04:15.810> very<00:04:17.000> well

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
weight to it but it does feel very well

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.449 
weight to it but it does feel very well
built<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.290> plastic<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:19.889> not<00:04:20.040> metal<00:04:20.220> or

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
built this is plastic it's not metal or

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.550 
built this is plastic it's not metal or
anything<00:04:20.850> so<00:04:21.209> but<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.600> does<00:04:21.780> feel<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:22.320> i<00:04:22.350> said

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
anything so but it does feel like i said

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.550 
anything so but it does feel like i said
hi<00:04:22.740> build<00:04:23.010> quality<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.990> there's<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.260> battery

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
hi build quality so there's the battery

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.379 
hi build quality so there's the battery
leds<00:04:25.889> i<00:04:25.919> believe<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.729> means<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.120> has<00:04:27.240> some

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
leds i believe that means it has some

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.240 
leds i believe that means it has some
charging<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:28.080> because<00:04:28.410> i<00:04:28.470> think<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.950> green

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
charging to do because i think the green

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.600 
charging to do because i think the green
button<00:04:29.430> here<00:04:29.729> is<00:04:29.820> where<00:04:30.150> it's<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.330> maximum

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
button here is where it's the maximum

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.060 
button here is where it's the maximum
there's<00:04:32.610> your<00:04:32.820> LED<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.500> at<00:04:34.919> least

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
there's your LED so it is at least

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.129
