that is not okay I think the biggest
impact<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.149> program<00:01:38.330> is<00:01:38.690> just<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.440> live

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
impact of the program is just to live

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.950 
impact of the program is just to live
the<00:01:39.950> prejudice<00:01:40.460> out<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.090> see<00:01:41.360> each<00:01:41.420> other<00:01:41.660> as

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
the prejudice out and see each other as

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.680
