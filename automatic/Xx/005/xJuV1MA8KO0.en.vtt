this<00:02:03.380> little<00:02:03.620> ramp<00:02:04.160> thing<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:05.930> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
this little ramp thing and then the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.530 
this little ramp thing and then the
mystery<00:02:06.440> box<00:02:06.680> will<00:02:06.980> always<00:02:07.340> spawn<00:02:07.670> right<00:02:08.240> on

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
mystery box will always spawn right on

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.170 
mystery box will always spawn right on
top<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.470> ceiling<00:02:09.979> right<00:02:10.250> there<00:02:10.580> there's

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
top of the ceiling right there there's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.990 
top of the ceiling right there there's
the<00:02:11.510> mystery<00:02:11.870> box<00:02:12.080> every<00:02:12.590> time<00:02:12.830> well<00:02:13.760> at<00:02:13.850> least

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the mystery box every time well at least

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.670 
the mystery box every time well at least
I'm<00:02:14.360> pretty<00:02:14.570> sure<00:02:14.810> it's<00:02:14.930> every<00:02:15.230> time<00:02:15.410> because

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
I'm pretty sure it's every time because

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.530 
I'm pretty sure it's every time because
the<00:02:16.040> three<00:02:16.340> times<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.760> hit<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.210> been<00:02:17.420> at

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
the three times I hit it it's been at

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.360 
the three times I hit it it's been at
the<00:02:17.660> same<00:02:17.870> spot<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.470> I'm<00:02:18.590> assuming<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:19.220> it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
the same spot so I'm assuming that it's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
the same spot so I'm assuming that it's
every<00:02:19.640> time<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:20.000> spawns<00:02:20.270> there<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:21.230> is

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
every time it spawns there it is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.160 
every time it spawns there it is
different<00:02:21.710> way<00:02:22.070> because<00:02:22.750> most<00:02:23.750> people<00:02:24.020> go

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
different way because most people go

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.570 
different way because most people go
down<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.500> elevator<00:02:24.650> right<00:02:25.160> away<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.370> would

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
down the elevator right away I would

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.800 
down the elevator right away I would
assume<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.120> should<00:02:26.300> go<00:02:26.390> down<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.690> way

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
assume that you should go down this way

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.240 
assume that you should go down this way
thanks<00:02:27.050> for<00:02:27.200> watching<00:02:27.470> guys<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.650> I'll<00:02:28.070> show

thanks for watching guys and I'll show
you<00:02:28.280> gobble<00:02:28.670> knuckles<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.270> different<00:02:29.510> video

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
you gobble knuckles in a different video

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.990 
you gobble knuckles in a different video
peace
