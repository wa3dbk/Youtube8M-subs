Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today we're talking about how to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.549
get answers to all of your Polymer Clay questions.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.309
Now when you work with something as versatile
as Polymer Clay, you are bound to have some

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.920
questions whether you are a beginner, an intermediate
or even an expert.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.490
So over the years, oh about eight years or
so, my husband Doug and I have put together

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.340
a resource PolymerClayTutor.com, where we've
been doing tutorials and answering questions

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.230
and doing all kinds of things to help you
further your Polymer Clay journey.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.170
But as we've been growing, it's becoming more
and more difficult for me to answer questions

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.260
individually anymore, so I have a big favor
to ask you.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:55.020
Now, first of all, I still want all your questions
to come in, questions, comments, suggestions,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.930
ideas, unless you ask them of me, I have no
idea what you need, and I need to understand

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.909
what is most difficult for you guys in order
to come up with the right videos to give you,

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.810
so keep those questions coming.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.999
And another favor I have is if you have the
answer, maybe you’ve been around for a while,

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:22.759
you know that I've done a video on it in the
past, help each other out, if you know it…

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.100
the answer, then give the answer to the person
that's asking, that would be really great,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.270
and we've been doing that for a lot of years
on our website and it's made a big difference,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.329
people learn a lot from each other, and actually
we have almost a 100,000 comments on our blog

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.060
where people have been interacting and it
makes a big difference in your learning experience.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.439
And then the last thing is maybe you can find
the answer yourself, now on our blog…or

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.429
on our site, PolymerClayTutor.com, there is
a search box there that if you type in your

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.930
question…your issue, your topic, whatever
it is, into the search box, the answer will

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.950
mostly likely pop up, because there is like
over a thousand posts, there's 500 videos

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.820
and like I said, like tens of thousands of
comments, those answers are probably gonna

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.330
pop right up for you and you'll be able to
find them right away, alright?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.780
So make sure to be using that resource, make
sure to be interacting with each other and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.380
keep the questions coming in, and the suggestions.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.340
I read everything, I just can't personally
respond to everything anymore, it's a little

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.100
overwhelming, and if I do…I've spent entire
days just answering questions, and I'm having

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.020
a difficult time getting all the videos and
stuff done, so if you could help me out, that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.130
would be great.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.980
So I hope that was helpful for you, if it
was, let me know if you liked this video in

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.620
the comment section below, of course ask whatever
questions that it is that you need.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.030
And don't forget to use that resource, PolymerClayTutor.com,
and use the search box there to find all the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.550
answers to your Polymer Clay questions.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.590
We will see you next time and bye for now.
